      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has named national security and native species protection as two key legislative priorities in the new year, as he and Bill Shorten gear up for an election expected in May but which could come as early as March. It is not clear what legislation Morrison was referring to, with no major environmental bills currently before parliament, and the prime minister\u2019s office was not immediately able to clarify. As voters return from summer holidays Morrison attempted to reframe the Coalition government as the champion of \u201cquieter Australians\u201d, promising in a Daily Telegraph opinion piece that he \u201cwon\u2019t be dragged off to the right or left\u201d of politics. Morrison recounted a recent family visit to the Shoalhaven Heads hotel on the New South Wales south coast, an experience he said reminded him that Australians \u201cthink Australia is a pretty great place\u201d and are \u201ca lot more interested in everyday life\u201d than noisy political debates. The Coalition has resumed political hostilities with a promise to force councils to hold citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day \u2013 a move targeted at progressive councils who have attempted to move ceremonies to protest against the celebration of 26 January, the anniversary of European colonisation. Morrison attempted to allay fears the 2019 election will be fought on culture war issues, stating his respect for Indigenous Australians who \u201cwere here first\u201d and that Australians \u201chave nothing at all against migrants\u201d. He said the government should \u201ckeep population growth under control by getting the migration settings right\u201d but not \u201cshut the place down\u201d just because of fears of congestion. \u201cThose who want to hate don\u2019t speak for me,\u201d he said. Morrison told ABC News Breakfast that in April the Coalition would deliver the first budget surplus in more than a decade, framing the pending election contest as a choice between the fiscal responsibility of the Coalition\u2019s plan for record social spending and Labor\u2019s plan for \u201c$200bn of higher taxes\u201d. The prime minister said he was \u201cnot contemplating\u201d an early election. When parliament resumes on 12 February Morrison faces a number of tests which could challenge his control of the lower house, including opposition amendments to facilitate medical transfers from offshore detention and the government\u2019s policy to create powers to break up energy companies. Asked about the Coalition\u2019s priorities in the few sitting days remaining before the election \u2013 with just four parliamentary weeks scheduled before May \u2013 Morrison said: \u201cWe want to continue the momentum with the measures on national security. They have kept my focus.\u201d Government national security bills currently before parliament include those to make it easier to strip convicted terrorists of Australian citizenship and increase police powers to stop people at airports. Morrison said there were a \u201crange of remaining items\u201dto \u201cfinish off\u201d the government\u2019s program in 2019, citing \u201cenvironmental legislation \u2026 [that is] important for native species\u201d. The Coalition has been accused of having no policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions since Malcolm Turnbull ditched the emissions reduction component of the national energy guarantee. In the Daily Telegraph, Morrison said Australians \u201cwant to take care of our environment, especially locally\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re sympathetic to the big global environmental issues, because we really do care about the world we\u2019re leaving for our kids,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to sign up to destroy our economy because of the extreme views of some.\u201d Morrison said the shift to renewable energy was \u201chappening\u201d and should occur without Australians \u201cbeing asked to pay higher taxes or shell out unaffordable taxpayer-funded subsidies\u201d. His government has refused to rule out indemnifying coal power against a future carbon price and is investigating options for the government to underwrite new power generation projects by promising to buy electricity at a minimum price. In a nod to his claim that Australia will meet its Paris climate targets of a 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030 \u2013 contradicted by the latest emissions data and climate scientists and economists \u2013 Morrison wrote, \u201cwe\u2019ll get there\u201d. On Monday Bill Shorten will visit Kakadu national park after he and Morrison both announced packages worth more than $200m to revitalise the world heritage-listed site.",

Here are five ways to end Australia's energy war | Nicky Ison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many still think that 100% renewables can\u2019t be done. In 2017 ANU, Energy Networks Australia and CSIRO joined the ranks of Australia\u2019s leading institutions on energy that have now done their own plans to show Australia can reliably achieve 100% renewables.

Solar for renters and other locked-out energy users</strong></p> <p>The coverage of rooftop solar hit two million roofs in 2018 \u2013 a huge achievement considering a decade ago there were less than 100,000 roofs with solar panels on them. However, while households and businesses that own a sunny roof can now benefit from greater energy independence, lower electricity bills and that good feeling of lessening their climate pollution, there are at least 30% of households that cannot put solar on their roof. These households rent, live in apartments, cannot afford the upfront cost or have shaded roofs. Research by startup incubator Energy Lab found that only 4% of rental properties and 4% of apartments have solar on the roof, compared with 29% of owner-occupied households and 38% of owner-occupied standalone houses.</p> <p>For a long time these households have been in the too-hard basket for policymakers and industry alike. However, there are signs that in 2019 this could be changing. The Victorian and South Australian governments have announced policies to support 50,000 rental properties to access solar, and for South Australia, batteries also. In NSW the government is trialling a program of solar for 15,000 low-income energy rebate customers. These are small steps, but if scaled could start to change the current trend towards solar energy haves and have-nots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-09T01:07:47/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Proportion of owner-occupiers and renters with rooftop solar\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-09T01:07:47/embed.html\">Proportion of owner-occupiers and renters with rooftop solar</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-09T01:14:54/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Proportion of apartments, semi-detached dwellings and separate houses with rooftop solar\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-09T01:14:54/embed.html\">Proportion of apartments, semi-detached dwellings and separate houses with rooftop solar</a> </figure>  <p><strong>3.

City are a fantastic team and we believe we are a really good team. It\u2019s going to go right to the wire: there are still a lot of big games to come and we [have to] just keep knocking them off.\u201d</p> \n<p>The victory over Chris Hughton\u2019s side, earned through Mohamed Salah\u2019s 49th-minute penalty, will occupy minimal space in the end-of-season highlights compilations but Robertson pointed out that it does not stand alone. \u201cThe two Brighton games have been massive for us,\u201d he said, recalling how Liverpool struggled to a similarly hard-fought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/25/liverpool-brighton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">1-0 win at Anfield</a> in August. Their knack for coming out on top during days of relative drudgery is perhaps the most eye-catching difference in this season\u2019s team and it provides as much satisfaction as those games when they manage to cut loose.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the winning mentality and finding a way,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what all the teams are doing now. City haven\u2019t played their best but have been winning games and Tottenham have done the same, so I think we are all showing signs of doing that. Whoever wins the league will look back on some games and go \u2018Do you know what, we probably weren\u2019t at our best there, and that was probably one that helped us turn one point into three or zero into one\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Moments like the second-half block Fabinho produced from Pascal Gross certainly contribute to that feeling. The Brazilian was asked to deputise in Liverpool\u2019s short-staffed centre-back position and, after one early blip when he let Glenn Murray escape and saw the Brighton striker head over from a good position, mastered the occasion well. \u201cI thought he was different class,\u201d Robertson said. Fabinho has overcome a quiet start at Liverpool to be increasingly influential, albeit mainly from his favoured midfield role, in recent weeks and Robertson drew parallels with his own adaptation after joining from Hull City in July 2017.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think all the lads that have come in have experienced very similar,\u201d he said. \u201cMe and Chambo [Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain] experienced it last season, Naby [Ke\u00efta] is experiencing it a wee bit now, Fabinho has experienced it, Shaq [Xherdan Shaqiri] has experienced it. It\u2019s just learning, and of course the massive expectations that come with playing for Liverpool sometimes take a wee bit of getting used to. It did for me, and once I got used to it I\u2019ve not really looked back, in my opinion. Fabinho took his time and now we are getting the rewards from it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Liverpool will travel to Dubai for a warm weather training camp after Saturday\u2019s match with Crystal Palace, having been freed up to do so by a skeleton side\u2019s 2-1 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/07/wolves-liverpool-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\" title=\"\">defeat to Wolves</a> in the FA Cup third round. By then, Fabinho should be primed for a return to the engine room. J\u00fcrgen Klopp hopes Jo\u00ebl Matip, who was on the bench at Brighton but not ready to start after recovering from a fractured collarbone, will benefit from the gap in their fixture list along with Dejan Lovren and Joe Gomez, who may both be available by the end of the month.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e9297d50-110b-471f-8ba7-1976d0765441\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NoXGkP0Wuno?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Although he would never say so, Robertson might appreciate a slowing down in the schedule. On Thursday his wife, Rachel, gave birth to their second child \u2013 a daughter named Aria \u2013 and he had to leave them the following day to travel with the team. His performance did not miss a beat, one fizzing first-half cross almost resulting in a goal for Roberto Firmino. On the pitch, the next four months will be about negotiating every bump in the road and letting as little speculation as possible reach their ears.</p> \n<p>\u201cLook, we hope we are here to stay,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWe let everyone else talk because the only pressure for us is playing for Liverpool, and that\u2019s enough pressure. And we can deal with that.\u201d</p>",

Liverpool opened up a seven-point gap at the top, at least until City have played Wolves on Monday night, with a largely forgettable win at Brighton on Saturday but there are few illusions inside the dressing room that, their heads cleared from losing narrowly to their rivals for top spot 10 days ago, the next four months will turn into a procession. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you get there,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to go right to the wire. City are a fantastic team and we believe we are a really good team. It\u2019s going to go right to the wire: there are still a lot of big games to come and we [have to] just keep knocking them off.\u201d The victory over Chris Hughton\u2019s side, earned through Mohamed Salah\u2019s 49th-minute penalty, will occupy minimal space in the end-of-season highlights compilations but Robertson pointed out that it does not stand alone. \u201cThe two Brighton games have been massive for us,\u201d he said, recalling how Liverpool struggled to a similarly hard-fought 1-0 win at Anfield in August. Their knack for coming out on top during days of relative drudgery is perhaps the most eye-catching difference in this season\u2019s team and it provides as much satisfaction as those games when they manage to cut loose. \u201cIt\u2019s just the winning mentality and finding a way,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what all the teams are doing now. City haven\u2019t played their best but have been winning games and Tottenham have done the same, so I think we are all showing signs of doing that. Whoever wins the league will look back on some games and go \u2018Do you know what, we probably weren\u2019t at our best there, and that was probably one that helped us turn one point into three or zero into one\u2019.\u201d Moments like the second-half block Fabinho produced from Pascal Gross certainly contribute to that feeling. The Brazilian was asked to deputise in Liverpool\u2019s short-staffed centre-back position and, after one early blip when he let Glenn Murray escape and saw the Brighton striker head over from a good position, mastered the occasion well. \u201cI thought he was different class,\u201d Robertson said. Fabinho has overcome a quiet start at Liverpool to be increasingly influential, albeit mainly from his favoured midfield role, in recent weeks and Robertson drew parallels with his own adaptation after joining from Hull City in July 2017. \u201cI think all the lads that have come in have experienced very similar,\u201d he said. \u201cMe and Chambo [Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain] experienced it last season, Naby [Ke\u00efta] is experiencing it a wee bit now, Fabinho has experienced it, Shaq [Xherdan Shaqiri] has experienced it. It\u2019s just learning, and of course the massive expectations that come with playing for Liverpool sometimes take a wee bit of getting used to. It did for me, and once I got used to it I\u2019ve not really looked back, in my opinion. Fabinho took his time and now we are getting the rewards from it.\u201d Liverpool will travel to Dubai for a warm weather training camp after Saturday\u2019s match with Crystal Palace, having been freed up to do so by a skeleton side\u2019s 2-1 defeat to Wolves in the FA Cup third round. By then, Fabinho should be primed for a return to the engine room. J\u00fcrgen Klopp hopes Jo\u00ebl Matip, who was on the bench at Brighton but not ready to start after recovering from a fractured collarbone, will benefit from the gap in their fixture list along with Dejan Lovren and Joe Gomez, who may both be available by the end of the month. Although he would never say so, Robertson might appreciate a slowing down in the schedule. On Thursday his wife, Rachel, gave birth to their second child \u2013 a daughter named Aria \u2013 and he had to leave them the following day to travel with the team. His performance did not miss a beat, one fizzing first-half cross almost resulting in a goal for Roberto Firmino. On the pitch, the next four months will be about negotiating every bump in the road and letting as little speculation as possible reach their ears. \u201cLook, we hope we are here to stay,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWe let everyone else talk because the only pressure for us is playing for Liverpool, and that\u2019s enough pressure. And we can deal with that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron has launched a two-month \u201cgreat national debate\u201d in France with a 2,330-word open letter to the country. The French president hopes the nationwide public consultation will take the sting out of the widespread public anger behind the rise of the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement and the civil unrest across France. In the letter, Macron said he was open to ideas and suggestions but insisted the government would not go back on previous reforms or key measures in his 2017 election campaign. \u201cNo questions are banned,\u201d Macron writes. \u201cWe won\u2019t agree on everything, that\u2019s normal, that\u2019s democracy. But at least we\u2019ll show that we are a people who are not afraid to speak, to exchange views and debate. And perhaps we\u2019ll discover that we might even agree, despite our different persuasions, more often than we think.\u201d Macron has been rocked by the ferocity of almost two months of angry protests by gilets jaunes. On Saturday a ninth weekend of demonstrations took place across France. The letter, to be published in French newspapers on Monday, marks the start of a nationwide consultation in which citizens are invited to give their views on four central themes: taxation; the organisation of the state and its public administration; ecological transition; and citizenship and democracy. Macron\u2019s missive asks a number of questions, including: what taxes should be reduced?; what spending cuts might be a priority?; is there too much administration?; how can the people be given a greater say in running the country? Macron said the proposals collected during the debate would build a new \u201ccontract for the nation\u201d, influence political policymaking and establish France\u2019s stance on national, European and international issues. \u201cThis is how I intend, with you, to transform anger into solutions,\u201d he wrote. Accepting that everyone wanted taxes that were \u201cfairer and more efficient\u201d, he warned against unrealistic expectations, adding there could be no drop in taxation without cuts in public spending. Macron and his centrist administration have been under intense pressure since November when public anger over an eco-tax on petrol and diesel sparked the gilets jaunes movement. Although the tax was dropped, protests have widened to adopt a wide range of anti-government grievances. Outside the cities, gilets jaunes continue to picket roundabouts around the country with ad hoc protests calling for a drop in taxes on food and essential goods, lower social charges and increased spending power. On Saturday there were further clashes between police and protesters in many French cities, with accusations of violence from both sides. In the letter, Macron wrote that he would accept \u201cno form of violence\u201d including \u201cpressure and insults\u201d against \u201celected representatives, media journalists, state institutions or public servants\u201d. \u201cIf everyone is being aggressive to everyone else, society falls apart,\u201d he wrote. Macron wrote that he would give his conclusions within a month of the end of the consultation process on 15 March. The letter ends: \u201cIn confidence. Emmanuel Macron\u201d.",

The money will be used for cleanups and for fish restocking. Littleproud has called a meeting of state and federal water ministers and the commonwealth environmental water manager to investigate what can be done to alleviate the crisis facing the river. The events have raised serious questions about management of the river, after locals repeatedly warned that the low flows through the lower Darling were risking the health of the river and could have major environmental impacts. They have accused the NSW government of deliberately draining the Menindee Lakes over the past two years and allowing greater extractions by irrigators upstream, leaving a 500km stretch of the river without regular flows. Without regular flows, the warmer weather causes blue-green algal blooms, which are then killed by cooler weather, causing the oxygen to be removed from the water, killing fish.

But the fish kill will also focus attention on the performance of the Murray-Darling Basin authority and whether the basin plan is working. In June 2018 the authority said a key priority was to maintain flows between the northern and southern basin to maintain the basin\u2019s health. \u201cThe Barwon\u2013Darling river system needs water to flow again so native fish can reach their natural habitat to feed, grow and breed,\u201d it said.

The New England Patriots have appeared in 10 and have won five, all of them with Tom Brady as quarterback and Bill Belichick as head coach. Today\u2019s game would appear to be a mismatch. Of course, despite being the lower seed, the Chargers had a better regular season record (12-4) than the Patriots (11-5). Listen, nobody said the NFL Playoffs made sense.</p> <p>The Patriots have had one of their less impressive regular seasons, with signs that Brady is finally showing signs of slipping. This could be Philip Rivers and the Chargers\u2019 best chance to notch their win against the quarterback. The Chargers are fresh off a 23-17 win over the Baltimore Ravens while the Patriots were relaxing on their bye. That mean\u2019s today\u2019s playoff game will be yet another referendum of rest vs. rust.</p> <p>The winner of today\u2019s game will face the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game after the Chiefs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jan/12/indianapolis-colts-kansas-city-chiefs-afc-playoffs-live\">tore through the Indianapolis Colts 31-13</a>. Either way, we\u2019re going to get another fantastic quarterback matchup, with either Brady or Rivers playing against Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes. Meanwhile, in the NFC, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jan/12/indianapolis-colts-kansas-city-chiefs-afc-playoffs-live\">Los Angeles Rams defeated the Dallas Cowboys 30-22</a>. After today\u2019s game, the Philadelphia Eagles will try to keep Nick Foles Magic going against Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints.</p> <p>If you want to contribute to this liveblog, you can either email us (at <a href=\"mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com\">hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com</a>) or tweet us at (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a>) throughout today\u2019s game with your questions, concerns, predictions, smack-talk and other such commentary.

While he ended the season with one of his finest efforts of the season, Tom Brady <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/16/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-season-problems\">has looked human of late</a> and more vulnerable to pressure. Meanwhile, the Chargers may have the best <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/1/6/18171403/nick-foles-philadelphia-eagles-chicago-bears-wild-card-round-comeback\">all-around defense</a> of the teams remaining in the playoffs.</p> <p><strong>What the Patriots need to do to win</strong>: Keep doing what they\u2019re doing at home. The Patriots have a perfect 8-0 record at Gillette Stadium this season and no team will have benefitted more from the bye week, what with Brady showing some surprising signs of age. Oh, and Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers has <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl-playoffs/2019/1/9/18174908/philip-rivers-tom-brady-chargers-patriots-divisional-round\">never won a game</a> against Brady.</p> <p><strong>Key player</strong>: Rob Gronkowski, TE, Patriots. The Patriots\u2019 playoff success has depended on the health of Gronkowski, maybe the greatest tight end in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl\">NFL</a>history. Expect Brady to look for him when his team need to pick up big-time yardage, even though Gronkowski has not had a vintage season by his standards.</p> <p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Chargers 28-31 Patriots</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Alright, the final game of the weekend between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New Orleans Saints has already begun! Hopefully this will salvage what has been something of an anticlimactic two days of football. This, however, marks the end of my liveblogging duties for this afternoon. Stay tuned, however, for further NFL Playoff coverage here at the Guardian over the next few weeks. Thanks to everybody who followed along with me and especially those who helped contribute. Ciao! Email from Justin Kavanagh So I\u2019m picturing a big truck backing into the players\u2019 entrance and Patriots employees rolling out a huge sheet of bubble wrap, with which they\u2019ll swathe Tom Brady any minute now, like a mummy. Then they\u2019ll feel him chicken soup with added vitamins until the Chiefs game. How long can they keep him alive and flinging footballs? Well that\u2019s the question. This could be Brady\u2019s last real shot at a Super Bowl. Meanwhile, this is Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes\u2019s first postseason. It\u2019s part of what makes the AFC Championship Game so intriguing. The Patriots won their regular season matchup, but it came down to the last play. It should be exciting. In other words, it should be the exact opposite of whatever this game was. The New England Patriots will be going to Arrowhead Stadium to face the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game! Chargers 28-41 Patriots, FINAL The onside kick fails and the Patriots go in victory formation. The New England Patriots win! Chargers 28-41 Patriots, :59, 4th quarter Philip Rivers wants a holding penalty on an incomplete pass. He is throwing a Trumperian-sized tantrum. He gets a call on the next play, a legit roughing the passer call. It\u2019s 1st and goal, and the Chargers are going for it. He throws a pass to the Gates for the final touchdown of the game and possibly in Gates\u2019s career. The two-point conversion fails. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 1:23, 4th quarter Rivers keeps getting first-downs and Chargers fans everywhere are going \u201coh, now you\u2019re doing this?\u201d They get the ball to the New England 25, looking for that sweet, sweet garbage time touchdown. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 2:00, 4th quarter Right after the two-minute warning, the Patriots call a timeout. Bill Belichick is now officially just trolling me. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 2:00, 4th quarter Rivers actually converts on a 4th and 10. Gates gets to the Chargers 34. Time for some postseason stat padding! Or nope, Rivers gets sacked for a five yard loss right before the two minute warning. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 2:46, 4th quarter For most of this quarter, Rivers looks like he\u2019s in pain. Yes, I know, he always kinda looks like that, but even moreso. This whole thing has felt like he\u2019s in a \u201cThey Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?\u201d situation. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 2:59, 4th quarter Patriots get hit with a delay of game penalty before the punt. Yeah, definitely think this is entirely on purpose now. Allen punts at the Chargers 39. It goes into the end zone for a touchback, cruelly forcing the Chargers to play even more offense before this game ends. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 3:53, 4th quarter Another play, another timeout. The guys on CBS are officially calling it. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re not going to get a Red Sox/Mets Game 6 situation here. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 4:01, 4th quarter Chargers call a timeout here. Discussing vacation plans, I\u2019m guessing. Meat Loaf is singing \u201cI can see paradise by the dashboard light\u201d through the PA. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 4:12, 4th quarter The Chargers are still out there playing because they have no other choice. At this point, the drama is all in watching the clock rather than Rivers throwing desperate pointless passes. On 3rd &amp; 10 at their own 14, Rivers throws an interception to Stephon Gilmore at the Chargers 33. That\u2019s that, really. Email from Christopher Walton Patriots v Chargers is the most depressing game I\u2019ve ever seen. Please tell me football will be good again. Chris Walton It will. Chiefs/Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. If it\u2019s anything like their regular season meeting, this is going to a treat. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 5:04, 4th quarter The Patriots drive falters at the LA 40. The Patriots go to punt\u2026 and there\u2019s a false start penalty. That\u2019s another five yards but they might prefer to take the time off the clock. Allen\u2019s punt puts the Chargers at their own 2. That\u2019s the nail in the coffin there. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 7:38, 4th quarter Have to think that there\u2019s an onside kick coming from the Chargers. There is and it goes nine yards, Nick Ebner makes the catch at the Chargers 44. That might do it. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 7:38, 4th quarter Rivers finds Virgil Green for an easy touchdown. The Chargers go for a two-point conversion, because they need way more points. They convert it. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 7:46, 4th quarter The ruling on the field is that It is a catch just short of the goal line. It\u2019ll be first and goal at the 1 yard line for the Chargers. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 7:51, 4th quarter Chargers are going no huddle, which means it starts to become tricky to follow them. They start creeping into new England territory, getting to the 33 where, on third down, Rivers throws what looks like a touchdown pass to Allen that\u2019s ruled incomplete. That looks like not the right call. The Chargers challenge and it\u2019s looking like they\u2019re going to win it. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 9:02, 4th quarter Rivers throws to Ty Williams to the Chargers 49. Impressive throw under pressure. Rivers\u2019s next throw is to Williams, it\u2019s incomplete, but there\u2019s a flag on Jackson. Defensive pass interference. That\u2019s 12 yards and an automatic first down. A nice statistic. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 9:39, 4th quarter The announcers are talking about the Patriots taking out Brady. It\u2019s not going to happen until it\u2019 like 1:37 left on the clock. The Patriots drive stalls out relatively quickly here, Sony Michel can\u2019t quite run the ball on 3rd and 1 so it\u2019s a rare three and out. The Chargers needed to get those a lot earlier in the game. Ryan Allen punts it to the end zone for a touchback after the Patriots burn some clock. THERE IS NO WAY THAT \u201cGOD FRIENDED ME\u201d IS A THING. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 11:47, 4th quarter There\u2019s a running into the kicker charge on Jones. The Chargers decline. On the punt, Edelman ran it from the 43 to the New England 48. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 11:47, 4th quarter 1st and 20. Rivers throws incomplete to Allen. Rivers hasn\u2019t been the main problem for the Chargers here, but he hasn\u2019t\u2026 been not a problem. 2nd &amp; 20. Rivers has plenty of time to throw to Hunter Henry (nice name) and it\u2019s *almost* picked off here by Kyle Van Noy. Rivers throws again, this time to Williams, surrounded by Patriots. It\u2019s 4th and 20. The Chargers punt\u2026 and there\u2019s a penalty on the Patriots. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 12:18, 4th quarter Gostkowski\u2019s kickoff gets returned by King to the Charger 24. On 1st down, Rivers throws incomplete BUT there\u2019s a flag. Oh, it\u2019s on the Chargers. A holding penalty backs them up 10 yards. We\u2019re spoiled here in New England Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 12:23, 4th quarter Patriots are at the Chargers 16. Brady\u2019s 1st down throw is incomplete, thanks to pressure by the Chiefs. 2nd and 10. Brady throws to Edelman, but somehow doesn\u2019t connect. 3rd and 10. Brady connects with Hogan who gets wrapped up at the 12. Gostkowski comes for a 30 yard field goal attempt which is good and that\u2019s another score and, more importantly, the drive takes a few more precious minutes off the clock. Chargers 14-38 Patriots, 13:49, 4th quarter A Patterson first down gets wiped away by a holding penalty on Edelman. That\u2019s instead a ten yard penalty. It\u2019s 1st and 20 at the Chargers 39, Brady finds White\u2026 who runs for a 23 yard gain. So it didn\u2019t really matter. The Patriots\u2019 Shaq Mason is hurt on the play Chargers 14-38 Patriots, 14:10, 4th quarter Oh man. Brady throws deep to Edelman who takes it to the Chargers 29. A 35 yard pickup. Chargers need like a pick-six and they need it like 12 minutes ago. Chargers 14-38 Patriots, end of the 3rd quarter Brady throws to Edelman, which is something that\u2019s been working pretty well this game. It\u2019s a nine yard game. On the next pass, Devellin gets a first down and extra and that will be the end of the third quarter. The Patriots are 15 minutes away from a date with the Chiefs in Arrowhead. Chargers 14-38 Patriots, 1:16, 3rd quarter What the Patriots have to do now is\u2026 not be stupid. No turnovers, bleed the clock, avoid 3-and-outs. Another score or two wouldn\u2019t hurt either. The Chargers kickoff goes into the end zone for a touchback so they will be starting at their own 25. Chargers 14-38 Patriots, 1:16, 3rd quarter On 1st and 10, Gordon takes a huge hit. He gets up and carries the ball on 2nd and goal and this time he\u2019s in. The Chargers get their desperately needed second touchdown of the game. The extra point is good. That\u2019s great. The thing is they have 16 minutes left in the game and the Patriots running game has been dominant. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 2:01, 3rd quarter Chargers have a 1st &amp; 10 on the New England 15, Rivers throws to Gates who makes the catch and is stuffed by Chung for a three yard loss. Man the Patriots defense is not letting up here. Or not. On 2nd &amp; 13, Rivers has his best throw of the last two quarters , hitting Williams at the Patriots one yard line. It\u2019s 1st &amp; goal\u2026 and the Chargers take a timeout to avoid a delay of game penalty. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 3:29, 3rd quarter 2nd &amp; 13. Rivers goes for the big play here, but the receiver can\u2019t quite make the play. 3rd &amp; 13. Rivers tries for the end zone again. No dice, but there\u2019s a flag here. It\u2019s defensive holding, that\u2019s a five yard penalty and an automatic first down. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 3:34, 3rd quarter The call stands as there\u2019s no evidence that the Patriots made the fumble recovery. So that\u2019s a lost timeout for Patriots. On the next play, Gordon gets stuffed for a three-yard loss. It looks like Williams has it no matter what, but we\u2019ll see. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 4:40, 3rd quarter Chargers go shotgun. Rivers\u2019 completion gets them 20 yards, they\u2019re on the New England 37. He throws to Williams for an additional five yards. 2nd &amp; 5. This is their second best drive of the game already. Rivers throws and he gets Williams for a first down. They\u2019re at the Patriots 17\u2026 but the ball looks like it might be out. The play is being challenged by the Patriots. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 5:52, 3rd quarter 1st and 10 and\u2026 you\u2019ll never guess what happens: Rivers throws it away. Granted, there\u2019s no real choice here but to air it out and hope for the best at this point. 2nd &amp; 10, Flowers takes down Rivers but that\u2019s probably an illegal hit from Flowers. Roughing the passer penalty leads to a first down and an additional 15 yards. The Chargers will take whatever they can get. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 6:23, 3rd quarter Patriots kick it off again. A touchdown for a return maybe would be great here. Well, King manages to go off, but Matthew Slater manages to take him down on the Chargers 28. I would be okay with this. Wait, let me check with my editor to see if I get paid the same rate. Email from Ben Dunn: The Patriots don\u2019t do easing off. This, as ugly as it already is for the Chargers, could become monumentally humiliating. I know most want a contest, and this isn\u2019t one, but watching the Patriots beat up on a team is like the best of Barcelona in the Champions league when they humiliate other best-in-their-country teams. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 6:31, 3rd quarter Michel gets stuffed on 2st down. On 2nd &amp; goal, Brady connects with White, who also gets stuffed for a loss. At least we\u2019re seeing something from the Chargers defense. Unfortunately, time is running out here. Just by extending the possession, they won. And Brady almost ends this thing with a pass to Hogan that he can\u2019t corral. Here comes Gostkowski for a 28 yard field goal that\u2019s good. That\u2019s a 7:22 possession. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 7:59, 3rd quarter Chargers get to Brady on first down. On second down, Burkhead gets to the 17. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 3 and Brady\u2019s pass to White only leads to a single yard. On 4th and 2, the Patriots decide they want to put this one away early. They hand off the ball to Michel\u2026 and he has that first down and more! It\u2019s first and goal at the 9. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 10:02, 3rd quarter Michel picks up five yards, that\u2019s his 17th carry. He gets to the Chargers 27. On 2nd &amp; 5, Brady connects with White who is a yard short of a first down. 3rd &amp; 1. At this point a field goal will be a moral victory for L.A. Instead, James Devellin gets the first down. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 12:33, 3rd quarter Edelman picks up 7 yards on 1st down. On 2nd &amp; 3, the Chargers stuff Burkhead for the loss of a yard. And THERE IS GRONK. I knew he\u2019d show up. Brady throws to Gronkowski for a 22 yard gain, barreling through defenders to get to the Chargers 36. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 13:53, 3rd quarter On 1st down, Rivers throws it very high over Allen. On 2nd &amp; 10, he throws\u2026 incomplete again after being pressured by Adam Butler. 3rd &amp; 10, Rivers actually makes a throw to Williams who gets three yards. The Chargers will punt. That was the opposite of what they had to do. Donnie Jones comes out punts to the 32 where Edelman takes it a yard. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 15:00, 3rd quarter King takes the kickoff to the Chargers 31 to start the second half. If they start the half with a touchdown, they\u2019ve got an outside shot. If they falter here, I think it\u2019s done. There should have been more drama. It\u2019s a pity, especially for my readership numbers this game. I\u2019m flattered but I am completely faking it. As far as Eagles/Saints, I am a huge believer in Brees, so I have the Saints beating the Eagles by a few touchdowns, but I\u2019ve bet against Nick Foles every single Eagles postseason game and he\u2019s won every single one so who knows. Emails from Ben Dunn The Patriots are just annoyingly good. The Chargers went all obscurely wild with their defensive strategy to stop the run-only offence of the Ravens in the previous round. The Patriots, as Belichick tends to do, took this as a challenge and has his RB Michel having a career day. Rivers looks flustered and losing his cool. The Patriots have schemed the life out of the Chargers. And it is not quite half-time. And a follow up: The voting for the league MVP ended last week. Can you imagine if Rivers had actually beaten out Mahomes? Chargers are being spanked. Drew Brees is his only real competition, I think but he\u2019s gonna win. Email from Justin Kavanagh Well it looks like rumors of Tom Brady\u2019s injury have been overinflated! LA need a half-time recharge! Sorry, I\u2019ll be here all week! I see what you did there. Well that looked like it was going to be a shootout after the two teams traded touchdowns in their first possessions but\u2026 well only the Patriots shot after that. It\u2019s not impossible for the Chargers to come back, not with their offense, but they\u2019re going to need stops too and their defense looks winded. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, end of the first half. Edelman takes the punt to the New England 48. Patriots in the shotgun. On 2nd &amp; 10, Edelman gets to the 40. Patriots take another timeout. They pick up four yards. On 3rd &amp; 6, the Patriots take a timeout. The goal here is obviously to get into field goal range. And they don\u2019t, Brady throws to Dorsett for six yards but he doesn\u2019t get out of bounds and that\u2019s the end of the half. The Chargers can\u2019t stop Tom Brady it seems, only the clock. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 1:00, 2nd quarter And Rivers gets sacked by Trey Flowers for a loss of ten yards. That\u2019s\u2026 Oh man. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 20 now, on their own 15. Patriots call a timeout. On the next drive, Rivers finds Gates for a ten yard gain. That\u2019s 3rd &amp; 10. Rivers throws, and it\u2019s knocked away by Jackson. Rivers wants a flag, he ain\u2019t getting one. The Chargers punt again. So much for the \u201chaving the ball\u201d idea. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 1:43, 2nd quarter Well the good news (?) for the Chargers is that they have the ball to end the half and they will have it to begin the second half. So they have a shot to score twice before the Patriots get the ball back. The bad news: they have to score. They will start at their own 25 after the touchback. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 1:43, 2nd quarter Okay, 2nd &amp; on the Chargers 18. Brady\u2019s pass to Dorsett for a first down. It\u2019s 1st &amp; goal now for New England. Chargers take a timeout. Whatever they talk about doesn\u2019t help. Michel runs into the end zone and that will be his third touchdown of the half. The extra point is good. What a coming out party for the rookie running back. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 2:00, 2nd quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Brady hits Edelman for a gain of 16 yards. Patriots are on the 19 yard line. It\u2019s 1st &amp; 10. Michel picks up two yards. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 8 and we hit the two minute warning. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 3:22, 2nd quarter The Patriots have challenged the ruling on the field that the ball was out of bounds (and thus would remain Chargers ball). And it\u2019s ruled a Patriots recovery. It\u2019s going to be 1st and 10, New England at the Chargers 35! Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 3:22, 2nd quarter And King fumbles on the punt return, it looks like the Patriots might have recovered. This is one is going to review. It looks real close. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 3:22, 2nd quarter Brady throws from the pocket\u2026 and it\u2019s in-between two receivers and far away from both of them. 2nd &amp; 10. On 2nd &amp; 10, Michel gets tripped up for a three yard gain. On 3rd &amp; 7, Brady gets hit and throws incomplete. Well so much for my prediction of a long drive. Oh hey, it\u2019s Ryan Allen to punt. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 4:16, 2nd quarter 3rd &amp; 10. Rivers throws under pressure to Gordon, who is busted up by Dont\u2019a Hightower. And that\u2019s another Chargers punt. Edelman fields the punt and gets it to the New England 21. Look for the Patriots to try to have a real long possession here and shorten the half. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 4:33, 2nd quarter Gordon goes off for no gain. 2nd &amp; 10. Rivers tries another deep throw, but no dice here. 3rd &amp; 10 at their own 47. Rivers is showing his trademark Extremely Upset Body Language here, but when doesn\u2019t he? On 3rd and 10... the Chargers call a timeout with one second left on the play clock. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 5:22, 2nd quarter King receives the kickoff and gets it to the Chargers 21. Rivers fires deep on the very first play, aiming for Ty Williams for a 26 yard gain. Rivers is gonna have to make big throws like that if they want to get back in this thing. I feel really bad about dismissing those \u201cthe key to this game is going to be the running backs\u201d takes. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 6:04, 2nd quarter And on this play, Michel gets 40 yards and reaches the Chargers 6 before being taken down. This is becoming a disaster for the Chargers. He\u2019s up to 95 yards on the half. On 1st down, Rex Burkhead gets 3 yards. On 2nd\u2026 he gets in. Another drive, another touchdown! The extra point is good and the Chargers are in trouble early. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 7:20, 2nd quarter Michel only gets 2 yards on 2nd down. It\u2019s 3rd and 2. LA could make a key stop here. Brady is in the pocket and throws long and it\u2019s incomplete. There is a flag on the play. Holding on the defense, on King. Five yard penalty and an automatic first down. Well. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 8:40, 2nd quarter If the Patriots score a touchdown on this drive, the Chargers might be in trouble. Brady throws to White on 1st down, he keeps running and picks up 25 yards. Jeez. Patriots are at their own 38. Michel gets six on 1st &amp; 10. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 9:12, 2nd quarter Chargers at their own 49. Gordon gets wrapped up for no gain. 2nd &amp; 10. Rivers throws under pressure to avoid a sack. 3rd &amp; 10. The Gillette crowd gets loud. Rivers throws to Antonio Gates, but McCourty bats it away. The Chargers have to punt again. That\u2019s not ideal. Edelman makes a fair catch of the punt at the New England 13. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 10:14, 2nd quarter 3rd &amp; 2. Big play here for both sides. Rivers decides to throw long\u2026 but it\u2019s a free play. There\u2019s a flag on the play, it\u2019s a delay of game on the offense (surprisingly). That\u2019s a five yard penalty which gives the Patriots defense a tad more breathing room. On 3rd and 7, Rivers finds Williams and\u2026 they complete it anyways, nice catch in heavy traffic. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 10:55, 2nd quarter Rivers finds Gordon for a first down. He gets to about the 36. 1st &amp; 10. Gordon gets a carry and picks up 8. This is a good start, they\u2019re at their own 44 already. 2nd &amp; 2\u2026. Rivers airs it out to Williams and that\u2019s incomplete. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 12:17, 2nd quarter The Chargers offense can make up large deficits quick but\u2026 They should try to start that now rather than later. Gostkowski\u2019s kick goes to the end zone for a touchdown, they\u2019ll start at their own 25. Okay my expert analysis is that the Chargers defense needs to play better. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 12:17, 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 6, Brady finds Hogan who gets taken down just short of a 1st down. On 3rd &amp; 1, Brady hands off to Michel. But it\u2019s a false start for the firsts penalty on the Patriots. That will make it 3rd &amp; 6. No matter, Brady finds Dorsett for their third touchdown of the game. That\u2019s one on every drive. And the extra point is good. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, 13:49, 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 10, Brady finds Phillip Dorsett for the first time of the game and he picks up a first down that brings the Patriots to the Chargers 19. On the next play, Brady hands off to Michel who picks up 4 yards. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, 15:00, 2nd quarter Brady finds Edelman again, that\u2019s a 17 yard gain that takes the Patriots to the Chargers 30. That moves him to second on the all-time postseason receptions list. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, end of the 1st quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Brady\u2019s pass is tipped by Melvin Ingram, but it falls incomplete. Brady throws to Edelman and that\u2019s another first down conversion as the first quarter comes to an end. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, :42, 1st quarter Edelman fields the punt and carries it 6 yards to the New England 36 and we have a brief commercial break. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, :42, 1st quarter Prop bet: when are we gonna see our first punt? It won\u2019t be here, the kickoff goes to Desmond King who gets to the Chargers 25. On 1st &amp; 10, Gordon picks up a yard. 2nd &amp; 9. Rivers throws long again and\u2026 it falls into no man\u2019s land. 3rd &amp; 9, the Pats defense gets on Rivers who scrambles and throws it away. I guess now we\u2019ll see our first punt. Random note: I refuse to believe \u201cGod Friended Me\u201d is a real show. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, 1:42, 1st quarter Michel picks up 2 yards on first down. He\u2019s getting a lot of carries. On 2nd &amp; 8, Brady finds Edelman again who gets it all the way to the Chargers 14. That\u2019s a 28 yard gain! On the very next play, Michel runs it all the way into the end zone. Touchdown! This is going to be a fun one folks! Oh and the extra point is good. Chargers 7-7 Patriots, 2:55, 1st quarter Phillips is back on the field for the Chargers, good news for them. Brady finds White, who gets taken for a loss by Jahleel Addae. On 2nd &amp; 13, Brady finds old reliable Edelman who manages to slip defenders and pick up a first down. Chargers 7-7 Patriots, 4:49, 1st quarter I\u2019m not sure exactly what the Pats defense was doing right there, but, then again, Allen is really that good. The Chargers kick it off and Cordarrelle Patterson takes it to the Patriots 33. On 1st &amp; 10, Brady throws incomplete. On 2nd &amp; 10, Michel gets it to the New England 45. Chargers 7-7 Patriots, 4:56, 1st quarter Williams is on the sidelines, trying to \u201cwalk off\u201d a leg injury. Chargers are at their own 46 with a fresh set of downs. Ausitn Ekeler picks up three yards. 2nd &amp; 7, Williams is already back in the game. Melvin Gordon gets the ball next and he picks up eight yards to the New England 43. And Rivers has enough of these short gains, he finds a completely alone Keenan Allen for a touchdown! Wow! The extra point ties this game up. This might be that quarterback battle we were hoping for. Chargers 0-7 Patriots, 6:52, 1st quarter Gostkowski\u2019s pooch kick goes to the 17 yard line, Justin Jackson takes it to the Chargers 33. On 1st down, Melvin Gordon gets stuffed for no gain. 2nd &amp; 10 for the Chargers. Rivers launches one deep, aiming for Mike Williams, who ALMOST makes the catch. Oh man that was painful. 3rd and 10\u2026 there\u2019s a flag on the play. Delay of game on the Chargers, that\u2019s a five yard penalty. So now it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 15. This is not a great start for them. Rivers throws deep\u2026 and Mike Williams catches it this time, that\u2019s an 18 yard gain and a first down. He looks shaken up on the field though. Twitter message from Dean Wyles: Just started taking an interest in NFL. Why do people not like Brady? Is it because he is successful or as a result of the deflate-gate? Great live coverage. Thanks. Dean Wyles Those are all part of it. There\u2019s a lot more, to be honest but those are big ones. Chargers 0-7 Patriots, 7:52, 1st quarter Michel goes up the middle and scored. Stephen Gostkowsksi\u2019s extra point is good and just like that the Patriots have the lead. Maybe receiving was the right choice. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 7:52, 1st quarter Brady throws incomplete, finally. It\u2019s a 3rd and 5, Brady throws throws to James White for a first down conversion. They\u2019re at the Chargers 13 now. On 1st &amp; 10, there\u2019s no gain by Michel. 2nd &amp; 10, Brady hits White again. Four yard gain. Yet another 3rd down conversion here for the Patriots, LA *has* to hold them to a field goal here. On 3rd &amp; 6, Brady throws incomplete to the end zone\u2026 but there\u2019s a flag. Pass Interference. Defense! The ball will be on the one yard line and an automatic first down. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 9:54, 1st quarter Phillips is out, big blow for Chargers. Michel gets the ball again, he goes 11 yards to the Chargers and then 5 more yards on the next carry. Patriots are at the Chargers 19. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 11:20, 1st quarter White gets into Chargers territory on a 17 yard gain. Brady has been hitting everybody so far. Chargers cornerback Adrian Phillips gets injured on the play. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 11:33 1st quarter On 3rd and 3, Brady finds Edelman for an easy gain to get a first down at the Patriots 30. On first down, Michel gets stuffed again. Okay, not so great for the run game so far. On 2nd &amp; 11, Michel picks up 9. 3rd and 2. Brady hits James White who picks up ten yards for another first down conversion. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 14:16, 1st quarter Brady finds James White who takes it to the 24. Sony Michel goes off for a run, and then gets stuffed for the loss of a yard on 2nd and 2. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 15:00, 1st quarter Patriots win the toss and\u2026 THEY RECEIVE? They always defer. I hate this, this is the reason they\u2019re gonna lose. The Patriots will start from inside their 20. A feature on Tom Brady vs Philip Rivers. Fun fact, this is the oldest quarterback battle in NFL playoff history. It\u2019s possible that the temperature could make this not the offensive, pass-heavy game that some of us might have hoped. This could come down to the running game. The players are coming to the field now, kickoff is coming. Email from David George Hi Hunter, Despite his record, I\u2019ve never been a fan of Brady and I really, really want the Chargers to win. However, with the best will in the world, I think your prediction of 28-31 to the Pats is being generous to the Chargers. I just can\u2019t see the Chargers getting that close to the Pats. Next Sunday in Kansas will be a very different proposition, though. In the meantime, here\u2019s hoping I\u2019m wrong. Enjoy doing the blog tonight. Regards, David George I will say this: you are very not alone in hating Tom Brady. Also: I think the Chiefs handle whoever wins this game. I got some heat on picking Rob Gronkowski for the player to watch this game but it was partly an emotional pick. He\u2019s been banged up this season and I fully expect him to retire at the end of the season. If so, win or lose, this would be his last home game as the Chiefs will be hosting the AFC Championship Game. I\u2019m hoping that he has a few more memorable plays in him. I\u2019ve already made my predictions, I\u2019ve got the Patriots by a field goal, but I\u2019ve been super-duper wrong so far during these playoffs. If you have any, feel free to send them here either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweet them to @HunterFelt. I am upset that the Chargers are now in Los Angeles because it makes the Greatest Theme Song In NFL History completely irrelevant. The fun thing is that there will now be \u201cBeat LA\u201d chants from the fans in the crowd. The anti-Los Angeles chant comes from the Boston Celtics/Los Angeles Lakers rivalry in the NBA BUT not from an actual Lakers/Celtics game. Fans began the chant to implore the Philadelphia 76ers, who had just beat the Celtics, to go out and beat their West Coast enemies because if they couldn\u2019t win at least maybe the Lakers could lose. The good news for the warm-weather Chargers is that it\u2019s warmed up at Foxboro. Right now it\u2019s a warm 24 degrees Fahrenheit. So, uh, yeah. Speaking as someone who is coming to you from Somerville MA with a furnace that keeps going out, I can assure you that it makes for not ideal conditions. It should favor the Patriots, as New England receiver Julian Edelman points out via Twitter. In their existence, the Chargers have played in one Super Bowl, back in 1995 as the San Diego Chargers, where they lost to the San Francisco 49ers. The New England Patriots have appeared in 10 and have won five, all of them with Tom Brady as quarterback and Bill Belichick as head coach. Today\u2019s game would appear to be a mismatch. Of course, despite being the lower seed, the Chargers had a better regular season record (12-4) than the Patriots (11-5). Listen, nobody said the NFL Playoffs made sense. The Patriots have had one of their less impressive regular seasons, with signs that Brady is finally showing signs of slipping. This could be Philip Rivers and the Chargers\u2019 best chance to notch their win against the quarterback. The Chargers are fresh off a 23-17 win over the Baltimore Ravens while the Patriots were relaxing on their bye. That mean\u2019s today\u2019s playoff game will be yet another referendum of rest vs. rust. The winner of today\u2019s game will face the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game after the Chiefs tore through the Indianapolis Colts 31-13. Either way, we\u2019re going to get another fantastic quarterback matchup, with either Brady or Rivers playing against Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes. Meanwhile, in the NFC, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Dallas Cowboys 30-22. After today\u2019s game, the Philadelphia Eagles will try to keep Nick Foles Magic going against Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints. If you want to contribute to this liveblog, you can either email us (at hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweet us at (@HunterFelt) throughout today\u2019s game with your questions, concerns, predictions, smack-talk and other such commentary. Kickoff is scheduled at 1:05pm EST, but we\u2019ll be back well before then. It\u2019s the Los Angeles Chargers vs the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium! Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s his rundown of today\u2019s game: What the Chargers need to do to win: Get to the quarterback. While he ended the season with one of his finest efforts of the season, Tom Brady has looked human of late and more vulnerable to pressure. Meanwhile, the Chargers may have the best all-around defense of the teams remaining in the playoffs. What the Patriots need to do to win: Keep doing what they\u2019re doing at home. The Patriots have a perfect 8-0 record at Gillette Stadium this season and no team will have benefitted more from the bye week, what with Brady showing some surprising signs of age. Oh, and Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers has never won a game against Brady. Key player: Rob Gronkowski, TE, Patriots. The Patriots\u2019 playoff success has depended on the health of Gronkowski, maybe the greatest tight end in NFLhistory. Expect Brady to look for him when his team need to pick up big-time yardage, even though Gronkowski has not had a vintage season by his standards. Prediction: Chargers 28-31 Patriots",

      "bodyText": "Madrid have managed to avert the embarrassment of their worst start in the 21st century but they had to dig it out. Ceballos, against his old club, was the hero, on a night when there was a glimpse of a new Real Madrid. Vinicius and Brahim Diaz, making his Liga debut, are two names that stood out. Betis can count themselves unlucky; better finishing and braver defending of that corner might even have taken all three points. 90 min+4: Vinicius tries to buy time by holding the ball in the corner, and that\u2019s enough. Real Madrid have their victory. 90 min+2: A Betis corner and a handball appeal. Nothing from the ref, nothing from VAR. 90 min+1: A replay suggests that Ryad Boudebouz, the Betis sub, was the guilty party in that collapsing wall. Pau Lopez did not expect him to turn away from the ball. Four minutes added on, as it happens. 90 min: Bitter blow for Betis, who had been the better team, but that was a soft goal to concede. Real Madrid have ridden their luck, big time. Ceballos takes it, when Ramos looked favourite. Pau Lopez stepped one way and the ball went the other, and Ceballos scored against his old club. The Betis wall was soft, too. 87 min: The Real Madrid front three is now Vinicius, Brahim and Cristo. How times change. Casemiro wins a free-kick, after being fouled by Carvalho, who receives a red card. Loren comes on for Sanabria, who has worked hard all night. 84 min: Tello had a chance to shoot, after another great run from Barragan; but this shot somehow ended up going behind him. 82 min: Real have gone to 4-4-2, with Nacho stepping out to left-back. That 3-5-2 has failed them in this second half. 80 min: Diaz had to wait a while to get on as Betis continued to control midfield. Eventually, he comes on to make his debut, as Valverde comes off. That suggests Solari is going for the win here. 78 min: Here comes Brahim Diaz, so recently of Manchester City. That will mean no Isco. A cheeky bid for the former midfield kingpin from a Premier League or Serie A club is surely worth a go, and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho won\u2019t fancy him, either, once Fellaini comes on. 76 min: Vinicius has been pushed to the left, but he will have to see the ball first if he is to make an impact. Betis ratcheting up the pressure. 74 min: Lo Celso and Carvalho are ruling the roost in midfield and after their decent first half, it is clear to see why Real Madrid are in such a mess. It has to be said that Modric, after his goal, has done very little. 72 min: Real Madrid make a sub. Requilon is coming off and on comes Dani Ceballos against his former club, whose fans don\u2019t give the new arrival the warmest of welcomes. 71 mins: Tello gets an early touch as Madrid\u2019s defence opens up once more. The giants are rocking here. Ramos has to clear a Barragan ball from the right flank. 69 min: Real Madrid can hardly say that wasn\u2019t coming. They stepped off the gas. By the way, Cristian Tello came on for Betis, for Francis Guerrero, and just a few seconds before the goal. Canales, at last, finds a way through, as Lo Celso plays an excellent ball. VAR is called upon but Carvajal was playing him onside. There was a lengthy delay to it being awarded and the celebrations. Canales\u2019 finish was typically delicate but just right this time. 65 min: Lo Celso tried to find a way through the middle, only for Nacho to come across. A hint of handball and the VAR is called into action. But nothing doing. 63 min: Real Madrid have not mounted an attack in some time. Some young and old legs in their team and they might be running out of energy. In the first half, they did press hard. 61 min: Real are sitting on this a little. Valverde is booked for a foul on Sanabria. 59 min: Carvalho, no longer linked to Arsenal every summer, stepping it up in midfield. Madrid are dropping off. And Guardado finds space to shoot, this time wide. 57 min: Betis still pushing on, but Real are sat back in numbers, while Betis are not committing enough into the box. The ball went across the six-yard line and was begging and no takers in green and white. 54 min: Benzema being absent does mean Real Madrid are not holding the ball up so well now. Betis on the march. Varane shows dexterity in hacking the ball away with his backheel. 52 min: Vinicius is now furthest forward for Real Madrid, and he makes a couple of darts across the Betis defence. He is also chasing down Betis defenders. This is a little different to what we see from Bale or that Ronaldo bloke. This is most modern. 50 min: Betis have a spell of possession; Madrid happy to sit back and soak up pressure. Betis don\u2019t exactly commit much forward into the box but a corner is forced nonetheless. 48 min: Joaquin sets up Canales with a neat pass, but the shot is not enough to beat Navas. Canales has had the best chances but doesn\u2019t seem capable of hitting the ball hard enough. 47 min: Vinicius forces a corner. It\u2019s well dealt with by Pau Lopez in Betis\u2019 goal. 46 min: On comes Cristo, and Benzema probably has his finger in ice somewhere. This looks a youthful team now with Vinicius and Cristo in attack. Looks like Benzema will not be continuing. Cristo Gonz\u00e1lez is stretching his legs at half-time. 45+2 min: Real Madrid have looked a decent unit here, with Solari\u2019s new system working well. Betis have been held at arm\u2019s length, though Benzema\u2019s finger might end up the story of this game. 45 min+1: Ouch! Benzema is tackled by Bartra and goes down to the floor. He looks to have wrenched his finger into a place it does not belong. He is in agony. The physio puts it back in place, but that hurt. And he leaves the field in distinct discomfort. 45 min: Better from Betis; Lo Celso jabs a pass for Canales, and the midfielder turns and pings a shot at goal. Perhaps he was too hasty, as he had time and ended up missing the target. 44 min: Nacho steps in to hack clear as Guardado threatens down the left flank; this has been a decent performance from the back three. 43 min: Ramos booked now, for a hefty trip on Lo Celso. 41 min: Another Betis free-kick after Casemiro and Ramos sandwiched Sanabria. Canales\u2019 shot is the closest Betis have come but is wide of the target. 39 min: Vinicius has an opportunity to charge on, but wasted his pass to Benzema. He looks annoyed with himself. Gareth Bale is not here and the Brazilian has a chance to shine. 37 min: Nine shots from Real Madrid, none from Betis, say the stats men, which doesn\u2019t seem to count Lo Celso\u2019s earlier attempt. It looked like a shot, but maybe was too weak to count. Would it even count for the xG lads? 35 mins: Modric was meanwhile booked for a foul on Joaquin. It was a full-blooded lunge. 34 min: Handbags as Casemiro throws in a nasty foul on Joaquin. No booking, though. The free-kick is over-deliberate. Real charge on, another fine touch from Vinicius. Valverde is through but then steps on the ball. It seems he wanted Benzema to have a shot. He probably got a call but it ended up a terrible waste. 32 min: Real stepping it up a bit here, now controlling matters. Valverde forced a corner off Marc Bartra as they pushed on. This time, Benzema can\u2019t link up with Vincius. 30 min: Another brief flicker of Vinicius, as he links with Benzema, who did some typical hold-up play before crossing back from the byline. A rueful grimace from the teenager; he might have done better. 28 min: If Betis have a problem, it is that they are being crowded in midfield. They have nowhere to go. This is a different Madrid. Pressing has never really been their thing. 26 mins: Lo Celso finds space, at last. His shot is weak, but receives applause as Betis have not created much until now. 25 min: Modric, left-footed this time, finds similar space to where his goal came from and shoots just over. 24 min: Real Madrid not great here, it has to be said. Betis have been a little naive in defence and were for the goal, but have matched their opponent. Madrid, perhaps as a result of that unfamiliar formation, are not clicking. 22 min: Guardado is fouled. Joaquin and Canales argue over who will take, but it is Canales who takes and Nacho who clears. 19 min: Vinicius makes his first surge. A lovely run, a languid stride but the shot is saved with ease. He was actually offside, but as it came to nothing, the ref waved play on. That\u2019s a change VAR brings. Takes some getting used to, all that. 17 min: Modric flies into a tackle which looked a little wild. Lo Celso, though, got up to continue. And the ref saw no problem in it in any case. Second look suggests it was lenient to think that. 15 min: This unfamiliar Real Madrid team took a while to get going but then scored, almost with their first attack of note. The old faithfuls in Modric and Benzema were involved. 13 min: There was a VAR delay for that one. Was Benzema offside? No, it seems not. The goal will stand. Carvajal surged on, and the ball came loose to Modric, who lashed it with his right foot and into the goal. 12 min: Brahim Diaz is on the bench for Real; one to watch for the City fans. 11 min: A Real Madrid break, Benzema goes down in the area, and a penalty claim is lodged. Nothing doing. 9 min: Another offside. Tony Adams and co would be proud of this level of control of the offside trap so far. 7 min: Canales, who has been lively against his old club, is caught offside. Madrid\u2019s unfamiliar back three is doing well with the offside trap so far. 4 min: Vinicius is fouled on the edge of the box. Guardado is booked, even though three players at a time surged in. The free-kick was a waste as Modric boomed it into the wall. 2 min: Navas, standing in for Thibaut Courtois, comes out to smother and attack. There was an offside flag in any case. 1 min: Betis beat Barcelona earlier this season. Let\u2019s see what they can do. Sergio Canales was once the Junior Vinicius of his day. And away we go...Betis take the kick-off in front of a home crowd in full terpsichorean mood. The headline news for Real Madrid is the continuing absence of Isco, who is being given a similar cold shoulder by Solari to that Unai Emery offers Mesut \u00d6zil these days at Arsenal. Here\u2019s the teams in analogue fashion. Junior Firpo, the flying full-back, will be a big miss for Betis. He\u2019s been linked with Big Real in recent weeks. Real Betis: Pau L\u00f3pez, Barrag\u00e1n, Mandi, Bartra, Francis, William Carvalho, Guardado, Canales, Lo Celso, Joaqu\u00edn, Sanabria Real Madrid: Navas, Carvajal, Varane, Nacho, Ramos, Reguil\u00f3n, Modric, Casemiro, Valverde, Vinicius, Benzema. The last time these teams met, there were a mere eight goals. Meanwhile, Lionel Messi has scored his 400th Liga goal, in just 435 matches as Barcelona beat Eibar 3-0 and stayed top of the league. Vinicius has some act to live up to. Sid Lowe on Real\u2019s travails here. Madrid are lining up with three central defenders against Betis with Nacho playing alongside Varane and Ramos. Vinicius has recovered from flu, and is something of a surprise starter. Here are the teams: Should Real Madrid lose this one to their similarly royalist opponents from Andalusia - or even draw - they will be at their lowest points total at this point of the season in the 21st Century so far Where did it all go wrong, Se\u00f1or Triple Champions League and Club World champions? It seems, as it often did during that imperial period, that the whole thing was built on sand. Banjaxing Spain\u2019s World Cup by appointing Julen Lopetegui now looks one of the worst decisions in football history, but it was a panic born of Zinedine Zidane reading the runes and doing one before the whol edifice collapsed. It seems Santiago Solari, similarly an ex-player, and part of the coaching set-up, is no Zizou, or even an Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. Things are so bad, they are even pining for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s brand of macho miserablism. Can Betis beat them? Why not? They are just four points behind, though haven\u2019t started the year too well themselves.",

I don\u2019t even remember some of the saves so I can\u2019t pick a best.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r has described De Gea on more than one occasion as the best goalkeeper in the world and he added a twist to hyperbole here. \u201cThere have been some great keepers at this club and he is challenging Edwin [van der Sar] and Peter [Schmeichel] for the No 1 spot historically. There were one or two fantastic ones and the rest were just about concentration. The team spirit is fantastic and, secondly, we\u2019ve shown we can defend today.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r and Pochettino both stressed that the question of the permanent managerial position at Old Trafford was not something they wanted to discuss. Pochettino was disappointed that a driving performance had yielded nothing \u2013 he said the second 45 minutes was the finest football of his four-and-a-half-year tenure at the club \u2013 and he was concerned about Kane, who has a history of ankle problems. \u201cMy worry is that it was a bad tackle in the last moment,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the intention of the United player but it was a bad tackle and now he has bit of a swelling on his ankle and he was limping after the game. We are going to lose Son for the Asia Cup and, if Harry suffers an injury, it is going to be massive for us.\u201d Pogba, who had fallen out with Mourinho, has been revitalised under Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cI am enjoying my football now,\u201d Pogba said. \u201cI like to be more attacking. I had to defend too much before and that is not my best attribute. This is my position. The manager tells me to get into the box and score goals. The best example is Frank Lampard.\u201d",

The president has reportedly told advisers he thinks the 23-day partial closure of the US government, the longest ever, is a win for him. Around the US, about 800,000 federal workers face increasing hardship without pay and government departments are underfunded and understaffed. Vital services including airport security and nutritional aid to poorer Americans are under increasing strain. On Sunday the president remained in a drastically understaffed White House, tweeting criticism of Democrats and inflammatory messages about migrants and crime, in one case apparently taken directly from Fox News. ABC News and the Washington Post released a poll that followed trends when it showed 53% of respondents saying Trump and Republicans in Congress were to blame for the shutdown, with 29% blaming Democrats and 13% a combination. Support for building a border wall, the issue at the heart of the shutdown, increased to 42%, from 34% in January 2018. Among Republicans, 87% supported a wall.

      "body": "<p>It was a case of new year, same successful England, as Tracey Neville\u2019s team began their quest for a first Quad Series title on a compelling note in Liverpool.</p> <p>Six months before the netball World Cup, to be staged at this same venue, England claimed a comfortable 54-41 victory over New Zealand to open the northern version of this tournament. It was not, quite, the statement performance England sought. But for a first effort it did the job, and set the foundations for what comes next.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games gold medal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2018/apr/15/englands-netball-team-shock-australia-to-win-commonwealth-gold-video\" title=\"\">victory over Australia</a>, one which propelled England to the BBC\u2019s Team of the Year and Greatest Moment awards, shocked the netball world. This year, England are intent on proving such a result represents a seismic shift rather than a fluke. While not perfectly polished by any stretch, this was another step in that direction.</p> <p>Continuing their recent dominance against New Zealand, with a fourth straight victory over the revamped, struggling Silver Ferns, offered the desired start to 2019. It says everything about the path England are now treading, and the elevated place they now occupy on the global stage, that Neville deems a record-equalling 13-goal victory over the Ferns not quite good enough, labelling some of the attacking skills scrappy.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people were wary that it was the end of our journey at that Commonwealth Games,\u201d Neville said. \u201cThe gold medal for me wasn\u2019t the priority, it was the consistency of results. It\u2019s about beating world No 1 consistently, and we haven\u2019t done that against Australia. Twenty years ago I started playing netball and I was sat in a room and it was about beating world No 1 and 2.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to be one of those people that people wanted to be. I can probably say we are, however, there\u2019s still a lot of work to go before the World Cup. People don\u2019t look at these results, they look at the major championships and those are the things we need to keep backing up.\u201d</p> <p>The victory comes with further benefits as this will be the last time these netball heavyweights meet before the World Cup, giving England a psychological advantage should they clash again in the summer at the 16-team event.</p> <p>England, runners-up in the last two tournaments, have never won the Quad Series. But in this, the sixth edition, they will not get a better chance to end that drought and further enhance credentials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/02/team-of-2018-england-women-netball\">Who are the team of 2018? My vote goes to England\u2019s women netballers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This result against the Ferns, coupled with Australia losing their star shooter and captain Caitlin Bassett to a broken forearm suffered in a training match last week, leaves the title within England\u2019s grasp with two matches to play in London next weekend.</p> <p>Where once England played second fiddle to Australia and New Zealand, they now wear the target. That brings different pressures, and they should therefore be better for this outing. Back at full strength for the first time since the Commonwealth Games, with the Helen Housby-Jo Harten shooting combination restored, England should only build.</p> <p>Here the experienced Serena Guthrie and Jade Clarke owned the mid-court, giving New Zealand\u2019s Sam Sinclair, who started at centre, a torrid time while at the defensive end Geva Mentor was her typical tower of strength alongside the player of the match, Eboni Usoro-Brown.</p> <p>England were held to a 25-24 half-time advantage but broke the shackles in a decisive third quarter to establish a 10-goal lead. They extended that by three in the final quarter, with New Zealand defender Karin Burger sent to the sin-bin for two minutes.</p>",

Six months before the netball World Cup, to be staged at this same venue, England claimed a comfortable 54-41 victory over New Zealand to open the northern version of this tournament. It was not, quite, the statement performance England sought. But for a first effort it did the job, and set the foundations for what comes next. Last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games gold medal victory over Australia, one which propelled England to the BBC\u2019s Team of the Year and Greatest Moment awards, shocked the netball world. This year, England are intent on proving such a result represents a seismic shift rather than a fluke. While not perfectly polished by any stretch, this was another step in that direction. Continuing their recent dominance against New Zealand, with a fourth straight victory over the revamped, struggling Silver Ferns, offered the desired start to 2019. It says everything about the path England are now treading, and the elevated place they now occupy on the global stage, that Neville deems a record-equalling 13-goal victory over the Ferns not quite good enough, labelling some of the attacking skills scrappy. \u201cA lot of people were wary that it was the end of our journey at that Commonwealth Games,\u201d Neville said. \u201cThe gold medal for me wasn\u2019t the priority, it was the consistency of results. It\u2019s about beating world No 1 consistently, and we haven\u2019t done that against Australia. Twenty years ago I started playing netball and I was sat in a room and it was about beating world No 1 and 2. \u201cWe wanted to be one of those people that people wanted to be. I can probably say we are, however, there\u2019s still a lot of work to go before the World Cup. People don\u2019t look at these results, they look at the major championships and those are the things we need to keep backing up.\u201d The victory comes with further benefits as this will be the last time these netball heavyweights meet before the World Cup, giving England a psychological advantage should they clash again in the summer at the 16-team event. England, runners-up in the last two tournaments, have never won the Quad Series. But in this, the sixth edition, they will not get a better chance to end that drought and further enhance credentials. This result against the Ferns, coupled with Australia losing their star shooter and captain Caitlin Bassett to a broken forearm suffered in a training match last week, leaves the title within England\u2019s grasp with two matches to play in London next weekend. Where once England played second fiddle to Australia and New Zealand, they now wear the target. That brings different pressures, and they should therefore be better for this outing. Back at full strength for the first time since the Commonwealth Games, with the Helen Housby-Jo Harten shooting combination restored, England should only build. Here the experienced Serena Guthrie and Jade Clarke owned the mid-court, giving New Zealand\u2019s Sam Sinclair, who started at centre, a torrid time while at the defensive end Geva Mentor was her typical tower of strength alongside the player of the match, Eboni Usoro-Brown. England were held to a 25-24 half-time advantage but broke the shackles in a decisive third quarter to establish a 10-goal lead. They extended that by three in the final quarter, with New Zealand defender Karin Burger sent to the sin-bin for two minutes.",

After meeting the Russian president in Hamburg in 2017, the Post reported, Trump took his interpreter\u2019s notes and instructed him not to disclose what was discussed to other US officials. The news follows a New York Times report on Friday that law enforcement officials were so concerned about Trump\u2019s behaviour after he fired James Comey as FBI director that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/donald-trump-fbi-investigate-working-russia-report\">launched a counterintelligence investigation</a> into whether he was acting as a Russian agent. On Saturday night, Trump was asked by a Fox News host whether he had ever worked for Russia. \u201cI think it\u2019s the most insulting thing I\u2019ve ever been asked,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, a poll has found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/13/shutdown-americans-blame-trump\">Trump is losing the battle to avoid blame for the longest-ever government shutdown</a> \u2013 which the president reportedly told advisers he thought would be a win for him.</p> <p><strong>Every Australian state and territory is set to swelter through a heatwave,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/13/temperatures-to-soar-as-heatwave-hits-every-state-and-territory\">with meteorologists saying soaring temperatures will last until the weekend in some parts</a>. The Bureau of Meteorology said hot days were expected in January but multiple days in a row of temperatures above 40C were unusual. \u201cParticularly northern South Australia, they\u2019re looking at maybe five days in a row above 45C and normally they might only get five or 10 a year,\u201d meteorologist Dean Narramore said. Heatwave conditions have been forecast across parts of central Western Australia to southern parts of the Northern Territory, south-western Queensland and across New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.</p> <p><strong>Delays are crippling Tasmania\u2019s freedom of information regime</strong> as new figures reveal the state\u2019s understaffed public watchdog is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/14/tasmanias-foi-regime-crippled-by-outrageous-delays-academics-say\">struggling under the weight of its growing workload</a>. The lack of political transparency in Tasmania was laid bare in last year\u2019s election, when voters were left unaware of the true influence of powerful gaming interests due to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/23/labor-thinks-youre-stupid-pokies-lobby-fights-hard-in-tasmanian-election\">weak and sluggish donation disclosure system</a>, widely considered the worst in the nation. Tasmania\u2019s right-to-information system, however, was considered one of the strongest of any state or territory when legislation was introduced in 2010. But Tasmania has been the worst performer on making RTI decisions within the statutory timeframes for two of the past three years on record, and when decisions are made, they are by far the most likely to be appealed of any jurisdiction.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bb4f93cc89ac76dad2790dab1a5f5ee52d3cb3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bb4f93cc89ac76dad2790dab1a5f5ee52d3cb3a/0_25_3297_1978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May leaves church on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The EU is preparing to delay Brexit until at least July </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/13/eu-preparing-to-delay-brexit-until-at-least-july\">after concluding that Theresa May is doomed to fail in getting her deal through parliament.</a><strong> </strong>The country\u2019s 29 March deadline for exiting the EU is now regarded by Brussels as highly unlikely to be met given the domestic opposition facing the prime minister.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 14 January. Top stories Donald Trump went to extraordinary lengths to conceal from his own administration details of conversations with Vladimir Putin, the Washington Post has reported. After meeting the Russian president in Hamburg in 2017, the Post reported, Trump took his interpreter\u2019s notes and instructed him not to disclose what was discussed to other US officials. The news follows a New York Times report on Friday that law enforcement officials were so concerned about Trump\u2019s behaviour after he fired James Comey as FBI director that they launched a counterintelligence investigation into whether he was acting as a Russian agent. On Saturday night, Trump was asked by a Fox News host whether he had ever worked for Russia. \u201cI think it\u2019s the most insulting thing I\u2019ve ever been asked,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, a poll has found Trump is losing the battle to avoid blame for the longest-ever government shutdown \u2013 which the president reportedly told advisers he thought would be a win for him. Every Australian state and territory is set to swelter through a heatwave, with meteorologists saying soaring temperatures will last until the weekend in some parts. The Bureau of Meteorology said hot days were expected in January but multiple days in a row of temperatures above 40C were unusual. \u201cParticularly northern South Australia, they\u2019re looking at maybe five days in a row above 45C and normally they might only get five or 10 a year,\u201d meteorologist Dean Narramore said. Heatwave conditions have been forecast across parts of central Western Australia to southern parts of the Northern Territory, south-western Queensland and across New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. Delays are crippling Tasmania\u2019s freedom of information regime as new figures reveal the state\u2019s understaffed public watchdog is struggling under the weight of its growing workload. The lack of political transparency in Tasmania was laid bare in last year\u2019s election, when voters were left unaware of the true influence of powerful gaming interests due to its weak and sluggish donation disclosure system, widely considered the worst in the nation. Tasmania\u2019s right-to-information system, however, was considered one of the strongest of any state or territory when legislation was introduced in 2010. But Tasmania has been the worst performer on making RTI decisions within the statutory timeframes for two of the past three years on record, and when decisions are made, they are by far the most likely to be appealed of any jurisdiction. World The EU is preparing to delay Brexit until at least July after concluding that Theresa May is doomed to fail in getting her deal through parliament. The country\u2019s 29 March deadline for exiting the EU is now regarded by Brussels as highly unlikely to be met given the domestic opposition facing the prime minister. Here is what the week ahead holds for the Brexit debate. German far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland has voted to campaign for the country\u2019s exit from the European Union if its demand for reforms within the bloc are not met. The decision on Sunday marks the first time any major party has called for a German departure. A member of the migrant caravan has been killed in Honduras after being sent back by the US. Nelson Espinal had made the 4,900km journey with several thousand others in October in the hope of starting a new life, but was deported after reaching the US. Just over a week after his return, Espinal was shot dead on the street outside his home. A powerful regional body of African states has called for a recount in the contested presidential election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Sunday\u2019s statement from the Southern African Development Community, which includes 16 states, notes the \u201cstrong doubts cast on the poll outcome by the \u2026 church, the opposition coalition and other observers\u201d and suggests \u201ca negotiated political settlement for a government of national unity\u201d. The pop star Robbie Williams has been \u201cblasting Black Sabbath music\u201d at his neighbour, Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, over a home extension row, a complaint to their local council has said. The musicians, who live in west London, clashed after the ex-Take That singer was granted conditional approval last year to build a basement swimming pool. Page is concerned the excavation work will damage his 1875 mansion. Opinion and analysis It\u2019s not as if Phil Collins recorded Say Say Say and The Girl Is Mine, is it? He didn\u2019t cowrite either Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? or We Are the World. He hasn\u2019t been accused of abusing women or children; and at no point did he step in as a replacement lead singer for Queen, Deep Purple or INXS. As the Not Dead Yet tour finally reaches Australia, Bernard Zuel looks into the origins of the near universal disdain for the former Genesis drummer. Roma has won acclaim and awards \u2013 most recently a Golden Globe \u2013 and may capture Mexico\u2019s first foreign-language film Oscar. It has catapulted its star, Yalitza Aparicio, into the global spotlight and on to the cover of Vogue\u2019s Mexican edition \u2013 a first for an indigenous woman. But it has also prompted serious soul-searching about the plight of poorly paid and often-unprotected domestic workers in Mexico where, nearly five decades after the period depicted in the film, inequality remains rife, racism stubbornly persists and social mobility seems to have stagnated. Sport Roger Federer, the Methuselah of sport, is ageing with the irresistible longevity of an oak tree. While Andy Murray\u2019s match against Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open might round out the 31-year-old Scot\u2019s career, Federer, at 37, continues to float on his own cloud. What has kept Federer competitive? Why is Australia failing its cyclists? With increasingly frequent reports of cyclists being injured or killed on Australian roads, the cycling community is asking what governments and Cycling Australia, the peak body, should be doing.

      "body": "<h2>Frenchman\u2019s beach, North Stradbroke Island, Queensland</h2> <p>Picking a favourite beach, and telling the world, is a risky proposition. No one wants their secret spot overrun by an army of gawkers wielding Lonely Planet guides and taking pictures with tablets. You know the sort. They\u2019ve already ruined some of the country\u2019s best swimming holes \u2013 Florence Falls in the Top End is a beautiful remote waterhole where you can swim underneath the waterfall and hear the serene sounds of drunk backpackers blasting crap music.</p> <p>There\u2019s no such risk opening up about Straddie. First, because it\u2019s the worst-kept secret in south-east Queensland. It\u2019s beloved by Brisbanites, and for more reasons than because we don\u2019t really have a proper beach to call our own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2019/jan/14/australias-best-beaches-poll-vote-for-your-top-seaside-spots\">Australia's best beaches poll: vote for your top seaside spots</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But more important, there\u2019s no risk of North Stradbroke Island being overrun. At popular times there\u2019s barely any room on the ferry; barely a spare bedroom on the island, but it still has parts that seem an ocean away from the city.</p> <p>Growing up near Newcastle, I loved Birubi beach at the end of Stockton bight; it was a great surf spot, opening into miles of dunes and national parks. Over on Straddie, Frenchman\u2019s beach is the only other place on earth that pulls off the same vibe. The surf can be stunning. But the place mostly feels untamed; wild waves and wildlife, on a strip of sand bordered by bushland and rocky bluffs. \u2013 <em>Ben Smee</em></p> <h2>Greenfield beach, Jervis Bay, NSW</h2> <p>My favourite beach used to be Hyams at Jervis Bay.</p> <p>The white sand and azure water are so bright it looks like a touched up postcard from the Caribbean, almost too perfect to be true. But it\u2019s backed by Australian bushland, with noisy crickets and birdsong.</p> <p>The view across Jervis Bay to the lighthouse on Point Perpendicular is mesmerising and, being inside the bay, the waves are soothing rather than challenging, big enough for children\u2019s boogie-boarding, but small enough to remove the anxiety from parental supervision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83ae1626339b85f23e35bb40f86d5dff87d24a24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83ae1626339b85f23e35bb40f86d5dff87d24a24/0_0_2000_1300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greenfields beach, Jervis Bay national park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fewer people \u2026 for now: Greenfields beach, Jervis Bay national park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NSW Government</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve seen dolphins on almost every visit, and on a few occasions, breaching whales.</p> <p>The beach is so beautiful it must have made it into tourist guides in many languages, because now it is also quite crowded, with parking lot traffic jams and queues for the toilets.</p> <p>I know the whole point of Australian beaches is that they are free to be enjoyed by all. I hate the way Europeans have to pay for a brolly and a beach chair, or the idea that my enjoyment should be contingent on wishing that others would stay away. But the Hyams Christmas crowds weren\u2019t great for relaxing, so my new favourite beach is Greenfield.</p> <p>As the crow flies, it\u2019s just around the corner. But it is accessed through nearby Vincentia rather than from the township of Hyams.</p> <p>Same colours, same bushland backdrop with ferns and scribbly gums, same vista across the the lighthouse, better barbecues and picnic tables, more shade and ... fewer people. For now. \u2013 <em>Lenore Taylor</em></p> <h2><strong>Mosman-Leighton dog beach, Perth, WA</strong></h2> <p>Is there any happier sight than dozens of dogs bounding along the sand and plunging dopily into the sea?</p> <p>Mosman and north Leighton dog beach is a 2km stretch in Fremantle between Port and Cottesloe beaches. While Cottesloe will always be popular, with its grassy knolls, white sand, and nearby fish and chips shop and pub, Mosman-Leighton dog beach has equally beautiful sea and sand but is more laid-back, despite also being busy with a less touristy crowd of pooches and their owners.</p> <p>Other major cities <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/why-we-should-look-after-dogs-20180626-p4znwn.html\">don\u2019t seem to have worked</a> out the balance between sharing beaches between people <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/whose-offleash-dog-beach-is-it-anyway-answer-not-your-dogs-20171009-gywu1g.html\">and their four-legged friends</a>. In Sydney, dogs may run on the grass near some beaches, and swim in a few reserves or coves. But they are banned from almost all beaches and owners have to go for a bit of a drive to find a dog-friendly one. In Perth and Fremantle, it\u2019s no big deal, with a variety of dog beach options close to the cities. Dogs frolic up and down the sand off-leash, stealing each other\u2019s tennis balls and bounding into the large mounds of seaweed often found on the sand at Mosman-Leighton. People pick up after them, and plenty of swimmers, kite surfers and children enjoy the dog beach too.</p> <p>Mosman-Leighton is special because of its combination of crystal blue sea, white sand, well-behaved dogs and owners, and closeness to the bustle of Fremantle. The waves at Port beach, a little further south, can be rough, but Mosman-Leighton has long, shallow stretches of water ideal for just getting feet wet while walking, or paws wet for those dogs afraid of the deeper seas. It\u2019s also a pristine walk \u2013 the water and the sky on a summer day are always beautiful, the blue seeming to stretch on forever. On a classic Perth scorcher it\u2019s always worth heading there early in the morning, when the water will already be warm but the sun less intense.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t have a dog, there\u2019s no shortage of people willing to offer theirs up for a pat. After seeing dogs of all shapes and sizes goofing around in their beach bliss, it\u2019s impossible to leave Mosman-Leighton without feeling a bit of joy. \u2013 <em>Melissa Davey</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/14/best-beaches-poll-what-tickles-your-fancy-when-land-meets-sea\">Best beaches poll: what tickles your fancy when land meets sea?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Nightcliff beach, Darwin, NT</h2> <p>Picking a favourite beach is a thankless act which will please almost no one and invite only scorn, so I might as well go for broke and choose one I can\u2019t even swim at.</p> <p>For six months of the year you can\u2019t swim at Darwin\u2019s Nightcliff beach at all \u2013 there are box jellyfish and probably crocs in the water. During the other six, only the jellyfish disappear, while the crocs remain. A quick dip or jump off the jetty has an extra thrill.</p> <p>There are personal reasons behind my choice. Nightcliff is where I sat and first realised I could make the town my home, where I ran to for a comforting horizon on one of my worst days, and where I sheltered under a tree during a monsoonal storm giggling with an old friend.</p> <p>But there are universal ones too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d118c6547d061c6da2a8a33bc355435c83b05ea9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d118c6547d061c6da2a8a33bc355435c83b05ea9/0_0_4860_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Purple sunset sky through the mangroves at Nightcliff beach, Darwin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Oversaturated colour\u2019: purple sunset sky through the mangroves at Nightcliff beach, Darwin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Denton Photography/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For one, it\u2019s stunning. The red cliffs, pale sand, turquoise tropical water and bright green pandanus blind you with oversaturated colour. Sunsets over the Timor Sea can be so heartbreakingly beautiful that people will talk about them the next day with an enthusiasm usually reserved for an exceptional game of footy.</p> <p>In the wet season, cyclones kick up a wild and muddy chop, drawing in starved surfers, whose loved ones line the cliff\u2019s edge on croc watch. Once, as we watched the surf pack take on the rubbish waves, a dark shape appeared behind them. But rather than something to fear, it was a solitary dolphin, which spent the afternoon swimming laps behind the break, like a bodyguard for the nervous boardriders, at a beach we\u2019re not supposed to swim in but can\u2019t stay away from. \u2013 <em>Helen Davidson</em></p> <h2>St Kilda beach, Melbourne, Victoria</h2> <p>A disclosure: I don\u2019t like the beach. I prefer to maintain a respectful distance from both the ocean and the creatures in it that want to kill me and, like Anakin Skywalker, I don\u2019t like sand.

      "bodyText": "Frenchman\u2019s beach, North Stradbroke Island, Queensland Picking a favourite beach, and telling the world, is a risky proposition. No one wants their secret spot overrun by an army of gawkers wielding Lonely Planet guides and taking pictures with tablets. You know the sort. They\u2019ve already ruined some of the country\u2019s best swimming holes \u2013 Florence Falls in the Top End is a beautiful remote waterhole where you can swim underneath the waterfall and hear the serene sounds of drunk backpackers blasting crap music. There\u2019s no such risk opening up about Straddie. First, because it\u2019s the worst-kept secret in south-east Queensland. It\u2019s beloved by Brisbanites, and for more reasons than because we don\u2019t really have a proper beach to call our own. But more important, there\u2019s no risk of North Stradbroke Island being overrun. At popular times there\u2019s barely any room on the ferry; barely a spare bedroom on the island, but it still has parts that seem an ocean away from the city. Growing up near Newcastle, I loved Birubi beach at the end of Stockton bight; it was a great surf spot, opening into miles of dunes and national parks. Over on Straddie, Frenchman\u2019s beach is the only other place on earth that pulls off the same vibe. The surf can be stunning. But the place mostly feels untamed; wild waves and wildlife, on a strip of sand bordered by bushland and rocky bluffs. \u2013 Ben Smee Greenfield beach, Jervis Bay, NSW My favourite beach used to be Hyams at Jervis Bay. The white sand and azure water are so bright it looks like a touched up postcard from the Caribbean, almost too perfect to be true. But it\u2019s backed by Australian bushland, with noisy crickets and birdsong. The view across Jervis Bay to the lighthouse on Point Perpendicular is mesmerising and, being inside the bay, the waves are soothing rather than challenging, big enough for children\u2019s boogie-boarding, but small enough to remove the anxiety from parental supervision. I\u2019ve seen dolphins on almost every visit, and on a few occasions, breaching whales. The beach is so beautiful it must have made it into tourist guides in many languages, because now it is also quite crowded, with parking lot traffic jams and queues for the toilets. I know the whole point of Australian beaches is that they are free to be enjoyed by all. I hate the way Europeans have to pay for a brolly and a beach chair, or the idea that my enjoyment should be contingent on wishing that others would stay away. But the Hyams Christmas crowds weren\u2019t great for relaxing, so my new favourite beach is Greenfield. As the crow flies, it\u2019s just around the corner. But it is accessed through nearby Vincentia rather than from the township of Hyams. Same colours, same bushland backdrop with ferns and scribbly gums, same vista across the the lighthouse, better barbecues and picnic tables, more shade and ... fewer people. For now. \u2013 Lenore Taylor Mosman-Leighton dog beach, Perth, WA Is there any happier sight than dozens of dogs bounding along the sand and plunging dopily into the sea? Mosman and north Leighton dog beach is a 2km stretch in Fremantle between Port and Cottesloe beaches. While Cottesloe will always be popular, with its grassy knolls, white sand, and nearby fish and chips shop and pub, Mosman-Leighton dog beach has equally beautiful sea and sand but is more laid-back, despite also being busy with a less touristy crowd of pooches and their owners. Other major cities don\u2019t seem to have worked out the balance between sharing beaches between people and their four-legged friends. In Sydney, dogs may run on the grass near some beaches, and swim in a few reserves or coves. But they are banned from almost all beaches and owners have to go for a bit of a drive to find a dog-friendly one. In Perth and Fremantle, it\u2019s no big deal, with a variety of dog beach options close to the cities. Dogs frolic up and down the sand off-leash, stealing each other\u2019s tennis balls and bounding into the large mounds of seaweed often found on the sand at Mosman-Leighton. People pick up after them, and plenty of swimmers, kite surfers and children enjoy the dog beach too. Mosman-Leighton is special because of its combination of crystal blue sea, white sand, well-behaved dogs and owners, and closeness to the bustle of Fremantle. The waves at Port beach, a little further south, can be rough, but Mosman-Leighton has long, shallow stretches of water ideal for just getting feet wet while walking, or paws wet for those dogs afraid of the deeper seas. It\u2019s also a pristine walk \u2013 the water and the sky on a summer day are always beautiful, the blue seeming to stretch on forever. On a classic Perth scorcher it\u2019s always worth heading there early in the morning, when the water will already be warm but the sun less intense. If you don\u2019t have a dog, there\u2019s no shortage of people willing to offer theirs up for a pat. After seeing dogs of all shapes and sizes goofing around in their beach bliss, it\u2019s impossible to leave Mosman-Leighton without feeling a bit of joy. \u2013 Melissa Davey Nightcliff beach, Darwin, NT Picking a favourite beach is a thankless act which will please almost no one and invite only scorn, so I might as well go for broke and choose one I can\u2019t even swim at. For six months of the year you can\u2019t swim at Darwin\u2019s Nightcliff beach at all \u2013 there are box jellyfish and probably crocs in the water. During the other six, only the jellyfish disappear, while the crocs remain. A quick dip or jump off the jetty has an extra thrill. There are personal reasons behind my choice. Nightcliff is where I sat and first realised I could make the town my home, where I ran to for a comforting horizon on one of my worst days, and where I sheltered under a tree during a monsoonal storm giggling with an old friend. But there are universal ones too. For one, it\u2019s stunning. The red cliffs, pale sand, turquoise tropical water and bright green pandanus blind you with oversaturated colour. Sunsets over the Timor Sea can be so heartbreakingly beautiful that people will talk about them the next day with an enthusiasm usually reserved for an exceptional game of footy. In the wet season, cyclones kick up a wild and muddy chop, drawing in starved surfers, whose loved ones line the cliff\u2019s edge on croc watch. Once, as we watched the surf pack take on the rubbish waves, a dark shape appeared behind them. But rather than something to fear, it was a solitary dolphin, which spent the afternoon swimming laps behind the break, like a bodyguard for the nervous boardriders, at a beach we\u2019re not supposed to swim in but can\u2019t stay away from. \u2013 Helen Davidson St Kilda beach, Melbourne, Victoria A disclosure: I don\u2019t like the beach. I prefer to maintain a respectful distance from both the ocean and the creatures in it that want to kill me and, like Anakin Skywalker, I don\u2019t like sand. Sitting at the beach is a thoroughly boring way to spend the day. But none of these concerns apply at St Kilda beach because you do not go there when you want to go to the beach. You go to walk along the esplanade or have a coffee or look at the little penguins (penguins! In a city!) or to stand in protest to a neo-Nazi rally. It does not matter that I am terrified of the water or that the water here feels considerably more oily than regular water because, based on the not-infrequent warnings from the Environmental Protection Authority, I probably shouldn\u2019t swim there anyway. Instead it is a perfect place to stroll along, look at all the families and tourists unaccountably enjoying the sand, and witness the many shades of terracotta a British backpacker can turn when let outside without SPF50. Plus, Paul Kelly (kind of) wrote a song about it. \u2013 Calla Wahlquist Emu Bay, Kangaroo Island, South Australia Why did no one ever tell me, a New South Wales native, that the best beaches were in South Australia? After years of hearing people sing the praises of Bondi, Manly, Whale beach, Jervis Bay, Byron and the rest, I had come to assume that barring a couple of notable Queensland and Western Australian exceptions, NSW beaches were the cream of the crop.

      "body": "<p>This year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery, or invention, of the periodic table of the elements, one of the most important, if least dramatic, of all scientific breakthroughs. Chemistry has a bad reputation among non-chemists, perhaps because it is the first place in science where a schoolchild comes up against the stubborn complexity of nature. The organising principles of physics appear simple; evolution makes biology appear a well-ordered process, at least until it\u2019s examined in detail. But chemistry is awkward and lumpy. There are endless facts to memorise, and there are few obvious and intuitively pleasing answers to questions such as why the periodic table has eight columns and not seven or nine. There is not even a hero figure like Darwin, Newton or Einstein whose story can dramatise our understanding of the subject. If there were, it would be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev\" title=\"\">Dmitri Mendeleev</a>, the Russian who first organised the known elements into an arrangement which not only fitted them together but had predictive value: it suggested new elements that might be discovered, and what their qualities would be.</p> <p>This was not a complete theoretical understanding, but it exposed the phenomena which a theory must explain. In some sense the elements had been known since gold was first washed out of gravel, long before writing was invented. But the existence of some simple and apparently irreducible kinds of stuff did not prove and might not even imply that every substance in the world was made from simpler elements combined. The idea that water is really the combination of two gases, themselves never found in a pure state in nature, seems entirely fanciful until it is proved by experiment. In the 18th century, following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier\" title=\"\">Antoine Lavoisier</a>, chemists began to isolate more and more elements from the apparent chaos around them. But their qualities and modes of reaction formed no discernible pattern. The discovery of this pattern and the development of its implications was Mendeleev\u2019s great contribution.</p> <p>The periodic table made possible the modern industrial world. It didn\u2019t just break down the world into its constituents; it supplied the knowledge needed to recombine these elements in new ways, from fertiliser to poison gas, from medicines to plastic. One of the remarkable things about this is that it worked even without a proper theoretical foundation. Not until 1913, when the British scientist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Moseley\" title=\"\">Henry Moseley</a> fired x-rays, then newly discovered, at elements and measured what came off, was it apparent how the underlying structure of atoms produced the qualities we detect in the elements.</p> <p>X-rays were only the start of the merger of chemistry with physics. At the extreme edge of present-day science lies the creation of new elements that can only be produced artificially: the most recent, <a href=\"http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/118/oganesson\" title=\"\">oganesson</a>, has only been observed as six short-lived atoms. But long before then, chemical analysis and understanding had been turned inwards, on to the bodies of living things. These techniques, widely available, make it possible to understand all the processes of life as interlocking reactions which can be tweaked to our advantage.</p> <p>One effect of this is that chemistry as a distinct subject tends to disappear. At the simplest level, it merges with physics; at its most complex it becomes a tool of biology. In both cases, chemistry, like all other science, is increasingly conducted inside computer simulations. But the depth and subtlety of the periodic table stands as one of the most remarkable feats of the human intellect.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This year marks the 150th anniversary of the discovery, or invention, of the periodic table of the elements, one of the most important, if least dramatic, of all scientific breakthroughs. Chemistry has a bad reputation among non-chemists, perhaps because it is the first place in science where a schoolchild comes up against the stubborn complexity of nature. The organising principles of physics appear simple; evolution makes biology appear a well-ordered process, at least until it\u2019s examined in detail. But chemistry is awkward and lumpy. There are endless facts to memorise, and there are few obvious and intuitively pleasing answers to questions such as why the periodic table has eight columns and not seven or nine. There is not even a hero figure like Darwin, Newton or Einstein whose story can dramatise our understanding of the subject. If there were, it would be Dmitri Mendeleev, the Russian who first organised the known elements into an arrangement which not only fitted them together but had predictive value: it suggested new elements that might be discovered, and what their qualities would be. This was not a complete theoretical understanding, but it exposed the phenomena which a theory must explain. In some sense the elements had been known since gold was first washed out of gravel, long before writing was invented. But the existence of some simple and apparently irreducible kinds of stuff did not prove and might not even imply that every substance in the world was made from simpler elements combined. The idea that water is really the combination of two gases, themselves never found in a pure state in nature, seems entirely fanciful until it is proved by experiment. In the 18th century, following Antoine Lavoisier, chemists began to isolate more and more elements from the apparent chaos around them. But their qualities and modes of reaction formed no discernible pattern. The discovery of this pattern and the development of its implications was Mendeleev\u2019s great contribution. The periodic table made possible the modern industrial world. It didn\u2019t just break down the world into its constituents; it supplied the knowledge needed to recombine these elements in new ways, from fertiliser to poison gas, from medicines to plastic. One of the remarkable things about this is that it worked even without a proper theoretical foundation. Not until 1913, when the British scientist Henry Moseley fired x-rays, then newly discovered, at elements and measured what came off, was it apparent how the underlying structure of atoms produced the qualities we detect in the elements. X-rays were only the start of the merger of chemistry with physics. At the extreme edge of present-day science lies the creation of new elements that can only be produced artificially: the most recent, oganesson, has only been observed as six short-lived atoms. But long before then, chemical analysis and understanding had been turned inwards, on to the bodies of living things. These techniques, widely available, make it possible to understand all the processes of life as interlocking reactions which can be tweaked to our advantage. One effect of this is that chemistry as a distinct subject tends to disappear. At the simplest level, it merges with physics; at its most complex it becomes a tool of biology. In both cases, chemistry, like all other science, is increasingly conducted inside computer simulations. But the depth and subtlety of the periodic table stands as one of the most remarkable feats of the human intellect.",

How much longer the Norwegian remains in caretaker charge remains to be seen after edging out Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Spurs. Paul Pogba was majestic in a superb first-half performance, though they had to work hard to hold on in the second and, ultimately, had the unbeatable David de Gea to thank for a series of classy saves. A worry for Spurs fans at the death too, with Harry Kane shaking his head and limping with what looks like a groin or hamstring problem. He was grounded for a while after the full-time whistle. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a208c8cf6d006a95898e556e2666faf75a8a3dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a208c8cf6d006a95898e556e2666faf75a8a3dd/0_0_3500_2439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer celebrates at the end of the match after Manchester United win 1-0.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer celebrates at the end of the match after Manchester United win 1-0.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-13T18:33:26.067Z\">at 6.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c3b81bee4b0cebe761857e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-13T18:22:28.844Z\">6.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90+4 min: </strong>There is almost a late sting in the tail for United, but Kane cannot reach Llorente\u2019s lofted through ball.

The Norwegian boasts a 100% record since replacing Jose Mourinho, seemingly transforming United from a nervous wreck, ready to crumble at any given moment, into an invincible force, with Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford, in particular, reborn. United should feel refreshed after a warm-weather training camp in Dubai, while victory would see Solskj\u00e6r match Sir Matt Busby\u2019s record of winning his first five matches in charge. At the moment, everything Solskj\u00e6r touches turns to gold and there is no doubting victory against Spurs would further boost his credentials for the gig on a permanent basis. But, with everybody pointing the finger at this match, quite how special Solskj\u00e6r and this United team is will come under the microscope against one of the best teams in the division in Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur. It is a showdown of sorts between one manager who really could not make it any clearer that he wants the job at Old Trafford and one who is remaining intriguingly tight-lipped. Tottenham will be desperate to hush United\u2019s strides under Solskj\u00e6r but, at the same time and, privately at least, probably wish Pochettino could steer Spurs to a masterclass against different opposition. As for United, they must find a way of keeping Harry Kane quiet. \u201cHe\u2019s not bad, is he?\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said of the England captain. \u201cHe is a fantastic goalscorer, one of the best in the world. It looks like he never misses chances really. We have to make sure he doesn\u2019t get any.\u201d In terms of team news, Spurs will call upon the in-form Son Heung-min for the final time before the South Korea forward joins up with his country at the Asian Cup, though the midfielder Eric Dier is still sidelined after appendix surgery. Chris Smalling is doubtful for United.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>4.30pm (GMT)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-mauricio-pochettino-manchester-united-tottenham\">Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r pits wits against Mauricio Pochettino in first big test</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-13T15:01:46.925Z\">at 3.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company. Read David Hytner\u2019s match report: Paul Pogba speaks and, believe it or not, says Rashford\u2019s goal was straight off the training ground. \u201cIt was very important to win because it was a big test and we carry on our winning run,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a great ball but we have been training on this. We were preparing this, we knew it would be a very difficult game and we knew that we could hurt them on the counterattacks. It is what we were working on last week, they have patterns they are used to doing and we knew that it was the key to create chances. Marcus made a great run and I tried to give him the perfect pass and he helped. We are all enjoying playing together.\u201d Asked what\u2019s changed under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, Pogba replies: \u201cUm, I would say I am enjoying, I am enjoying playing football. It was really difficult with the system, the tactics that we used to play. I like to play more attacking, pressing and play high, and I missed the lucidity when I had to defend. Defending is not my best attribute. I think my position [today] is where I feel most comfortable. The manager has told me to get in the box and score goals, and the best example is Frank Lampard, who scored a lot of goals and got chances.\u201d A couple of post-match stats to indulge in, via Opta: \u2022 Manchester United were eight points behind Arsenal when Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r became their caretaker manager on 19 December but are now level on points \u2022 The only top-flight league match in which David de Gea has made more saves than he did versus Tottenham Hotspur today (11) was against Arsenal at the Emirates on 2 December 2017 (14) \u2022 David de Gea made 11 saves for Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur today; the most saves he\u2019s made in a top-flight league match without conceding a goal Some Manchester United reaction. David de Gea, who made 11 fine saves, says: \u201cThe manager has brought some happiness, the team is very strong now and we know how to control the games and create chances. It is very good for us, it is the real Manchester United. We controlled the first half but in the second they put a lot of pressure but we defended well and got the three points. It was a great game, we are very, very happy.\u201d Marcus Rashford, the goalscorer, adds: \u201cThis was the hardest we have had to work for a result [under Solskj\u00e6r]. We played a slightly different system but against a team like this it was needed. We prepared different, the tactics changed but to beat the top teams you have to adapt.\u201d Marcus Rashford\u2019s brilliant goal is the difference at Wembley. The feelgood factor rolls under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, who has matched Sir Matt Busby\u2019s record of winning his first five league games in charge. In all competitions, United have won six on the bounce since Solskj\u00e6r was handed the reins on an interim basis. How much longer the Norwegian remains in caretaker charge remains to be seen after edging out Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Spurs. Paul Pogba was majestic in a superb first-half performance, though they had to work hard to hold on in the second and, ultimately, had the unbeatable David de Gea to thank for a series of classy saves. A worry for Spurs fans at the death too, with Harry Kane shaking his head and limping with what looks like a groin or hamstring problem. He was grounded for a while after the full-time whistle. 90+4 min: There is almost a late sting in the tail for United, but Kane cannot reach Llorente\u2019s lofted through ball. Spurs have been aching for an equaliser, but United are very nearly there. A fifth straight win is seconds away from their grasp. 90+4 min: United clear their lines. Can they cling on? 90+3 min: Shaw does really well to block Trippier\u2019s low ball into the box as Spurs get everybody forward. Lamela will swing in the corner ... 90+2 min: Paul Pogba is replaced by Scott McTominay. 90+1 min: Herrera has a timely bout of cramp. Luke Shaw gives him a helping hand, after the Spaniard had played in Lukaku, whose shot was blocked by Davies. 90 min: There will be a minimum of four minutes added time. 89 min: Llorente spurns a golden opportunity! He actually does really well to take the sting out of the cross from the right with his first touch, before prodding at goal with his second. De Gea watches it all the way and cradles the ball like a newborn baby. Llorente has his head in his hands but it was not a sitter. 88 min: It\u2019s attack v defence, Spurs v United. 86 min: Another instinctive stop by David de Gea! Llorente did well, cushioning a header into the path of Kane just inside the edge of the box. When Kane wriggled away from Lindelof to earn himself a yard of space, he powered at goal but de Gea was equal to it once more, with his right foot this time sweeping away the danger. There will be few arguments over the man of the match. 85 min: It\u2019s kitchen-sink time. United are camped inside their own half. 83 min: A plucky foul by Rashford gifts Spurs a free-kick deep inside their own half but Tottenham cannot make the most of it. Ander Herrera cuts the ball out with a cute interception before Alderweireld returns the favour, with United winning a free-kick which David de Gea will wallop downfield. 82 min: Llorente, just on, is pulled up for a foul on Ashley Young. United attempt to calm things down, with Dalot replacing Jesse Lingard, who had just walked to the very far side of the Wembley pitch. Lovely stuff. 80 min: Fernando Llorente replaces Harry Winks. Down in the United dugout, Mike Phelan reacts and orders Diego Dalot to be readied. 78 min: Fed up and frustrated at Spurs\u2019 failure to breach United\u2019s back line, Harry Kane rushes an effort at goal and it sails towards Row Z. 77 min: Dele Alli is grounded after a poor tackle by Pogba, whose left boot was very high. The United midfielder vehemently disagrees and is booked for kicking the ball away. A touch of petulance after his magnificence a little earlier. 75 min: Solskj\u00e6r is deep in conversation with Mike Phelan, frantically trying to work-up a plan to stop Eriksen wreaking further havoc. 74 min: Another chance for Spurs, another David de Gea save. Christian Eriksen crafted the opening, lofting a cute pass in for Dele Alli but the midfielder cannot beat the United goalkeeper. After composing himself, nudging the ball on to his right foot, Alli failed to wrap the ball into either corner, instead powering the ball towards the centre of de Gea\u2019s goal. And, of course, the United goalkeeper inevitably repelled his effort. Spurs have done everything but score. 73 min: Solksjaer summons Lukaku in place of Martial. United appear to have switched to a 4-3-3, with Lukaku flanked by Rashford and Lingard. 71 min: Yet another fine stop by de Gea, this time from Harry Kane\u2019s curled free-kick. This was a more routine stop, but nevertheless. 70 min: De Gea with an absolutely sublime save! The goalkeeper keeps Alderweireld\u2019s effort out at the near post, clearing the ball with his left leg. The Spurs defender did well, beating Rashford to Trippier\u2019s corner. But then it was all about whether de Gea could do anything about it \u2013 and the United keeper came up trumps. Again. He has been in inspired form. 69 min: And now Son has a go, but Lingard blocks his effort. The ball loops away for a Spurs corner as the hosts continue to pile on the pressure. 68 min: Eriksen plays a neat give-and-go with Harry Kane but the striker cannot get his feet sorted or fashion an effort at goal. Spurs are beginning to turn it on. 66 min: Eriksen has a pop, but his right-footed effort drops a couple of yards wide of the post. Spurs have gone through the gears a bit and are looking much more dangerous. As for United, they could do with taking some of the heat out of this game. 65 min: De Gea with another great save! Kane frees Dele Alli but, with Nemanja Matic for company, he fires straight at the Manchester United goalkeeper. United survive and then Ander Herrera hauls down Eriksen on the edge of the box. Spurs win a free-kick, 25 yards from goal. It\u2019s Eriksen and Trippier territory. 64 min: Spurs pour forward, but Eriksen\u2019s shot from distance is too ambitious. 63 min: Vertonghen lashes a high ball straight out of play, causing Pochettino to grimace. But United fail to seize the territory and Spurs counter ... 61 min: Lloris prevents Pogba from doubling United\u2019s lead. The midfielder powers a venomous effort goalwards but the Spurs captain is equal to it, despite the ball taking a nick off Ben Davies. It was brilliant buildup play by Anthony Martial who unselfishly drove into the box before centring the ball to tee up his team-mate. 60 min: Lamela must do better \u2013 the Argentine ends up shouldering the ball out play instead of burying a header beyond de Gea. The ball in was again clever by Trippier but after Kane failed to reach it, there was Lamela behind him, though the Spurs substitute seemed to be caught cold. 58 min: De Gea saves from Kane\u2019s header! Spurs pass up another opportunity as Kane nods his header into the ground after beating Phil Jones at the front post. A quick corner by Lamela fooled United, with Eriksen\u2019s delivery as wicked as ever. Kane does well, but is punished for making too clean a contact if anything. De Gea with another instinctive save, but he will feel it was a routine one. 57 min: Spurs pressure United into a mistake, as Young slides a wayward pass out of play. Tottenham try to conjure up an equaliser, with Eriksen winning a corner out of Pogba, who does well tracking his man after Trippier freed the Dane. 55 min: Another alert stop by Lloris! Pogba follows up on his own shot, rampaging through on goal after his initial shot was blocked by Alderweireld. It was not pretty but Pogba bulldozed his way through, before outmuscling Jan Vertonghen to dink an effort over the goalkeeper. Lloris is equal to it, though. 54 min: An almighty \u201cCome on you Spurs!\u201d echoes around Wembley as United patiently probe in search of an opening. Ashley Young has had a busy start to this second half, at both ends. 53 min: Lloris handles Pogba\u2019s header! It was a lovely cross by Young, whose corner was headed away by Davies. When the ball came back in, Pogba held his ground to power at goal, but in the end his effort is too tame to trouble Lloris. The Spurs goalkeeper gathers and back come United, via Shaw. 52 min: Pogba buys a corner out of Ben Davies ... 51 min: Davies clatters into the back of Ashley Young, and United win a free-kick deep inside their own half. Eriksen and Alli are beginning to pull the strings for Spurs, though. Tottenham have started this second half far sleeker. 49 min: And now de Gea saves from Dele Alli! The midfielder rises highest to meet Trippier\u2019s hanging ball and the Manchester United goalkeeper gets down well low to his left to push the ball away with both hands. This is much better, much crisper from Tottenham. Alli then scythes down Pogba on halfway, earning United a little respite. Whatever Pochettino said at half-time, it seems to have worked. 48 min: De Gea makes a superb save to deny Harry Kane! It was a wonderful move by Tottenham, who carved open the United defence, with Alli fizzing in a cute pass into the striker after intricate play with Son. Kane eludes Phil Jones but a brilliant stop by de Gea denies the England skipper with his feet. 47 min: United break forward nicely, with Lingard helping the ball on neatly. But Martial cannot fashion a clear-cut chance. 46 min: Lingard gets the second half under way. Spurs seem to have switched formation, with Eriksen joining Winks deep in midfield. Some half-time reading before the restart at Wembley: An intriguing half-time stat for your perusal, courtesy of Opta: no player has been involved in more Premier League goals since Solskj\u00e6r became caretaker manager at Manchester United than Paul Pogba (eight \u2013 four goals, four assists). A stunning goal by Marcus Rashford is the difference at the break, with United taking a deserved lead on the brink of the interval. But, as much as the finish was coolness personified, Paul Pogba\u2019s architected pass made it. Pogba had a quick look up before curling an exquisite pass into Rashford, who did the rest without breaking sweat. Tottenham\u2019s performance has been a little half-hearted, while United look hungry to extend their run of four consecutive league wins. They look slick on the break and, simply, really in the mood to do damage. Plenty of food for thought for Pochettino, whose side have been second-best. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. The delirious United fans will serenade their team throughout the next 120 seconds or so. It\u2019s an incisive finish, but what a devastating world-class ball into Marcus Rashford by Paul Pogba. From inside his own half, the Frenchman bends a wonderful, irresistible searching through ball into the path of Rashford, who steadies himself before firing across goal beyond Lloris. It has been a brilliant first-half by Manchester United. Rashford scores for the third Premier League game in a row. A brilliant, cool finish by the striker. 43 min: Erik Lamela replaces the injured Moussa Sissoko. 42 min: Trippier makes a brilliant challenge on Anthony Martial, and then Frenchman retaliates after the Tottenham defender refuses to lash the ball out of play after Sissoko goes to ground once more. It\u2019s handbags, and Mike Dean\u2019s soon along to hoover up any bad energy. 40 min: Sissoko looked a spent force, but the powerful action man is back on the pitch to a warm ovation from the home faithful. He is limping, though. 39 min: Sissoko is intent on running it off. Let\u2019s see. 38 min: Ah! Moussa Sissoko is down, appearing to strain his hamstring or groin after switching on the afterburners to leave Luke Shaw in his wake. Sissoko winces and he looks in trouble, with Spurs summoning Oliver Skipp to warm up. 37 min: A swell of boos from home supporters as David de Gea takes an age to take a goal-kick. Time-wasting, already? United have got a bit sloppy in midfield. Up in the posh seats, Dimitar Berbatov is sat alongside Ledley King. 35 min: Kane does well to flash a ball across the box but Spurs have nobody there to meet it. The striker managed to hold off Lindelof before forcing the ball across goal. Alli and Eriksen arrived too late. 34 min: Harry Winks lets fly from distance \u2013 and it sails miles over. But this is much better from Spurs, who appear more confident after a cagey start. 33 min: Young slows things down from a throw-in, as United attempt to steal back control. Pogba and co have undoubtedly been stifled in the last few minutes. 32 min: Spurs seemed to have hushed United in the last 10 minutes or so, with Eriksen, Son and Kane growing into the game. United are being forced to repel Spurs more often now. 30 min: Kane has the ball in the net \u2013 but his goal\u2019s disallowed! Trippier plays a delightful ball in towards the back post, where Dele Alli meets it, with the ball bobbling goalwards off his knee. At that point, Kane gets involved, prodding home but, before he has the chance to wheel away, the linesman\u2019s flag halts celebrations. It all stemmed from a silly foul, a tug at the shirt, by Matic on Son on halfway. He has not been involved too often, but when he has, Trippier has been lethal. 28 min: Kane takes an age to free Ben Davies down the left. When Davies eventually picks it up, he nudges the ball inside to Son, who slaloms beyond Matic before teeing up Eriksen, whose shot is blocked. And then frankly every Spurs player has a go, but United stand firm before Son is flagged offside second time round. United\u2019s appetite to quickly quell the slightest whiff of danger is clear. 26 min: Moussa Sissoko does well to niggle back at Pogba and nick the ball away. The Spurs midfielder has grown into this team in recent weeks and months; he has been one of their most consistent performers of late. 25 min: Spurs, so often dominant in possession, have been made to work really hard for the ball. They are not having it all their own way, far from it, with United looking deadly on the counter. It is easy to see why Solksjaer opted for pace over power \u2013 and Rashford over Romelu Lukaku \u2013 on this evidence. 23 min: Spurs dance into the six-yard box \u2013 but Alli gets caught in two minds at the crucial moment. Eriksen kickstarted the move, spreading the ball out to Son, via Ben Davies. Son has certainly been lively when involved so far. The forward jinked inside and then out before feeding Alli, who drove towards the byline. But Alli ends up trickling a ball into Kane which is eventually cleared. Trippier delivers the corner, but Kane\u2019s shot cannot breach the crowd of United shirts. And United will counter through Rashford. 21 min: United look a different beast to a few weeks ago, fizzing the ball about with confidence. They are quietly probing, with Spurs struggling to get close enough to panic United. Rashford, over the top, looks a real threat. 19 min: Davies and Lindelof collide, but it is just a coming together. Spurs have not seen quite so much of the ball after making an early impression. 18 min: Harry Kane clears the United corner as Spurs pull everyone back to get their house in order. United, fresh from a Dubai camp, look full of energy. There is no bus in sight. 16 min: Matic slides in Rashford \u2013 but is flagged offside. The forward failed to hold his run, after eluding the Spurs defence who do look vulnerable. They seem unsure who should be marking who, with Vertonghen and Davies looking at one another to pick up the pieces. And now United win another corner after Martial forces a save out of Lloris from an acute angle. United are in the mood. 15 min: Young\u2019s cross flies into the heart of the Spurs six-yard box but Sissoko clears. Spurs attempt to get back on track but United seize back possession. Pogba, Herrera and Matic are winning the midfield battle at present. 14 min: And now Pogba buys United a corner out of Alderweireld ... 13 min: United are suddenly in on the counter again, this time through Martial after Matic cleared Trippier\u2019s corner. Ben Davies climbed highest but could not direct a header on target. United look electric on the break, though Martial failed to control the ball after being released by a revved-up Rashford. 12 min: End-to-end stuff, with Son teeing up Trippier to deliver another cross. Spurs have to settle for a corner ... 11 min: Lloris saves comfortably from Rashford! United pour forward again and, slipped in down the channel on the counter, Rashford is forced wide and, in the end, his effort is relatively tame. No problem for Lloris in the Spurs goal. 10 min: Lingard shoots high and wide! Pogba floated a ball towards the back stick and when Young fizzes it back in, Lingard leans back and drives over after collecting the ball from Toby Alderweireld\u2019s headed clearance. 8 min: Son does superbly \u2013 but Harry Winks drags wide! The Spurs forward is slipped in behind a static Phil Jones with a marvellous sweeping ball by Eriksen and, once he gets to the edge of the 18-yard box, Son does well to hold the ball up before playing a wonderful reverse pass in for Winks, with Jones again left for dead. The Spurs midfielder is one-on-one with David de Gea from the angle, but his execution is ultimately wayward. United survive the resulting corner. That was a warning, if United indeed needed one. 6 min: Kane goes to ground after tangling with Pogba, with the Frenchman lucky not to be pulled up for a clumsy challenge on the striker. Then a collision with Luke Shaw goes against Kane. Manchester United hammer it long in search of Rashford. Solskj\u00e6r jumps down into his technical area, drawing the Wembley arch with his hands, presumably urging the ball to played quicker over the top. 5 min: Eriksen picks the ball up just outside the Spurs half, gets his head up and attempts to slide in Kane down the left. Eriksen frees the England captain but the ball runs a little too quickly for him to latch on to it. Spurs will re-build. 4 min: Spurs build nicely but Trippier thrashes a wild cross-field ball out of touch in search of Ben Davies. Sir Alex Ferguson is among the crowd at Wembley. 3 min: United attempt to float the ball into Jesse Lingard over the top, but Hugo Lloris reads it and smothers. Lingard is playing close to Rashford, as a No 10. 2 min: Kieran Trippier whips in a dangerous cross from the right flank, with the overlap of Moussa Sissoko forcing Luke Shaw to stand off the Spurs full-back. But his delivery is too powerful if anything, flashing beyond Harry Kane at the back post. 1 min: Matic does well to oust Christian Eriksen aside on halfway after Spurs build down the left through Alli and Kane. United snuff it out. Harry Winks gets things started from the centre circle for Spurs. Ashley Young is geeing up his United troops, as he and his team-mates proceed to do the formalities of the pre-match handshakes. The teams are in the tunnel at Wembley. Kick-off is imminent. Solskj\u00e6r speaks. \u201cWe have had a great week training over in Dubai, we had some time to get the tactics right and the principles laid down,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you sign for Manchester United these are the games you look forward to, walking out a Wembley for a final or to play against Spurs, a big team at the moment that are flying. It\u2019s a big challenge for the boys. We are playing against one of the best strikers in the world, you have got Son who is unbelievable and Eriksen is one of the best playmakers around. We have got to defend but we have to attack with balance. The surface does not look the best and we know we have to protect the space behind us.\u201d Pochettino, meanwhile, has been bizarrely effusive about running out at the national stadium. \u201cI think every single game at Wembley is a special occasion to enjoy, the best place in the world to play football, for us. We cannot find any excuses, we need to be ready, we must be ready to challenge Manchester United and I think we are so confident that we are going to match their motivation and freshness. I am not worried.\u201d With Spurs back at Wembley, Mauricio Pochettino has of course been speaking about the need to move into the new White Hart Lane sharpish. Pronto. Their home game against Crystal Palace on 16 March looks the most likely suspect to usher in a new era in north London. \u201cTo move to our new stadium will be massive, massive for our fans,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cI cannot wait to move. I told Daniel [Levy], he always listens and arrives in my office and says \u2018do you know what will be good, to move there or not?\u2019. I said 200% we have to move there as soon as possible.\u201d David de Gea or Hugo Lloris? Paul Pogba or Christian Eriksen in midfield? And Harry Kane or Marcus Rashford up top? Team news news: Romelu Lukaku is named among the substitutes for Manchester United as Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r opts for pace over power, with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial preferred in attack. There are also starts for Jesse Lingard, in for Juan Mata, and Ashley Young. Alexis S\u00e1nchez, meanwhile, is absent altogether, sidelined through injury. For Tottenham, a boost in the shape of Jan Vertonghen, who returns to the Spurs back line after a thigh injury, paired alongside Toby Alderweireld. Ben Davies is favoured to Danny Rose at left-back by Mauricio Pochettino. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Trippier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Davies, Winks, Sissoko, Eriksen, Alli, Son, Kane Subs: Foyth, Lamela, S\u00e1nchez, Rose, Llorente, Gazzaniga, Skipp Manchester United: De Gea, Young, Jones, Lindelof, Shaw, Matic, Herrera, Lingard, Pogba, Martial, Rashford Subs: Romero, Dalot, Pereira, Fred, Mata, McTominay, Lukaku Referee: Mike Dean A trip to Wembley is supposed to provide Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r with his first stern test as caretaker manager of Manchester United, a team who have failed every assignment against top-six opposition so far this season. The Norwegian boasts a 100% record since replacing Jose Mourinho, seemingly transforming United from a nervous wreck, ready to crumble at any given moment, into an invincible force, with Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford, in particular, reborn. United should feel refreshed after a warm-weather training camp in Dubai, while victory would see Solskj\u00e6r match Sir Matt Busby\u2019s record of winning his first five matches in charge. At the moment, everything Solskj\u00e6r touches turns to gold and there is no doubting victory against Spurs would further boost his credentials for the gig on a permanent basis. But, with everybody pointing the finger at this match, quite how special Solskj\u00e6r and this United team is will come under the microscope against one of the best teams in the division in Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur. It is a showdown of sorts between one manager who really could not make it any clearer that he wants the job at Old Trafford and one who is remaining intriguingly tight-lipped. Tottenham will be desperate to hush United\u2019s strides under Solskj\u00e6r but, at the same time and, privately at least, probably wish Pochettino could steer Spurs to a masterclass against different opposition. As for United, they must find a way of keeping Harry Kane quiet. \u201cHe\u2019s not bad, is he?\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said of the England captain. \u201cHe is a fantastic goalscorer, one of the best in the world. It looks like he never misses chances really. We have to make sure he doesn\u2019t get any.\u201d In terms of team news, Spurs will call upon the in-form Son Heung-min for the final time before the South Korea forward joins up with his country at the Asian Cup, though the midfielder Eric Dier is still sidelined after appendix surgery. Chris Smalling is doubtful for United. Kick-off: 4.30pm (GMT)",

He is charged with failing in his duty to take reasonable care for the safety of spectators at the Leppings Lane and north stand areas of Hillsborough designated for Liverpool supporters, to protect them from overcrowding and crushing.</p> <p>The showpiece football occasion was attended by 54,000 people, 24,000 of them Liverpool supporters allocated those sides of the ground. The indictment alleges that Duckenfield\u2019s breach of his duty of care, to prevent people being crushed in \u201cpens\u201d 3 and 4 of the Leppings Lane terrace, amounted to gross negligence, and was \u201ca substantial cause\u201d of the deaths.</p> <p>Graham Mackrell, the Sheffield Wednesday club secretary and safety officer at the time the disaster happened, will stand trial alongside Duckenfield, on two counts of breaching his duties under safety legislation.</p> <p>Mackrell is charged with failing to agree with the police the number of turnstiles to be used for Liverpool supporters\u2019 admission to the Leppings Lane terrace, an alleged breach of the club\u2019s safety certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, the first ever prosecution under that legislation.

      "bodyText": "Almost 30 years after 96 people were killed at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough football ground, the police officer who was in command of the match, David Duckenfield, will on Monday stand trial on a criminal charge of gross negligence manslaughter. Duckenfield was newly promoted by South Yorkshire police to the rank of chief superintendent when he took charge of safety at the semi-final, which was played on 15 April 1989. He is charged with failing in his duty to take reasonable care for the safety of spectators at the Leppings Lane and north stand areas of Hillsborough designated for Liverpool supporters, to protect them from overcrowding and crushing. The showpiece football occasion was attended by 54,000 people, 24,000 of them Liverpool supporters allocated those sides of the ground. The indictment alleges that Duckenfield\u2019s breach of his duty of care, to prevent people being crushed in \u201cpens\u201d 3 and 4 of the Leppings Lane terrace, amounted to gross negligence, and was \u201ca substantial cause\u201d of the deaths. Graham Mackrell, the Sheffield Wednesday club secretary and safety officer at the time the disaster happened, will stand trial alongside Duckenfield, on two counts of breaching his duties under safety legislation. Mackrell is charged with failing to agree with the police the number of turnstiles to be used for Liverpool supporters\u2019 admission to the Leppings Lane terrace, an alleged breach of the club\u2019s safety certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, the first ever prosecution under that legislation. He is also charged with failing to take reasonable care of people\u2019s safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, including by failing to draw up contingency plans for coping with a large build-up of spectators outside the ground. The trial at Preston crown court, which will be presided over by the judge Sir Peter Openshaw, is scheduled to last four months, due to conclude in May. The 30th anniversary of the disaster is on 15 April , while the trial is almost certain still to be proceeding. Openshaw is expected to pause the trial during the week of the anniversary, for commemorations and remembrances of the disaster and the 96 people who were killed. The Crown Prosecution Service charged Duckenfield and Mackrell in June 2017, based on a police investigation into the disaster, Operation Resolve, which was set up after the report by the Hillsborough Independent Panel in September 2012. The last Labour government set up the panel in 2009, after the 20th anniversary of the disaster, and its work continued from 2010 under the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. The criminal charges followed inquests into the 96 deaths, held in Warrington from 31 March 2014 to 26 April 2016, the longest case ever heard by a jury in British legal history. Both Duckenfield and Mackrell have already pleaded not guilty to the charges in pre-trial hearings. The maximum sentence for manslaughter by gross negligence, if Duckenfield is convicted, is life in prison. The maximum sentence for the first charge faced by Mackrell is two years in prison; for the second he faces, the maximum is an unlimited fine. Duckenfield is charged with a single count of unlawful killing, manslaughter by gross negligence, in relation to 95 of the people who died. No charge could be brought in relation to the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland.

The life support was turned off in 1993 following a court application by Airedale NHS Trust, supported by his parents, that it would not be unlawful to do so, based on medical evidence that the brain damage was irreversible and he could never recover his faculties. Duckenfield has not been charged in relation to Bland\u2019s death because, according to the law in 1989, a criminal charge of manslaughter could not be applied if the victim died more than a year and a day after the alleged breaches of care occurred. The first day, at least, of the scheduled trial is expected to be concerned with selecting a jury of 12 people. The lead barrister for the Crown Prosecution Service, Richard Matthews QC, is expected to open the case against Duckenfield and Mackrell on Tuesday or Wednesday this week. Three other men face criminal charges in relation to the disaster in a separate trial scheduled to start in September.

Labour might do well to devote its energy to this rather than to seeking a general election which will put it in charge of a foreordained disaster.<br><strong>Stephen Sedley</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/08/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-the-government-has-failed-its-time-to-go-back-to-the-people\" title=\"\">editorial</a> (9 January) argued that \u201cBritain should pause the article 50 process and put Brexit on hold\u201d. It is simply not an option that Britain could exercise itself as that wording implies. It is true that recent judgment of the European court of justice makes it clear that the UK can withdraw its intention to leave unilaterally and thus stay in the EU with all its opt-outs and membership rights. Yet this intention to leave has to be \u201cunequivocal and unconditional\u201d. It cannot be used to stop the clock and is quite different from asking for more time. This is explicitly covered by the article 50 procedure in the EU treaties and requires unanimous agreement from all EU27 member states. It is at least doubtful that such an agreement by all states would be forthcoming, especially if the main purpose is to allow Westminster more time to discuss among itself and thus prolong uncertainty and costs to others.</p> <p>The patience of our EU partners is exhausted after what the government has put them through since the referendum \u2013 and indeed before. Article 50 does not mention any \u201cpause\u201d and it is unlikely that the EU27 would agree an unlimited extension of article 50. It is dangerous to create expectations that the EU27 will again bend over backwards because the withdrawal agreement negotiated with great effort does not get through the Commons and the government ran down the clock.</p> <p>The editorial rightly complains about the lack of honesty of many MPs about what Brexit entails. I suggest it is time to be honest about what is actually possible at this late stage in the process and the risks each option involves.<br><strong>Professor Christoph Meyer</strong><br><em>King\u2019s College London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Timothy Garton Ash (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/11/labour-peoples-vote-second-referendum-blindfold-brexit\" title=\"\">Labour must back a people\u2019s vote before the clock runs out</a>, 11 January) points out that extension of the article 50 deadline requires the unanimous approval of the EU27. Any extension necessary to allow a people\u2019s vote would have to go beyond 23 May, the start date of the European elections. Such an extension would mean that UK citizens would have the right to vote in those elections. Would the EU27 be likely to agree to that?

It is true that recent judgment of the European court of justice makes it clear that the UK can withdraw its intention to leave unilaterally and thus stay in the EU with all its opt-outs and membership rights. Yet this intention to leave has to be \u201cunequivocal and unconditional\u201d. It cannot be used to stop the clock and is quite different from asking for more time. This is explicitly covered by the article 50 procedure in the EU treaties and requires unanimous agreement from all EU27 member states. It is at least doubtful that such an agreement by all states would be forthcoming, especially if the main purpose is to allow Westminster more time to discuss among itself and thus prolong uncertainty and costs to others. The patience of our EU partners is exhausted after what the government has put them through since the referendum \u2013 and indeed before. Article 50 does not mention any \u201cpause\u201d and it is unlikely that the EU27 would agree an unlimited extension of article 50. It is dangerous to create expectations that the EU27 will again bend over backwards because the withdrawal agreement negotiated with great effort does not get through the Commons and the government ran down the clock. The editorial rightly complains about the lack of honesty of many MPs about what Brexit entails. I suggest it is time to be honest about what is actually possible at this late stage in the process and the risks each option involves. Professor Christoph Meyer King\u2019s College London \u2022 Timothy Garton Ash (Labour must back a people\u2019s vote before the clock runs out, 11 January) points out that extension of the article 50 deadline requires the unanimous approval of the EU27. Any extension necessary to allow a people\u2019s vote would have to go beyond 23 May, the start date of the European elections. Such an extension would mean that UK citizens would have the right to vote in those elections. Would the EU27 be likely to agree to that? Is this a little-noticed problem for a people\u2019s vote? Michael Freeman Nayland, Suffolk \u2022 In 1972 Tom Nairn effortlessly demolished \u201cThe strong leftwing case against the EU\u201d (Letters, 10 January) in his seminal New Left Review article, The Left Against Europe? A national, patriotic, anti-Europe Britain, he argued, would end up with not a left government but a Powellite one. \u201cAnd in that case the left would turn out to be have been no more than the sorcerer\u2019s apprentice who had temporarily harnessed the unclean spirits, only to be overwhelmed by them.\u201d That remains valid to this day. Dr Stephen Dorril Netherthong, West Yorkshire \u2022 While the authors of the letter headed \u201cUniversities needn\u2019t fear a no-deal Brexit\u201d (9 January) are correct in stating that it is possible for non-EU countries to access EU funding (eg Horizon 2020), they\u2019ve missed a crucial point. They ignore the point that to be eligible as an associated country with full access to funding (as is the case with Norway, for example), strict criteria need to be met, including free movement of people. How likely do they think is this given that, following negotiations, the prime minister\u2019s statement said that the Brexit deal would \u201cend freedom of movement once and for all\u201d? Professor Kirsty Park University of Stirling \u2022 What a delight, on a page where every letter was about Brexit, to see the photo of an envelope with a commemorative stamp celebrating us joining the European Communities in 1973 (Stamp of approval?, 10 January). Did anyone else notice it was posted on Valentine\u2019s Day? Have we really fallen out of love with Europe? Divorce imminent? Or could relationship counselling be an option?

How to get through this difficult time \u2013 without paying unnecessary costs, Money, 12 January) did not mention the option of a natural burial as an alternative to a regular funeral or cremation. My husband recently died and the funeral was the most beautiful event possible at my local natural burial ground. My family and friends all commented on how lovely it was to say goodbye surrounded by nature. The service can be custom-made to suit your needs, with any religious belief celebrated or none at all, and the option of a tree or wild flowers, planted to mark the site, contributes to the eventual nature reserve. An added bonus is the low cost of this completely green type of funeral.

The latest government figures show that cladding on only five of 176 privately owned towers identified has been replaced amid ongoing disputes between ministers, councils and building owners over who should pay.</p> <p>Leaseholders at the Northpoint building in Bromley in south London are each facing \u00a370,000 bills in a situation they describe as \u201cabsolutely desperate\u201d. One resident has been hospitalised with hypertension caused by the stress of the safety risk and the financial threat. After already paying up to \u00a38,000 each for emergency safety measures, another resident said she could only can afford to heat hot water once a week. Others are racking up major debts and cancelling holiday plans. The two-bedroom flats were worth about \u00a3300,000 each but are now thought to be unmortgageable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/21/fire-safety-cuts-memory-grenfell-inspection-audits-prevention\">Fire safety cuts are an insult to the memory of Grenfell | Seraphima Kennedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government has so far released \u00a3400m to contribute to work on social housing blocks, but nothing for private buildings. It said this week it does not know who will cover the cost of remediation in 96 of the private blocks \u2013 an unsettled bill that on a conservative estimate is likely to surpass \u00a3250m. It means there is no end in sight to the fire safety fears for thousands of residents. Of the 437 high rise buildings identified as having combustible cladding since the Grenfell fire, 85% still have similar systems in place even though they have now been banned on tall apartment blocks.</p> <p>\u201cThe shock is that for people living in a developed country, the choice could be so stark: bankruptcy or homelessness,\u201d said Rituparna Saha, auniversity administrator and top-floor resident, who walks the corridors to check for fires. \u201cThe fact that over 18 months after Grenfell, no one is taking ownership, not the freeholder, not the developer and not the government makes it seem to me that the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2018/may/14/lives-of-grenfell-tower-victims-fire\">72 people died</a> doesn\u2019t really matter. We are the football that keeps being tossed around.\u201d</p> <p>She is scared to ask friends with children to visit her, saying: \u201cI couldn\u2019t live with myself if there was a fire.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0318eb3dd835bceef6b27e96b56c02cb7d3cd1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0318eb3dd835bceef6b27e96b56c02cb7d3cd1d/0_146_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rituparna Saha in her flat Bromley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rituparna Saha in her flat Bromley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The freeholder of Northpoint is Citistead, a company owned by the family trust of the multi-millionaire property mogul Vincent Tchenguiz. It is refusing to pay because under the terms of the lease, leaseholders are responsible for maintenance and repairs and because the works were certified as compliant with building regulations which it said were \u201cclearly not fit for purpose\u201d.</p> <p>Tchenguiz, whose family trust ultimately owns other blocks in a similar situation, told the Financial Times last week the cladding bills should be paid either by the government or residents because the rents freeholders earn do not cover the cost.</p> <p>Taylor Wimpey, the developer which sold the freehold in 2007, does not want to pay either. It told the Guardian it does not own or bear any legal responsibility for the building, so removing the cladding is the job of the freeholder.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are going into arrears on the service charge,\u201d said Graham Snewin, 67, a retired chartered surveyor and a director of the leaseholders\u2019 management company . \u201cPeople are incredibly stressed. You go to bed with it and you wake up with it. One of our directors ended up in hospital with hypertension because of the stress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d said Hayley Kennedy, 35, who is losing her sight and has had to put on hold plans to travel the world because of the financial strain. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to put my heating on. I put my hot water on once a week. By the end of the month I have no money. I am in my mid-30s and I have a property that is worthless that I spent my 20s saving for.\u201d</p> <p>Facing a \u00a370,000 bill, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would start to pay that. All the equity has vanished and you can\u2019t remortgage.\u201d</p> <p>There has been confusion in government over its policy on making private tower blocks safe. The Conservative MP for Bromley, Bob Neill, accused ministers of offering \u201cfalse hope\u201d with promises of help that had not been thought through. In November, the housing secretary, James Brokenshire, said councils had government backing \u201cincluding financial support if necessary\u201d to strip combustible panels from private buildings. He said councils could recover the cost from building owners.</p> <p>But with no further details on how this would work, no councils have dared risk spending millions. This week the housing minister Lord Bourne wrongly told parliament that under law, councils were responsible for stripping dangerous cladding from private towers. He was forced into a correction by Lord Porter, the chairman of the Local Government Association, who said the law simply \u201cdoes not allow them to go in and take cladding off of other people\u2019s buildings\u201d.</p> <p>Bromley Council, which has held talks with the leaseholders, said it was raising the issue with the government.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government wants to protect owners it will have to come out of central government money,\u201d said Neill. \u201c[The Northpoint residents] are clearly under real stress. It is bad enough they are financially crippled, but they are now living in homes that are dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Brokenshire said: \u201cA number of developers and building owners have already done the right thing and protected leaseholders from additional costs, and I expect others to follow their lead. My message is clear \u2013 private building owners must pay for this work now or they should expect to pay more later.\u201d</p> <p>But the continuing ambiguity will not help the Northpoint leaseholders who need to find \u00a3200,000 to pay for the most urgent fire safety works by April and fear that unless they do so the building could be condemned by the fire authorities.</p> <p>The stalemate is also being complicated by a wider political fight over leasehold reform. Citistead has told politicians it cannot afford to help because of the threat to its business from potential law changes that would limit their profitability of freeholds as an investment. It is arguing that if the reforms were dropped, freeholders would be willing to contribute to leaseholders\u2019 remediation costs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Residents in a tower block that is wrapped with combustible cladding say they are facing possible bankruptcy and are falling ill with stress after the building owner and its developer refused to pay \u00a34m to make their homes safe. They are among tens of thousands of people across England known to be still living in private apartment buildings wrapped in similar material to that which spread the Grenfell Tower fire 19 months ago. The latest government figures show that cladding on only five of 176 privately owned towers identified has been replaced amid ongoing disputes between ministers, councils and building owners over who should pay. Leaseholders at the Northpoint building in Bromley in south London are each facing \u00a370,000 bills in a situation they describe as \u201cabsolutely desperate\u201d. One resident has been hospitalised with hypertension caused by the stress of the safety risk and the financial threat. After already paying up to \u00a38,000 each for emergency safety measures, another resident said she could only can afford to heat hot water once a week. Others are racking up major debts and cancelling holiday plans. The two-bedroom flats were worth about \u00a3300,000 each but are now thought to be unmortgageable. The government has so far released \u00a3400m to contribute to work on social housing blocks, but nothing for private buildings. It said this week it does not know who will cover the cost of remediation in 96 of the private blocks \u2013 an unsettled bill that on a conservative estimate is likely to surpass \u00a3250m. It means there is no end in sight to the fire safety fears for thousands of residents. Of the 437 high rise buildings identified as having combustible cladding since the Grenfell fire, 85% still have similar systems in place even though they have now been banned on tall apartment blocks. \u201cThe shock is that for people living in a developed country, the choice could be so stark: bankruptcy or homelessness,\u201d said Rituparna Saha, auniversity administrator and top-floor resident, who walks the corridors to check for fires. \u201cThe fact that over 18 months after Grenfell, no one is taking ownership, not the freeholder, not the developer and not the government makes it seem to me that the fact that 72 people died doesn\u2019t really matter. We are the football that keeps being tossed around.\u201d She is scared to ask friends with children to visit her, saying: \u201cI couldn\u2019t live with myself if there was a fire.\u201d The freeholder of Northpoint is Citistead, a company owned by the family trust of the multi-millionaire property mogul Vincent Tchenguiz. It is refusing to pay because under the terms of the lease, leaseholders are responsible for maintenance and repairs and because the works were certified as compliant with building regulations which it said were \u201cclearly not fit for purpose\u201d. Tchenguiz, whose family trust ultimately owns other blocks in a similar situation, told the Financial Times last week the cladding bills should be paid either by the government or residents because the rents freeholders earn do not cover the cost. Taylor Wimpey, the developer which sold the freehold in 2007, does not want to pay either. It told the Guardian it does not own or bear any legal responsibility for the building, so removing the cladding is the job of the freeholder. \u201cPeople are going into arrears on the service charge,\u201d said Graham Snewin, 67, a retired chartered surveyor and a director of the leaseholders\u2019 management company . \u201cPeople are incredibly stressed. You go to bed with it and you wake up with it. One of our directors ended up in hospital with hypertension because of the stress.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d said Hayley Kennedy, 35, who is losing her sight and has had to put on hold plans to travel the world because of the financial strain. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to put my heating on. I put my hot water on once a week. By the end of the month I have no money. I am in my mid-30s and I have a property that is worthless that I spent my 20s saving for.\u201d Facing a \u00a370,000 bill, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would start to pay that. All the equity has vanished and you can\u2019t remortgage.\u201d There has been confusion in government over its policy on making private tower blocks safe. The Conservative MP for Bromley, Bob Neill, accused ministers of offering \u201cfalse hope\u201d with promises of help that had not been thought through. In November, the housing secretary, James Brokenshire, said councils had government backing \u201cincluding financial support if necessary\u201d to strip combustible panels from private buildings. He said councils could recover the cost from building owners. But with no further details on how this would work, no councils have dared risk spending millions. This week the housing minister Lord Bourne wrongly told parliament that under law, councils were responsible for stripping dangerous cladding from private towers. He was forced into a correction by Lord Porter, the chairman of the Local Government Association, who said the law simply \u201cdoes not allow them to go in and take cladding off of other people\u2019s buildings\u201d. Bromley Council, which has held talks with the leaseholders, said it was raising the issue with the government. \u201cIf the government wants to protect owners it will have to come out of central government money,\u201d said Neill. \u201c[The Northpoint residents] are clearly under real stress. It is bad enough they are financially crippled, but they are now living in homes that are dangerous.\u201d Brokenshire said: \u201cA number of developers and building owners have already done the right thing and protected leaseholders from additional costs, and I expect others to follow their lead. My message is clear \u2013 private building owners must pay for this work now or they should expect to pay more later.\u201d But the continuing ambiguity will not help the Northpoint leaseholders who need to find \u00a3200,000 to pay for the most urgent fire safety works by April and fear that unless they do so the building could be condemned by the fire authorities. The stalemate is also being complicated by a wider political fight over leasehold reform. Citistead has told politicians it cannot afford to help because of the threat to its business from potential law changes that would limit their profitability of freeholds as an investment. It is arguing that if the reforms were dropped, freeholders would be willing to contribute to leaseholders\u2019 remediation costs.",

      "bodyText": "A powerful regional body of African states has called for a recount in the contested presidential election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The unexpected move underlines growing worries that instead of marking a turning point for the troubled country, the 30 December vote and the deepening political crisis it has triggered will instead lead to a slide into anarchy and violence. Such concerns are urgent for regional powers well aware that extensive conflict in the vast and mineral-rich DRC has the potential to destabilise significant parts of central, east and southern Africa. A civil war between 1997 and 2002 killed 5 million people and drew in all neighbouring states. The surprise victor of the election was F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, leader of the country\u2019s main opposition party. Tshisekedi beat opposition politician Martin Fayulu by a narrow margin. However Fayulu, a widely respected former business executive and parliamentarian, claims that he in fact won by a landslide and that Tshisekedi struck a deal with Joseph Kabila to be declared victor. Fayulu\u2019s claims have been bolstered by DRC\u2019s influential Catholic church, which deployed 40,000 election monitors on the day of the election and has stated that its data showed a different winner to that announced by the electoral commission. Sunday\u2019s statement from the Southern African Development Community, which includes 16 states, notes the \u201cstrong doubts cast on the poll outcome by the \u2026 church, the opposition coalition and other observers\u201d and calls for a recount \u201cto provide the necessary reassurance to both winners and losers\u201d. The organisation also suggested \u201ca negotiated political settlement for a government of national unity\u201d. Initial reactions to the polls from other African nations were broadly supportive of the conduct of the poll by the country\u2019s much-criticised electoral commission. Though outgoing President Kabila, in power since 2001, can ignore pressure from western powers, including the US, major regional states have significant leverage. Kabila, who was constitutionally banned from standing for a third term, only reluctantly called the elections under pressure from Angola and South Africa. Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, Kabila\u2019s handpicked candidate, came a poor third. The church has refused to reveal who won according to its findings, but diplomats briefed on the church data say it indicates a clear victory for Fayulu, in line with pre-election polls that had put him at least 20 points ahead of Tshisekedi. Fayulu filed a fraud complaint on Saturday with DRC\u2019s highest court to challenge the result. Better news for the government was that parties supporting Kabila had won a majority in the 500-seat national assembly. This will consolidate the position of the former president, whoever takes power. Kabila has ruled since the 2001 assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila, who overthrew the long-serving dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. Tshisekedi would be the first leader to takes power via the ballot box in DRC since Patrice Lumumba shortly after DRC won independence from Belgium in 1960. Lumumba was toppled in a coup and killed four months later. DRC suffers from widespread corruption, continuing conflict, endemic disease, and some of the world\u2019s highest levels of sexual violence and malnutrition. It is also rich in minerals, including those crucial to the world\u2019s smartphones and electric cars.",

According to the Australian Automobile Association, 40 cyclists died on Australian roads in the 12 months to September. Despite the stated intent of the government\u2019s 2011 National Road Safety Strategy to decrease cycling-related fatalities, the death toll has remained largely static. Cycling casualties as a proportion of all road traffic causalities have even risen.</p> <p>Renshaw might be a high-profile example, but his circumstances are alarmingly common. A study in the Medical Journal of Australia found that injuries to cyclists in Victoria doubled between 2007 and 2015, with $700m in associated health costs.</p> <p>\u201cI have been hit several times,\u201d says Lauren O\u2019Neill, a university student in Sydney who rides every day. \u201cI can\u2019t count the number of incidents I have been involved in, and when you go to the police they just aren\u2019t interested. It is astonishing how differently you are treated when you are on a bike. Cycling is not inherently unsafe, but drivers make it unsafe.\u201d O\u2019Neill says she was recently knocked to the ground by a driver, who yelled: \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have happened if you were in a car.\u201d</p> <p>Scott McGrory, an Olympic gold medal-winning former cyclist, travelled around the world during his professional career. Whenever he returned home, he was shocked by what he saw. \u201cWe are not doing enough,\u201d he says. \u201cI suspect most Australians would consider our road infrastructure to be better than, say, India. But I felt safer riding on the ridiculously busy streets of Mumbai than I do in any Australian capital city.\u201d</p> <h2>Death of promising young cyclist</h2> <p>Twelve months ago, Australia\u2019s tight-knit professional peloton was shaken by the death of Jason Lowndes, a promising young rider who died after being hit by a car near Bendigo. The driver, whose prosecution is ongoing, was allegedly using a phone.</p> <p>Midway through Cycling Australia\u2019s 2018 Road National Championships in sweltering Ballarat, the peloton conducted a lap of honour in Lowndes\u2019 memory.

      "bodyText": "Mark Renshaw should be in Adelaide. The professional cyclist was scheduled to begin his 2019 UCI World Tour campaign at this week\u2019s Tour Down Under. Instead, he is at home in Bathurst, recovering from a fractured pelvis after being hit by a car in December. \u201cI was out on a training ride and about three-quarters of the way through a roundabout when a middle-aged driver entered the roundabout into my path,\u201d Renshaw recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see her \u2013 I just went straight over the bonnet.\u201d He fractured his pelvis and is expected to miss several months of racing. The Team Dimension Data rider\u2019s injuries have reopened debate about the safety of cyclists in Australia. According to the Australian Automobile Association, 40 cyclists died on Australian roads in the 12 months to September. Despite the stated intent of the government\u2019s 2011 National Road Safety Strategy to decrease cycling-related fatalities, the death toll has remained largely static. Cycling casualties as a proportion of all road traffic causalities have even risen. Renshaw might be a high-profile example, but his circumstances are alarmingly common. A study in the Medical Journal of Australia found that injuries to cyclists in Victoria doubled between 2007 and 2015, with $700m in associated health costs. \u201cI have been hit several times,\u201d says Lauren O\u2019Neill, a university student in Sydney who rides every day. \u201cI can\u2019t count the number of incidents I have been involved in, and when you go to the police they just aren\u2019t interested. It is astonishing how differently you are treated when you are on a bike. Cycling is not inherently unsafe, but drivers make it unsafe.\u201d O\u2019Neill says she was recently knocked to the ground by a driver, who yelled: \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have happened if you were in a car.\u201d Scott McGrory, an Olympic gold medal-winning former cyclist, travelled around the world during his professional career. Whenever he returned home, he was shocked by what he saw. \u201cWe are not doing enough,\u201d he says. \u201cI suspect most Australians would consider our road infrastructure to be better than, say, India. But I felt safer riding on the ridiculously busy streets of Mumbai than I do in any Australian capital city.\u201d Death of promising young cyclist Twelve months ago, Australia\u2019s tight-knit professional peloton was shaken by the death of Jason Lowndes, a promising young rider who died after being hit by a car near Bendigo. The driver, whose prosecution is ongoing, was allegedly using a phone. Midway through Cycling Australia\u2019s 2018 Road National Championships in sweltering Ballarat, the peloton conducted a lap of honour in Lowndes\u2019 memory. Tears mixed with anger as the riders, many of whom are based in Europe and only experience Australian road conditions sporadically, wondered why more was not being done. \u201cWe\u2019re not just bike riders, we\u2019re husbands, brothers, sons, daughters,\u201d says professional cyclist Brenton Jones. These elite athletes are, paradoxically, one reason why peak body Cycling Australia has not played a more prominent role in the cycling safety debate.

      "bodyText": "Academics and journalists say delays are crippling Tasmania\u2019s freedom of information regime as new figures reveal the state\u2019s understaffed public watchdog is struggling under the weight of its growing workload. The lack of political transparency in Tasmania was laid bare in last year\u2019s election, when voters were left unaware of the true influence of powerful gaming interests due to its weak and sluggish donation disclosure system, widely considered the worst in the nation. Tasmania\u2019s right-to-information (RTI) system, however, was envisioned as one of the strongest of any state or territory when legislation was introduced in 2010. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon But the RTI system is now beset by delays. Tasmania has been the worst performer on making RTI decisions within the statutory timeframes for two of the past three years on record. When decisions are made, they are by far the most likely to be appealed of any jurisdiction. About 7.6% of the state government\u2019s RTI decisions are appealed to the ombudsman, more than double the rate of Queensland, the next closest jurisdiction. Experts and the ombudsman have repeatedly said the high number of appeals are because the government fails to give adequate reasons when it refuses to release documents. The chronically understaffed ombudsman\u2019s office has just one officer working on RTI reviews. The 50 cases before the ombudsman have been open for 415 days on average, according to data provided to Guardian Australia. It took an average of 318 days to complete an RTI review last financial year, up from 230 days the year before. The cases closed so far this financial year have taken an average of 687 days, although that number will fall as the year goes on. The ombudsman said the problem would worsen unless the office was given more staff. \u201cWith only a single staff member and a growing trend nationally of applicants seeking external review, it is likely the backlog will progressively worsen over time if resourcing levels remain the same,\u201d the ombudsman said. \u201cAny delay will undermine the ongoing effectiveness of the external review process.\u201d A Tasmanian academic and FOI expert, Rick Snell, described the situation as \u201can absolute farce\u201d and \u201cjust outrageous\u201d. The backlog meant those making RTI decisions would not have to face the ombudsman\u2019s scrutiny for years, by which time they were likely to have left or changed roles, he said. \u201cThere is a fix, and that is to give the ombudsman immediately more staffing and resources,\u201d he said. Emily Baker, a political reporter with the Hobart Mercury, has seen examples of journalists waiting four years for an RTI appeal to be resolved. \u201cI\u2019ve only been back working in Tasmania for about four months but, by way of example, an ABC journalist who appealed against an RTI decision in September 2014 only received a response in October 2018,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThe journalist has since left the state and the government-owned business that was the subject of the RTI has rebranded. The information \u2013 likely important in 2014 \u2013 is now relatively redundant.\u201d Snell said the ombudsman\u2019s workload also created flow-on problems. The ombudsman had almost no ability to train government RTI officers, and had not updated the RTI guidelines or manual since 2010. \u201cThere\u2019s been no response from the government to even admit that they\u2019ve got a problem, and certainly no response in providing the ombudsman with some spare staff to at least start addressing some of the key backlogs,\u201d Snell said. A spokeswoman for the Hodgman government responded to queries by sending Guardian Australia a two-sentence statement, which was word-for-word for the response given to the ABC months earlier. \u201cWe have every confidence in the ombudsman\u2019s office to undertake their duties,\u201d it said. \u201cWhile the office operates independently of government, we will continue to consult with the ombudsman\u2019s office when it comes to budget submissions and matters of resourcing.\u201d The state government has moved on several other fronts to improve transparency in recent years. It has improved its disclosure of gifts to ministers and departments, and recently committed to a review of the electoral act, which controversially prevents newspapers publishing election content on election day. But Baker said transparency of political donations was still sorely lacking. A recent poll by the Hobart Mercury found 94% of Tasmanians wanted improvements to the donations disclosure regime. \u201cTasmania follows commonwealth guidelines, meaning we still don\u2019t know who funded what in the March 2018 state election and could theoretically never find out the full extent of donations made,\u201d she said. The RTI scheme needed greater resourcing and greater consistency in application across various agencies. \u201cThere is a sense of interference in some departments when RTI requests are made,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, staff from one minister\u2019s office were revealed as discussing journalists\u2019 RTIs, and I have had a media staffer call me after making an RTI request. As well, unfortunately like anywhere, RTIs are often heavily redacted.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A group of men and a group of women are shown a playlet about the interactions at work between Ryan, a male manager of a bar, and his new, female co-manager, Cat. When and where, they are asked, does he sexually harass her \u2013 if at all? The setup of Is This Sexual Harassment? (BBC Three) was a brilliantly simple way to stimulate discussion and interrogation of this endemic workplace problem. Rather too simple, on the other hand, was the mini-film, over which they were supposed to argue. It was split into three sections so minds could change with the unfolding story and the massing evidence, or lack thereof. The sexual harassment clearly began straight away, when he leaned too closely over her at the computer to show how to use the office stock control software and complimented her perfume. \u201cBrains and beauty,\u201d he called their teamwork. Bleurgh. Her removing his hand from the small of her back at the office party was a blatant signal she wasn\u2019t interested. Yet he got them a shared taxi home and got out at her place instead of going on to his as he had said he would, and kissed her. She said no and laughed it off. He called head office to report her stock control mistakes, she realised he was out to make her place untenable and they ended up at an employment tribunal. So obvious what was going on! So clear!

His side\u2019s intentions have been good and some of the football has been very easy on the eye; the results aren\u2019t really coming though, as one win in their last eight Premier League games will inform you, and they are looking distinctly like Just Another Mid-Table Side among the division\u2019s 289,845 others.</p> <p><strong>So they find themselves level on points with \u2013 but nine goals better than \u2013 Bournemouth, whose manager has indisputably done a very good job indeed.</strong> There was quite a lot of excitement earlier in the season when Eddie Howe\u2019s side climbed to within a few places of the Champions League contenders but, with two wins from their last 12, that\u2019s been tempered a little. They\u2019ve probably found their place, in truth: they\u2019re not going down and won\u2019t finish a great deal higher. None of which is a problem for them at this point, really.</p> <p><strong>Not that they won\u2019t be gagging to to hit form today!</strong> It should be a pleasant affair between two sides that play good, front-footed stuff.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019ll do from me \u2013 here\u2019s the match report to enjoy before you skitter off to watch Spurs-United. Thanks for your company, as always! Amid all that, it was a milestone for Begovic. Now I am not saying this game wasn\u2019t today\u2019s biggest show, but Spurs v Man Utd is fairly weighty too and starts soon. Ben Fisher is all over it: Bournemouth will, indeed, regret lacking a finishing touch when they were so well on top early on. That Brooks chance, when he hit the post, was a key moment in the game. They stay 12th, while Everton soar to the giddy heights of 10th. For the Toffees\u2019 part, Lookman was excellent and has surely supplanted Walcott in the pecking order for now. It was the last kick of the game! Everton weren\u2019t two goals better, but they improved massively on that opening 30 minutes and did enough \u2013 relieving the pressure on Marco Silva for now. Well *that* definitely is. Lookman escapes down the left and Everton, going for the second all of a sudden, have men in support. He cuts back to the substitute and his finish, low and precise with the aid of a small deflection, gives Begovic no chance! 90+5 min: ... which is met by Mousset, but he can\u2019t connect with his volley cleanly and a grateful Pickford dives onto it. That could well be that. 90+4 min: Everton survive that corner but then concede another. Begovic wants to go up but Howe won\u2019t let him! Pickford ends up hammering the ball away from somewhere close to his own corner flag. It\u2019s backs to the wall stuff \u2013 and here comes another flag kick for the Cherries ... 90+2 min: Big challenge from Keane! Mousset plays Gosling in and the defender, in combination with the onrushing Pickford, does enough to deny the shot and concede the corner! Before it\u2019s taken, Sigurdsson is replaced by Yerry Mina. 90 min: Ibe whips in a tremendous cross from the right byline and Keane is fortunate that his clearance hits Mousset and flies behind. Just before that, Everton survive a mild goalmouth scramble. There\u2019ll be five added minutes and Goodison suddenly sounds very nervous indeed. 89 min: Then Fraser delivers a free-kick from the left and Pickford, again, gets just enough on it to deflect away. Do Bournemouth have one more big chance in them? 88 min: Suddenly the ball squirts free on the left of Everton\u2019s area and it\u2019s a race between Fraser and Pickford! The keeper wins it, crucially for his side, and smothers the ball. It runs free but he pelts it out of play. 87 min: Richarlison, who has worked hard and almost scored when Ake cleared off the line, is replaced by Calvert-Lewin. 86 min: Silva is angered by a Gosling challenge \u2013 sufficiently so that the referee, Taylor, has to go over to the dugouts and calm him down. It has been largely scrappy and niggly since Zouma\u2019s goal. 84 min: Now Richardson goes up against Cook in a less edifying way, catching him with a flailing hand and causing some pain. He is rightly booked. 83 min: He has Jordon Ibe up his sleeve, to be fair and on he comes for Brooks. But it\u2019s Everton who attack next and Richarlison, going up against Cook, blazes over from an angle on the left. 81 min: You just don\u2019t quite sense Bournemouth are going to have the cutting edge they need here. Most of their moves are falling short before they get into the penalty area; I\u2019m not sure what else Howe really has up his sleeve either. 78 min: Here\u2019s Walcott for Everton, replacing the largely impressive Bernard. 77 min: That would have sealed it though \u2013 Richardson stooping to head another fine Sigurdsson delivery just wide from somewhere near sea level. 76 min: The pressure continues and Bournemouth win their latest corner, Pickford saving Ake\u2019s header comfortably. 75 min: Then Gomes concedes a free-kick in a far more dangerous area, just outside his own box and on the right. He\u2019s on a tightrope! King needs some extensive treatment as a result and, for now, that will continue on the side. Eventually Fraser delivers the set-piece: it loops up off a head and Pickford has to punch away from under his own bar. 73 min: Gomes almost succeeds in chasing down Begovic, but then gets overeager and catches Cook very late. He\u2019s been booked already and I think he should be off for that \u2013 lucky boy. 71 min: The away side are pressing now but time is beginning to look tight. Everton look fairly comfortable. 68 min: Here\u2019s Lys Mousset, replacing Stanislas for Bournemouth. I wonder if things would be looking rather different had Wilson been fit for this. 66 min: Now it gets a bit fiery as Gomes and Zouma are both booked following a contretemps caused by Gueye\u2019s foul on Stanislas. Neither needed to get involved. 65 min: Bournemouth need a response and King almost provides one, marauding down the inside-left before drilling high into the side netting. The away side shouldn\u2019t really be behind but credit to Everton for stepping things up the way they have. Might not need a sub to win this after all! The corner, sent in from the right, is flicked out to the opposite flank where Digne collects, giving himself a chance to surge for the byline with a masterful first touch. He does exactly that, before whipping in a marvellous cross that Zouma, rising to reach the ball ahead of Begovic, powerfully heads into the net! Goodison is happy! 61 min: But Everton up the tempo as I write that, Coleman belting the ball against Ake at close quarters \u2013 calls for a handball go unheeded \u2013 and winning a corner. From which ... 60 min: All a bit scrappy as we reach the hour mark and you wonder whether this is a game that will be won from the bench. 57 min: Brooks tries to slip Stanislas in but his team-mate is offside. Everton have, since the first half hour, succeeded in stopping Brooks getting too much space between midfield and defence. 55 min: Lerma, never a shrinking violet, barges Bernard over clumsily with little need and Everton have a centrally-located free-kick, just about within realistic shooting range if Sigurdsson wants to belt one. Instead he floats a harmless ball towards Zouma, which is headed out for Bernard to volley waywardly. 52 min: It\u2019s a fun start to the half and Bournemouth have a corner on the other side now. It\u2019s not dealt with very well at first, but the ball comes back in and eventually Everton sort themselves out. There\u2019s a half-ricochet off Zouma\u2019s arm amid all that, but nobody appeals. 51 min: A first glimpse of Bournemouth in this half, as they win a left-sided corner through Fraser .. from which Cook gets a run on the home defence and loops a header tantalisingly onto the roof of the net! 49 min: Off the line from Ake! My, that was close. Gueye\u2019s ball from the right finds Richardson at the far post, and his initial header is blocked. But he gets a second chance to drill past Begovic, and duly does ... only Ake to slide and hack the ball away from *right* on the line. Fine defending. 47 min: Bernard *just* isn\u2019t tall enough to reach a beautiful Sigurdsson cross from deep. Everton have begun this half as they finished the first. And Gomes skies a shot over from 20 yards within seconds. In netball, England are about to open the Quad Series against New Zealand. Just before we get stuck into the second half here, a preview: We must try to see the best in both these teams. Lookman has been a plus for Everton, definitely their best attacking player. Brooks made Bournemouth tick for half an hour. What happened in that WSL clash between Arsenal and Chelsea? No spoilers here ... but it was a massive result for the title race, potentially, and Suzanne Wrack was there to tell you the rest: Goalless, but it\u2019s been watchable. The first half-hour was entirely Bournemouth\u2019s, with Brooks hitting the post and a few other half-chances falling their way. Everton belatedly found some rhythm and could have scored themselves when Keane\u2019s header flicked the bar. All to play for! 45 min: Now Sigurdsson does get a shooting chance after some bright play from Bernard, but he snatches at it from inside the \u2018D\u2019 and it goes well wide. A little more composure might have seen him work Begovic. 44 min: Now a chance to really make some hay before the break, as Gosling checks Richardson 25 yards out. Sigurdsson will fancy it ... and so will Digne, who dollies a harmless one into the wall when the angle didn\u2019t really suit him. 42 min: A lovely Everton move sees Lookman, who is playing well, slip a perfectly-weighted ball through for Coleman, who has to settle for a corner. It\u2019s cleared out to the left and Digne delivers ... onto the head of Keane, whose header grazes the bar! At the moment they won\u2019t want the half to end, because they\u2019ve really woken up. 39 min: Ooh, that\u2019s certainly better from the hosts. Digne lays inside for Lookman, who fizzes a *dream* of a low centre across but discovers that Everton don\u2019t really have a centre-forward out there. Nobody is gambling and Bournemouth survive. Bernard is then booked for a late challenge. 38 min: This end-to-end spell continues with a corner for Everton, who are just livening up a bit. Lerma thuds it away, unchallenged. 36 min: It\u2019s not really a high-quality game but it is certainly quite open and decently paced. Everton nod away a disappointing Fraser corner, and then Fraser gets another go but centres too close to Pickford. There\u2019s a goal or two in this one. 34 min: ... which Richarlison deals with, winning two consecutive headers. Everton then break through the same player but he can\u2019t pick out Lookman ... but they keep attacking and Clyne defends excellently at the back post to prevent Lookman from getting a shot away from Bernard\u2019s cross. 33 min: The excellent Brooks is fouled about 35 yards out, at a slight angle on the right. It\u2019s good for a delivery into the box, this. Fraser\u2019s kick is flicked out by Keane for a corner ... 31 min: A quieter few minutes, followed by Everton\u2019s first vaguely scintillating moment, Lookman running away on the right and crossing for Bernard, who is awkwardly placed and can\u2019t direct his header near goal. Will Bournemouth regret not scoring in that first half-hour? 28 min: Fraser darts in to intercept another sloppy Pickford clearance and crosses for King, who heads a fairly difficult chance over. Everton have to wake up or they will lose; Bournemouth look much better. 27 min: From the corner, Everton can\u2019t fully clear and Lerma shoots against his own man before Gosling fires into the stand. 26 min: Smith gets up, at length, and this potentially very dangerous set-piece can be taken. Stanislas steps up ... and forces Pickford into a handy tip round the post with a low, bouncing effort curled round the wall. 24 min: Bournemouth remain the more lucid in possession and Brooks can\u2019t quite find Fraser at the end of a patient move. Then a combination of Gueye and Gomes concedes a free-kick just outside the box \u2013 causing Smith some pain ... 22 min: They are angered, though, by a late challenge by Ake on the hitherto invisible Richarlison that goes unpunished. They\u2019re not too happy, either, when Zouma plays Pickford into trouble and forces a hurried clearance out of play. 21 min: It\u2019s fairly quiet inside Goodison. You can hear the players\u2019 shouts quite comfortably. There\u2019s the low hum of a crowd rather waiting for things to happen. At the moment there\u2019s little sign of that from Everton. 18 min: For the first time Everton manage some sustained pressure and possession, although nothing results bar some mild handbags between Gosling and Gomes. They\u2019ll need to improve massively on that first 15 minutes. 16 min: Everton win a corner on the left, though. Zouma charges onto Digne\u2019s delivery but Bournemouth have enough bodies in situ to clear. 14 min: Brooks hits the post! He\u2019s played through in the inside-right position by Stanislas and onside, with just Pickford to beat. He rolls the ball across the keeper delicately ... but it strikes the inside of the far post and pings out. Bournemouth, much the better side so far, really should be ahead. 12 min: Lerma skids a long one wide. Everton are yet to get going at all. 11 min: It\u2019s a good few minutes of pressure from Bournemouth and the highly involved Brooks seeks a penalty, flinging himself down as he looks to surge into the box beyond Gueye. There seemed to be a tangle of legs but Brooks also appeared to be tugging Gueye\u2019s shirt, so it is the right decision from a well-positioned Anthony Taylor. 8 min: Chance for Josh King! Coleman can only glance a right-sided delivery out to an unattended Fraser, whose first touch makes a shot impossible but can cut the ball back from the byline. It goes through a defender\u2019s legs to King, who is tightly marshaled and can only get a half-contact as he jabs at it, allowing Pickford to smother at close range. 7 min: Lookman gets himself out of a tight spot with a lovely turn inside his own half. He\u2019s a talent alright, but Everton need to get him in the right areas today. 6 min: \u201cThe comments from Moshiri are a bit of a storm in a teacup,\u201d writes Rick Jackson. \u201cTaken in context, they were more of a statement of the obvious. We\u2019re a work-in-progress and most Everton fans are happy with the progress made so far. This time last year, we were miserable and frustrated, rather than just frustrated like now.\u201d 4 min: Now a glimmer for Everton, Sigurdsson\u2019s dangerous free-kick from the right ricocheting off a couple of players and forcing Begovic to clutch down to his right side. 3 min: Coleman decides its time to show Fraser he is actually there, clipping him late and causing him to wince as he walks away. He\u2019ll be fine but that\u2019s already a contest to keep an eye on. 1 min: A bright early sortie from Bournemouth, Fraser skipping away from Coleman on the left before laying back for Stanislas. His leg is cocked but Bernard does superbly to track back and snick the ball away. Bournemouth, in white shirts and shooting left to right, get us going. Ha \u2013 it currently works! The teams are walking out of Everton\u2019s tight, old-school tunnel at Goodison \u2013 perhaps the league\u2019s most old-world venue these days. Z-Cars is whistling loud and clear ... we are almost ready! Great to see Lookman get a go (although you\u2019d wonder, too, whether Walcott might be all but done at a team with pretentions to the top 10). It\u2019s only his sixth start in the league for Everton, but he impressed in scoring against Lincoln in the cup last weekend. And while we wait for this one, Arsenal and Chelsea are facing off in a big Women\u2019s Super League clash. Nick Miller has it: I\u2019m interested, Everton fans, in your view of Silva. Surely he needs more time before Moshiri starts getting trigger happy, no? Does he need to be put under such pressure at this stage? Or is a kick up the whatnots desperately required? Email/tweet away. The big takeaways from that team news are that Ademola Lookman gets a \u2013 ahem \u2013 look in for Everton, with Theo Walcott benched. For Bournemouth there\u2019s a big blow, because Callum Wilson is injured and doesn\u2019t make it. Liverpool loanee Nathaniel Clyne starts, though. Everton: Pickford; Coleman, Keane, Zouma, Digne; Gueye, Gomes; Lookman, Sigurdsson, Bernard; Richarlison. Subs: Stekelenburg, Walcott, Mina, Tosun, Davies, Calvert-Lewin, Kenny. Bournemouth: Begovic; Clyne, Ake, Cook, Smith; Gosling, Lerma, Brooks; Stanislas, King, Fraser. Subs: Boruc, Surman, Mousset, Ibe, Daniels, Rico, Simpson. Is Marco Silva the second coming? Is he a TERRIBLE FRAUD? Is he, perhaps, an OK manager doing an OK job with an OK team at a club whose expectations shouldn\u2019t be sky high just yet? I leave that all to you, but the bare fact is that he\u2019s under pressure to deliver at the moment. His side\u2019s intentions have been good and some of the football has been very easy on the eye; the results aren\u2019t really coming though, as one win in their last eight Premier League games will inform you, and they are looking distinctly like Just Another Mid-Table Side among the division\u2019s 289,845 others. So they find themselves level on points with \u2013 but nine goals better than \u2013 Bournemouth, whose manager has indisputably done a very good job indeed. There was quite a lot of excitement earlier in the season when Eddie Howe\u2019s side climbed to within a few places of the Champions League contenders but, with two wins from their last 12, that\u2019s been tempered a little. They\u2019ve probably found their place, in truth: they\u2019re not going down and won\u2019t finish a great deal higher. None of which is a problem for them at this point, really. Not that they won\u2019t be gagging to to hit form today! It should be a pleasant affair between two sides that play good, front-footed stuff. And whoever wins might just inject themselves with some much-needed momentum. Stick with us \u2013 kick-off is at 2.15pm UK time!",

When concerns were first raised about collection of children\u2019s nationality and country of birth, the DfE had insisted that the new data would not be shared with immigration enforcement authorities, that it was only being collected for \u201canalytical, statistical and research purposes\u201d, and that parents could opt out whenever they wanted. But when it emerged that names and addresses of children collected through the census had since 2015 been secretly shared every month with immigration enforcement, thousands of parents in 2016 heeded calls by human rights groups and teachers\u2019 unions to boycott the questions. After a freedom of information battle, campaigners subsequently exposed a memorandum of understanding between the DfE and the Home Office that showed that officials had originally intended for nationality and birth country data to be used for immigration enforcement. In a move that suggests ministers had misled public over their plans, the memorandum had been quietly amended some months after public opposition emerged \u2013 and after assurances had already been given \u2013 to remove references to nationality and country of birth. Last month, Against Borders for Children (ABC), a group set up to campaign against the use of children\u2019s data for immigration enforcement, began legal action against Damian Hinds, the education secretary, to force his department to delete the data it currently holds. Kwadwo Kyerewaa, a spokesman for ABC, said: \u201cThe DfE should live up to its purpose and ensure that every child has a right to education without fear of immigration enforcement. \u201cRecent data-sharing statistics show that families are providing data that has been re-purposed for immigration enforcement without their informed consent. We hope the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office will put an end to this shameful and shocking practice.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 January 2019 to clarify that this policy only applies to schools in England.",

That is a charge you could never level at F\u00e0bregas. No wonder Henry is hoping that the Spaniard, who provided so many assists during their time together at Arsenal, can help him once more by getting Monaco out of a relegation dogfight. Do not be surprised if the 31-year-old locksmith still proves capable of unpicking the toughest of defences.",

With my workout you can be the person you have always wanted to be.</p> <p>What makes my approach so different is that it doesn\u2019t demand you waste years in therapy trying to understand why you are so useless. Instead I can get you to become perfectly comfortable with the futility of your existence in just 10 minutes. That\u2019s why there is Ten in the title. And don\u2019t be put off by the word Zen. I\u2019m not trying to turn you into a Buddhist monk. The publishers just said I needed a word that rhymed with ten.</p> <p>Before we start the workout, I want you to lie down and relax. Perhaps you are feeling stressed about not being able to complete the workout in 10 minutes. Don\u2019t be. Ten is only there to rhyme with zen. Deep. If your workout overruns by a minute that is still OK. Because 11 also sort of rhymes with zen. And ten. That\u2019s the symmetry of my psychic world.

      "bodyText": "Hi. It\u2019s me, Owen, and I want you to know that I\u2019m here for you. Thank you for picking up my book. It means a lot that you have chosen to put your trust in me. I\u2019m guessing that, since you have managed to read this far, you are probably feeling something has been missing from your life. That something has been me. With my workout you can be the person you have always wanted to be. What makes my approach so different is that it doesn\u2019t demand you waste years in therapy trying to understand why you are so useless. Instead I can get you to become perfectly comfortable with the futility of your existence in just 10 minutes. That\u2019s why there is Ten in the title. And don\u2019t be put off by the word Zen. I\u2019m not trying to turn you into a Buddhist monk. The publishers just said I needed a word that rhymed with ten. Before we start the workout, I want you to lie down and relax. Perhaps you are feeling stressed about not being able to complete the workout in 10 minutes. Don\u2019t be. Ten is only there to rhyme with zen. Deep. If your workout overruns by a minute that is still OK. Because 11 also sort of rhymes with zen. And ten. That\u2019s the symmetry of my psychic world. Ten to Zen is based on my professional work with my patients. Some of whom are A-list celebrities. And some of whom are complete nobodies. Like you. Welcome. I\u2019m glad you have joined me. My workout is based on the latest cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness research, much of which has been discredited by other professional psychotherapists.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019ll leave you be for the afternoon. Over in the men\u2019s Premier League, Everton and Bournemouth is about 27 minutes in, and Nick Ames is on hand to take you through it. Here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack\u2019s match report: Here\u2019s Joe Montemurro: \u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough today. They exploited the spaces and played through us. The end of the year will determine if it\u2019s a big result for the title race. The soccer gods aren\u2019t smiling on us [with all the injuries], and we\u2019re having to compromise how we play.\u201d Emma Hayes speaks, holding her son Harry, who appears to have a glove on his foot: \u201cArsenal made a game of it when it shouldn\u2019t have been a game. It\u2019s not good for me heart, but a brilliant advert for the women\u2019s game. The team are gutted they\u2019ve given up a goal: that\u2019s their mentality.\u201d That\u2019s the first time Arsenal have lost at home in near enough three years, which is pretty remarkable. Chelsea move up to third in the table for the moment, but that could change if Birmingham turn things around. Colossal win for Chelsea and probably the title race in general. Arsenal, their team sliced and diced with injury, woke up in the last ten minutes or so and made the closing stages pretty hairy, but really Chelsea should have won much more convincingly. Chelsea now go to within two points of the Gunners, who still have a game in hand, but by the end of the day Arsenal might be no longer top of the table. That said, one of the teams who could overhaul them, Birmingham City, are already 1-0 down to Bristol, while Manchester City kick-off at 3pm against West Ham. Peeeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins +4: Little takes the corner at the second attempt, the first having been thwarted due to two balls being on the pitch. Lindahl comes out and gets a half-punch on the ball, but Chelsea smuggle it clear and that might just be that. 90 mins +3: A long ball causes some chaos in the Chelsea defence, as Little brings it down with her head and is inches away from being clean through, but the most last-ditch of last-ditch challenges from Eriksson nicks the ball away. What a finish to this game! 90 mins +2: We\u2019re into the second of four minutes stoppage time. Kirby chases a long clearance into the corner but can\u2019t haul it in. 90 mins: Miedema nearly goes through on her own! She picks the ball up outside the box just to the left, powers past/through two defenders but her shot is saved at the near post. She probably should\u2019ve had a penalty too: Carter got a good fistful of her shirt, but because she stayed up and went for the shot nothing was given. 88 mins: Chelsea counter and Blundell slides a ball through for the run of Kirby, who checks back onto her left foot from the right channel inside the box, but there wasn\u2019t much power to her shot and Peyraud-Magnin saves. 86 mins: Andersson carelessly gives a free-kick away near the right corner of the box. Chelsea, somehow, look rattled. Little puts the cross over and Miedema is implausibly unmarked at the near post, but she doesn\u2019t quite get hold of the header and Lindahl saves with ease. 84 mins: Should mention: just before the goal Ingle went into the book for absolutely ploughing through McCabe\u2019s calves. She looked astounded that the foul was given, pointing at the ball in textbook fashion, and was even more dismayed when the yellow card came out. The referee probably rather politely explained that getting the ball isn\u2019t much good when you\u2019ve had to batter through muscle to reach it. 83 mins: Corner for Arsenal which Bright heads away. There\u2019s more energy and urgency from Arsenal here: great, but they could\u2019ve done with showing it a bit earlier. 82 mins: If Chelsea contrive not to win this, you\u2019d think that Emma Hayes will tell the coach to drive away and the players can make their own way home. 80 mins: Scored by Miedema, but that was all Kim Little\u2019s work. She drove in from the right, got to near the byline in the box and put over a strong low cross which Miedema, perfectly placed on the edge of the six yard box, turns home. Now then. 79 mins: Great chance for Riley as she finds herself in some space in the left channel, but takes a ropey touch and compounds the issue by playing a terrible pass in theory towards Kirby. 78 mins: Miedema, who frankly has had sod all else to do, is penalised for a foul on Spence as Arsenal try to do some attacking. Meanwhile Chelsea make a final sub: England is off, and Jess Carter is on. 77 mins: Arsenal dip into their meagre resources: Arnth goes off, to be replaced by fellow Dane Katrine Veje. Theoretically an attacking change, that, but it might be too late to make an impact. 74 mins: Andersson puts the cross into the middle, Bright gets up the highest but her glanced header is put behind for a corner, with Spence lurking. Arsenal rather frantically defender, the ball hitting Arnth\u2019s arm but not deliberately, before she and another defender leave it for each other. Spence has a shot which is deflected behind, but that second corner is cleared properly. 73 mins: Ingle tries a pass down the line from Riley, who holds it up and eventually McCabe is penalised for a foul on Andersson. Safe to say the Arsenal full-back didn\u2019t agree with the decision, but Chelsea have a free-kick from a decent position on the left flank. 70 mins: Get this: another Arsenal player is down, this time Quinn requiring attention. Think she might\u2019ve got a smack in the nose from someone, possibly accidental, but there is some blood to be stemmed. 69 mins: Arsenal make a brief foray into the Chelsea half, and Millie Bright blocks a cross behind for a corner. McCabe crosses and the hitherto under-employed Lindahl flaps at it a little, but Chelsea manage to clear. 66 mins: Double sub for Chelsea: no hat-trick for Cuthbert, as she\u2019s replaced by Ali Riley, while Kirby is introduced in place of Carney. No mercy here from Emma Hayes. 65 mins: The scoreline does now reflect the balance of play a little more. Hard to see a way back for Arsenal from here. 63 mins: Ingle sticks a big one into the mixer which England goes up for, but the ball drops to Cuthbert who hits a volley at goal. It\u2019s pretty near Peyraud-Magnin who gets a hand to it, but allows the ball through and into the net. Not great all round for Arsenal there: Cuthbert was in absurd amounts of space on the edge of the box, and the keeper should have done better. And there it is! 62 mins: Even more good news for Arsenal: looks like Fran Kirby is preparing to come on. 59 mins: Chelsea just aren\u2019t letting Arsenal create anything: Little winds up for a big pass from midfield, only to have it whipped from \u2018neath her feet by a well-timed Cuthbert challenge. 57 mins: Miedema chases a ball through as Arsenal desperately try to claw their way back into the game, but once again no dice as Eriksson swoops in to clear. GOA....NO! 55 mins: Chelsea have the ball in the net, after a lovely Carney clipped cross was headed home at the back stick by England, but her head and shoulders were leaning just offside. In a rare piece of correct officiating, the offside is given, met by a barrage of invective from England. 54 mins: Cuthbert makes a forward run down the inside-left channel, but her flick right to play in England goes awry. 51 mins: Neither team have really got going in the second-half so far. Blundell tries a big diagonal that drifts out of play. 49 mins: Blimey, I hadn\u2019t quite realised the referee didn\u2019t even give a free-kick for that. Lord. Some generous officiating in this game so far. Evans looks to be OK, though. 48 mins: Oh lord another injury for Arsenal: an extremely beefy challenge from Eriksson chops Evans to the ground, and she needs some attention. 46 mins: We\u2019re away again, and Mitchell gets stuck in straight away with a run down the left, but the ball goes out for a goal kick to Chelsea. The players are back out, and Arsenal are making a change: Beth Mead, who tweaked her knee before the break, hasn\u2019t come out for the second-half, with Emma Mitchell coming on in her place. Another injury for Arsenal: they\u2019re basically the equivalent of the Black Knight from Monty Python at this stage. The goal... It sort of seems churlish to suggest Chelsea might not be entirely happy with how things stand, but they\u2019ve been so dominant that only being 1-0 ahead at the break probably qualifies as a disappointment. You could say they didn\u2019t quite put the boot on the throat after opening the scoring as they should have done, and given Arsenal\u2019s attacking record this might come back to bite them. Peeeeeeeeeep. Precisely nothing happened in those minutes of injury time. 45 mins: Three minutes of added time. Mead will at least try to continue. 44 mins: Another injury concern for Arsenal, a team with injury concerns coming out of their ears: Beth Mead is down having jarred her knee in the middle of the park, sliding forward as she attempted to block a pass. Could be nasty, that. Remember Arsenal only have three outfield players on the bench. 40 mins: The suggestion from people in the ground is that the referee - Rebecca Welch - didn\u2019t actually see that incident, didn\u2019t check with the fourth official (about four yards in front of whom the incident happened) but booked Carney anyway. Baffling. 38 mins: Eesh, Carney pretty lucky to avoid a red card. Carney makes a run off the ball and as she runs past McCabe goes down - probably tripped, but slightly difficult to tell. She certainly thinks it\u2019s a trip, because she rapidly gets to her feet and drops McCabe with a meaty barge to the abdomen. I think she was booked, but even though the trip was underhand to say the least, I\u2019m not really sure how, if the referee saw it, that\u2019s all she got. 36 mins: Cuthbert tries a shot from outside the area that she drags wide. Shortly afterwards, Spence drives into the box and goes over the outstretched leg of Quinn, but no penalty is given and really Spence doesn\u2019t really appeal very much. Looked very much like a foul from the replay. 35 mins: Nearly a chance for Arsenal: Williamson makes tracks down the right and puts in an early low cross to the near post. Evans misses it under pressure from a defender and Miedema is just beaten to it in the middle, but that qualifies as a clear opportunity considering the balance of play. 33 mins: Chelsea attack through the middle as Ji approaches the box, but is crowded out. They could do with getting at least one more before the break in this continuing period of dominance, because you\u2019d think Arsenal can\u2019t be this bad again after the break. 32 mins: Arsenal try something like an attack from the left but McCabe\u2019s cross is...no good. Joe Montemurro looks pensive on the bench. 31 mins: Mead concedes a free-kick in midfield for a push on Ji, and flaps her arms in frustration. Not frustration at the decision, you\u2019d think, but more at the general state of the game. 28 mins: Chelsea on the attack once again, but her curled cross from the left is behind England. This is no more than Chelsea deserve - they\u2019ve been entirely dominant and haven\u2019t allowed Arsenal to play or create anything of note. 27 mins: Lovely interplay down the right by Chelsea sets up Blundell, coming forwards from right-back, to stick over a terrific cross from the right. Cuthbert has a good run on it and meets the ball perfectly, with a couple of Arsenal defenders getting in each other\u2019s way, and Cuthbert absolutely batters the header home. And it had been coming. 24 mins: Miedema goes down in the box after chasing a pass through with Eriksson, but doesn\u2019t look too perturbed about things. 23 mins: Cuthbert brings down a long pass nicely on her chest, but takes a touch too many before shooting, allowing Quinn to block the effort. 22 mins: A quiet few minutes. Chelsea have done brilliantly to pen Arsenal back with their smothering forward press, but haven\u2019t broken through to complement their dominance so far. 19 mins: Excellent bit of old school football as Lisa Evans runs down the right and is shoulder-barged off the ball by Andersson. Evans quite literally left the ground after being fairly challenged, tossed aside like a rag doll. 17 mins: Peyraud-Magnin has been a busy old bee so far, and is thoroughly unimpressed with what she perceived to be a rough aerial challenge from England. Looked fine to me, but goalkeepers do go off like car alarms whenever a striker goes anywhere near them, and she gets the free-kick. 16 mins: Another huge chance for Chelsea. Carney again on the right, she skips past McCabe as if she\u2019s avoiding a very small traffic cone, hits a strong cross into the middle which is missed by England and at least two defenders. For some reason Millie Bright finds herself in the box, free and eight yards out, but she almost seems to get her legs in a mess and can only direct towards goal with her thigh, and Peyraud-Magnin saves easily. 15 mins: Now Arsenal attack for the first time properly, and Miedema wins a corner on the left. But they do little with it and Chelsea counter, an attack that only fizzles out when Cuthbert runs out of support and is dispossessed just outside the Arsenal area. 13 mins: All Chelsea so far. Ji gets her foot on the ball for the first time but her shot from about 20 yards out is blocked easily enough. 12 mins: A foul throw! McCabe is the careless one, and has a chuckle after being penalised. But it does set up an attack for Chelsea: Cuthbert powers through the middle and slips it right to Carney, briefly swapping flanks, but her fizzed ball behind the defence is just a little strong for England. 10 mins: Huge chance for Chelsea. Ingle plays a strong pass to England just outside the box, who in turn offloads it quickly to Carney who finds herself in space and through on goal, but maybe her first touch is just a hair too heavy, and she allows Peyraud-Magnin to rush out and block. 9 mins: Good pressing from Chelsea so far, causing Arsenal keeper Peyraud-Magnin to panic a little and boot a pass straight out of play in their own right-back position. 7 mins: Eriksson spreads a big diagonal from left to right and picks out Cuthbert, but her cross looking for England in the middle doesn\u2019t beat the first defender. 4 mins: Slight formation tweak from the one I suggested: looks more like a 4-2-3-1 for Chelsea with Cuthbert and Carney on the flanks, and Ji tucked in behind England. 3 mins: Eriksson wastes the chance, giving the free-kick just a little too much welly. In fact, the ball might well be still rising, and takes a while to be retrieved having sailed over the very small stand and into the street behind. 2 mins: Early chance for Chelsea as they win a free-kick right on the edge of the box. Beth Mead \u2018helps out\u2019 her defence by tracking Cuthbert back on the right side of the box, but she only succeeds in barging her opponent over. 1 min: We\u2019re away. Chelsea kick-off, shooting from right to left. Although that description doesn\u2019t help you massively if you can\u2019t actually see the game. Sorry. Carry on. The players are coming out, each holding the hand of a mascot. The one accompanying Arsenal skipper Kim Little was almost taller than her and looked suitably embarrassed. Phil Neville is in the house, apparently. Although, the old \u2018if the opposite was true it would be more interesting\u2019 test does apply here: you would bloody hope he would be. Emma Hayes speaks: \u201cArsenal are in the driving seat - the pressure\u2019s on them, and for us to win the title it\u2019s a really slender chance. We\u2019re talking about an unbelievable Arsenal team going forwards. We respect them, and know they\u2019re the team in position to win the title.\u201d Joe Montemurro speaks: \u201cWe just felt it was better to keep her [Van de Donk] out, with all the other injuries we have. This championship will go right down to the wire, it\u2019s going to be a very tight league.\u201d Looks like players from both teams are a little in the wars. That\u2019s that one explained, then. Simon Burnton went to speak to Arsenal manager Joe Montemurro this week. Have a good old read: I\u2019m of Italian descent and Italians know how to defend a lead, but I don\u2019t park the bus,\u201d Montemurro says. \u201cWe play our style. We\u2019ll go out there and play how we need to play. Will we adjust a couple of things? Obviously. But it\u2019s about winning, and it\u2019s about winning in our style, and the way we do it. Interesting team news, then. We knew Jordan Nobbs would be missing for Arsenal, but the absence of Danielle van de Donk is more of a surprise. Equally I expected Fran Kirby, who scored twice against Reading last time out after an injury absence, to start for Chelsea, but she\u2019s only on the bench: presumably Ji will play just behind Cuthbert and England. Arsenal Peyraud-Magnin; Williamson, Quinn, Arnth, McCabe; Bloodworth, Walti, Little; Evans, Miedema, Mead Subs: van Veenendaal, Mitchell, Kuyken, Veje Chelsea Lindahl; Andersson, Eriksson, Bright, Blundell; Ingle, Carney, Spence; Ji; Cuthbert, England. Subs: Telford, Asante, Carter, Kirby, Cooper, Bachmann. Pivotal game for Chelsea, this. If Arsenal win, then the defending Women\u2019s Super League champions will be more or less out of the title race, eight points back from the Gunners having played a game more. You could make an argument that the title race as a whole might be at least on its way to being done, depending on how Manchester City and Birmingham City get on later this afternoon. But should Chelsea win, and both Cities also prevail, then the top four in the table will be separated by three points, and we could be on for not so much a race but a hugely entertaining scramble over the remaining nine or ten games. The good news for those of you looking for such a thing is that Chelsea are in good form, having last dropped points in mid-October, and have only conceded five league goals all season. But the remarkable thing is that those five goals came in one game, in the space of about 46 minutes, against Arsenal. So the message from that is anything could happen in this game. Should be a belter. Stay tuned. Kick-off: 12.30pm GMT.",

That is something we will not do.\u201d</p> <p>Sturgeon had come under pressure to make the referral, which under the Scottish government\u2019s rules can only be made by a first minister, from senior figures in the Scottish National party.</p> <p>Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, said Sturgeon had done the right thing by heeding opposition calls for her to refer herself. But there still needed to be a separate Scottish parliament investigation into the entire episode, with Holyrood also given powers to review the ministerial code inquiry.</p> <p>\u201cTransparency is now absolutely essential in order for the public to have confidence in the first minister and the Scottish government,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we should also see a full, public parliamentary inquiry in to what exactly has happened \u2013 and I look forward to working constructively with members from other parties this week in order to secure that.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, Kevin Pringle, Salmond\u2019s former spin doctor and a former communications chief for the SNP, urged her to do so quickly. \u201cThe first minister will have to be bold and candid\u201d to allow her to rebuild the party\u2019s reputation, he said.</p> <p>Pringle was Salmond\u2019s chief spokesman when the then first minister made several self-referrals under the ministerial code. Salmond was exonerated of any breach each time.</p> <p>Writing in the Sunday Times, Pringle said the \u201cdrip-drip of information coming out slowly is poison\u201d for Sturgeon\u2019s government and the SNP. He said it undermined the case for independence if the civil service that would run an independent Scotland could not be trusted.</p> <p>\u201cLast week was torrid for Sturgeon, and it can\u2019t go on like that,\u201d Pringle said. \u201cShe should lead the charge for an independent, external inquiry into the whole business, covering the conduct of ministers and officials. It may be uncomfortable, but it\u2019s the only path to better ground.\u201d</p> <p>It also emerged that Salmond\u2019s claims the Scottish government leaked confidential data about the sexual harassment allegations against him are being investigated by a watchdog\u2019s criminal offences unit.</p> <p>The Herald on Sunday reported that the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), which polices the UK\u2019s data protection legislation, passed Salmond\u2019s complaints to its criminal investigations desk in November last year. </p> <p>Two women filed formal complaints of sexual harassment against Salmond in January last year under the Scottish government\u2019s new ministerial complaints system.</p> <p>In late August, Evans confirmed the cases had been investigated and reports had been handed to the police after news of the inquiry leaked. The leak triggered Salmond\u2019s complaints to the ICO alongside a judicial review of the government\u2019s handling of the investigation.</p> <p>The Herald on Sunday reports the ICO wrote to Salmond last year to say that based on the information he provided, an offence in breach of section 170 of the Data Protection Act \u201cmay have been committed\u201d. That section prohibits the unlawful obtaining or disclosure of personal data.</p> <p>The government\u2019s case dramatically collapsed last week after Evans admitted that the civil servant who investigated the complaints had already been counselling both women, a conflict of interest in breach of the complaints process.</p> <p>Evans\u2019s future is now in doubt, with some senior SNP figures predicting she will be forced out. Sturgeon\u2019s decision to refer herself under the ministerial code will take some of the pressure off Evans.</p>",

Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, said Sturgeon had done the right thing by heeding opposition calls for her to refer herself. But there still needed to be a separate Scottish parliament investigation into the entire episode, with Holyrood also given powers to review the ministerial code inquiry. \u201cTransparency is now absolutely essential in order for the public to have confidence in the first minister and the Scottish government,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we should also see a full, public parliamentary inquiry in to what exactly has happened \u2013 and I look forward to working constructively with members from other parties this week in order to secure that.\u201d On Sunday, Kevin Pringle, Salmond\u2019s former spin doctor and a former communications chief for the SNP, urged her to do so quickly. \u201cThe first minister will have to be bold and candid\u201d to allow her to rebuild the party\u2019s reputation, he said. Pringle was Salmond\u2019s chief spokesman when the then first minister made several self-referrals under the ministerial code. Salmond was exonerated of any breach each time. Writing in the Sunday Times, Pringle said the \u201cdrip-drip of information coming out slowly is poison\u201d for Sturgeon\u2019s government and the SNP. He said it undermined the case for independence if the civil service that would run an independent Scotland could not be trusted. \u201cLast week was torrid for Sturgeon, and it can\u2019t go on like that,\u201d Pringle said. \u201cShe should lead the charge for an independent, external inquiry into the whole business, covering the conduct of ministers and officials. It may be uncomfortable, but it\u2019s the only path to better ground.\u201d It also emerged that Salmond\u2019s claims the Scottish government leaked confidential data about the sexual harassment allegations against him are being investigated by a watchdog\u2019s criminal offences unit. The Herald on Sunday reported that the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), which polices the UK\u2019s data protection legislation, passed Salmond\u2019s complaints to its criminal investigations desk in November last year. Two women filed formal complaints of sexual harassment against Salmond in January last year under the Scottish government\u2019s new ministerial complaints system. In late August, Evans confirmed the cases had been investigated and reports had been handed to the police after news of the inquiry leaked. The leak triggered Salmond\u2019s complaints to the ICO alongside a judicial review of the government\u2019s handling of the investigation. The Herald on Sunday reports the ICO wrote to Salmond last year to say that based on the information he provided, an offence in breach of section 170 of the Data Protection Act \u201cmay have been committed\u201d. That section prohibits the unlawful obtaining or disclosure of personal data. The government\u2019s case dramatically collapsed last week after Evans admitted that the civil servant who investigated the complaints had already been counselling both women, a conflict of interest in breach of the complaints process. Evans\u2019s future is now in doubt, with some senior SNP figures predicting she will be forced out. Sturgeon\u2019s decision to refer herself under the ministerial code will take some of the pressure off Evans.",

There was the prelude to the speech, in which Trump invited network bosses to lunch and told them he didn\u2019t, in fact, want to be on TV at all, but his advisers were making him. There was the Democratic rebuttal and the subsequent memes.

The Democrats\u2019 refusal to approve the money is another.\u201d</p> <p>In a move that strayed beyond satire, AP then adjusted its own fact check to better conform to the facts.</p> <p>The Trump Show is a live experiment in what happens when the complete fusion of politics, technology and public entertainment occurs. Journalists and politicians alike struggle to find a footing that keeps them simultaneously relevant and rational. As Trump was sniffing uncomfortably behind his desk on Tuesday, potential contenders for 2020 were popping up on Instagram using the platform\u2019s fleeting Stories function, frolicking with their dogs or <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/10/politics/beto-orourke-dentist-instagram/index.html\" title=\"\">having their teeth cleaned</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the southern border, where the real policy story is playing out, there was scant coverage of <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2019/01/06/patriot-movement-protesting-phoenix-churches-housing-asylum-seekers/2496373002/\" title=\"\">fringe groups harassing asylum seekers sheltered by churches</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/shutdown-stalls-immigration-courts-already-facing-a-tremendous-backlog-of-cases\" title=\"\">the wider story about the growing crisis in processing immigration cases</a> was eclipsed.</p> <p>This time next year we will be in full-on primary season as part of the run up to the 2020 election, and the era of Trump might be drawing to a close. The television networks and press corps might imagine there will then be a return to normality. But this heightened environment of mediated and unmediated communications is the new reality.</p> <p>Interaction between politicians, the public and the press has been permanently altered. The fourth wall has come down far faster than the border wall could ever be constructed. As yet it is not entirely clear that the commercial media has decided what role it could \u2013 or should \u2013 play in this changed world.</p>",

A more nuanced point is that journalists employed by the same networks are often subject to abuse and even physical danger because of Trump\u2019s hostility to the press: CNN correspondent Jim Acosta had his press credentials withdrawn for upsetting the president, and Katy Tur of NBC had to be given secret service protection at Trump rallies during his campaign. Allowing a president noted for his untruthfulness access to their networks arguably put protocol above national interest, or perhaps, more honestly, prioritised ratings over principle. Brian Stelter, CNN\u2019s media editor, told the New Yorker he thought the decision was driven by tradition: \u201cIt is not that television networks are unaware or uninterested in the president\u2019s mendacity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that tradition, that custom, of broadcasting the president simply outweighs the concerns.\u201d Given the refusal to allow Obama airtime, this argument looks a trifle disingenuous, made more so by the attendant ratings. The speech and an accompanying rebuttal by Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were seen by more than 43 million viewers. Trump remains strong box office. The viewing figures are, however, only one aspect of a series of coordinated events. There was the prelude to the speech, in which Trump invited network bosses to lunch and told them he didn\u2019t, in fact, want to be on TV at all, but his advisers were making him. There was the Democratic rebuttal and the subsequent memes. There was the discussion about the speech (see above) and there was the fact checking which has now become a media event in itself. The assumption that the speech might be false and misleading opened up the opportunity for a fact-checked meta-narrative to run alongside the event. The (non-profit) Associated Press won the prize for worst use of fact checking with a tweet that read: \u201cAP fact check: Democrats put the blame for the shutdown on Trump. But it takes two to tango. Trump\u2019s demand for $5.7bn for his border wall is one reason for the budget impasse. The Democrats\u2019 refusal to approve the money is another.\u201d In a move that strayed beyond satire, AP then adjusted its own fact check to better conform to the facts. The Trump Show is a live experiment in what happens when the complete fusion of politics, technology and public entertainment occurs. Journalists and politicians alike struggle to find a footing that keeps them simultaneously relevant and rational. As Trump was sniffing uncomfortably behind his desk on Tuesday, potential contenders for 2020 were popping up on Instagram using the platform\u2019s fleeting Stories function, frolicking with their dogs or having their teeth cleaned. Meanwhile, on the southern border, where the real policy story is playing out, there was scant coverage of fringe groups harassing asylum seekers sheltered by churches. And the wider story about the growing crisis in processing immigration cases was eclipsed. This time next year we will be in full-on primary season as part of the run up to the 2020 election, and the era of Trump might be drawing to a close. The television networks and press corps might imagine there will then be a return to normality. But this heightened environment of mediated and unmediated communications is the new reality. Interaction between politicians, the public and the press has been permanently altered. The fourth wall has come down far faster than the border wall could ever be constructed. As yet it is not entirely clear that the commercial media has decided what role it could \u2013 or should \u2013 play in this changed world.",

It\u2019s difficult to make out exactly what he says \u2013 the fans are not above the occasional teenybopper scream \u2013 but it\u2019s something about this being the peak of their careers. You can see why he might feel like that: the SSE Hydro is heaving, and barely a month after the release of the 1975\u2019s third album, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, their largely late-teen and early-twentysomething audience appear to have memorised the whole thing, singing along word-perfect and greeting Give Yourself a Try and It\u2019s Not Living (If It\u2019s Not With You) as if they were the band\u2019s greatest hits. Their success is founded both on Healy\u2019s charisma \u2013 he\u2019s very good at the business of being a pop star, confessional interviews, grand pronouncements and all \u2013 and the way they\u2019ve carved out a unique, liminal space in the current pop landscape.

The region has a long history of salt mining, with the voids used for other purposes including records from the National Archive. The first 10 of Storengy\u2019s caverns were finished and operational from 2016, and it has since added five more, with a final five due for completion by December. Catherine Gras, the company\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cI think we need to have gas storage because it is really important for the gas and electricity markets. Not just during events such as the Beast from the East, though that was a good example. \u201cWe have more and more renewables, the electricity market is more unpredictable. The backup is the gas. We need flexible assets.\u201d Gras said there \u201cwas a market to do more\u201d storage, but she could not justify the investment because of the high costs, in particular business rates. The tax on property makes up around half of all costs the firm incurs, she said. Energy intensive industries and unions have lobbied the government to support more gas storage following last year\u2019s cold spring weather, which forced National Grid to warn the UK of a gas shortfall. MPs are also investigating whether the UK has enough storage after the country\u2019s biggest facility, accounting for about three-quarters of gas stores, closed due to ageing infrastructure. Centrica\u2019s Rough gas store off the coast of Yorkshire closed in 2017. The government has rebuffed previous calls to support new gas storage, saying the fact supplies did not run out last winter showed the market was working. But Gras said she was frustrated by that approach to storage and the government risked being complacent. \u201cThey tend to think because gas has worked for decades it will go on working,\u201d she said. That was no longer guaranteed because so much storage had been closed, Gras added. The government said: \u201cOver the past 10 years, analysis undertaken by the government and others has delivered a consistent message: that our gas system is secure, with GB supplies able to meet gas demand even under severe weather conditions for an extended period of time.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Houthi rebels in Yemen have threatened to launch more drone attacks after a deadly strike last week on a Yemeni government military parade killed seven people, stoking tension between the warring parties and threatening UN efforts to broker peace. Houthi spokesman Yahya Sarea said Thursday\u2019s drone strike on a military base in Lahaj province, which killed several people, was a \u201clegitimate operation against aggression\u201d. He said the movement was building a stockpile of locally manufactured drones. \u201cSoon there will be enough in the strategic stockpile to launch more than one drone operation in multiple battle fronts at the same time,\u201d Sarea told reporters in the Houthi-held capital, Sana\u2019a, on Sunday. The Houthi statement came as Britain said it was pressing ahead in seeking an enhanced mandate for a UN mission to oversee a ceasefire in the port city region of Hodeidah, despite claims by the Saudi-backed Yemeni government that the Houthis were not implementing the agreements struck between the parties in talks in Stockholm last month. The Yemeni intelligence chief, Brig Gen Saleh Tamah, died on Sunday from injuries sustained in the Houthi drone attack on Thursday. The attack was outside the ceasefire zone, but has been condemned by the US as a breach of the spirit of the Stockholm agreement. In a further development, Houthi negotiators boycotted a meeting of the UN\u2019s ceasefire monitoring body, the Redeployment Coordination Committee, on Sunday, saying the UN special envoy was using the committee to pursue other agendas. Britain is nevertheless planning to table a fresh security council resolution next week to give a UN team in Hodeidah a fresh mandate after the current one expires on 21 January. The new mandate will give the UN mission, overseen by the retired Dutch general Patrick Cammaert, enhanced powers to monitor the compliance of the parties to the ceasefire in Hodeidah governorate, and the mutual redeployment of forces from Hodeidah, and the ports of Salif and Ras Isa. The mission will also discuss with both sides how security in the city of Hodeidah and the ports can be overseen by \u201ca new local security force in compliance with Yemeni law\u201d, a vague phrase in the Stockholm agreement that has so far been interpreted differently by the parties. The Yemeni government claims the agreement means its forces can start policing the city, something the Houthis \u2013 currently in control of the city \u2013 reject. Hodeidah is the lifeline port for aid across Yemen. The fresh resolution is also likely to result in an increase in the number of UN monitors capable of overseeing breaches of the ceasefire, with a total team of 75. The monitors may be drawn from other UN existing missions in Yemen or sent to the country for this specific purpose. Both sides are accusing the other of repeated ceasefire breaches, and pressure is being applied on the US by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to do more to condemn the Houthis. Key issues remain access to humanitarian supplies, administration of the port of Hodeidah, the pullback of Houthi forces from the city and the composition of the new security force. Few diplomats would deny that the agreement is only being partially honoured, even if they would argue the levels of violence in the area have fallen. The Aid group Oxfam is one of many that fear that the vagueness of the ceasefire could lead to its collapse. Dina El-Mamoun, Oxfam\u2019s head of policy and advocacy in Sana\u2019a, recently said: \u201cThere is an issue with the actual agreement, which is actually quite vague.

That snake is moved from the margins of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s tale to the centre of the latest book by AL Kennedy. <em>The Little Snake</em> is about a little girl called Mary, who lives in an unnamed town where they fly kites from the rooftops \u2013 \u201csome looked like birds of paradise, some looked like fish and some looked like wonderful serpents\u201d. The snake comes to visit Mary and her kindness to him forges a lifelong bond between the two, eventually causing the snake\u2019s lifeless heart to start beating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We seem to be living through a bright moment in the literary life of the fable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The snake reveals his name is Lanmo \u2013 Haitian for death \u2013 and we understand that usually his appearance means the end of a life. We follow him to a number of victims, some of them evil, some good, and for each he \u201copened his beautiful mouth and his tiny needle teeth shone white as bone\u201d. However, he confides in Mary that humans have recently been taking death into their own hands. \u201cIt seemed strange to the snake that so many humans would use so many ingenious machines and so many ingenious excuses and so many ingenious methods to rush each other out of the world, when all of them must leave their lives in any case.\u201d</p> <p>Mary grows older, wars are fought and the city Mary lives in grows shabbier and darker. The snake attempts to help Mary escape.</p> <p>We seem to be living through a bright moment in the literary life of the fable. I kept thinking of Mohsin Hamid\u2019s hauntingly fabular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/12/exit-west-mohsin-hamid-review-refugee-crisis\" title=\"\"><em>Exit West</em></a> as I was reading <em>The Little Snake</em> \u2013 it shares the anonymous cityscape, the leaps through time, the clarity of the almost childlike language; more than anything, though, it shares that book\u2019s sense of carrying a deep moral message about modern life.</p> <p>Kennedy\u2019s slim, suggestive fable is about the need for kindness to strangers; it\u2019s about greed and politics; it\u2019s about migration. It\u2019s about the lessons we learn from the books we read as kids. What <em>The Little Snake</em> is about more than anything, though, is the acceptance of death as an ineluctable part of life. It\u2019s not a new message, but Kennedy conveys it here in a manner that is subtle and hugely moving.</p> <p>If you know a child \u2013 or an adult \u2013 who has lost someone, give them this book.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Little Snake </em>by AL Kennedy is published by Canongate (\u00a39.99).

      "bodyText": "In Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s much-loved The Little Prince a slippery, sinister snake appears who \u201ctwined himself around the little prince\u2019s ankle, like a golden bracelet\u201d. That snake is moved from the margins of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s tale to the centre of the latest book by AL Kennedy. The Little Snake is about a little girl called Mary, who lives in an unnamed town where they fly kites from the rooftops \u2013 \u201csome looked like birds of paradise, some looked like fish and some looked like wonderful serpents\u201d. The snake comes to visit Mary and her kindness to him forges a lifelong bond between the two, eventually causing the snake\u2019s lifeless heart to start beating. The snake reveals his name is Lanmo \u2013 Haitian for death \u2013 and we understand that usually his appearance means the end of a life. We follow him to a number of victims, some of them evil, some good, and for each he \u201copened his beautiful mouth and his tiny needle teeth shone white as bone\u201d. However, he confides in Mary that humans have recently been taking death into their own hands. \u201cIt seemed strange to the snake that so many humans would use so many ingenious machines and so many ingenious excuses and so many ingenious methods to rush each other out of the world, when all of them must leave their lives in any case.\u201d Mary grows older, wars are fought and the city Mary lives in grows shabbier and darker. The snake attempts to help Mary escape. We seem to be living through a bright moment in the literary life of the fable. I kept thinking of Mohsin Hamid\u2019s hauntingly fabular Exit West as I was reading The Little Snake \u2013 it shares the anonymous cityscape, the leaps through time, the clarity of the almost childlike language; more than anything, though, it shares that book\u2019s sense of carrying a deep moral message about modern life. Kennedy\u2019s slim, suggestive fable is about the need for kindness to strangers; it\u2019s about greed and politics; it\u2019s about migration. It\u2019s about the lessons we learn from the books we read as kids. What The Little Snake is about more than anything, though, is the acceptance of death as an ineluctable part of life. It\u2019s not a new message, but Kennedy conveys it here in a manner that is subtle and hugely moving. If you know a child \u2013 or an adult \u2013 who has lost someone, give them this book. \u2022 The Little Snake by AL Kennedy is published by Canongate (\u00a39.99).

Of course, many online influencers have well-stocked wardrobes and bathroom cabinets, and are given the items they use and wear in posts, or are paid to wear them, but Ormerod is committed to not wearing any new products or clothes she is given. \u201cReally I just want to reassure people they don\u2019t have to spend a wedge on fashion every month to look stylish and there\u2019s no such thing as \u2018so last season\u2019 any more,\u201d she says. \u201cTrue style has never been about that anyway.\u201d",

It took 10 years, while at the same time raising two children, to build up experience and perfect my Italian.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver, 52, went on to establish her own firm in 2013, but now faces uncertainty over whether her qualification as an Italian lawyer can or will be revoked, or if she can continue to practise as a British solicitor.</p> <p>Her rights to healthcare, a pension and freedom of movement within the EU, which is crucial for her job, are also at risk. She is applying for Italian citizenship, but that process now takes about four years, instead of two, under new rules recently approved by parliament.</p> <p>\u201cIt is immoral, and I believe illegal, that any person who has been given EU citizenship, and then exercised free movement, can be told our rights could be taken away,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>The psychologist: Matt Bristow, Berlin</h2> <p>Matt Bristow returned to Berlin last summer fearing it could be his last chance.

After that, he says there will be a hard border at the Channel whatever anyone claims, and his business will have to adapt. \u201cFrictionless trade does not exist outside the single market. Once the UK is unplugged from the EU system that lets trucks go straight through Dover \u2026 Our strategy I guess will be to use the transition period to move some business away from the UK.\u201d The lawyer: Charlotte Oliver, Rome The Italian government has said British nationals in Italy would remain legally resident, keeping their existing rights to work, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but myriad concerns remain. \u201cI believed it would be easy to get a job in the legal world in Italy \u2013 it was Europe and opportunities were growing,\u201d says Charlotte Oliver, a lawyer, who moved to Italy in 2001 to join her Italian boyfriend and became the first British solicitor to be admitted to the Italian bar council thanks to a new EU directive. \u201cIt was in fact very tough. It took 10 years, while at the same time raising two children, to build up experience and perfect my Italian.\u201d Oliver, 52, went on to establish her own firm in 2013, but now faces uncertainty over whether her qualification as an Italian lawyer can or will be revoked, or if she can continue to practise as a British solicitor. Her rights to healthcare, a pension and freedom of movement within the EU, which is crucial for her job, are also at risk. She is applying for Italian citizenship, but that process now takes about four years, instead of two, under new rules recently approved by parliament. \u201cIt is immoral, and I believe illegal, that any person who has been given EU citizenship, and then exercised free movement, can be told our rights could be taken away,\u201d she says. The psychologist: Matt Bristow, Berlin Matt Bristow returned to Berlin last summer fearing it could be his last chance. A 33-year old psychologist, he had always intended to live again in the German capital, where he owns a flat. Brexit forced a decision. \u201cI have always felt happiest here and I felt the need to grab this opportunity while I still have it,\u201d said Bristow, who quit the NHS earlier than planned and now works for a local authority in Berlin. Despite being fluent in German and doing part of his psychology training in the country, getting his qualifications recognised was not easy: it involved 18 months of form filling, language tests and legal translations costing hundreds of euros. At least the cost of living is cheaper than London: \u201cI never felt like I had much money at the end of the month despite being in a reasonably well-paid professional job.\u201d But he is increasingly anxious about no-deal Brexit, as his contract expires in the summer. \u201cMy worry is that I might be caught in a catch-22, that it will be harder to convince new employers to employ me if I haven\u2019t got a clear residence permit, but for some residence permits you need to have a job or a clear offer of work.\u201d While the referendum result left him devastated, he now feels frustrated with the process and believes British nationals in the EU have been forgotten by British politicians. \u201cWe are out of sight and out of mind.\u201d The job-seeking academic: Louise Howes, Lund After finishing her PhD Louise Howes, 30, moved to southern Sweden in 2015 to take up a research post in the astronomy department at Lund University, a contract that is up at the end of February. \u201cMy fiance is also British \u2013 we\u2019re getting married this summer \u2013 and his contract runs another five years,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to stay in Sweden, we like it. So I\u2019m currently job hunting, for something maybe in research project management or data science.\u201d Howes says she feels a \u201cconstant underlying nervousness\u201d about what Brexit may bring, a \u201clevel of added stress I really don\u2019t need \u2026 We\u2019ve been told it will all be fine, but there\u2019s nothing in writing. If you\u2019re in full employment it should be quite straightforward, people say \u2013 but what if you\u2019re not?\u201d She is also applying for jobs in Copenhagen, less than an hour\u2019s commute away across the Oresund Bridge. \u201cLots of people do it, in both directions,\u201d Howes says. \u201cBut I have absolutely no clue whether as a British citizen I\u2019ll be allowed to after Brexit. Non-Europeans have had problems, I know.\u201d More generally, she says, she is, like almost everyone in the university sector, \u201cacutely aware not just of the damage it will do to British universities but the problems it\u2019s going to cause for EU academics and researchers in Britain, and Britons in European universities\u201d. The pensioners: Les and Louise Buchanan, Barcelona As the hours tick by towards the Brexit deal vote on Tuesday, Les Buchanan, 75, and his wife, Louise, 71, in Barcelona find themselves assailed by an all too familiar sensation. \u201cIt\u2019s the uncertainty,\u201d says Les Buchanan, who worked as a diplomat for 40 years before retiring to Spain in 2000. \u201cOnce you know something, you can face up to it.\u201d He still feels exasperated at being denied a vote in the referendum because he had lived outside the UK for too long. But the pressing concern is what happens next, especially if the UK crashes out. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what the Spanish government line will be,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re covered by the local health service and the British government pays the Spanish government for expats who were in the British system. Will that cease?\u201d He is also worried his sterling pension could take another knock and that the British government could use Brexit as an excuse to freeze expat pensions. But he is grateful that at least he and his wife should be able to weather the financial loss. \u201cFor young people embarking upon their lives and being denied the benefits and freedoms the EU provides, it borders on the criminal,\u201d he says. The couple have taken the necessary tests to acquire Spanish nationality but Les Buchanan is holding off renouncing his British citizenship, as he would have to: \u201cI\u2019m very pissed off, but not pissed enough to say I\u2019m not British any more.\u201d",

Labour\u2019s plan on Brexit, as decided at the party\u2019s conference, is to seek a general election first, and only if this cannot happen then look at the possibility of a second referendum. While a large majority of party members, according to polling, want Corbyn to actively seek a new referendum, the Labour leader has previously said it is more likely he would push to take the UK out of Europe with a different deal. Corbyn declined to say whether a Labour manifesto for a snap election would promise to deliver Brexit, arguing that this would be up to party processes, but strongly indicated his preference would be to depart with a deal that kept the UK in a customs union and with access to the single market. Asked what he would want to deliver on Brexit if there were an election and he became prime minister, Corbyn said: \u201dAt the very minimum, a customs arrangement with the European Union that gives us a say of what goes on but also avoids the whole issue of the problems of Northern Ireland, which this deal does.\u201d Corbyn said: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is we\u2019re campaigning for a country that is brought together by investment,\u201d adding that people were \u201cvery, very angry about the way they\u2019ve been treated in their different communities around the country\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Here\u2019s something I learned the hard way: if you\u2019re taking driving lessons as an adult, it\u2019s generally a good idea not to mention it in public. I discussed my driving lessons in a book I wrote last year, for instance, and it\u2019s pretty much all that anyone has wanted to talk about ever since. \u201cCan you drive yet?\u201d they\u2019ll ask me by way of introduction. \u201cHave you passed your test?\u201d</p> <p>Every time this has happened, I\u2019ve had to drop my head, avoid eye contact and apologetically mumble that no, I haven\u2019t passed yet, sorry, but I guess I might soon. Because, in truth, I stopped learning. I had a few lessons for the book and then just sort of drifted away. Has it stopped people asking about it? No. No, it hasn\u2019t.</p> <p>But at least now I can shut them up. Because last month, at the grand age of 38, I finally passed my driving test. Two months of learning, six minor faults, one reverse parallel park with the handbrake on and I still managed to pass first time.</p> <p>Actually, let me walk that back a little. I <em>sort of</em> passed first time. I passed first time <em>this</em> time. If we\u2019re going to be picky and count every single driving test I\u2019ve ever taken in my entire life, then I actually passed on my eighth attempt. Because I first took driving lessons as a teenager, and it\u2019s fair to say the whole thing went horribly. Back then I took test after test after test; some where I racked up an impossible number of minors, some where I kept indicating the wrong way, one where the examiner had to physically lean over and wrench the steering wheel from my hands to stop me from hitting a parked car. It got so desperate that, at the caf\u00e9 where I worked, a middle-aged waitress once gave me a Temazepam to take before my next test to calm me down. I didn\u2019t take it, but nevertheless it was a solid sign that things had got undeniably bad.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They were heavy, speeding, exploding missiles of metal and glass that would definitely kill you if they had the chance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, I\u2019m also treating the fact that I have now passed as a solid sign that people are capable of change. Twenty years ago, I cannot remember a time spent behind the wheel \u2013 either in lessons or on tests \u2013 where I wasn\u2019t utterly paralysed with fear. To me, cars were the things I\u2019d spent my entire childhood learning to avoid. They were heavy, speeding, exploding missiles of metal and glass that the Green Cross Code Man made perfectly clear would definitely kill you if they had the chance. I was hit by a car when I was 14, so I knew how much they hurt. What sort of idiot would want to be responsible for controlling one?</p> <p>My time driving was spent tying myself up in knots, second-guessing everything until I was entirely unmoored. My nights were worse; full of anxiety dreams about speeding through residential areas in a car with no steering or brakes. Teenage me never stood a chance of passing his test. He was far too panic-stricken for that.</p> <p>Besides, teenage me didn\u2019t actually want to drive. He was taking lessons out of misplaced duty, out of a vague sense that this was something he should probably do. He was reluctantly being pushed along by the expectation of others and, God knows, that always ends in disaster.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t even want to drive when I took lessons for my book. I needed a chapter that demonstrated a growing intimacy between me and my brother, so I asked him to teach me how to drive. The lessons were good \u2013 and he made for a surprisingly decent instructor \u2013 but I packed it in as soon as I\u2019d got enough material for the chapter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7fd1413c8dcd0c8e0604a9307032a3413a705f36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fd1413c8dcd0c8e0604a9307032a3413a705f36/0_598_8018_4813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart Heritage looking terrified in the reflection of the rear view mirror and the back of his head, a blurred view through the windscreen of the car he's driving\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018At the caf\u00e9 where I worked, a middle-aged waitress once gave me a Temazepam to take before my next test\u2019: Stuart Heritage on the road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This time, though, I wanted to drive. I had a reason to pass my test \u2013 and that reason was my second kid. With one child, you can easily cadge lifts off people. There\u2019s plenty of room for you, your partner, a baby seat and the driver. Add a second baby seat into the mix, though, and the backseat becomes an impossible squeeze of held breath and looming deep-vein thrombosis. So I had no choice but to bite the bullet. If we were to get around as a family, it needed to be in a family car.</p> <p>I\u2019ve discovered a lot about myself as an adult learner driver, but this feels like the most universal lesson. If I\u2019m going to do anything in life, it had better be for a very good reason. If I just let myself drift around on the tepid current of duty, the results will always be disappointing. Give me a purpose, though, and I\u2019ll get there in the end. And the purpose doesn\u2019t even need to be particularly dramatic. This time it was my low-level desire to take my kids to a Center Parcs. Obviously I reserve the right to post-rationalise a better purpose if I go to Center Parcs and hate it.</p> <p>Perhaps less universally, I\u2019ve also come to realise that I might have a tiny problem with authority. On one hand this is a good thing, because teenage me was so absurdly deferent to everyone else that even making eye contact with another person felt like an act of obscene intimacy. Grown-up me has a more defined sense of self. Again, this might be down to having kids. When you\u2019re a dad you have to become A Dad, a figure of benevolent authority who knows everything and can do everything and is always there. A Dad needs to have his shit together 24/7, whether he likes it or not.</p> <p>However, I\u2019m also a self-employed writer. I don\u2019t have a boss. Nobody has told me what to do for 15 years. They\u2019ve made suggestions, but most times I get the final say. For the past decade and a half I\u2019ve been a tinpot dictator in a one-man nation, ruling over a land of no absolutes or consequences with an iron fist. So my first few driving lessons, where I had to hand over my authority to a stranger whose job was to issue me with strict instructions, were hard. I bristled at the thought of being told what to do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Having a driving lesson gave me a whole hour to limit my concentration to just one thing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But then I realised that roads are full of absolutes. They\u2019re packed with consequences. Steer the wrong way, look the wrong way, disobey the rules even for a second, and you\u2019ll end up in serious trouble. There is always a right answer and a wrong answer, and it\u2019s only when I realised this that I started to improve. It gets harder to learn new things as you grow older, and so I had to very deliberately open myself up enough to absorb new information. Learning how to be vulnerable to new things again was tough, but great. Hopefully I\u2019ll never lose that ability again.</p> <p>Best of all, I think I actually understand why people like driving now. All these years, the appeal of it had completely eluded me.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s something I learned the hard way: if you\u2019re taking driving lessons as an adult, it\u2019s generally a good idea not to mention it in public. I discussed my driving lessons in a book I wrote last year, for instance, and it\u2019s pretty much all that anyone has wanted to talk about ever since. \u201cCan you drive yet?\u201d they\u2019ll ask me by way of introduction. \u201cHave you passed your test?\u201d Every time this has happened, I\u2019ve had to drop my head, avoid eye contact and apologetically mumble that no, I haven\u2019t passed yet, sorry, but I guess I might soon. Because, in truth, I stopped learning. I had a few lessons for the book and then just sort of drifted away. Has it stopped people asking about it? No. No, it hasn\u2019t. But at least now I can shut them up. Because last month, at the grand age of 38, I finally passed my driving test. Two months of learning, six minor faults, one reverse parallel park with the handbrake on and I still managed to pass first time. Actually, let me walk that back a little. I sort of passed first time. I passed first time this time. If we\u2019re going to be picky and count every single driving test I\u2019ve ever taken in my entire life, then I actually passed on my eighth attempt. Because I first took driving lessons as a teenager, and it\u2019s fair to say the whole thing went horribly. Back then I took test after test after test; some where I racked up an impossible number of minors, some where I kept indicating the wrong way, one where the examiner had to physically lean over and wrench the steering wheel from my hands to stop me from hitting a parked car. It got so desperate that, at the caf\u00e9 where I worked, a middle-aged waitress once gave me a Temazepam to take before my next test to calm me down. I didn\u2019t take it, but nevertheless it was a solid sign that things had got undeniably bad. However, I\u2019m also treating the fact that I have now passed as a solid sign that people are capable of change. Twenty years ago, I cannot remember a time spent behind the wheel \u2013 either in lessons or on tests \u2013 where I wasn\u2019t utterly paralysed with fear. To me, cars were the things I\u2019d spent my entire childhood learning to avoid. They were heavy, speeding, exploding missiles of metal and glass that the Green Cross Code Man made perfectly clear would definitely kill you if they had the chance. I was hit by a car when I was 14, so I knew how much they hurt. What sort of idiot would want to be responsible for controlling one? My time driving was spent tying myself up in knots, second-guessing everything until I was entirely unmoored. My nights were worse; full of anxiety dreams about speeding through residential areas in a car with no steering or brakes. Teenage me never stood a chance of passing his test. He was far too panic-stricken for that. Besides, teenage me didn\u2019t actually want to drive. He was taking lessons out of misplaced duty, out of a vague sense that this was something he should probably do. He was reluctantly being pushed along by the expectation of others and, God knows, that always ends in disaster. I didn\u2019t even want to drive when I took lessons for my book. I needed a chapter that demonstrated a growing intimacy between me and my brother, so I asked him to teach me how to drive. The lessons were good \u2013 and he made for a surprisingly decent instructor \u2013 but I packed it in as soon as I\u2019d got enough material for the chapter. This time, though, I wanted to drive. I had a reason to pass my test \u2013 and that reason was my second kid. With one child, you can easily cadge lifts off people. There\u2019s plenty of room for you, your partner, a baby seat and the driver. Add a second baby seat into the mix, though, and the backseat becomes an impossible squeeze of held breath and looming deep-vein thrombosis. So I had no choice but to bite the bullet. If we were to get around as a family, it needed to be in a family car. I\u2019ve discovered a lot about myself as an adult learner driver, but this feels like the most universal lesson. If I\u2019m going to do anything in life, it had better be for a very good reason. If I just let myself drift around on the tepid current of duty, the results will always be disappointing. Give me a purpose, though, and I\u2019ll get there in the end. And the purpose doesn\u2019t even need to be particularly dramatic. This time it was my low-level desire to take my kids to a Center Parcs. Obviously I reserve the right to post-rationalise a better purpose if I go to Center Parcs and hate it. Perhaps less universally, I\u2019ve also come to realise that I might have a tiny problem with authority. On one hand this is a good thing, because teenage me was so absurdly deferent to everyone else that even making eye contact with another person felt like an act of obscene intimacy. Grown-up me has a more defined sense of self. Again, this might be down to having kids. When you\u2019re a dad you have to become A Dad, a figure of benevolent authority who knows everything and can do everything and is always there. A Dad needs to have his shit together 24/7, whether he likes it or not. However, I\u2019m also a self-employed writer. I don\u2019t have a boss. Nobody has told me what to do for 15 years. They\u2019ve made suggestions, but most times I get the final say. For the past decade and a half I\u2019ve been a tinpot dictator in a one-man nation, ruling over a land of no absolutes or consequences with an iron fist. So my first few driving lessons, where I had to hand over my authority to a stranger whose job was to issue me with strict instructions, were hard. I bristled at the thought of being told what to do. But then I realised that roads are full of absolutes. They\u2019re packed with consequences. Steer the wrong way, look the wrong way, disobey the rules even for a second, and you\u2019ll end up in serious trouble. There is always a right answer and a wrong answer, and it\u2019s only when I realised this that I started to improve. It gets harder to learn new things as you grow older, and so I had to very deliberately open myself up enough to absorb new information. Learning how to be vulnerable to new things again was tough, but great. Hopefully I\u2019ll never lose that ability again. Best of all, I think I actually understand why people like driving now. All these years, the appeal of it had completely eluded me. Say I wanted to travel across the country; driving would mean staying on high alert for the whole journey, limiting my concentration to just one thing. I\u2019d much rather take the train, where I can spread out, have a snack, read a book, answer emails, listen to a podcast, maybe do some work. How was that not always the better option? But now that I\u2019m an adult with proper adult responsibilities \u2013 now that I have to juggle equal parenting with enough work to pay the lion\u2019s share of the bills \u2013 I find myself regularly overloading.

The roster of resident yoga teachers changes regularly. I love Mariana Dragan\u2019s hatha flow and yin, which is gentle yet deep (geared more towards beginners and intermediates). The sun shines enough for us to practise outside \u2013 even though it\u2019s November. There\u2019s regular meditation, too, and a powerful sound bath session one evening, where we lie fully clothed as the sound of the gongs wash over us (no getting wet required). There\u2019s also an outdoor hot tub, an infra-red sauna with a huge picture window overlooking the mountains, and treatments from herb-filled baths to reflexology and Swedish massage. What really sets this place apart, though, is the surroundings. We wander up to the nearby \u201cbat cave\u201d (we only spy one clinging to the ceiling) and into the hills beyond; sheep trundle by, their bells tinkling; and a man on horseback waves and gives us directions we don\u2019t understand. At the top of the hill, the Sunday service is in progress in a tiny church \u2013 its interior crammed with murals and old women dressed head-to-toe in black. One afternoon I follow the river at the end of the garden through fairytale forests, passing isolated cottages and a man in a peak-cap chopping wood \u2013 all very Hansel and Gretel. There\u2019s plenty more to do: longer mountain hikes, horse riding, visits to a bear sanctuary \u2013 and Bran Castle, of Dracula fame, is a 15-minute drive down steeply winding roads. The castle is the country\u2019s top tourist attraction, but still bewitching, with secret passages and tales of Vlad the Impaler and Queen Marie who once lived here (Bram Stoker himself actually never visited). Retreats run for five nights, so there\u2019s time to get out and explore without losing that chilled edge (though for the time-pressed, shorter stays are on offer too). On the penultimate day there\u2019s a morning of silence \u2013 a way of deepening the digital detox, keeping the focus inwards and building on the sense of calm. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to breakfast with other guests without talking and I pad around the retreat relishing the total peace. I leave with the feeling I\u2019d like to see this remarkable landscape in different seasons. Even in early winter \u2013 too soon for snow and too late for the russet brush of autumn \u2013 it\u2019s strikingly beautiful. Forget Dracula; Transylvania is the perfect place to step off the world for a while and let nature, good food and gentle yoga get to work. \u2022 The trip was provided by Akasha Wellness Retreat, which has three-night all-inclusive retreats from \u20ac497 or five nights from \u20ac698, flights extra. Akasha also runs retreats in Goa and Costa Rica, and 27-day yoga teacher training programmes. Flights were provided by Wizz Air, which flies to Bucharest from five UK airports from \u00a318 one-way",

It said that it usually takes more than a year to prepare a facility for a CAA production organisation approval audit, but the Airlander Technology Centre was audit-ready within six months. The aircraft, which can take off and land from almost any flat surface, reached heights of 7,000ft and speeds of up to 50 knots during its final tests. It could be used for a variety of functions, including surveillance, communications, transporting freight, delivering aid and passenger travel, according to HAV.

      "body": "<p>The US government shutdown, which is soon to enter its fourth week, is affecting travel, small business loan approvals, passport administration, national park services, food inspections and tax return processing. Most Americans can live with that at least for a while.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/10/congress-small-business-certainty-gridlock\">The new Congress will do nothing for small business \u2013\u00a0and that's fine by us | Gene Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s another consequence of the shutdown that could soon rattle American society: a disruption in the deliveries of craft beer. New beer labels must be approved in advance by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau \u2013 which is part of the US treasury department \u2013 and because of the standstill in Washington this is not happening.</p> <p>The result? Manufacturers of craft beers \u2013 many of whom are small businesses \u2013 are feeling the pinch. Thousands of applications are piling up and revenues are going, well, untapped.</p> <p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t gotten to a critical point yet, but it\u2019s enough that you\u2019re noticing,\u201d Geoff Dale, the self-proclaimed \u201cminister of mayhem\u201d at Three Heads Brewing <a href=\"https://13wham.com/news/local/craft-beers-tapped-by-government-shutdown\">told 13WHAM.com.</a> \u201cWe don\u2019t want something that was supposed to be out in January to come out in April. You go for a bigger, heartier beer in winter.\u201d (Warning to all those pols in Washington DC: you probably don\u2019t want to mess with someone who goes by the name \u201cminister of mayhem\u201d.)</p> <p>This is not just a growing crisis for craft brewers. Other liquor manufacturers are also having problems with the shutdown.

      "bodyText": "The US government shutdown, which is soon to enter its fourth week, is affecting travel, small business loan approvals, passport administration, national park services, food inspections and tax return processing. Most Americans can live with that at least for a while. But there\u2019s another consequence of the shutdown that could soon rattle American society: a disruption in the deliveries of craft beer. New beer labels must be approved in advance by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau \u2013 which is part of the US treasury department \u2013 and because of the standstill in Washington this is not happening. The result? Manufacturers of craft beers \u2013 many of whom are small businesses \u2013 are feeling the pinch. Thousands of applications are piling up and revenues are going, well, untapped. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t gotten to a critical point yet, but it\u2019s enough that you\u2019re noticing,\u201d Geoff Dale, the self-proclaimed \u201cminister of mayhem\u201d at Three Heads Brewing told 13WHAM.com. \u201cWe don\u2019t want something that was supposed to be out in January to come out in April. You go for a bigger, heartier beer in winter.\u201d (Warning to all those pols in Washington DC: you probably don\u2019t want to mess with someone who goes by the name \u201cminister of mayhem\u201d.) This is not just a growing crisis for craft brewers. Other liquor manufacturers are also having problems with the shutdown.

Unfortunately, the standstill in Washington has halted these plans. \u201cOh my gosh, it\u2019s going to impact us greatly,\u201d one of the brewery\u2019s founders said in a CBS4 report. \u201cIt\u2019s not only affecting us, it\u2019s affecting every distillery in Indiana and across the country.\u201d In addition to the suspension in new product offerings, some beer and alcohol producers are not able to get approval to sell their existing products across their state lines, and the owners of newer or expanding breweries may be forced to sign leases on buildings not knowing when they will eventually be able to manufacture their product.

It wasn\u2019t the prospect of getting older that alarmed her, but that she had still not written a novel and sent it to an agent, as she had been promising herself. It was now or never, she thought, and she got to work.</p> <p>\u201cI was writing in a frenzy,\u201d says Braithwaite, speaking from her home in Lagos, Nigeria. \u201cI asked myself: \u2018Are you really going to turn 30 never having sent out a novel to an agent? You say you want to achieve this dream but you haven\u2019t even tried!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t expect the draft to sell. She had not written for a while and conceived the story of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/04/my-sister-the-serial-killer-by-okyinkan-braithwaite\" title=\"\">My Sister, the Serial Killer</a></em> \u2013 a combination of deadly sexual attraction, psychosis, murder and sibling loyalty \u2013 as a way of flexing her writing muscles. \u201cThe book was a way back out of my writer\u2019s block. I wanted to do something fun for myself.\u201d</p> <p>A month later, in September 2017, she had completed the first draft for what would become her sensational debut; the book sold both at home, in Nigeria, and in Britain and the US, well before she hit her milestone birthday in March last year.

Its sparky black comedy makes it something of a satire-meets-slasher, but its broader, more serious themes include timely explorations of violence against women and psychotic female rage.</p> <p>Was the story inspired by the flood of testimonies that emerged out of the #MeToo movement? No, says Braithwaite, \u201cthe idea first came when I read about the black widow spider [who eats the male of the species after mating with them]\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Nigeria, Braithwaite shuttled between London and Lagos as she was growing up (her parents are Nigerian-born British citizens) and she now considers both cities to be home in different ways. She fell in love with poetry in her UK primary school, returning to Lagos to go to secondary school, then back to London to sit her A-levels and do a law and creative writing degree at the Kingston University. She took a job for a while as an editor in the Lagos publishing house Kachifo, but left to work on her own writing.</p> <p>For a time, poetry took precedence \u2013 she was among the top 10 finalists in Lagos\u2019s Eko Poetry Slam in 2014 \u2013 but then she realised she wanted to focus on prose. In 2016, she was shortlisted for the <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthwriters.org/\" title=\"\">Commonwealth short story prize</a> for The Driver, which featured a relationship between a young woman from a wealthy Nigerian family and a chauffeur, and dealt with issues of class, wealth and exploitative love.</p> <p>This debut is not her first attempt at writing a full-length novel: she had already completed two novels before she began this one, but they have not been sent to an agent. The first is a romance with a tragic ending, and the second a fantasy epic which also plays with the black widow idea: \u201cIt has this tribe of Amazonian women, like the black widow spiders, who spend a lot of time going from village to village, slaughtering men.\u201d</p> <p>Even though she feels that the second manuscript is too messy for publication, she hopes to return to the genre. \u201cI\u2019d like to try writing fantasy because it has everything \u2013 you can have crime and romance and the magic of it is that it allows you to stay connected to your childhood self.\u201d</p> <p>But for now, she is satisfied at having met her own deadline: \u201cWhen I began writing this novel, the idea of having it rejected [by a publisher] was better than knowing that I had dreamed of doing it but that I hadn\u2019t tried at all. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arifa-akbar\" title=\"\">Arifa Akbar</a></strong></p> <h2>Alex Michaelides: \u2018Agatha Christie made me a reader and a writer\u2019</h2> <p><strong>The Silent Patient (Orion, February)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be8199e8563743e42857d7e5aa12677fab2f91f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be8199e8563743e42857d7e5aa12677fab2f91f9/1020_740_2640_1783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Michaelides\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When Alex Michaelides was growing up in Cyprus, there were long, hot summers which he and his sister would spend at the beach. The summer he turned 13, he borrowed his sister\u2019s collection of Agatha Christie novels and read one every couple of days. \u201cThey were the first adult books I read, the first time that I\u2019d ever disappeared into someone else\u2019s world. Christie made me a reader and a writer.\u201d</p> <p>Almost three decades later, Michaelides, 41, has written a debut novel with a narrative to rival that of his boyhood literary heroine. <em>The Silent Patient</em> is a taut, meticulously plotted and compelling novel that has earned advance praise from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lee-child\" title=\"\">Lee Child</a>, Stephen Fry and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/oct/17/review-the-finisher-david-baldacci\" title=\"\">David Baldacci</a>. It was the subject of a seven-way publisher auction and has so far sold in 40 foreign territories, a record for a UK debut thriller.</p> <p><em>The Silent Patient</em> is narrated by Theo Faber, a psychotherapist determined to discover why Alicia Berenson, a famous artist accused of murdering her husband, has refused to speak since her husband\u2019s death. The therapeutic setting was inspired by Michaelides\u2019s own experience. \u201cTherapy is very important to me and has been a major part of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI was in individual therapy twice a week for about 10 years and then I was in group therapy for quite a while. All the raw emotional stuff is my own. I put a lot of myself into the book.\u201d</p> <p>Running through the novel is the Greek myth of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcestis\" title=\"\">Alcestis</a>, and Euripides\u2019s play of the same name. Michaelides says he has been \u201chaunted\u201d by the play since reading it at school as a teenager: \u201cIt\u2019s something about feeling unlovable and unworthy that I related to. And a sense of being damaged, I guess. At that point in my life I felt quite damaged That\u2019s probably why it haunted me.\u201d</p> <p>The Alcestis theme is perhaps one of the reasons that <em>The Silent Patient</em> is finding such traction both among early readers and the tranche of movie executives who fought to option it. With its story of female sacrifice and the silencing of a woman post-trauma, it feels highly relevant in a post #MeToo world. \u201cIt\u2019s about silence as a weapon,\u201d Michaelides says. \u201cAnd it was very clear in my head when I was writing the book that Alicia was surrounded by these men who were imprisoning her. Like Alcestis, Alicia is trapped and she\u2019s denied a voice. It\u2019s a lifetime of being made to think that she wasn\u2019t worthy, she wasn\u2019t good enough, and maybe that\u2019s something that a lot of women [readers] have been responding to.\u201d</p> <p>The novel has already been optioned by Brad Pitt\u2019s production company, Plan B, with Michaelides due to write the screenplay, a fitting circularity for a novelist who has spent the past 15 years working as a screenwriter.</p> <p>After an English degree at Cambridge University, he took a screenwriting course at the American Film Institute and embarked on a career in a film industry he found \u201csoul destroying\u201d. He was on the brink of giving up writing when he decided to have one last throw of the dice: \u201cI thought, \u2018Before I give up writing, I\u2019m going to try and write the one thing I always wanted to write\u2019, which was an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery with a deeper psychological complexity.\u201d</p> <p>Novel writing, he discovered, was his natural medium: \u201cBeing able to move into someone\u2019s head \u2013 it\u2019s totally liberated me. In a film, you have to keep moving. In a book, you can go down rabbit holes, go into internal monologues. The opportunity to really slow down was a revelation.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of the hype surrounding the novel, Michaelides is circumspect about his pre-publication success: \u201cEven now I\u2019m so ridiculously happy when someone says they like it.\u201d It is a novel, he says, that asks the question: can you get over your childhood?</p> <p>And what\u2019s the answer?</p> <p>\u201cThat if you hold yourself in awareness, then you can. Otherwise you\u2019re destined to re-enact it.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-beckerman\" title=\"\">Hannah Beckerman</a></strong></p> <h2>Elizabeth Macneal: \u2018It\u2019s all about what it means to be stifled and how to achieve freedom\u2019</h2> <p><strong>The Doll Factory (Picador, May</strong><strong>)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be721c0b41ed3a058cd1821fbf2f5c3476d42fd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be721c0b41ed3a058cd1821fbf2f5c3476d42fd2/1150_479_2498_1682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth MacNeal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When <a href=\"http://elizabethmacneal.com/\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Macneal</a> was a teenager she began to collect literary classics \u2013 not in handy paperbacks like most bookworms her age, but in antique editions, which she would track down in charity shops or antiquarian bookstores. \u201cAll of my friends spent their money on alcohol and drugs and I would say, \u2018Sorry, I can\u2019t go out tonight because I\u2019ve just bought 14 volumes of Shakespeare\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Neatly stacked by author, they dominate the living room of her small east London house. \u201cThey are the epitome of ornament versus function. I read one of the Hardys but spilt tea on it and cracked the spine,\u201d she says -, so her reading is now confined to humbler copies.</p> <p>The obsessiveness of collectors powers one strand of her debut novel, <em>The Doll Factory</em>, while the other centres on the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/pre-raphaelite\" title=\"\">pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</a>, the group of precocious young painters and poets who faced down the Victorian art establishment. Though initially she assumed these two subjects belonged to different novels, gradually she realised that they dovetailed neatly in the story of a talented working-class girl who is adopted as a model by an up-and-coming artist while being stalked by a creepy taxidermist.</p> <p>Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais lounge in the background as the story of Iris unfolds: she is a shadow version of <a href=\"http://lizziesiddal.com/portal/\" title=\"\">Lizzie Siddal</a>, the model for Millais\u2019s drowned Ophelia, who was also an artist in her own right. Released from the drudgery of painting the faces on children\u2019s dolls after negotiating art lessons in exchange for modelling, Iris finds herself posing for hours on end as the mythological Queen in a grand painting which is to be entered for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Exhibition\" title=\"\">the Great Exhibition in 1851</a>.</p> <p>Her new independence is exhilarating, dizzying, terrifying \u2013 and constantly endangered by the men she encounters along the way. \u201cI guess for me the whole book is an exploration of freedom and imprisonment; what it means to be stifled and how it feels to achieve creative and literal freedom,\u201d says Macneal. \u201cIt\u2019s also about what it means to be held back by both an individual and a society that don\u2019t seem to have room for a woman to transcend her class and gender.\u201d</p> <p>Jacketed in luminous blue, and clearly targeted at fans of Tracy Chevalier\u2019s <em>Girl </em><em>With a Pearl </em><em>Earring</em> and Jessie Burton\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/29/the-miniaturist-jessie-burton-review\" title=\"\">The Miniaturist</a></em>, the novel has a vivid energy of its own \u2013 bringing a painterly eye to the tricks of the pre-Raphaelite trade: a dash of emerald to emphasise lips; a lush resinous gloss \u201cto make the Queen\u2019s fur-trimmed dress shine like stained glass\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise to find that the 30-year-old author is also an artist. She has a fully equipped pottery in her garden shed, though she came late to the artisanal life. Born and brought up in Edinburgh, the eldest of three children, she graduated from Oxford University (where her passion for Victorian clutter found its first expression in \u201cactually a rather bad\u201d thesis) to a job with a management consultancy.</p> <p>Though safe and lucrative, the job was her own version of Iris\u2019s doll emporium, so she decided to strike out by signing up for pottery classes. \u201cI loved the peace of it and \u2013 particularly working as part of a big company where I couldn\u2019t even explain what I did \u2013 the satisfaction of turning this lump of earth into something useful and beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Her pots began to sell, enabling her to leave her job and pursue her other interest: writing. By the time she enrolled on a creative writing MA at the University of East Anglia she had already had two novels rejected. \u201cI thought I\u2019d go on the course and write some short stories,\u201d she says, but her tutors pushed her towards another novel. She entered a Scottish prize for unpublished writers with half a manuscript, racing through the last 50,000 words after it was accepted. That early draft of <em>The Doll Factory</em> not only won her <a href=\"https://thecaledonianovelaward.com/\" title=\"\">the Caledonia award</a> but secured her an agent and had publishers beating at her door: 14 of them fought to win it, and television rights were snapped up.</p> <p>As the build-up to publication begins, she has retreated to her pottery shed, where 250 tiny saucers are cooling in a kiln \u2013 each decorated in delicate gold leaf with a wombat. Rossetti famously kept one as a pet, and a female wombat called Guinevere wreaks merry havoc in <em>The Doll Factory</em>, before expiring \u2013 much like Rossetti\u2019s \u2013 after a feast of cigars and chocolate. Except the chocolate was Macneal\u2019s own elaboration, on the advice of a vet friend, who pointed out that cigars alone would probably not have been fatal.

All the same, when she began writing <em>The Confessions of Frannie Langton </em>\u2013 the story of a former slave from a Jamaican plantation accused of the murder of her master and mistress, in whose London home she is employed as a maid \u2013 Collins had the \u201cvague idea\u201d of doing something gothic.</p> <p>Around the same time, she read the biography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/25/fortunes-of-francis-barber-by-michael-bundock-review-samuel-johnson\" title=\"\">Francis Barber</a>, the former slave given to Samuel Johnson, which sent her down a deep rabbit hole of stories about West Indians in England long before the Windrush generation.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted a Jamaican woman in Jane Austen territory,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to see what would happen to someone like Frannie making her presence felt in these sophisticated Georgian drawing rooms.\u201d</p> <p>Today, 46-year-old Collins splits her time between the Caribbean and London, \u201cparallel lives\u201d she\u2019s lived since coming to boarding school in England at the age of 11. Despite her love affair with novels, she studied law at the London School of Economics and then worked in trust litigation for 17 years, a career she describes as \u201cprofessionally but not personally fulfilling\u201d.</p> <p>She also brought up five children: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit <em>Brady Bunch</em>,\u201d she laughs, as she had two kids and then married a widowed father of three; so despite always knowing that she wanted to write, she couldn\u2019t find the time.</p> <p>About 10 years ago she gave up law to concentrate on being a stay-at-home mother. \u201cHaving it all is a mantra the modern woman is sold, supposedly to make us feel better, but it can make you feel like a failure when you don\u2019t have that balance, when you\u2019re feeling burnt out and short-changed.\u201d</p> <p>It was only when her youngest started secondary school that she felt able to finally start writing.</p> <p>\u201cThe way I look at it now is that you can have it all, but only if you do one thing at a time.\u201d</p> <p>She enrolled in a creative writing MA. Her work in progress was shortlisted for the 2016 <a href=\"https://www.lucy-cav.cam.ac.uk/fictionprize/the-prize/\" title=\"\">Lucy Cavendish prize</a>, and she found an agent before she\u2019d finished the course. On the evening before the novel was planned to go to a nine-way auction, Viking made an offer too good to refuse. The book\u2019s also been optioned for TV \u2013 Collins is currently working on the adaptation. Not that the writing process was easy: \u201cNothing I have ever done, including raising five children, was harder than writing this novel.\u201d</p> <p>From Charlotte Bront\u00eb through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sarahwaters\" title=\"\">Sarah Waters</a> (at the novel\u2019s heart is a love story between Frannie and her white mistress), <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/04/alias-grace-review-margaret-atwood-netflix\" title=\"\">Alias Grace</a></em> and Jean Rhys\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/25/review-wide-sargasso-sea-jean-rhys\" title=\"\">Wide Sargasso Sea</a></em>, <em>The Confessions of Frannie Langton</em> draws on a wealth of literary influences, although Collins admits that she\u2019s always found Rhys\u2019s novel \u201cproblematic because it privileges the white Creole experience at the expense of women like Frannie\u201d.</p> <p>As a black woman she feels pressure to \u201cwrite about race in an emotionally honest way\u201d, which is why she wanted Frannie to \u201cchallenge the idea of pure victimhood\u201d.

Having worked for many years as a clinical psychologist in the NHS, her first attempts at writing included forays into historical fiction. But eventually she found herself writing a novel set in her professional domain. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in what people do and why they do things,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I trained as a clinical psychologist. When I began writing it was fundamental for me to think that the characters made psychological sense. It\u2019s a psychological drama rather than a thriller.\u201d</p> <p><em>A Good Enough Mother</em> is about grief, motherhood and the complexities of the therapist-patient relationship. The novel\u2019s narrator is Dr Ruth Hartland, a highly respected psychotherapist and director of a trauma unit whose private life is unravelling: her teenage son has gone missing, her marriage has fallen apart and her relationship with her daughter is strained. When a patient resembling her missing son arrives at the unit, the boundaries between Ruth\u2019s professional judgment and her personal trauma begin to blur, with devastating consequences.</p> <p>Part of Thomas\u2019s motivation was, she says, to humanise therapists: \u201cThe reality is that therapists have crumbling lives like everybody else: marriages that don\u2019t work, children they can\u2019t manage very well\u2026 They are not perfect people but that doesn\u2019t stop them being fantastic therapists.\u201d</p> <p>The novel is immersed in the world of therapy: there are discussions about transference and counter-transference, and references to <a href=\"http://www.melanie-klein-trust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Melanie Klein</a> and <a href=\"http://psychoanalysis.org.uk/our-authors-and-theorists/donald-woods-winnicott\" title=\"\">Donald Winnicott</a>, who first introduced the idea of \u201cthe good-enough mother\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re opening a door on to an intimate world,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cMy aim is that people who are not necessarily ever going to have therapy might find the concepts useful outside the therapy room: that it might change the way they work with a colleague, or how they understand what their child might be feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside an exploration of therapy, the novel examines the aspirations and limitations of motherhood. \u201c[The novel] enables you to grapple with all sorts of dilemmas,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cWhat does it mean to get it right? What do you do if your child is struggling? How much do you bear letting them find their way? I think it\u2019s a real challenge. And I think there\u2019s such a lot of pressure at the moment to get it right.\u201d</p> <p>Integral to Ruth\u2019s narrative is the experience of loss, which, as Thomas observes, is universal. \u201cIt\u2019s something that finds its way into the therapy room in all sorts of guises. I don\u2019t just mean bereavement, but loss of identity or loss of a family member through drugs or alcohol or mental health issues. Loss is such a human condition.\u201d</p> <p>These universal themes led to <em>A Good Enough Mother</em> being the subject of a five-way publisher auction. But Thomas\u2019s route to publication has involved \u201c18 years of hard graft\u201d. She has, she says, become \u201can <a href=\"https://www.arvon.org/\" title=\"\">Arvon</a> junkie\u201d, attending multiple creative writing courses. She likes the collective work done in creative writing groups. \u201cGetting that feedback has definitely altered things I\u2019ve written. If you feel supported and contained then I think you can do your best work.\u201d Writing groups mirror her current role as an organisational consultant, helping mental health teams collaborate and communicate more effectively. \u201cI do love groups. I think it\u2019s fascinating how group processes get played out in organisations.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas now plans to combine writing with her clinical work. \u201cFor me, the leap from therapy to writing wasn\u2019t quite such a leap as it might seem,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of what therapists do is help people tell their life stories. And you write in order to engage and have some kind of connection. So to now have this opportunity to connect with readers through a psychological book is fantastic.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-beckerman\" title=\"\">Hannah Beckerman</a></strong></p> <h2>Isabella Hammad: \u2018Listening to my father, I thought: this would make a great novel\u2019</h2> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>Parisian</strong><strong> (Jonathan Cape, April)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15b8fa60e5a774a78dc919b8ff82697554509520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15b8fa60e5a774a78dc919b8ff82697554509520/1284_523_2703_1699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabella Hammad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Isabella Hammad, 27, was a teenager when she first felt a \u201creal impulse\u201d to be a writer. \u201cIt was Virginia Woolf that made me feel the need to express myself in that way,\u201d she says, but she also had a tale she was itching to tell. \u2018\u2018It was a particular story that I wanted to get out, about my great grandfather Midhat in Palestine. I had heard all these stories about him and I remember the exact moment \u2013 in the back of the car, listening to my father talking about him \u2013 when I thought \u2018This would make a great novel.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>The Parisian</em> is a hugely accomplished historical sweep of a book describing the life and times of young Palestinian dreamer, Midhat Kamal. It encompasses his childhood in Nablus, Palestine, student days in Montpellier, the turbulent years of the first world war and the Palestinian struggle for independence.</p> <p>Hammad is careful to say that while the central character has the same name as her great-grandfather, the book is heavily fictionalised, that she has \u201cjoined the dots imaginatively\u201d. The result is a novel of immense skill and confidence, garnering praise from Zadie Smith, who taught her for a while, and who calls it \u201ca sublime reading experience\u2026 surpassingly intelligent\u201d.</p> <p>Hammad studied at Oxford University then Harvard, and last year won the <em>Paris Review</em>\u2019s Plimpton prize for fiction with a short story called <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/fiction/7035/mr-canaan-isabella-hammad\" title=\"\">Mr Can\u2019aan</a>.

But we didn\u2019t go there as kids\u2026 I went for the first time when I was researching this book, to Nablus to visit my family, and to Ramallah as well.\u201d</p> <p>Her father spent his childhood in Lebanon. \u201cHe was there during the war, when it was very dangerous to be a Palestinian in Lebanon, and so people became shape shifters a little bit. The relationship those of his generation have [with Palestine] can be complicated. In the Palestinian diaspora, people either really commit to the Palestinian cause and talk about it a lot, or they want to assimilate.\u201d</p> <p>A theme in the book, she says, is the pressure Palestinians feel to somehow speak for their whole country. \u201cThis is a struggle many Palestinians face: they don\u2019t want to be defined in this way, to have to be representative. There is no single Palestinian experience. The life of a Palestinian living in Nablus is very different from a Palestinian living in Gaza or Jerusalem. Different from living in Jaffa, Syria or Lebanon. I mean, I\u2019m obviously a mix, but I\u2019m more complex than that, and I don\u2019t think I can be representative in any way.\u201d</p> <p>Before writing the book Hammad spent about a year in the Middle East, researching \u2013 which, she says, was its own adventure. \u201cI interviewed about 80 members of my family, but also I spent a lot of time with historians, geographers and refugees.\u201d</p> <p>Does she feel a little responsibility, having written a book based on the life of a relative who has the same name as the central character? (Her father has read and enjoyed the book.) \u201cYes, in a way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the act of writing often feels irresponsible because you\u2019re in imagination, a dream zone.\u201d</p> <p>Her home is now in Brooklyn, New York, where she has begun work on her next novel, also set in Palestine \u2013 \u201cbut contemporary and shorter!\u201d \u2013 which she has just visited again to do more research. \u201cFor the time being it\u2019s my obsession.\u201d</p> <p>Given the praise <em>The Parisian</em> is already receiving, does she feel the weight of expectation?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not really thinking about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it really helps to have started writing something new. It means that\u2019s where my lifeblood is now. I did the work, I did the book.

It felt so urgent \u2013 there was so much I needed to say, and that gave me the momentum to keep going.\u201d</p> <p>Price, 26, was herself the victim of rape, when she was \u201ctoo young to understand properly\u201d. Through writing the book, she began to make sense of her own experiences, exploring how the assault had \u201cchanged my view of the world\u201d.</p> <p>The novel is an intriguing blend: part comedy of manners, part hard-hitting drama. Price was influenced, she says, by Edward St Aubyn\u2019s blackly comic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/08/at-last-edward-st-aubyn-review\" title=\"\">Patrick Melrose novels</a>, and the idea that \u201cthe more levity and joyful moments you have, the darker you are able to go\u201d.</p> <p>It follows a young woman, Kate Quaile, as she leaves her modest upbringing in rural Gloucestershire for university. There she meets Max Rippon, a charismatic young man from a privileged background. Kate is drawn into Max\u2019s world, and becomes close to his mother, Zara, a successful film director. She becomes increasingly reliant on the Rippons, both emotionally and financially, so when she is assaulted by one of their inner circle, she finds herself trapped.</p> <p>When Price started writing the novel she was working in a literary agency \u2013 a job she had held since graduating three years earlier. She initially worked on the book in the evenings and at weekends, but then quickly realised that she needed to \u201cmake the leap and commit\u201d. She left her job for a more flexible tutoring role, which allowed her to write in the mornings. The gamble paid off: there was a five-way auction among publishers for <em>What Red Was</em>, and film rights have now been bought by the BBC.</p> <p>Of course the book feels timely in the light of the #MeToo movement \u2013 but the project was already well under way when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/the-allegations-against-harvey-weinstein-what-we-know-so-far\" title=\"\">first Weinstein allegations</a> surfaced in October 2017. Some of the echoes in Price\u2019s narrative seem almost uncanny. \u201cWhen it all emerged, I already had a character who was a female film director, who had been assaulted,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Although she praises #MeToo as \u201can incredible movement\u201d, she describes that period as a difficult one for people who have been victims of rape and assault. \u201cIt is really hard to be reminded of it every time you turn on the news. And in some ways it felt as though those experiences were being normalised.\u201d</p> <p><em>What Red Was</em> has allowed Price not only to explore her own legacy of trauma, but also to find a way of speaking out \u2013 the pros and cons of which are explored in the book.</p> <p>\u201cNobody can tell a rape survivor how to behave \u2013 there are a plethora of reasons why speaking out may not be the right thing to do,\u201d she says. \u201cThe one thing you have afterwards is control over how you tell your story. For me, the process of writing has been very empowering.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alice-o-keeffe\" title=\"\">Alice O\u2019Keeffe</a></strong></p> <h2>Beth O\u2019Leary: \u2018I started to notice how many coffee mugs there were by the sink\u2019</h2> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>Flatshare</strong><strong> (Quercus</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> April)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59e350007893c1bbdc12e5ee1313a2d96d24d031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59e350007893c1bbdc12e5ee1313a2d96d24d031/1426_667_2668_1619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosie Price\" width=\"1000\" height=\"607\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was moving house that gave Beth O\u2019Leary, 26, the idea for her first novel. She had been living in London for a couple of years after graduating from Oxford University, working in children\u2019s publishing, but never felt \u201cquite right\u201d in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s so loud and nonstop and just not me,\u201d she says. So she moved back to Winchester, her home town, to share a flat with her boyfriend, Sam, a junior doctor.</p> <p>Ironically, she found she saw even less of him than when she had been living 60 miles away. \u201cHe was working nights and I was commuting to work, so we could go a whole week when there was always one of us asleep in the bed but never [both] at the same time. It was such a weird way to live, being in the same space as him but not actually seeing each other.\u201d</p> <p>She found ways of telling how Sam\u2019s day had been. \u201cI would start to notice how many coffee mugs were by the sink. If his trainers were out, that meant he\u2019d had time to go for a run before he went to bed. And it just got me thinking, \u2018What an interesting thing that is, how close you can feel to someone when you\u2019re in the same physical space but not at the same time. Could two people who don\u2019t know each other become very close living like this?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>That is the big question driving O\u2019Leary\u2019s story about two hard-pressed strangers who decide to save money by sharing a one-bedroom flat. Leon works nights as a nurse, so he occupies the flat during the day, while Tiffy is out at work as a publicist. She has the place to herself the rest of the time. The book, which O\u2019Leary wrote on her laptop during her daily commute, explores Leon and Tiffy\u2019s relationship and their lives as they communicate through Post-It notes, introducing us to an eclectic cast of minor characters, from Leon\u2019s brother, who is in prison, to Tiffy\u2019s controlling ex-partner.</p> <p>Having rented a flat in London herself, where a sewage pipe from the flat above used to leak through her bedroom wall, O\u2019Leary says: \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem at all implausible to me that two people would agree to that kind of arrangement, because so many people I knew were so desperate to find somewhere to live in London, however awful.\u201d</p> <p>Within weeks of her sending the book to an agent it had sold in a pre-emptive deal for six figures, with foreign rights snapped up in 30 countries.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary has always wanted to be a writer. Growing up as one of six children in a noisy household, she spent every spare moment reading books and writing stories. \u201cI just never thought it was really a feasible career path,\u201d she says. Now she has given up her job in publishing to write fulltime. \u201cIt is a total dream,\u201d she says. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaokelly\" title=\"\">Lisa O\u2019Kelly</a></strong></p> <h2>Yara Rodrigues Fowler: \u2018I\u2019d love it if the book made Latin Americans in the UK more visible\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Stubborn Archivist </strong><strong>(Fleet</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> February)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"026a75a6a99c3712dd215aa5f5ebb844f404dd55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/026a75a6a99c3712dd215aa5f5ebb844f404dd55/0_0_5985_4241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yara Rodrigues fowler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yara Rodrigues Fowler\u2019s debut is unlike any other book you\u2019ve read. A blend of prose and poetry, it\u2019s a collection of short pieces that gradually cohere into a larger narrative. But while it\u2019s formally experimental, it never feels like a chore. Holding the disparate elements together is a strong sense of identity and voice \u2013 the development of which is, in fact, partly what <em>Stubborn Archivist</em> is about.</p> <p>Rodrigues Fowler, 26, is a south Londoner, the child of an English father and a Brazilian mother. The book draws on her experience of growing up between those cultures. \u201cI would love it if the book helped to make the Latin American population of the UK more visible,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a heterogeneous community \u2013 racially and in terms of class.\u201d</p> <p>The Latin American diaspora forms one of the UK\u2019s fastest-growing communities, but is not well represented in British literature \u2013 unlike in the US, where there is a strong canon of Latin American authors writing in English (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/junot-diaz\" title=\"\">Junot D\u00edaz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/25/the-king-is-always-above-the-people-daniel-alarcon-review-moving-tales-of-migration\" title=\"\">Daniel Alarc\u00f3n</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/junot-diaz-edwidge-danticat-condemn-dominican-republic-haitian-migrants\" title=\"\">Edwidge Danticat</a>). On this side of the Atlantic, the multicultural experience has been explored mainly by writers with family links to former British colonies.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/zadiesmith\" title=\"\">Zadie Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hanif-kureishi\" title=\"\">Hanif Kureishi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/salmanrushdie\" title=\"\">Salman Rushdie</a>, so they were big influences,\u201d says Rodrigues Fowler, but she also cites Danticat, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alice-walker\" title=\"\">Alice Walker</a>, and the Brazilian oral storytelling tradition. \u201cI grew up listening to musicians like Elis Regina and Caetano Veloso, and I wanted to give the book an oral poetic texture.\u201d</p> <p>Another important thread in <em>Stubborn Archivist</em> is that of sexual violence, and how that can be fed by racial prejudice. The protagonist, who is never named, has a British boyfriend with a taste for Brazilian porn. He asks her to grow her hair so she looks more like Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, and talk in Portuguese in bed. Although the violence is never made explicit, it is clear that these fantasies are the beginning of a process of dehumanisation that leads them to a dark place.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to look at how her Brazilian identity is part and parcel of her experience of sexual assault,\u201d says Rodrigues Fowler, who is the trustee of a refuge for Latin American women. She hopes that people who have experienced sexual violence will read the book and identify with \u201chow you exist in the world after that happens. And recognise that you can be in love with the person who is violent towards you.\u201d</p> <p>Flitting nimbly through generations, between Brazil and south London, between dating and dictatorship, this is a novel that is personal and political \u2013 and its unusual form is integral to its power. Rodrigues Fowler says she wanted to \u201cuse blank space as a way of expressing trauma \u2013 both the trauma of dictatorship and sexual violence\u201d. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alice-o-keeffe\" title=\"\">Alice O\u2019Keeffe</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Others 2019 debuts to watch out for</strong></h2> <h2><strong>You Will Be Safe Here</strong></h2> <p><strong>Damian Barr</strong><br><strong>Bloomsbury, </strong><strong>April</strong><br>The award-winning author of the memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/25/maggie-me-damian-barr-review\" title=\"\">Maggie and Me</a></em> explores legacies of abuse and redemption in his searing first novel, set in South Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d18db4ae1cac39edebe93b4aaff60196b8e3e67b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d18db4ae1cac39edebe93b4aaff60196b8e3e67b/0_0_1500_2302/652.jpg\" alt=\"The First Time Lauren Pailing Died Alyson Rudd Harper Collins\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>The First Time Lauren Pailing Died</strong></h2> <p><strong>Alyson Rudd</strong><br><strong>Harper Collins, </strong><strong>July</strong><br>Stylish time-slip story \u00e0 la <em>Sliding Doors</em> from respected <em>Times</em> newspaper sports journalist.</p> <h2><strong>Blood Orange</strong></h2> <p><strong>Harriet Tyce</strong><br><strong>Wildfire, February</strong><br>Disturbing domestic noir featuring a secretly alcoholic lawyer defending a woman who has stabbed her husband.</p> <h2><strong>Saltwater</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jessica Andrews</strong><br><strong>Sceptre, </strong><strong>May</strong><br>Coming-of-age tale from 25-year-old who sparked a publishers\u2019 bidding war.</p> <h2><strong>A Perfect Explanation</strong></h2> <p><strong>Eleanor Anstruther</strong><br><strong>Salt, </strong><strong>March</strong><br>Fictionalised story of the duke\u2019s granddaughter who sold her son to her sister for \u00a3500.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/03/golden-child-claire-adam-review\" title=\"\">Golden Child</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Claire Adam</strong><br><strong>Faber, January</strong><br>Family saga set in Trinidad, acquired by Sarah Jessica Parker for her imprint SJP for Hogarth in the US.</p> <h2><strong>The Most Difficult Thing</strong></h2> <p><strong>Charlotte Philby</strong><br><strong>Borough Press, </strong><strong>July</strong><br>The granddaughter of Kim Philby blends a classic spy mystery with modern domestic drama.</p> <h2><strong>Last Ones Left Alive</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sarah Davis-Goff</strong><br><strong>Tinder Press, </strong><strong>March</strong><br>Dystopian, post-apocalyptic drama set in Ireland from the founder of Dublin publisher Tramp Press.</p> <h2>The Familiars</h2> <p><strong>Stacey Halls</strong><br><strong>Bonnier Zaffre, </strong><strong>February</strong><br>Gripping tale of witchcraft set around the Pendle witch trials of 1612.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"44113c728a4fa3e9aa71a23e90eb77de1492e6e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44113c728a4fa3e9aa71a23e90eb77de1492e6e5/0_0_1591_2560/621.jpg\" alt=\"When All Is Said Anne Griffin\" width=\"621\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>When All Is Said</strong></h2> <p><strong>Anne Griffin</strong><br><strong>Sceptre, </strong><strong>January</strong><br>A man in a hotel bar nearing the end of his life toasts and remembers those he has loved.</p> <h2><strong>The Girl Before You</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nicola Rayner</strong><br><strong>Harper Collins, out as an e-book in May (e-book), July (paperback</strong><strong>)</strong><br>Described as the new <em>Girl on the Train, t</em>his thriller about a woman obsessed by her husband\u2019s exes is \u201cso addictive, it should come with a health warning\u201d, according to Alex Preston in these pages.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Oyinkan Braithwaite: \u2018It was a way out of my writer\u2019s block. I wanted to do something for myself\u2019 My Sister, the Serial Killer (Atlantic, January) Six months before Oyinkan Braithwaite turned 30, she began to panic. It wasn\u2019t the prospect of getting older that alarmed her, but that she had still not written a novel and sent it to an agent, as she had been promising herself. It was now or never, she thought, and she got to work. \u201cI was writing in a frenzy,\u201d says Braithwaite, speaking from her home in Lagos, Nigeria. \u201cI asked myself: \u2018Are you really going to turn 30 never having sent out a novel to an agent? You say you want to achieve this dream but you haven\u2019t even tried!\u2019\u201d She didn\u2019t expect the draft to sell. She had not written for a while and conceived the story of My Sister, the Serial Killer \u2013 a combination of deadly sexual attraction, psychosis, murder and sibling loyalty \u2013 as a way of flexing her writing muscles. \u201cThe book was a way back out of my writer\u2019s block. I wanted to do something fun for myself.\u201d A month later, in September 2017, she had completed the first draft for what would become her sensational debut; the book sold both at home, in Nigeria, and in Britain and the US, well before she hit her milestone birthday in March last year. By last month, it had been translated into nine languages and the film rights sold to Working Title. The book is a thriller whose plot revolves around two sisters, the younger and more beautiful of whom keeps killing her boyfriends. Its sparky black comedy makes it something of a satire-meets-slasher, but its broader, more serious themes include timely explorations of violence against women and psychotic female rage. Was the story inspired by the flood of testimonies that emerged out of the #MeToo movement? No, says Braithwaite, \u201cthe idea first came when I read about the black widow spider [who eats the male of the species after mating with them]\u201d. Born in Nigeria, Braithwaite shuttled between London and Lagos as she was growing up (her parents are Nigerian-born British citizens) and she now considers both cities to be home in different ways. She fell in love with poetry in her UK primary school, returning to Lagos to go to secondary school, then back to London to sit her A-levels and do a law and creative writing degree at the Kingston University. She took a job for a while as an editor in the Lagos publishing house Kachifo, but left to work on her own writing. For a time, poetry took precedence \u2013 she was among the top 10 finalists in Lagos\u2019s Eko Poetry Slam in 2014 \u2013 but then she realised she wanted to focus on prose. In 2016, she was shortlisted for the Commonwealth short story prize for The Driver, which featured a relationship between a young woman from a wealthy Nigerian family and a chauffeur, and dealt with issues of class, wealth and exploitative love. This debut is not her first attempt at writing a full-length novel: she had already completed two novels before she began this one, but they have not been sent to an agent. The first is a romance with a tragic ending, and the second a fantasy epic which also plays with the black widow idea: \u201cIt has this tribe of Amazonian women, like the black widow spiders, who spend a lot of time going from village to village, slaughtering men.\u201d Even though she feels that the second manuscript is too messy for publication, she hopes to return to the genre. \u201cI\u2019d like to try writing fantasy because it has everything \u2013 you can have crime and romance and the magic of it is that it allows you to stay connected to your childhood self.\u201d But for now, she is satisfied at having met her own deadline: \u201cWhen I began writing this novel, the idea of having it rejected [by a publisher] was better than knowing that I had dreamed of doing it but that I hadn\u2019t tried at all. Arifa Akbar Alex Michaelides: \u2018Agatha Christie made me a reader and a writer\u2019 The Silent Patient (Orion, February) When Alex Michaelides was growing up in Cyprus, there were long, hot summers which he and his sister would spend at the beach. The summer he turned 13, he borrowed his sister\u2019s collection of Agatha Christie novels and read one every couple of days. \u201cThey were the first adult books I read, the first time that I\u2019d ever disappeared into someone else\u2019s world. Christie made me a reader and a writer.\u201d Almost three decades later, Michaelides, 41, has written a debut novel with a narrative to rival that of his boyhood literary heroine. The Silent Patient is a taut, meticulously plotted and compelling novel that has earned advance praise from the likes of Lee Child, Stephen Fry and David Baldacci. It was the subject of a seven-way publisher auction and has so far sold in 40 foreign territories, a record for a UK debut thriller. The Silent Patient is narrated by Theo Faber, a psychotherapist determined to discover why Alicia Berenson, a famous artist accused of murdering her husband, has refused to speak since her husband\u2019s death. The therapeutic setting was inspired by Michaelides\u2019s own experience. \u201cTherapy is very important to me and has been a major part of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI was in individual therapy twice a week for about 10 years and then I was in group therapy for quite a while. All the raw emotional stuff is my own. I put a lot of myself into the book.\u201d Running through the novel is the Greek myth of Alcestis, and Euripides\u2019s play of the same name. Michaelides says he has been \u201chaunted\u201d by the play since reading it at school as a teenager: \u201cIt\u2019s something about feeling unlovable and unworthy that I related to. And a sense of being damaged, I guess. At that point in my life I felt quite damaged That\u2019s probably why it haunted me.\u201d The Alcestis theme is perhaps one of the reasons that The Silent Patient is finding such traction both among early readers and the tranche of movie executives who fought to option it. With its story of female sacrifice and the silencing of a woman post-trauma, it feels highly relevant in a post #MeToo world. \u201cIt\u2019s about silence as a weapon,\u201d Michaelides says. \u201cAnd it was very clear in my head when I was writing the book that Alicia was surrounded by these men who were imprisoning her. Like Alcestis, Alicia is trapped and she\u2019s denied a voice. It\u2019s a lifetime of being made to think that she wasn\u2019t worthy, she wasn\u2019t good enough, and maybe that\u2019s something that a lot of women [readers] have been responding to.\u201d The novel has already been optioned by Brad Pitt\u2019s production company, Plan B, with Michaelides due to write the screenplay, a fitting circularity for a novelist who has spent the past 15 years working as a screenwriter. After an English degree at Cambridge University, he took a screenwriting course at the American Film Institute and embarked on a career in a film industry he found \u201csoul destroying\u201d. He was on the brink of giving up writing when he decided to have one last throw of the dice: \u201cI thought, \u2018Before I give up writing, I\u2019m going to try and write the one thing I always wanted to write\u2019, which was an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery with a deeper psychological complexity.\u201d Novel writing, he discovered, was his natural medium: \u201cBeing able to move into someone\u2019s head \u2013 it\u2019s totally liberated me. In a film, you have to keep moving. In a book, you can go down rabbit holes, go into internal monologues. The opportunity to really slow down was a revelation.\u201d In spite of the hype surrounding the novel, Michaelides is circumspect about his pre-publication success: \u201cEven now I\u2019m so ridiculously happy when someone says they like it.\u201d It is a novel, he says, that asks the question: can you get over your childhood? And what\u2019s the answer? \u201cThat if you hold yourself in awareness, then you can. Otherwise you\u2019re destined to re-enact it.\u201d Hannah Beckerman Elizabeth Macneal: \u2018It\u2019s all about what it means to be stifled and how to achieve freedom\u2019 The Doll Factory (Picador, May) When Elizabeth Macneal was a teenager she began to collect literary classics \u2013 not in handy paperbacks like most bookworms her age, but in antique editions, which she would track down in charity shops or antiquarian bookstores. \u201cAll of my friends spent their money on alcohol and drugs and I would say, \u2018Sorry, I can\u2019t go out tonight because I\u2019ve just bought 14 volumes of Shakespeare\u2019.\u201d Neatly stacked by author, they dominate the living room of her small east London house. \u201cThey are the epitome of ornament versus function. I read one of the Hardys but spilt tea on it and cracked the spine,\u201d she says -, so her reading is now confined to humbler copies. The obsessiveness of collectors powers one strand of her debut novel, The Doll Factory, while the other centres on the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, the group of precocious young painters and poets who faced down the Victorian art establishment. Though initially she assumed these two subjects belonged to different novels, gradually she realised that they dovetailed neatly in the story of a talented working-class girl who is adopted as a model by an up-and-coming artist while being stalked by a creepy taxidermist. Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais lounge in the background as the story of Iris unfolds: she is a shadow version of Lizzie Siddal, the model for Millais\u2019s drowned Ophelia, who was also an artist in her own right. Released from the drudgery of painting the faces on children\u2019s dolls after negotiating art lessons in exchange for modelling, Iris finds herself posing for hours on end as the mythological Queen in a grand painting which is to be entered for the Great Exhibition in 1851. Her new independence is exhilarating, dizzying, terrifying \u2013 and constantly endangered by the men she encounters along the way. \u201cI guess for me the whole book is an exploration of freedom and imprisonment; what it means to be stifled and how it feels to achieve creative and literal freedom,\u201d says Macneal. \u201cIt\u2019s also about what it means to be held back by both an individual and a society that don\u2019t seem to have room for a woman to transcend her class and gender.\u201d Jacketed in luminous blue, and clearly targeted at fans of Tracy Chevalier\u2019s Girl With a Pearl Earring and Jessie Burton\u2019s The Miniaturist, the novel has a vivid energy of its own \u2013 bringing a painterly eye to the tricks of the pre-Raphaelite trade: a dash of emerald to emphasise lips; a lush resinous gloss \u201cto make the Queen\u2019s fur-trimmed dress shine like stained glass\u201d. It\u2019s no surprise to find that the 30-year-old author is also an artist. She has a fully equipped pottery in her garden shed, though she came late to the artisanal life. Born and brought up in Edinburgh, the eldest of three children, she graduated from Oxford University (where her passion for Victorian clutter found its first expression in \u201cactually a rather bad\u201d thesis) to a job with a management consultancy. Though safe and lucrative, the job was her own version of Iris\u2019s doll emporium, so she decided to strike out by signing up for pottery classes. \u201cI loved the peace of it and \u2013 particularly working as part of a big company where I couldn\u2019t even explain what I did \u2013 the satisfaction of turning this lump of earth into something useful and beautiful.\u201d Her pots began to sell, enabling her to leave her job and pursue her other interest: writing. By the time she enrolled on a creative writing MA at the University of East Anglia she had already had two novels rejected. \u201cI thought I\u2019d go on the course and write some short stories,\u201d she says, but her tutors pushed her towards another novel. She entered a Scottish prize for unpublished writers with half a manuscript, racing through the last 50,000 words after it was accepted. That early draft of The Doll Factory not only won her the Caledonia award but secured her an agent and had publishers beating at her door: 14 of them fought to win it, and television rights were snapped up. As the build-up to publication begins, she has retreated to her pottery shed, where 250 tiny saucers are cooling in a kiln \u2013 each decorated in delicate gold leaf with a wombat. Rossetti famously kept one as a pet, and a female wombat called Guinevere wreaks merry havoc in The Doll Factory, before expiring \u2013 much like Rossetti\u2019s \u2013 after a feast of cigars and chocolate. Except the chocolate was Macneal\u2019s own elaboration, on the advice of a vet friend, who pointed out that cigars alone would probably not have been fatal. The devil of all good historical fiction is in the detail. Claire Armitstead Sara Collins: \u2018Raising five children wasn\u2019t as hard as writing this novel\u2019 The Confessions of Frannie Langton (Viking, April) Even though they didn\u2019t return her affection, Sara Collins fell in love with the Victorian gothic romances she read while growing up: there wasn\u2019t much in the likes of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre for someone born in Jamaica and raised in the Cayman Islands to identify with. All the same, when she began writing The Confessions of Frannie Langton \u2013 the story of a former slave from a Jamaican plantation accused of the murder of her master and mistress, in whose London home she is employed as a maid \u2013 Collins had the \u201cvague idea\u201d of doing something gothic. Around the same time, she read the biography of Francis Barber, the former slave given to Samuel Johnson, which sent her down a deep rabbit hole of stories about West Indians in England long before the Windrush generation. \u201cI wanted a Jamaican woman in Jane Austen territory,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to see what would happen to someone like Frannie making her presence felt in these sophisticated Georgian drawing rooms.\u201d Today, 46-year-old Collins splits her time between the Caribbean and London, \u201cparallel lives\u201d she\u2019s lived since coming to boarding school in England at the age of 11. Despite her love affair with novels, she studied law at the London School of Economics and then worked in trust litigation for 17 years, a career she describes as \u201cprofessionally but not personally fulfilling\u201d. She also brought up five children: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit Brady Bunch,\u201d she laughs, as she had two kids and then married a widowed father of three; so despite always knowing that she wanted to write, she couldn\u2019t find the time. About 10 years ago she gave up law to concentrate on being a stay-at-home mother. \u201cHaving it all is a mantra the modern woman is sold, supposedly to make us feel better, but it can make you feel like a failure when you don\u2019t have that balance, when you\u2019re feeling burnt out and short-changed.\u201d It was only when her youngest started secondary school that she felt able to finally start writing. \u201cThe way I look at it now is that you can have it all, but only if you do one thing at a time.\u201d She enrolled in a creative writing MA. Her work in progress was shortlisted for the 2016 Lucy Cavendish prize, and she found an agent before she\u2019d finished the course. On the evening before the novel was planned to go to a nine-way auction, Viking made an offer too good to refuse. The book\u2019s also been optioned for TV \u2013 Collins is currently working on the adaptation. Not that the writing process was easy: \u201cNothing I have ever done, including raising five children, was harder than writing this novel.\u201d From Charlotte Bront\u00eb through Sarah Waters (at the novel\u2019s heart is a love story between Frannie and her white mistress), Alias Grace and Jean Rhys\u2019s Wide Sargasso Sea, The Confessions of Frannie Langton draws on a wealth of literary influences, although Collins admits that she\u2019s always found Rhys\u2019s novel \u201cproblematic because it privileges the white Creole experience at the expense of women like Frannie\u201d. As a black woman she feels pressure to \u201cwrite about race in an emotionally honest way\u201d, which is why she wanted Frannie to \u201cchallenge the idea of pure victimhood\u201d. What is her response to those who question the authenticity of such bold historical revisionism? \u201cBecause of the dominance of stuffy male academics, we\u2019re not used to hearing these voices, so when they\u2019re fictionalised it comes as a shock and we might think of it as anachronistic,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think all we\u2019re doing with historical fiction is imagining what people might have said if they\u2019d been able to speak for themselves.\u201d Lucy Scholes Bev Thomas: \u2018The reality is that therapists have crumbling lives like everybody else\u2019 A Good Enough Mother (Faber, April) Bev Thomas never expected to set her first novel in the world of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Having worked for many years as a clinical psychologist in the NHS, her first attempts at writing included forays into historical fiction. But eventually she found herself writing a novel set in her professional domain. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in what people do and why they do things,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I trained as a clinical psychologist. When I began writing it was fundamental for me to think that the characters made psychological sense. It\u2019s a psychological drama rather than a thriller.\u201d A Good Enough Mother is about grief, motherhood and the complexities of the therapist-patient relationship. The novel\u2019s narrator is Dr Ruth Hartland, a highly respected psychotherapist and director of a trauma unit whose private life is unravelling: her teenage son has gone missing, her marriage has fallen apart and her relationship with her daughter is strained. When a patient resembling her missing son arrives at the unit, the boundaries between Ruth\u2019s professional judgment and her personal trauma begin to blur, with devastating consequences. Part of Thomas\u2019s motivation was, she says, to humanise therapists: \u201cThe reality is that therapists have crumbling lives like everybody else: marriages that don\u2019t work, children they can\u2019t manage very well\u2026 They are not perfect people but that doesn\u2019t stop them being fantastic therapists.\u201d The novel is immersed in the world of therapy: there are discussions about transference and counter-transference, and references to Melanie Klein and Donald Winnicott, who first introduced the idea of \u201cthe good-enough mother\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re opening a door on to an intimate world,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cMy aim is that people who are not necessarily ever going to have therapy might find the concepts useful outside the therapy room: that it might change the way they work with a colleague, or how they understand what their child might be feeling.\u201d Alongside an exploration of therapy, the novel examines the aspirations and limitations of motherhood. \u201c[The novel] enables you to grapple with all sorts of dilemmas,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cWhat does it mean to get it right? What do you do if your child is struggling? How much do you bear letting them find their way? I think it\u2019s a real challenge. And I think there\u2019s such a lot of pressure at the moment to get it right.\u201d Integral to Ruth\u2019s narrative is the experience of loss, which, as Thomas observes, is universal. \u201cIt\u2019s something that finds its way into the therapy room in all sorts of guises. I don\u2019t just mean bereavement, but loss of identity or loss of a family member through drugs or alcohol or mental health issues. Loss is such a human condition.\u201d These universal themes led to A Good Enough Mother being the subject of a five-way publisher auction. But Thomas\u2019s route to publication has involved \u201c18 years of hard graft\u201d. She has, she says, become \u201can Arvon junkie\u201d, attending multiple creative writing courses. She likes the collective work done in creative writing groups. \u201cGetting that feedback has definitely altered things I\u2019ve written. If you feel supported and contained then I think you can do your best work.\u201d Writing groups mirror her current role as an organisational consultant, helping mental health teams collaborate and communicate more effectively. \u201cI do love groups. I think it\u2019s fascinating how group processes get played out in organisations.\u201d Thomas now plans to combine writing with her clinical work. \u201cFor me, the leap from therapy to writing wasn\u2019t quite such a leap as it might seem,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of what therapists do is help people tell their life stories. And you write in order to engage and have some kind of connection. So to now have this opportunity to connect with readers through a psychological book is fantastic.\u201d Hannah Beckerman Isabella Hammad: \u2018Listening to my father, I thought: this would make a great novel\u2019 The Parisian (Jonathan Cape, April) Isabella Hammad, 27, was a teenager when she first felt a \u201creal impulse\u201d to be a writer. \u201cIt was Virginia Woolf that made me feel the need to express myself in that way,\u201d she says, but she also had a tale she was itching to tell. \u2018\u2018It was a particular story that I wanted to get out, about my great grandfather Midhat in Palestine. I had heard all these stories about him and I remember the exact moment \u2013 in the back of the car, listening to my father talking about him \u2013 when I thought \u2018This would make a great novel.\u2019\u201d The Parisian is a hugely accomplished historical sweep of a book describing the life and times of young Palestinian dreamer, Midhat Kamal. It encompasses his childhood in Nablus, Palestine, student days in Montpellier, the turbulent years of the first world war and the Palestinian struggle for independence. Hammad is careful to say that while the central character has the same name as her great-grandfather, the book is heavily fictionalised, that she has \u201cjoined the dots imaginatively\u201d. The result is a novel of immense skill and confidence, garnering praise from Zadie Smith, who taught her for a while, and who calls it \u201ca sublime reading experience\u2026 surpassingly intelligent\u201d. Hammad studied at Oxford University then Harvard, and last year won the Paris Review\u2019s Plimpton prize for fiction with a short story called Mr Can\u2019aan. She grew up in west London with her parents and brother and navigates her heritage with care, commenting that she finds talking about her father \u201ctricky\u201d when I ask about him and their relationship with his homeland. Her grandmother, she says, was a big matriarch in the Palestinian community in London when she was growing up, \u201cso [Palestine] was very present. But we didn\u2019t go there as kids\u2026 I went for the first time when I was researching this book, to Nablus to visit my family, and to Ramallah as well.\u201d Her father spent his childhood in Lebanon. \u201cHe was there during the war, when it was very dangerous to be a Palestinian in Lebanon, and so people became shape shifters a little bit. The relationship those of his generation have [with Palestine] can be complicated. In the Palestinian diaspora, people either really commit to the Palestinian cause and talk about it a lot, or they want to assimilate.\u201d A theme in the book, she says, is the pressure Palestinians feel to somehow speak for their whole country. \u201cThis is a struggle many Palestinians face: they don\u2019t want to be defined in this way, to have to be representative. There is no single Palestinian experience. The life of a Palestinian living in Nablus is very different from a Palestinian living in Gaza or Jerusalem. Different from living in Jaffa, Syria or Lebanon. I mean, I\u2019m obviously a mix, but I\u2019m more complex than that, and I don\u2019t think I can be representative in any way.\u201d Before writing the book Hammad spent about a year in the Middle East, researching \u2013 which, she says, was its own adventure. \u201cI interviewed about 80 members of my family, but also I spent a lot of time with historians, geographers and refugees.\u201d Does she feel a little responsibility, having written a book based on the life of a relative who has the same name as the central character? (Her father has read and enjoyed the book.) \u201cYes, in a way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the act of writing often feels irresponsible because you\u2019re in imagination, a dream zone.\u201d Her home is now in Brooklyn, New York, where she has begun work on her next novel, also set in Palestine \u2013 \u201cbut contemporary and shorter!\u201d \u2013 which she has just visited again to do more research. \u201cFor the time being it\u2019s my obsession.\u201d Given the praise The Parisian is already receiving, does she feel the weight of expectation? \u201cI\u2019m not really thinking about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it really helps to have started writing something new. It means that\u2019s where my lifeblood is now. I did the work, I did the book. What happens happens.\u201d Ursula Kenny Rosie Price: \u2018It wasn\u2019t until I started writing about sexual assault that the work took off\u2019 What Red Was (Harvill Secker, May) Rosie Price had set her sights on being a writer several years before she started work on What Red Was. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until I started writing about sexual assault that the work took off. It felt so urgent \u2013 there was so much I needed to say, and that gave me the momentum to keep going.\u201d Price, 26, was herself the victim of rape, when she was \u201ctoo young to understand properly\u201d. Through writing the book, she began to make sense of her own experiences, exploring how the assault had \u201cchanged my view of the world\u201d. The novel is an intriguing blend: part comedy of manners, part hard-hitting drama. Price was influenced, she says, by Edward St Aubyn\u2019s blackly comic Patrick Melrose novels, and the idea that \u201cthe more levity and joyful moments you have, the darker you are able to go\u201d. It follows a young woman, Kate Quaile, as she leaves her modest upbringing in rural Gloucestershire for university. There she meets Max Rippon, a charismatic young man from a privileged background. Kate is drawn into Max\u2019s world, and becomes close to his mother, Zara, a successful film director. She becomes increasingly reliant on the Rippons, both emotionally and financially, so when she is assaulted by one of their inner circle, she finds herself trapped. When Price started writing the novel she was working in a literary agency \u2013 a job she had held since graduating three years earlier. She initially worked on the book in the evenings and at weekends, but then quickly realised that she needed to \u201cmake the leap and commit\u201d. She left her job for a more flexible tutoring role, which allowed her to write in the mornings. The gamble paid off: there was a five-way auction among publishers for What Red Was, and film rights have now been bought by the BBC. Of course the book feels timely in the light of the #MeToo movement \u2013 but the project was already well under way when the first Weinstein allegations surfaced in October 2017. Some of the echoes in Price\u2019s narrative seem almost uncanny. \u201cWhen it all emerged, I already had a character who was a female film director, who had been assaulted,\u201d she says. Although she praises #MeToo as \u201can incredible movement\u201d, she describes that period as a difficult one for people who have been victims of rape and assault. \u201cIt is really hard to be reminded of it every time you turn on the news. And in some ways it felt as though those experiences were being normalised.\u201d What Red Was has allowed Price not only to explore her own legacy of trauma, but also to find a way of speaking out \u2013 the pros and cons of which are explored in the book. \u201cNobody can tell a rape survivor how to behave \u2013 there are a plethora of reasons why speaking out may not be the right thing to do,\u201d she says. \u201cThe one thing you have afterwards is control over how you tell your story. For me, the process of writing has been very empowering.\u201d Alice O\u2019Keeffe Beth O\u2019Leary: \u2018I started to notice how many coffee mugs there were by the sink\u2019 The Flatshare (Quercus, April) It was moving house that gave Beth O\u2019Leary, 26, the idea for her first novel. She had been living in London for a couple of years after graduating from Oxford University, working in children\u2019s publishing, but never felt \u201cquite right\u201d in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s so loud and nonstop and just not me,\u201d she says. So she moved back to Winchester, her home town, to share a flat with her boyfriend, Sam, a junior doctor. Ironically, she found she saw even less of him than when she had been living 60 miles away. \u201cHe was working nights and I was commuting to work, so we could go a whole week when there was always one of us asleep in the bed but never [both] at the same time. It was such a weird way to live, being in the same space as him but not actually seeing each other.\u201d She found ways of telling how Sam\u2019s day had been. \u201cI would start to notice how many coffee mugs were by the sink. If his trainers were out, that meant he\u2019d had time to go for a run before he went to bed. And it just got me thinking, \u2018What an interesting thing that is, how close you can feel to someone when you\u2019re in the same physical space but not at the same time. Could two people who don\u2019t know each other become very close living like this?\u2019\u201d That is the big question driving O\u2019Leary\u2019s story about two hard-pressed strangers who decide to save money by sharing a one-bedroom flat. Leon works nights as a nurse, so he occupies the flat during the day, while Tiffy is out at work as a publicist. She has the place to herself the rest of the time. The book, which O\u2019Leary wrote on her laptop during her daily commute, explores Leon and Tiffy\u2019s relationship and their lives as they communicate through Post-It notes, introducing us to an eclectic cast of minor characters, from Leon\u2019s brother, who is in prison, to Tiffy\u2019s controlling ex-partner. Having rented a flat in London herself, where a sewage pipe from the flat above used to leak through her bedroom wall, O\u2019Leary says: \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem at all implausible to me that two people would agree to that kind of arrangement, because so many people I knew were so desperate to find somewhere to live in London, however awful.\u201d Within weeks of her sending the book to an agent it had sold in a pre-emptive deal for six figures, with foreign rights snapped up in 30 countries. O\u2019Leary has always wanted to be a writer. Growing up as one of six children in a noisy household, she spent every spare moment reading books and writing stories. \u201cI just never thought it was really a feasible career path,\u201d she says. Now she has given up her job in publishing to write fulltime. \u201cIt is a total dream,\u201d she says. Lisa O\u2019Kelly Yara Rodrigues Fowler: \u2018I\u2019d love it if the book made Latin Americans in the UK more visible\u2019 Stubborn Archivist (Fleet, February) Yara Rodrigues Fowler\u2019s debut is unlike any other book you\u2019ve read. A blend of prose and poetry, it\u2019s a collection of short pieces that gradually cohere into a larger narrative. But while it\u2019s formally experimental, it never feels like a chore. Holding the disparate elements together is a strong sense of identity and voice \u2013 the development of which is, in fact, partly what Stubborn Archivist is about. Rodrigues Fowler, 26, is a south Londoner, the child of an English father and a Brazilian mother. The book draws on her experience of growing up between those cultures. \u201cI would love it if the book helped to make the Latin American population of the UK more visible,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a heterogeneous community \u2013 racially and in terms of class.\u201d The Latin American diaspora forms one of the UK\u2019s fastest-growing communities, but is not well represented in British literature \u2013 unlike in the US, where there is a strong canon of Latin American authors writing in English (Junot D\u00edaz, Daniel Alarc\u00f3n, Edwidge Danticat). On this side of the Atlantic, the multicultural experience has been explored mainly by writers with family links to former British colonies. \u201cI grew up reading Zadie Smith, Hanif Kureishi and Salman Rushdie, so they were big influences,\u201d says Rodrigues Fowler, but she also cites Danticat, Alice Walker, and the Brazilian oral storytelling tradition. \u201cI grew up listening to musicians like Elis Regina and Caetano Veloso, and I wanted to give the book an oral poetic texture.\u201d Another important thread in Stubborn Archivist is that of sexual violence, and how that can be fed by racial prejudice. The protagonist, who is never named, has a British boyfriend with a taste for Brazilian porn. He asks her to grow her hair so she looks more like Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, and talk in Portuguese in bed. Although the violence is never made explicit, it is clear that these fantasies are the beginning of a process of dehumanisation that leads them to a dark place. \u201cI wanted to look at how her Brazilian identity is part and parcel of her experience of sexual assault,\u201d says Rodrigues Fowler, who is the trustee of a refuge for Latin American women. She hopes that people who have experienced sexual violence will read the book and identify with \u201chow you exist in the world after that happens. And recognise that you can be in love with the person who is violent towards you.\u201d Flitting nimbly through generations, between Brazil and south London, between dating and dictatorship, this is a novel that is personal and political \u2013 and its unusual form is integral to its power. Rodrigues Fowler says she wanted to \u201cuse blank space as a way of expressing trauma \u2013 both the trauma of dictatorship and sexual violence\u201d.

How did 18th-century politicians train their racing ducks? Did Queen Anne ever get treatment for her raging bulimia? What became of Anne\u2019s 17 little rabbits? And did Sarah really dress up as a highwayman \u2013 because it\u2019s certainly not in Wikipedia?</p> <p>Whether or not either book is able to gratify this surge of curiosity, you can\u2019t but think how convenient it would be if people could go somewhere to have a quick read or do some minor fact-checking, particularly if the alternative is a contribution to the obscene profits shortly to be divided between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/09/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-wife-mackenzie-divorce\" title=\"\">Mr and Mrs \u201cloving exploration\u201d Bezos</a>.</p> <p>Such a system could further serve the growing number of people, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/dec/30/dont-mess-with-marie-tidying-up-with-author-netflix-star-marie-kondo\" title=\"\">Marie Kondo</a>, who find books repellently messy and members of another demographic (though its existence is still unacknowledged by some of the lending-averse) who, though they like reading, are too hard up to buy books on impulse.</p> <p>What if there were places where you could simply take a book about Queen Anne or the Duchess of Marlborough off the shelf, at no charge, borrow it if you wanted? Then do the same thing with other books, possibly with suggestions for further reading from qualified staff? The bookshelves might be complemented with other services, cultural and not, say, internet access, places to study, literacy help, citizen advice, children\u2019s literature, book events, activities for schools, with newspapers and magazines for people who can\u2019t afford them? Obviously, they\u2019d need funding to attract imaginative leadership. You might call these civilised learning and meeting places, for example, libraries.</p> <p>Admittedly, it\u2019s not a new idea. At some point \u2013 it is probably in some book or other \u2013 someone historical came up with something similar and there are still some 3,600 libraries surviving in Great Britain (<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/volunteers-left-to-stack-bookshelves-as-hundreds-of-libraries-are-closed-3x20kxbbz\" title=\"\">700 have closed in a decade</a>), along with more than 8 million active borrowers. But clearly not for long, since the country\u2019s remaining services continue, according to <a href=\"https://www.cipfa.org/cipfa-thinks/cipfa-thinks-articles/libraries-tell-us-a-tale-on-the-transformation-of-local-government\" title=\"\">recent reports</a>, under attack: budgets slashed, hours reduced, low on trained, if deplorably paid, staff, propped up by 51,000 volunteers and, perhaps most dismal, regarded as disposable by national government.</p> <p>Officially responsible for providing a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d library service, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has consistently evaded exposure for its dereliction by blaming local authorities, whose funding has been cut by \u00a315bn in 10 years. So much so that little lasting damage has been done, for instance, to the reputation of Ed Vaizey, the former libraries minister, even though he presided, from 2010, over unprecedented cuts in library service, pronouncing himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/05/library-closures-ed-vaizey\" title=\"\">\u201cnot minded\u201d to intervene </a>(a stance for which he had earlier attacked Andy Burnham). At about the same time, Chris Grayling was denying books to prisoners.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0001t8y\" title=\"\">painful <em>Today</em> programme</a> double act, featuring Vaizey and Michael Gove, recently suggested that the two may have been too beguiled by their own \u201cbanter\u201d (Gove\u2019s word) to notice what they were doing to the cultural fabric of communities. Either way, the library banterer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/more-heads-roll-in-next-round-of-theresa-may-ruthless-reshuffle\" title=\"\">sacking in 2016</a> was represented, notwithstanding his pitiful legacy, as a brutal loss to the arts world. Happily for Vaizey and his successors, many fellow non-book-borrowers are similarly unmoved by the <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/campaigners-hit-back-after-government-rejects-petition-ringfence-library-funding-890741\" title=\"\">reproaches of leading writers and library campaigners</a>.

      "bodyText": "It is a further triumph for The Favourite, with 12 Bafta nominations, to have propelled Ophelia Field\u2019s 2002 biography of Sarah Churchill, the favourite in question, to the heights of Amazon\u2019s gay and lesbian biography list. Anne Somerset\u2019s 2012 biography of Queen Anne is also likely to benefit, as people attempt to discover more about the extraordinary incidents depicted in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s film. How did 18th-century politicians train their racing ducks? Did Queen Anne ever get treatment for her raging bulimia? What became of Anne\u2019s 17 little rabbits? And did Sarah really dress up as a highwayman \u2013 because it\u2019s certainly not in Wikipedia? Whether or not either book is able to gratify this surge of curiosity, you can\u2019t but think how convenient it would be if people could go somewhere to have a quick read or do some minor fact-checking, particularly if the alternative is a contribution to the obscene profits shortly to be divided between Mr and Mrs \u201cloving exploration\u201d Bezos. Such a system could further serve the growing number of people, like Marie Kondo, who find books repellently messy and members of another demographic (though its existence is still unacknowledged by some of the lending-averse) who, though they like reading, are too hard up to buy books on impulse. What if there were places where you could simply take a book about Queen Anne or the Duchess of Marlborough off the shelf, at no charge, borrow it if you wanted? Then do the same thing with other books, possibly with suggestions for further reading from qualified staff? The bookshelves might be complemented with other services, cultural and not, say, internet access, places to study, literacy help, citizen advice, children\u2019s literature, book events, activities for schools, with newspapers and magazines for people who can\u2019t afford them? Obviously, they\u2019d need funding to attract imaginative leadership. You might call these civilised learning and meeting places, for example, libraries. Admittedly, it\u2019s not a new idea. At some point \u2013 it is probably in some book or other \u2013 someone historical came up with something similar and there are still some 3,600 libraries surviving in Great Britain (700 have closed in a decade), along with more than 8 million active borrowers. But clearly not for long, since the country\u2019s remaining services continue, according to recent reports, under attack: budgets slashed, hours reduced, low on trained, if deplorably paid, staff, propped up by 51,000 volunteers and, perhaps most dismal, regarded as disposable by national government. Officially responsible for providing a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d library service, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has consistently evaded exposure for its dereliction by blaming local authorities, whose funding has been cut by \u00a315bn in 10 years. So much so that little lasting damage has been done, for instance, to the reputation of Ed Vaizey, the former libraries minister, even though he presided, from 2010, over unprecedented cuts in library service, pronouncing himself \u201cnot minded\u201d to intervene (a stance for which he had earlier attacked Andy Burnham). At about the same time, Chris Grayling was denying books to prisoners. A painful Today programme double act, featuring Vaizey and Michael Gove, recently suggested that the two may have been too beguiled by their own \u201cbanter\u201d (Gove\u2019s word) to notice what they were doing to the cultural fabric of communities. Either way, the library banterer\u2019s sacking in 2016 was represented, notwithstanding his pitiful legacy, as a brutal loss to the arts world. Happily for Vaizey and his successors, many fellow non-book-borrowers are similarly unmoved by the reproaches of leading writers and library campaigners. Impatience with libraries may not, to the anti-lending tendency, appear an unlovely clue to a person\u2019s cultural and social sensibility, so much as attractively modern. Reports of closures are routinely accompanied with comments about preferring Kindles, from people who don\u2019t need technical help, thank you, and therefore conclude that libraries \u2013 it\u2019s not as if they\u2019ve noticed any of the other duties keeping staff busy or the queues to go in \u2013 are finished. Contributions to these online debates from the millions of users who do value libraries, many of them much older, much younger, poorer, less technically/administratively competent, or just cold or lonely, are naturally less prominent. Analysis of the latest, dismal library figures from Cipfa (the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy), showing a halved wage bill since 2010, met with another chorus of \u201cSo what?\u201d from Amazon fans, eg: \u201cYou could always buy your children books,\u201d suggests one. On that principle, the well-nourished could argue, of food banks, that all normal people use Deliveroo. The case for neglect has been further portrayed, again usefully for flaky providers, as responsive to the social trends that leave people isolated, but online. In a document, featured by Private Eye, which should really be entitled, in homage to King Lear\u2019s Regan, \u201cWhat Need One?, Essex county council proposes, along with the recruitment of countless volunteers, a reduced library service \u201cwithout walls\u201d. Should actual books feature, \u201ccustomers may be able to pick items from an outlet in a local shop or leisure centre\u201d. Whatever is happening in Essex, these particular \u201citems\u201d are popular enough, elsewhere, to support a recovery in independent itemshops, and the flourishing of item festivals and item events and item groups, where \u201creading materials\u201d (Essex\u2019s other word for items) bring people physically, creatively together. If bookshops, book sales and book events can thrive, why \u2013 if it\u2019s not their broken budgets, dependence on volunteers and devaluing by the very department and authorities that should prize and cultivate them \u2013 can\u2019t public libraries? The death of reading \u2013 prematurely announced or not \u2013 is habitually attributed to social media. It\u2019s unfair, really. Because nobody has worked as doggedly to this end, as unsentimentally, and with a greater commitment to the suppression of literacy, than our own Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p><em>Virtuoso</em>, the second novel by the Paris-based Ukrainian-American Yelena Moskovich, traces the trajectory of two Prague schoolfriends and one-time lovers, Jana and Zorka, as they move to the west and shape lives for themselves there.</p> <p>Like Moskovich\u2019s powerful debut, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/natashas-630104.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Natashas</em>,</a> this is a book about the last generation to be born in the Soviet era and how the fall of communism shaped their social, sexual and artistic engagement with the world.

      "bodyText": "Virtuoso, the second novel by the Paris-based Ukrainian-American Yelena Moskovich, traces the trajectory of two Prague schoolfriends and one-time lovers, Jana and Zorka, as they move to the west and shape lives for themselves there. Like Moskovich\u2019s powerful debut, The Natashas, this is a book about the last generation to be born in the Soviet era and how the fall of communism shaped their social, sexual and artistic engagement with the world. Towards the end of the novel, we meet Erki, an Estonian fashion designer living in Paris who establishes a group called \u201cthe EB\u201d (the Eastern Bloc), \u201cthe romantic cowboys of their countries\u2019 cultural and economic isolation\u2026 [who] put their childhood disparities into fabrics, cuts and fashion statements\u201d. It feels like Moskovich is seeking to do something similar with the novel \u2013 to find a voice and narrative form that captures the peculiarity of this generation\u2019s existence as flotsam carried on the great political currents of the past three decades. About halfway through the book, when Zorka has been taken by her unstable mother to stay with her brother Gejza in Wisconsin, there\u2019s a passage that demonstrates both the novel\u2019s interest in the intersection of the personal and the political and Moskovich\u2019s subtlety when conveying this to the reader. Zorka and her mother are watching a film in English: \u201cZorka understood that phrase \u2018I love you\u2019, from the rest of the mumbling, and would snuff \u2018bullshit\u2019 under her breath whenever she\u2019d hear it, because she had never in her life, ever, seen a man and a woman say \u2018I love you\u2019 to each other when it wasn\u2019t a threat or something you do in the hallway to show your neighbours you are reliable tenants.\u201d The Natashas was remarkable for its frank treatment of sexuality, but also for its singular use of language. Moskovich\u2019s mother tongue is Ukrainian, and while her English is faultless, there\u2019s a pleasing otherness about her syntax and word choice, a sense that there are different languages operating just beneath the surface of the text.

We try to hold two thoughts in our head at the same time \u2013 the feeling that we must change as the clock does, but also, that every year our panicking efforts rarely work to improve our lives, instead leaving us with the sour emptiness of failure, and having extended our overdraft for the privilege. The two thoughts fight in the dark like cats. Is there a compromise? We could cut down on meat, drink mindfully, jog around the park, but with no ambitions of perfecting ourselves. That might be nice? What about if this year we seek approval, not from the internet, but instead only from those we love? What if this year, we forget about trying to live longer, and instead enjoy the moments of glee in our existing day-to-days? What if, instead of cutting all alcohol from our lives for a month, we instead interrogate the things that make us want to drink too much? What if, instead of looking inwards, we stare cleanly out across this cold landscape of gentrified possibility, making sure the annual efforts to fix ourselves don\u2019t distract us from fixing the world? What if the change we make is the realisation\u2026 we might not be the problem? And another thing\u2026 It\u2019s worked - I\u2019ve postponed learning to drive long enough that self-driving cars are a reality. Lauren Collins\u2019s elegant New Yorker profile of bestselling novelist Sally Rooney (which I read on a train opposite two people reading her books) reveals her to be intimidatingly smart and infuriatingly argumentative, she doesn\u2019t give a toss what strangers think of her. Qualities I greatly admire in artists, but would rarely want to be stuck in a room with. During the period between Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Day, 455 applications for divorce were lodged in England and Wales. Which sounds\u2026 not that bad? Really? Under 500 couples? After a week in one of their mum\u2019s overheated houses, eating meat for every meal, a massive fight over Poirot, the kids in A&amp;E with rashes that turn out to have been spilt Benetint cheek colour? Under 500 couples? Come on, that\u2019s not bad. Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter@EvaWiseman",

Bosses have spent long enough watching and waiting to see what kind of Brexit unfolds. Another six months, while parliament moves in the direction of a general election or a referendum on the current deal with the European Union, would break their resolve, say May\u2019s supporters. Businesses have certainly delayed investment decisions. The latest figures show that business investment fell by 1.1% to \u00a347bn between the second and third quarters last year.

However, a deeper dive into the data revealed that almost all that boost came from shopping on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and that most of these gains are likely to be revised away once the Office for National Statistics applies its seasonal adjustment methods. That leaves the glaring and declining trajectory of manufacturing output, which fell for a fifth straight month, something that has also not happened since the 2008-09 recession. Across a broader swath of Britain\u2019s industrial sector, which draws together energy production, water supply, and mining and quarrying alongside the manufacturing sector, there were declines in November across all four industries for the first time since 2012. The car industry was especially badly affected, making a difficult period \u2013 following declines in demand for cars from China and the diesel emissions crisis \u2013 even worse. On just one day last week Jaguar Land Rover and Ford announced thousands of job cuts, while figures from China revealed the first drop in car sales for almost 30 years. Nobody would want such a dire situation to drag on any longer than necessary. Everyone can see that the cost of negotiating an exit has proved to be high in lost investment and output. All the studies, even those of the arch Brexiter Patrick Minford \u2013 the Cardiff academic whose Panglossian optimism meant he came bottom in a league of economic forecasters for 2018 \u2013 show the UK\u2019s metal-bashers will be the most badly affected by leaving the EU\u2019s customs union and single market. It means that the north-west, the Midlands (east and west) and Wales, which have disproportionate numbers of well-paid residents working in manufacturing, have the most to lose. Manufacturing accounts for 10% of the economy and keeping it at that level in recent years has required considerable investment from companies such as Nissan, Jaguar Land Rover and Airbus. So remaining inside the EU, or at the very least, getting the best possible Brexit deal, is hugely important to the areas in which these companies are based and the manufacturing industry more generally. If a delay to article 50 is needed to decide on the best route forward, or even a general election \u2013 this newspaper\u2019s preferred option is a referendum \u2013 then investment decisions can wait a little longer.

The withdrawal of the two Japanese players leaves a pair of state-owned firms, EDF of France and CGN of China, as the only serious contenders. Both face huge challenges. The backlash in some countries against the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei shows the risks CGN could face if authorities raise concerns over a Chinese state company putting its technology at the heart of the UK energy system. EDF\u2019s challenge is more prosaic \u2013 it has a mountain to climb to raise the finance needed for a second plant after Hinkley Point C in Somerset, even if it is able to cut the project\u2019s costs as it claims.

So what now for the struggling department store, which has seen its share price drop 86% in the last year? Erstwhile chairman Sir Ian Cheshire has quit but chief executive Sergio Bucher, a former Amazon executive, is apparently hanging on despite losing his seat on the board.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a terrific scene in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-yorgos-lanthimos\" title=\"\"><em>The Favourite</em></a>, the film about the last of the Stuart monarchs, when Queen Anne is about to propose a European policy to her parliament. Just before she opens her mouth, the bewigged MPs make plain that they won\u2019t have it. The queen faints with shock and hits the floor with a thump.</p> <p>I don\u2019t expect Queen Theresa to collapse when she loses in parliament this week, not least because the rejection of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/11/what-is-going-on-in-brexit-and-what-might-happen-next\" title=\"\">her Brexit deal</a> is not going to be a surprise to anyone, herself included. If we still lived by the traditional rules of British politics, defeat ought to be the final curtain for Mrs May. Brexit is the defining task of her premiership and she is about to fail it. We\u2019d ordinarily expect the abdication of the PM to follow such a humiliating rejection. Yet no one, neither friend nor foe, expects her to respond to defeat by submitting her resignation. Brexit has so scrambled our politics that it has normalised dramas that we would once have regarded as extraordinary and made the unthinkable routine. We no longer know which of the rules still apply.</p> <p>Some illumination of how Britain and its parliament got trapped in this howling nightmare is to be found in <em>The Favourite</em>. I hugely recommend this film and not just for the dazzling performances by Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. The drama is footloose with the facts, but it is a prompt to pay more attention to a critical period of our history that is little taught in schools and little known to most Britons. The tensely convoluted relationship between parliament, ministers, monarch and favourites, played out during a war in Europe, echoes into our own era from the age of Anne. Her grandfather, Charles I, had been deprived of his crown and his head after he embarked on a losing struggle with parliament.</p> <p>When her father, James II, exhibited designs to create an absolutist Catholic monarchy, parliament rebelled again. He lost his crown, but escaped with his head, in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. By Anne\u2019s time, quite a lot of clout was still wielded by the monarch \u2013 or by those, such as John and Sarah Churchill, who could get close enough to the monarch to harness the powers of the crown to their own ambitions. The queen could still dismiss her ministers, but power was leaching away. Anne was the last British sovereign to veto a parliamentary bill.</p> <p>Britain had begun its gradual transformation, centuries in the making, into a liberal democracy with an ornamental constitutional monarchy. One consequence of getting there by evolution rather than revolution is that Britain has never had a properly codified constitution. Other nations have sat down, thought about it and inscribed the rules in famous documents with resonant phrases. We have made things up as we have gone along, with the result that many of the laws governing our politics are ambiguous and contested. We never had the equivalent of the founding fathers of the United States. Unlike postwar Japan and Germany, Britain never suffered a devastating military defeat and then had a constitution imposed on us by the winners.</p> <p>You can argue that an ad-hoc constitution has not served Britain entirely badly. We have bolted on innovations in recent decades, such as the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the supreme court, with a relative lack of turbulence. Gaps in the constitution in protecting rights have been filled by membership of the European Union. The previous disinclination of Britons to go to war with themselves over constitutional issues has also meant a high tolerance for absurdities, such as a bloated, unelected second chamber that still calls itself the House of Lords and still contains hereditary peers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f72944d145c8dd7eae71a9deec691f46e295e1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f72944d145c8dd7eae71a9deec691f46e295e1e/21_0_2813_1688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The British way of doing politics is... expressed in the very architecture of the chamber of the House of Commons.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The British way of doing politics is... expressed in the very architecture of the chamber of the House of Commons.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The constitution is stuck together from parliamentary conventions, precedents, international agreements, unwritten understandings, judicial rulings and legislative sticky notes. This seemed serviceable enough \u2013 until this spatchcocked structure collided with something as colossal as Brexit. We are partly paying the price for making such a massive decision by simple plebiscite, without having properly settled rules about referendums and how they can be reconciled with representative democracy. It is very hard work to amend the constitution of the United States and a change can only be made if there is a wide and deep consensus. Britain is heading out of the EU, the most consequential act in decades, on the basis of one ballot held nearly three years ago in which just one vote could have decided the outcome. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\" title=\"\">closeness of the result</a> and the lack of agreement about what it meant spelled trouble from the start. It also led to the inevitable convulsions that were going to follow when a parliament largely against Brexit was tasked with implementing a result most MPs thought a mistake, a challenge without precedent. This conundrum might have been eased had Mrs May responded to her task with a non-partisan, cross-party approach, but she made things harder when she started out by seeking to please one faction of her party alone.</p> <p>The conventions and culture of parliament have deepened the nightmare. The British way of doing politics is founded in the idea that power is a binary contest between two big and tribal parties. It is expressed in the very architecture of the chamber of the House of Commons that sits the two sides confronting each other two swords\u2019 length apart. It is incarnated in parliamentary rules that vest a large amount of power in the two tribal leaders \u2013 the prime minister and the leader of the official opposition. To compound the problem, it is a hung parliament in which the prime minister is a former Remainer trying to find a form of Brexit that can satisfy a majority and the opposition leader is a Brexiter leading a Remainer party who has little interest in trying to resolve the deadlock and lots of incentives to want it to end disastrously. The two of them have great sway over how parliamentary time is allocated and which motions MPs get to debate. This gives them the power to run down the clock \u2013 and both have been exploiting this for different reasons. Mrs May has taken Britain perilously close to the precipice of a crash-out Brexit on the gamble that, when MPs are staring into the abyss, they will finally succumb to her deal. This can be fairly called Blackmail Brexit. Even if she does ultimately prevail this way, forcing MPs to approve a plan they hate under the muzzle of the gun will guarantee further trouble and strife.</p> <p>Parliamentary convention has it that only the leader of the official opposition can table a motion of no confidence in the government. This has given Mr Corbyn an extremely convenient hiding place from his own contradictions. He keeps calling for an election, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/10/corbyn-says-labour-may-need-to-delay-brexit-if-it-wins-snap-election\" title=\"\">repeatedly refuses to trigger</a> the one mechanism that could make that happen because this delays the day when he has to declare whether he is or is not in favour of another referendum. If he fails to table a confidence motion this week, it will become too late to hold an election before Britain is due to leave the EU.</p> <p>In recent days, we have seen senior MPs from different parties working together to try to navigate an escape from the impasse. There is an embryonic cross-party coalition for seeking a solution, but it is desperately late and the obstacles to coalition-building, both cultural and mechanical, are huge. They have had to resort to parliamentary devices that will seem bewildering and arcane even to the most intelligent and engaged of voters.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a terrific scene in The Favourite, the film about the last of the Stuart monarchs, when Queen Anne is about to propose a European policy to her parliament. Just before she opens her mouth, the bewigged MPs make plain that they won\u2019t have it. The queen faints with shock and hits the floor with a thump. I don\u2019t expect Queen Theresa to collapse when she loses in parliament this week, not least because the rejection of her Brexit deal is not going to be a surprise to anyone, herself included. If we still lived by the traditional rules of British politics, defeat ought to be the final curtain for Mrs May. Brexit is the defining task of her premiership and she is about to fail it. We\u2019d ordinarily expect the abdication of the PM to follow such a humiliating rejection. Yet no one, neither friend nor foe, expects her to respond to defeat by submitting her resignation. Brexit has so scrambled our politics that it has normalised dramas that we would once have regarded as extraordinary and made the unthinkable routine. We no longer know which of the rules still apply. Some illumination of how Britain and its parliament got trapped in this howling nightmare is to be found in The Favourite. I hugely recommend this film and not just for the dazzling performances by Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. The drama is footloose with the facts, but it is a prompt to pay more attention to a critical period of our history that is little taught in schools and little known to most Britons. The tensely convoluted relationship between parliament, ministers, monarch and favourites, played out during a war in Europe, echoes into our own era from the age of Anne. Her grandfather, Charles I, had been deprived of his crown and his head after he embarked on a losing struggle with parliament. When her father, James II, exhibited designs to create an absolutist Catholic monarchy, parliament rebelled again. He lost his crown, but escaped with his head, in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. By Anne\u2019s time, quite a lot of clout was still wielded by the monarch \u2013 or by those, such as John and Sarah Churchill, who could get close enough to the monarch to harness the powers of the crown to their own ambitions. The queen could still dismiss her ministers, but power was leaching away. Anne was the last British sovereign to veto a parliamentary bill. Britain had begun its gradual transformation, centuries in the making, into a liberal democracy with an ornamental constitutional monarchy. One consequence of getting there by evolution rather than revolution is that Britain has never had a properly codified constitution. Other nations have sat down, thought about it and inscribed the rules in famous documents with resonant phrases. We have made things up as we have gone along, with the result that many of the laws governing our politics are ambiguous and contested. We never had the equivalent of the founding fathers of the United States. Unlike postwar Japan and Germany, Britain never suffered a devastating military defeat and then had a constitution imposed on us by the winners. You can argue that an ad-hoc constitution has not served Britain entirely badly. We have bolted on innovations in recent decades, such as the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the supreme court, with a relative lack of turbulence. Gaps in the constitution in protecting rights have been filled by membership of the European Union. The previous disinclination of Britons to go to war with themselves over constitutional issues has also meant a high tolerance for absurdities, such as a bloated, unelected second chamber that still calls itself the House of Lords and still contains hereditary peers. The constitution is stuck together from parliamentary conventions, precedents, international agreements, unwritten understandings, judicial rulings and legislative sticky notes. This seemed serviceable enough \u2013 until this spatchcocked structure collided with something as colossal as Brexit. We are partly paying the price for making such a massive decision by simple plebiscite, without having properly settled rules about referendums and how they can be reconciled with representative democracy. It is very hard work to amend the constitution of the United States and a change can only be made if there is a wide and deep consensus. Britain is heading out of the EU, the most consequential act in decades, on the basis of one ballot held nearly three years ago in which just one vote could have decided the outcome. The closeness of the result and the lack of agreement about what it meant spelled trouble from the start. It also led to the inevitable convulsions that were going to follow when a parliament largely against Brexit was tasked with implementing a result most MPs thought a mistake, a challenge without precedent. This conundrum might have been eased had Mrs May responded to her task with a non-partisan, cross-party approach, but she made things harder when she started out by seeking to please one faction of her party alone. The conventions and culture of parliament have deepened the nightmare. The British way of doing politics is founded in the idea that power is a binary contest between two big and tribal parties. It is expressed in the very architecture of the chamber of the House of Commons that sits the two sides confronting each other two swords\u2019 length apart. It is incarnated in parliamentary rules that vest a large amount of power in the two tribal leaders \u2013 the prime minister and the leader of the official opposition. To compound the problem, it is a hung parliament in which the prime minister is a former Remainer trying to find a form of Brexit that can satisfy a majority and the opposition leader is a Brexiter leading a Remainer party who has little interest in trying to resolve the deadlock and lots of incentives to want it to end disastrously. The two of them have great sway over how parliamentary time is allocated and which motions MPs get to debate. This gives them the power to run down the clock \u2013 and both have been exploiting this for different reasons. Mrs May has taken Britain perilously close to the precipice of a crash-out Brexit on the gamble that, when MPs are staring into the abyss, they will finally succumb to her deal. This can be fairly called Blackmail Brexit. Even if she does ultimately prevail this way, forcing MPs to approve a plan they hate under the muzzle of the gun will guarantee further trouble and strife. Parliamentary convention has it that only the leader of the official opposition can table a motion of no confidence in the government. This has given Mr Corbyn an extremely convenient hiding place from his own contradictions. He keeps calling for an election, but repeatedly refuses to trigger the one mechanism that could make that happen because this delays the day when he has to declare whether he is or is not in favour of another referendum. If he fails to table a confidence motion this week, it will become too late to hold an election before Britain is due to leave the EU. In recent days, we have seen senior MPs from different parties working together to try to navigate an escape from the impasse. There is an embryonic cross-party coalition for seeking a solution, but it is desperately late and the obstacles to coalition-building, both cultural and mechanical, are huge. They have had to resort to parliamentary devices that will seem bewildering and arcane even to the most intelligent and engaged of voters. There was a great fuss when the Speaker allowed an amendment, which subsequently passed, instructing Mrs May to quickly report back to parliament when her deal is voted down. We are witnessing these parliamentary explosions about procedural issues and sequencing questions because MPs lack the tools to properly take control of Brexit decision-making. People I respect think that when the dust has finally settled, Britain will need to rethink its casual attitude to the rules of its democracy and embrace a properly codified and protected constitution. Professor Vernon Bogdanor will make that case in a book, Beyond Brexit, to be published in February. Britons might have avoided this nightmare \u2013 or at least been better prepared to cope with it \u2013 had we understood more of our history. Queen Anne, who lost all 17 of her children, died without a direct heir. Rather than risk giving the throne to another troublesome Stuart, pragmatic British parliamentarians recruited a replacement monarch from Germany who did not speak a word of English. His great-great-great-great-great-great-great granddaughter now wears the crown. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist",

It\u2019s her decision to strike. Now she\u2019s made it, I think we will respond to how things develop and try not to feel too much panic.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7e2a1c14-3e93-4d05-b9d8-af2dfd293360\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is an Iranian-British dual national who has been jailed in Iran since April 2016. She has been accused of attempting to orchestrate a \u201csoft overthrow\u201d of the Islamic Republic. She and her three-year-old daughter, Gabriella, were about to return to the UK from Iran after a family visit when she was arrested. Since then, she has spent most of her time in Evin prison in Tehran, separated from her daughter.</p>\n    <p>In January 2019 she went on hunger strike for three days in protest against being denied medical care in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison. In March, the UK Foreign Office granted her diplomatic protection, a step that raised her case from a consular matter to the level of a dispute between the two states.</p>\n    <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe worked for BBC Media Action between February 2009 and October 2010 before moving to Thomson Reuters Foundation, the news agency\u2019s charitable arm, as a project manager. Her family has always said that she was in Iran on holiday.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ratcliffe said his wife was scared that her decision would result in further reprisals from the Iranian authorities after her food rations were cut last week and a programme was aired on state TV in Iran repeating allegations she is a British spy. In particular, the couple fear her twice-weekly visits with their daughter, Gabriella, will be stopped as punishment for the hunger strike.</p> \n<p>\u201cOutside contact has already been restricted,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cWhen she was in solitary confinement she went on hunger strike for six days and they sent her family in to plead with her. It\u2019s not impossible that family visits are disrupted for a bit. And then when she\u2019s weak and vulnerable, family is sent back in to plead she should end it.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added that the Foreign Office had sent him advice stressing the negative physical effects of a hunger strike, which he found too painful to read closely. \u201cWe know a hunger strike has significant physical consequences the longer it goes on for and Nazanin is feeling a strong sense, of trepidation. But there aren\u2019t many ways she can say, \u2018Enough is enough. Take me seriously\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Ratcliffe said his wife, who is 40 and has been detained in Evin since her arrest in April 2016, had made the decision to strike because she wanted to send a message that she was \u201cat the end\u201d and \u201ccannot take any more\u201d.</p> \n<p>She has been denied medical attention for lumps in her breasts and refused neurological care for neck pains and numbness in her arms and legs, despite being referred by the prison doctor for specialist treatment for both. She has also been banned from seeing an outside psychiatrist.</p> \n<p>Ratcliffe has been struggling to keep his wife\u2019s spirits up and simultaneously cope with his own anxieties. \u201cThis week I haven\u2019t gone to sleep before about 2am and I\u2019ve been waking up early. I carry on because you just do, don\u2019t you? But I\u2019ve been half dreading this moment and calming myself that the moment isn\u2019t actually here yet. It certainly feels like the stakes have risen significantly. I think we\u2019re on the precipice,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He sees the decision to deny his wife treatment as an assertion of power by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. \u201cThey obviously don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to die this week and are just asserting that they are in charge. So everyone else can agree she needs medical treatment, and the Foreign Office can demand it, but they\u2019re the ones who give the say-so, and they haven\u2019t. That\u2019s my reading of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Neither he nor Zaghari-Ratcliffe have been able to bring themselves to watch the lengthy TV documentary that was broadcast on Iranian state TV, showing secretly-filmed footage of her arrest at Tehran airport. \u201cThe other prisoners watched it. Nazanin couldn\u2019t watch it. She left the room. But she heard it and she heard again the voices of her interrogators ... I still haven\u2019t be able to watch it either.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both of them found the broadcast shocking. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that, actually, all of this has been secretly filmed on a secret camera, perhaps hidden in a bag. It\u2019s very violating.\u201d He thinks broadcasting the footage was a way of sending a powerful message to the Iranian diaspora: \u201cWe can take who we want. No one can stop us. This could happen to you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ratcliffe met the British ambassador last week to find out what diplomatic discussions have been taking place behind the scenes and what the ultimate response of the British government will be if medical access continues to be denied to his wife. \u201cThe foreign secretary [Jeremy Hunt] made a clear ultimatum and got promises from the Iranian authorities they were going to give her the health treatment she needs. He said, do it or there will be consequences. Now Nazanin is essentially saying the same thing, there will be consequences if I don\u2019t get this treatment I need. The Iranian authorities are playing with fire.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is \u201cfeeling a strong sense of trepidation\u201d ahead of a hunger strike she intends to start tomorrow, but will pursue the high-stakes strategy despite fears that the Iranian authorities will cut off her daughter\u2019s visits as a result, her husband has said. The British-Iranian dual national plans to strike for three days in protest against being denied medical care in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison, but will consider extending the protest if her demands to be seen by a doctor are not met, Richard Ratcliffe said. \u201cThe question is whether she\u2019ll just strike for the three days she announced or whether she\u2019ll decide to go on,\u201d said Ratcliffe, whose phone calls with his wife were cut back after she announced her plan to go on hunger strike. \u201cShe\u2019s giving slightly mixed messages, depending on whether she\u2019s feeling daunted or angry ... It\u2019s her decision to strike. Now she\u2019s made it, I think we will respond to how things develop and try not to feel too much panic.\u201d Ratcliffe said his wife was scared that her decision would result in further reprisals from the Iranian authorities after her food rations were cut last week and a programme was aired on state TV in Iran repeating allegations she is a British spy. In particular, the couple fear her twice-weekly visits with their daughter, Gabriella, will be stopped as punishment for the hunger strike. \u201cOutside contact has already been restricted,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cWhen she was in solitary confinement she went on hunger strike for six days and they sent her family in to plead with her. It\u2019s not impossible that family visits are disrupted for a bit. And then when she\u2019s weak and vulnerable, family is sent back in to plead she should end it.\u201d He added that the Foreign Office had sent him advice stressing the negative physical effects of a hunger strike, which he found too painful to read closely. \u201cWe know a hunger strike has significant physical consequences the longer it goes on for and Nazanin is feeling a strong sense, of trepidation. But there aren\u2019t many ways she can say, \u2018Enough is enough. Take me seriously\u2019,\u201d he said. Ratcliffe said his wife, who is 40 and has been detained in Evin since her arrest in April 2016, had made the decision to strike because she wanted to send a message that she was \u201cat the end\u201d and \u201ccannot take any more\u201d. She has been denied medical attention for lumps in her breasts and refused neurological care for neck pains and numbness in her arms and legs, despite being referred by the prison doctor for specialist treatment for both. She has also been banned from seeing an outside psychiatrist. Ratcliffe has been struggling to keep his wife\u2019s spirits up and simultaneously cope with his own anxieties. \u201cThis week I haven\u2019t gone to sleep before about 2am and I\u2019ve been waking up early. I carry on because you just do, don\u2019t you? But I\u2019ve been half dreading this moment and calming myself that the moment isn\u2019t actually here yet. It certainly feels like the stakes have risen significantly. I think we\u2019re on the precipice,\u201d he said. He sees the decision to deny his wife treatment as an assertion of power by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. \u201cThey obviously don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to die this week and are just asserting that they are in charge. So everyone else can agree she needs medical treatment, and the Foreign Office can demand it, but they\u2019re the ones who give the say-so, and they haven\u2019t. That\u2019s my reading of it.\u201d Neither he nor Zaghari-Ratcliffe have been able to bring themselves to watch the lengthy TV documentary that was broadcast on Iranian state TV, showing secretly-filmed footage of her arrest at Tehran airport. \u201cThe other prisoners watched it. Nazanin couldn\u2019t watch it. She left the room. But she heard it and she heard again the voices of her interrogators ... I still haven\u2019t be able to watch it either.\u201d Both of them found the broadcast shocking. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that, actually, all of this has been secretly filmed on a secret camera, perhaps hidden in a bag. It\u2019s very violating.\u201d He thinks broadcasting the footage was a way of sending a powerful message to the Iranian diaspora: \u201cWe can take who we want. No one can stop us. This could happen to you.\u201d Ratcliffe met the British ambassador last week to find out what diplomatic discussions have been taking place behind the scenes and what the ultimate response of the British government will be if medical access continues to be denied to his wife. \u201cThe foreign secretary [Jeremy Hunt] made a clear ultimatum and got promises from the Iranian authorities they were going to give her the health treatment she needs. He said, do it or there will be consequences. Now Nazanin is essentially saying the same thing, there will be consequences if I don\u2019t get this treatment I need. The Iranian authorities are playing with fire.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When England Netball sat down with three of their closest rivals to create the Quad Series this decade, their motivation was twofold. One factor was that a regular international showpiece beyond the four-yearly World Cup would play better with sponsors and broadcasters, who had previously been offered little in the way of a consistent calendar. Another was to ensure the best could complete against one another more often. The wisdom behind that thinking will be gloriously evident in Liverpool todayon Sunday. England will begin the competition\u2019s sixth edition with a match against New Zealand and its place in the public consciousness has never been higher. This was always intended to be netball\u2019s equivalent of rugby union\u2019s Six Nations, a stand-alone tournament whose kudos will grow as storylines are written and rivalries forged, and the events of last year have taken its allure to new levels. \u201cEverybody is coming out to beat England,\u201d says Helen Housby, who shot to fame when she scored the winning point in the Commonwealth Games final against Australia last April.

That thing is often in disguise \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a political article, maybe it\u2019s a cookbook, maybe it\u2019s a collection of poetry \u2013 but I\u2019m writing the same thing, over and over again.</p> <p>It\u2019s this: it\u2019s nice to have a friend.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never written anything that wasn\u2019t really about the pure joy of meeting someone who gets it and gets you. In everything I ever write I\u2019m trying to articulate why friends are so good, and why we devalue friendship in favour of other kinds of relationship, and how all relationships are more complicated and beautiful and boundless than the labels we stick on them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We just don\u2019t have the vocab because we don\u2019t really believe that friendship matters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The word \u201cfriend\u201d has to cover all manner of sins. It has to mean that girl you work with, but don\u2019t want to offend; a mutual Twitter follower you\u2019ve never met, but speak to every day; the flatmate who makes you toast every morning. It\u2019s the same word for someone you\u2019ve just met as for someone who has known you your whole life; it\u2019s the same word for somebody you kind of like as for somebody without whom you feel like you might die. We just don\u2019t have the vocab because, culturally speaking, we don\u2019t really believe that friendship matters.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends,\u201d we say, of someone we love dearly, but aren\u2019t sleeping with. \u201cJust friends, nothing more,\u201d as if friendship were a sort of place on the road to monogamous sex-on-tap. Because we\u2019re obsessed with couples, with The One. The One is Friendship Plus. The One is the most evolved Pok\u00e9mon of love.

Even with my flexible definitions of family, expanding and contracting depending on who was around, I was pretty sure that it was just a question of finding the right One. I thought that with the right One, I\u2019d do it all properly. Nuclear family with all the bits correctly labelled, like a diagram in a science textbook.</p> <p>And then, you see, I met him. He was \u2013 and I am unbiased here \u2013 really something. He was a smasher. He was funny and mean and beautiful and clever, and I absolutely worshipped him, and then he died.</p> <p>There\u2019s a bit in the 2002 classic <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/26/2002inreview\" title=\"\">About a Boy</a> </em>that I think about all the time. A thing that tiny Nicholas Hoult in his woolly hat says, just after his mum Toni Collette tries to kill herself. He says, \u201cThat\u2019s when I realised: two people isn\u2019t enough. You\u2019ve got to have backup. If there are only two people, and one of you drops off the edge, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p> <p>My person, the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2015/aug/13/john-underwood-cancer-fundraising-drive-twitter\" title=\"\">John Underwood</a>, dropped off the edge by degrees. He had cancer, to start with; then he acquired a brain injury; and then he died.</p> <p>The thing about his getting ill was this: he got sick at exactly the wrong age. We were the wrong age. I was just 22, he was 25, 25 is a year too old for the young person\u2019s cancer unit, where they have PlayStations and support networks; but much too young for the \u201chow to tell your children you have cancer\u201d and \u201cmortgage support\u201d leaflets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bdfe08d57087262e1a8605a6e304de71dad41b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bdfe08d57087262e1a8605a6e304de71dad41b3/1325_522_2206_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Underwood and goddaughter Leila\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The thing about his getting ill was this: he got sick at exactly the wrong age\u2019: John Underwood and goddaughter Leila.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joanna Nicole Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps if we\u2019d been just a bit older, we\u2019d have had a house and kids and a marriage certificate of our own, and if we\u2019d have been just a bit younger, we\u2019d have gone home to our parents and been kids again ourselves. But we were who we were, and we had what we had, and what we had was each other. We had each other, and our friends.</p> <p>\u201cFriends are the family you choose\u201d is a trite statement, but I watched as it became true. In the mad world of John\u2019s sickness, friendship became to us something as important as any blood relationship, something as vital and meaningful and profound as any romantic relationship.</p> <p>Other people our age were bonding over nights out and drinking and occasional trips to A&amp;E. Other people our age never thought about blood counts or sperm banks or any other bodily fluids outside the context of a sexual health clinic. Other people our age lived in a world that seemed entirely distinct from ours, like two pieces of acetate laid over each other. I used to come out of the hospital and stare at people in pubs on my way home, baffled it could be Friday and baffled that Friday meant something still.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It must be said that we were a pretty close-knit friendship group before my partner had cancer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It must be said that we were a pretty close-knit friendship group before my partner had cancer. We did elaborate birthday treats and dinners that went on until well past the last tube. We talked a lot. We walked a lot. We lay around on the sofa, drinking red wine and playing the guitar, like people from films. If this sounds romantic, it\u2019s meant to: it was.</p> <p>What else could you call it? I met Caroline at a party my first year in London; we locked eyes and fell hopelessly in love and knew we were best friends. A little while later we ran through the rain together, holding hands and laughing.</p> <p>Harry \u2013 a work colleague of John, and a stranger to me \u2013 turned up an hour early to a dinner party I\u2019d forgotten was happening; we started talking about music and pies and we\u2019ve been doing that, pretty much, ever since.</p> <p>Lily offered me a doughnut in a pub; Lettie asked me about a (cheerfully gaudy) statuette of Catherine of Aragon in my window; I ran into Cornelia\u2019s arms outside the Gare du Nord on an unseasonally warm October day a decade ago now; I saw Katya in a queue and immediately texted a mutual friend to demand we be set up. In the romcom world, they call this a meet-cute. In the real world, we don\u2019t have a vocabulary for meeting people we don\u2019t want to sleep with. If I have a flexible definition of family, I also now have a flexible definition of romance. Which gives me a kind of freedom from overthinking things. Freedom to be different; to change and to grow and to evolve.</p> <p>And in that way, once John was ill, our friendships became different. Our meet-cutes became real, profound, life-changing relationships. It was only then, when our world had fallen apart, that our friends became our family. We were forged in a kind of emotional fire, I suppose, and the word \u201cfriend\u201d started to sound almost laughable. They were there, too. They were in the hospital with us; they were at the end of the phone at two in the morning. They were there for our birthdays and Christmases when we couldn\u2019t go to our families for fear of being far from the hospital. They were there for celebratory dinners whenever his blood counts got better and commiseration drinks when things got awful again. They slept in our bed and on our sofa and sat in hospital caf\u00e9s for hours until I had a minute. They smuggled guitars and expensive meatball sandwiches into sterile wards; folded laundry and answered emails and drove cars and were, in every sense, there.</p> <p>Some of them I\u2019d known for a long time; some I barely knew at all. If you said you\u2019d been dating someone for a year, you\u2019d imply a certain degree of seriousness; to say you\u2019ve only been friends with someone for a year implies in some ways that you barely know them. But they were there, and they were family.</p> <p><em><strong>\u201c</strong></em>Friend\u201d seemed such<em><strong> </strong></em>a flimsy word to describe a person who had washed your clothes and helped you dress; a person who had driven you to the beach so that you could yell into the sea, and filled your fridge, and cleaned your sink; a person who had pushed squares of Marmite toast into your open mouth as if you were a baby bird; a person who had curled herself around you as you slept so that if you woke you wouldn\u2019t feel the coldness of the space across the double bed. \u201cFriend\u201d didn\u2019t carry the kind of weight we needed it to bear \u2013 it didn\u2019t carry the heft of the burden at all. It didn\u2019t carry the duty, the responsibility, the care. It did not carry the love. It\u2019s hard to write about this in a way that doesn\u2019t feel fragile or melodramatic or saccharine: we don\u2019t have the language.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e0193c7586c49e3dfae5f382097d61b173014fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e0193c7586c49e3dfae5f382097d61b173014fb/96_126_1099_659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Maybe you will be worried about being alone now\u2026\u2019 Ella facing the future.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Maybe you will be worried about being alone now\u2026\u2019 Ella facing the future.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Day</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With Caroline, we went for \u201cmy sister\u201d, often; sometimes \u201cmy wife\u201d. Our friend Harry became our collective \u201cwayward nephew\u201d: it seemed easier than explaining the complex intricacies of our gentle co-dependence. A gang of women I adored became my \u201caunts\u201d, sending hampers and cards and constant support. Mark was our \u201cLondon Dad\u201d; Lily mothered me and fed me fish fingers as she fed her own small daughter. The small daughter \u2013 our godchild \u2013 drew pictures.</p> <p>They were there the whole time, and they were there after he died and we were all left, reeling. But I was not on my own. I was never on my own. We had lost a pillar of our family, but there were enough of us left to hold each other up.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you will be worried about being alone now,\u201d our godchild (seven) wrote to me carefully, after John died. \u201cBut, you are my family and you do not have to be!\u201d This part was underlined twice, in red pen, with a ruler.</p> <p>We are friends, my goddaughter and I, in that we talk about things that we both like (pictures of horses, Taylor Swift) and build Lego together and she tells me, cryptically, about the gossip from Year Four. But she\u2019s right: we\u2019re more than that. We\u2019re family.</p> <p>We\u2019re family in the way my housemate Tash and I are family: we\u2019re a household, technically speaking, because we share \u201cat least one meal a day together\u201d (what a lovely definition that is). But it\u2019s more than that: she knows everything that happens to me, because she\u2019s the one here. We have small domestic routines, and all the tiny intimacies that you learn when you live with someone. I make the tea; she makes the toast. I cook; she washes up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I see tiny signs that we might be moving collectively away from that 1950s 'couples' cultural burden of The One</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou sound\u2026 married,\u201d someone remarked the other day, and I told Tash this over dinner and we agreed it made sense. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re alone in this kind of non- marital domestic set-up: every week I hear about women living together to raise their children, or someone living with his adopted granny, or some other kind of non-nuclear communal living. \u201cI used to think two wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Nicholas Hoult also says, at the end of <em>About </em><em>a Boy</em>, looking around at his new, chaotic life full of relationships that are impossible to articulate. \u201cAnd now there were loads of people. I don\u2019t think couples are the future. You need more than that. You need back-up.\u201d</p> <p>I see tiny signs that we might be moving collectively away from that cultural burden of The One: queer culture in particular has taught me a great deal about perceptions of love. I like this; I hope it means that one day we\u2019ll have the language to explain it. But until then, I\u2019ll keep looking. I\u2019ll keep trying to articulate it, keep writing 2,000 words to try and say it better. For now, though, I\u2019ll just keep flying this flag: it\u2019s nice to have a friend.</p> <p><em>Midnight Chicken and Other Recipes Worth Living For by Ella Risbridger and Elisa Cunningham (Bloomsbury, \u00a322).

      "bodyText": "I have written a lot of things in my life, but this year it has become clear to me that I only have one story to tell. That thing is often in disguise \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a political article, maybe it\u2019s a cookbook, maybe it\u2019s a collection of poetry \u2013 but I\u2019m writing the same thing, over and over again. It\u2019s this: it\u2019s nice to have a friend. I\u2019ve never written anything that wasn\u2019t really about the pure joy of meeting someone who gets it and gets you. In everything I ever write I\u2019m trying to articulate why friends are so good, and why we devalue friendship in favour of other kinds of relationship, and how all relationships are more complicated and beautiful and boundless than the labels we stick on them. The word \u201cfriend\u201d has to cover all manner of sins. It has to mean that girl you work with, but don\u2019t want to offend; a mutual Twitter follower you\u2019ve never met, but speak to every day; the flatmate who makes you toast every morning. It\u2019s the same word for someone you\u2019ve just met as for someone who has known you your whole life; it\u2019s the same word for somebody you kind of like as for somebody without whom you feel like you might die. We just don\u2019t have the vocab because, culturally speaking, we don\u2019t really believe that friendship matters. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends,\u201d we say, of someone we love dearly, but aren\u2019t sleeping with. \u201cJust friends, nothing more,\u201d as if friendship were a sort of place on the road to monogamous sex-on-tap. Because we\u2019re obsessed with couples, with The One. The One is Friendship Plus. The One is the most evolved Pok\u00e9mon of love. This is, when you think about it, a profoundly curious idea: a real multiple-egg-single- basket distribution error. I didn\u2019t used to think like this. Even with my flexible definitions of family, expanding and contracting depending on who was around, I was pretty sure that it was just a question of finding the right One. I thought that with the right One, I\u2019d do it all properly. Nuclear family with all the bits correctly labelled, like a diagram in a science textbook. And then, you see, I met him. He was \u2013 and I am unbiased here \u2013 really something. He was a smasher. He was funny and mean and beautiful and clever, and I absolutely worshipped him, and then he died. There\u2019s a bit in the 2002 classic About a Boy that I think about all the time. A thing that tiny Nicholas Hoult in his woolly hat says, just after his mum Toni Collette tries to kill herself. He says, \u201cThat\u2019s when I realised: two people isn\u2019t enough. You\u2019ve got to have backup. If there are only two people, and one of you drops off the edge, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d My person, the writer John Underwood, dropped off the edge by degrees. He had cancer, to start with; then he acquired a brain injury; and then he died. The thing about his getting ill was this: he got sick at exactly the wrong age. We were the wrong age. I was just 22, he was 25, 25 is a year too old for the young person\u2019s cancer unit, where they have PlayStations and support networks; but much too young for the \u201chow to tell your children you have cancer\u201d and \u201cmortgage support\u201d leaflets. Perhaps if we\u2019d been just a bit older, we\u2019d have had a house and kids and a marriage certificate of our own, and if we\u2019d have been just a bit younger, we\u2019d have gone home to our parents and been kids again ourselves. But we were who we were, and we had what we had, and what we had was each other. We had each other, and our friends. \u201cFriends are the family you choose\u201d is a trite statement, but I watched as it became true. In the mad world of John\u2019s sickness, friendship became to us something as important as any blood relationship, something as vital and meaningful and profound as any romantic relationship. Other people our age were bonding over nights out and drinking and occasional trips to A&amp;E. Other people our age never thought about blood counts or sperm banks or any other bodily fluids outside the context of a sexual health clinic. Other people our age lived in a world that seemed entirely distinct from ours, like two pieces of acetate laid over each other. I used to come out of the hospital and stare at people in pubs on my way home, baffled it could be Friday and baffled that Friday meant something still. It must be said that we were a pretty close-knit friendship group before my partner had cancer. We did elaborate birthday treats and dinners that went on until well past the last tube. We talked a lot. We walked a lot. We lay around on the sofa, drinking red wine and playing the guitar, like people from films. If this sounds romantic, it\u2019s meant to: it was. What else could you call it? I met Caroline at a party my first year in London; we locked eyes and fell hopelessly in love and knew we were best friends. A little while later we ran through the rain together, holding hands and laughing. Harry \u2013 a work colleague of John, and a stranger to me \u2013 turned up an hour early to a dinner party I\u2019d forgotten was happening; we started talking about music and pies and we\u2019ve been doing that, pretty much, ever since. Lily offered me a doughnut in a pub; Lettie asked me about a (cheerfully gaudy) statuette of Catherine of Aragon in my window; I ran into Cornelia\u2019s arms outside the Gare du Nord on an unseasonally warm October day a decade ago now; I saw Katya in a queue and immediately texted a mutual friend to demand we be set up. In the romcom world, they call this a meet-cute. In the real world, we don\u2019t have a vocabulary for meeting people we don\u2019t want to sleep with. If I have a flexible definition of family, I also now have a flexible definition of romance. Which gives me a kind of freedom from overthinking things. Freedom to be different; to change and to grow and to evolve. And in that way, once John was ill, our friendships became different. Our meet-cutes became real, profound, life-changing relationships. It was only then, when our world had fallen apart, that our friends became our family. We were forged in a kind of emotional fire, I suppose, and the word \u201cfriend\u201d started to sound almost laughable. They were there, too. They were in the hospital with us; they were at the end of the phone at two in the morning. They were there for our birthdays and Christmases when we couldn\u2019t go to our families for fear of being far from the hospital. They were there for celebratory dinners whenever his blood counts got better and commiseration drinks when things got awful again. They slept in our bed and on our sofa and sat in hospital caf\u00e9s for hours until I had a minute. They smuggled guitars and expensive meatball sandwiches into sterile wards; folded laundry and answered emails and drove cars and were, in every sense, there. Some of them I\u2019d known for a long time; some I barely knew at all. If you said you\u2019d been dating someone for a year, you\u2019d imply a certain degree of seriousness; to say you\u2019ve only been friends with someone for a year implies in some ways that you barely know them. But they were there, and they were family. \u201cFriend\u201d seemed such a flimsy word to describe a person who had washed your clothes and helped you dress; a person who had driven you to the beach so that you could yell into the sea, and filled your fridge, and cleaned your sink; a person who had pushed squares of Marmite toast into your open mouth as if you were a baby bird; a person who had curled herself around you as you slept so that if you woke you wouldn\u2019t feel the coldness of the space across the double bed. \u201cFriend\u201d didn\u2019t carry the kind of weight we needed it to bear \u2013 it didn\u2019t carry the heft of the burden at all. It didn\u2019t carry the duty, the responsibility, the care. It did not carry the love. It\u2019s hard to write about this in a way that doesn\u2019t feel fragile or melodramatic or saccharine: we don\u2019t have the language. With Caroline, we went for \u201cmy sister\u201d, often; sometimes \u201cmy wife\u201d. Our friend Harry became our collective \u201cwayward nephew\u201d: it seemed easier than explaining the complex intricacies of our gentle co-dependence. A gang of women I adored became my \u201caunts\u201d, sending hampers and cards and constant support. Mark was our \u201cLondon Dad\u201d; Lily mothered me and fed me fish fingers as she fed her own small daughter. The small daughter \u2013 our godchild \u2013 drew pictures. They were there the whole time, and they were there after he died and we were all left, reeling. But I was not on my own. I was never on my own. We had lost a pillar of our family, but there were enough of us left to hold each other up. \u201cMaybe you will be worried about being alone now,\u201d our godchild (seven) wrote to me carefully, after John died. \u201cBut, you are my family and you do not have to be!\u201d This part was underlined twice, in red pen, with a ruler. We are friends, my goddaughter and I, in that we talk about things that we both like (pictures of horses, Taylor Swift) and build Lego together and she tells me, cryptically, about the gossip from Year Four. But she\u2019s right: we\u2019re more than that. We\u2019re family. We\u2019re family in the way my housemate Tash and I are family: we\u2019re a household, technically speaking, because we share \u201cat least one meal a day together\u201d (what a lovely definition that is). But it\u2019s more than that: she knows everything that happens to me, because she\u2019s the one here. We have small domestic routines, and all the tiny intimacies that you learn when you live with someone. I make the tea; she makes the toast. I cook; she washes up. \u201cYou sound\u2026 married,\u201d someone remarked the other day, and I told Tash this over dinner and we agreed it made sense. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re alone in this kind of non- marital domestic set-up: every week I hear about women living together to raise their children, or someone living with his adopted granny, or some other kind of non-nuclear communal living. \u201cI used to think two wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Nicholas Hoult also says, at the end of About a Boy, looking around at his new, chaotic life full of relationships that are impossible to articulate. \u201cAnd now there were loads of people. I don\u2019t think couples are the future. You need more than that. You need back-up.\u201d I see tiny signs that we might be moving collectively away from that cultural burden of The One: queer culture in particular has taught me a great deal about perceptions of love. I like this; I hope it means that one day we\u2019ll have the language to explain it. But until then, I\u2019ll keep looking. I\u2019ll keep trying to articulate it, keep writing 2,000 words to try and say it better. For now, though, I\u2019ll just keep flying this flag: it\u2019s nice to have a friend.

Google\u2019s Nest Cam IQ is a wired camera available in both indoor and outdoor variants. Both versions need plugging into the mains, which limits where you can put them compared to battery-powered products. But it also means you get the best-in-class camera, which captures up to 1080p video in HDR, a good 130-degree field-of-view and night vision.</p> <p>The indoor Nest Cam IQ is a relatively attractive lollipop-style camera with wifi built in, which can be wall or ceiling mounted, but most will probably just put it on a bookshelf or something similar. The outdoor version is shaped like a large spotlight and is screwed into the wall on a rotating, angled bracket. An indoor plug comes with it, meant to be threaded through the wall into the back of the camera, but a weatherproof alternative is available to buy for \u00a349 if needed.</p> <p>Without a Nest Aware subscription you get live video feeds, motion alerts and three hours of image snapshots of events in the Nest app on your smartphone or tablet.</p> <p>Things get a lot smarter with a \u00a34 per month 5-day Nest Aware subscription, adding continuous cloud recording, not just motion events, which makes it the best here for capturing everything that happens indoors or outside.</p> <p>You also get smarter detection of events, activity zones, clips and time lapses in the app, brilliant motion gif alerts, and face recognition.</p> <p>By tagging faces with names as they\u2019re detected you can get the camera to recognise whether a friend or family member has shown up rather than a stranger. It worked well after undergoing a bit of training to spot that me with glasses on, me with a hat and me buckling under the weight of Christmas shopping were all the same person.</p> <p>You can talk through the camera via the app, or even access Google Assistant by saying \u201cHey, Google\u201d to the indoor version of the camera like one of Google\u2019s smart speakers.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> It\u2019s expensive, but if you need high-quality continuous monitoring, the Nest Cam IQ is the smartest of smart cameras. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/circle-2-home-security-camera\" title=\"\">Logitech Circle 2</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>\u00a3199 </strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25f70bf3b4aba71a2ff774c6e4d277af22f9d026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25f70bf3b4aba71a2ff774c6e4d277af22f9d026/0_206_4895_2936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the logitech circle 2 smart camera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Logitech Circle 2: simple, flexible and adaptable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Logitech Circle 2 series of cameras that start at \u00a3169 for wired, or \u00a3199 for battery-powered, prove that feature packed flexibility needn\u2019t be complicated.</p> <p>The little globe-shaped camera is simple to set up and use. Open the Logitech Circle app on your phone, connect the camera to wifi, place the camera somewhere and you\u2019re good to go \u2013 no need for another box or subscription.</p> <p>You get 24 hours of cloud storage with video downloads and smart alerts free, plus a good 30-second summary of the day\u2019s action in the app. If you want more it\u2019s \u00a32.99 a month for 14-day cloud storage.</p> <p>The Circle 2 is flexible too. Being weatherproof, it can be used indoors or out, has night vision, a 180-degree field of view and streams up to 1080p video. The camera bit unscrews from the back making swapping between mains and battery easy, while a variety of mounts mean you can stick it just about anywhere, including on the inside of a window looking out. It even proved durable enough to survive a couple of falls from my bannister, knocked off in the bluster of Christmas preparations.</p> <p>The battery lasts around a month when placed in a hallway, or longer if there are fewer events to record, and you can talk through it to whoever comes calling using the app on your smartphone.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The Logitech Circle 2 is simple, flexible and adaptable, making it great for those who don\u2019t want to mess around with more advanced and costly systems. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.arlo.com/uk/products/arlo-pro-2/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Arlo Pro 2</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>\u00a3347 </strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c730d839595d5e6ade7c16a1d09df7ce5ee1502b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c730d839595d5e6ade7c16a1d09df7ce5ee1502b/0_143_3438_2063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the arlo pro 2 camera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Arlo Pro 2: small, weatherproof, go-anywhere design.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Arlo Pro 2 consists of a battery-powered camera, which can also be plugged in, and a base station with a siren and local recording capability that connects to your router via ethernet.</p> <p>At first the requirement for a base station was irritating, but I quickly found out that the ear-splitting siren makes for a much better alarm system. The cameras are small and weatherproof and can be stuck just about anywhere, with various mounts available.</p> <p>What they can do depends if they\u2019re on battery power or not. Plugged in, they offer up to three activity zones capturing a rolling three seconds before any event, sound detection and continuous recording. On battery power you\u2019re limited to motion-triggered recording and alerts, but the battery lasts around two months in medium-activity zones such as a hallway or much longer in a backyard alley.</p> <p>The cameras capture up to 1080p video with a 130-degree field of view and night vision. You also get three seven-day cloud event recordings for up to five cameras. Paying \u00a36.49 takes that up to 30 days and 10 cameras, while \u00a36.99 a month per camera will record video 24/7 for 14 days.</p> <p>The Arlo app is not quite as good as the Ring or Nest app, but still gets the basics right, handling setup fairly easily, alerts and live streams.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> They aren\u2019t cheap, but if you need compact cameras all over your house and garden, even in awkward positions, then the Arlo Pro 2 is for you.</p>",

It worked well after undergoing a bit of training to spot that me with glasses on, me with a hat and me buckling under the weight of Christmas shopping were all the same person. You can talk through the camera via the app, or even access Google Assistant by saying \u201cHey, Google\u201d to the indoor version of the camera like one of Google\u2019s smart speakers. Verdict: It\u2019s expensive, but if you need high-quality continuous monitoring, the Nest Cam IQ is the smartest of smart cameras. Logitech Circle 2 \u00a3199 The Logitech Circle 2 series of cameras that start at \u00a3169 for wired, or \u00a3199 for battery-powered, prove that feature packed flexibility needn\u2019t be complicated. The little globe-shaped camera is simple to set up and use. Open the Logitech Circle app on your phone, connect the camera to wifi, place the camera somewhere and you\u2019re good to go \u2013 no need for another box or subscription. You get 24 hours of cloud storage with video downloads and smart alerts free, plus a good 30-second summary of the day\u2019s action in the app. If you want more it\u2019s \u00a32.99 a month for 14-day cloud storage. The Circle 2 is flexible too. Being weatherproof, it can be used indoors or out, has night vision, a 180-degree field of view and streams up to 1080p video. The camera bit unscrews from the back making swapping between mains and battery easy, while a variety of mounts mean you can stick it just about anywhere, including on the inside of a window looking out. It even proved durable enough to survive a couple of falls from my bannister, knocked off in the bluster of Christmas preparations. The battery lasts around a month when placed in a hallway, or longer if there are fewer events to record, and you can talk through it to whoever comes calling using the app on your smartphone. Verdict: The Logitech Circle 2 is simple, flexible and adaptable, making it great for those who don\u2019t want to mess around with more advanced and costly systems. Arlo Pro 2 \u00a3347 The Arlo Pro 2 consists of a battery-powered camera, which can also be plugged in, and a base station with a siren and local recording capability that connects to your router via ethernet. At first the requirement for a base station was irritating, but I quickly found out that the ear-splitting siren makes for a much better alarm system. The cameras are small and weatherproof and can be stuck just about anywhere, with various mounts available. What they can do depends if they\u2019re on battery power or not. Plugged in, they offer up to three activity zones capturing a rolling three seconds before any event, sound detection and continuous recording. On battery power you\u2019re limited to motion-triggered recording and alerts, but the battery lasts around two months in medium-activity zones such as a hallway or much longer in a backyard alley. The cameras capture up to 1080p video with a 130-degree field of view and night vision. You also get three seven-day cloud event recordings for up to five cameras. Paying \u00a36.49 takes that up to 30 days and 10 cameras, while \u00a36.99 a month per camera will record video 24/7 for 14 days. The Arlo app is not quite as good as the Ring or Nest app, but still gets the basics right, handling setup fairly easily, alerts and live streams. Verdict: They aren\u2019t cheap, but if you need compact cameras all over your house and garden, even in awkward positions, then the Arlo Pro 2 is for you.",

      "body": "<p>Like the comedy greats to whom this winningly warm film pays tribute, Jon S Baird\u2019s affectionate drama balances humour and pathos, laughter and tears. Set in Laurel and Hardy\u2019s twilight years, it\u2019s more melancholy love story than slapstick showbiz reminiscence. <em>Philomena</em> co-writer Jeff Pope\u2019s inventive script (inspired by <a href=\"http://www.laurelandhardybooks.com/britishtours.html\" title=\"\">AJ Marriot\u2019s factual account</a> of Stan and Ollie\u2019s post-war British theatre tours) paints the performers as an odd couple, professionally joined at the hip yet sometimes separated at the heart. Superb headline performances from Steve Coogan and John C Reilly are matched by equally sparkling supporting turns from Nina Arianda and Shirley Henderson as Stan and Ollie\u2019s combative wives, providing what an astute promoter dubs \u201ctwo double acts for the price of one!\u201d</p> <p>We first meet Laurel and Hardy in 1937, at the top of their Hollywood game. They\u2019re popular, but underpaid, at least compared to \u201cCharlie, Buster and Harold\u201d who \u201cown their own pictures\u201d, and their contracts are, crucially, out of sync. While filming an unforgettable dance routine from <em>Way Out West</em>, Stan threatens to leave his co-producer Hal Roach, insisting: \u201cYou can\u2019t have Hardy without Laurel.\u201d When Roach (played on the brink of caricature by Danny Huston) calls his bluff, Stan heads to Fox, sure that Ollie will follow.</p> <p>Sixteen years later, with finances failing, Laurel and Hardy arrive in Newcastle, Stan greyer, Ollie heavier (hats off to makeup and prosthetics designers Jeremy Woodhead and Mark Coulier), both nursing old wounds. They\u2019re supposedly touring to support a new movie project, a Robin Hood spoof Stan claims to have set up with a British producer. But while Norman Wisdom is winning hearts in theatres and Abbott and Costello are going to Mars in cinemas, Stan struggles to land a meeting with elusive money-man Mr Miffin.

      "bodyText": "Like the comedy greats to whom this winningly warm film pays tribute, Jon S Baird\u2019s affectionate drama balances humour and pathos, laughter and tears. Set in Laurel and Hardy\u2019s twilight years, it\u2019s more melancholy love story than slapstick showbiz reminiscence. Philomena co-writer Jeff Pope\u2019s inventive script (inspired by AJ Marriot\u2019s factual account of Stan and Ollie\u2019s post-war British theatre tours) paints the performers as an odd couple, professionally joined at the hip yet sometimes separated at the heart. Superb headline performances from Steve Coogan and John C Reilly are matched by equally sparkling supporting turns from Nina Arianda and Shirley Henderson as Stan and Ollie\u2019s combative wives, providing what an astute promoter dubs \u201ctwo double acts for the price of one!\u201d We first meet Laurel and Hardy in 1937, at the top of their Hollywood game. They\u2019re popular, but underpaid, at least compared to \u201cCharlie, Buster and Harold\u201d who \u201cown their own pictures\u201d, and their contracts are, crucially, out of sync. While filming an unforgettable dance routine from Way Out West, Stan threatens to leave his co-producer Hal Roach, insisting: \u201cYou can\u2019t have Hardy without Laurel.\u201d When Roach (played on the brink of caricature by Danny Huston) calls his bluff, Stan heads to Fox, sure that Ollie will follow. Sixteen years later, with finances failing, Laurel and Hardy arrive in Newcastle, Stan greyer, Ollie heavier (hats off to makeup and prosthetics designers Jeremy Woodhead and Mark Coulier), both nursing old wounds. They\u2019re supposedly touring to support a new movie project, a Robin Hood spoof Stan claims to have set up with a British producer. But while Norman Wisdom is winning hearts in theatres and Abbott and Costello are going to Mars in cinemas, Stan struggles to land a meeting with elusive money-man Mr Miffin. As for Ollie, whom everyone calls \u201cBabe\u201d, tired knees and a weakened heart make the tour a chore. \u201cI thought you\u2019d retired,\u201d says a boarding house clerk and clearly she\u2019s not the only one. Despite half-empty houses and low-rent lodgings, the pair gradually find their feet, the \u201cbeautiful madness\u201d of a dexterously executed double-door routine melting the heart of impresario Bernard Delfont (Rufus Jones in smashing, charmy-smarmy form). But it\u2019s the arrival of the wives that really shifts things up a gear. As the flinty Ida, Nina Arianda is a hoot, imperiously dismissive yet tenderly protective of her Stanley, keen to remind everyone that she too was an actor. \u201cMore of a dancer, really,\u201d tuts Shirley Henderson\u2019s quietly territorial Lucille, \u201cwith a very high pain threshold.\u201d Throughout, there\u2019s an intriguing interplay between the performers\u2019 real and fictional personae that lends emotional weight to the \u201cstuff and nonsense\u201d of their act.

      "body": "<p>Vishal Vora used eBay to auction a \u00a3115 BabyBj\u00f6rn bouncer when his children had grown out of it. He washed it, listed it as used and accepted an offer of \u00a356 plus \u00a35 postage from an expectant mother. As soon as it was delivered the buyer complained that it was \u201cliterally covered in faeces\u201d and demanded a \u00a320 reduction in the price. Vora offered \u00a37.50, although the screenshot of a photo sent by the buyer did not show evidence of staining. </p> <p>The buyer then opened a case with eBay which advised she could return it and receive a refund. She was duly refunded by the company but she never sent the bouncer back. Weeks later, Vora found photos on the buyer\u2019s social media accounts showing her baby happily installed in it.</p> <p>For most eBay sellers the story would end there. Vora, however, decided to make a stand. He emailed the buyer demanding the item, or his money back. She then reported him to the police for harassment. So he took her to court and, two years after the sale, was awarded \u00a362.</p> <p>\u201cIt happens often, buyers thinking they are entitled to free goods due to eBay\u2019s liberal approach to refunds,\u201d he says. \u201cMy case wasn\u2019t about money, more about the principle.\u201d</p> <p>The principle came at a cost \u2013 the \u00a370 in court fees and administration outweighed the award and he must find a further \u00a370 if he wants a summary of the judgment.</p> <p>In 2014 Vora issued legal proceedings after selling an iPhone4 to a buyer who claimed the box arrived empty. Despite proof from the Post Office that the parcel weight corresponded with a handset, eBay refunded the buyer. It eventually settled out of court.</p> <p>Vora is one of a legion of sellers to have fallen victim to eBay\u2019s lavish buyer-protection policy. Launched in 2013, it refunds buyers who raise a dispute if an item is not received, or not as described. The promise was to encourage buyer confidence in the online auction site, but it can be exploited by unscrupulous buyers to obtain free goods. Scores of sellers, both private and business, have contacted the <em>Observer</em> over the years to complain that the company has unquestioningly refunded buyers who had failed to return the goods they bought or sent them back used, damaged or substituted.</p> <p>Anna Wabrobska is a business seller of car parts. When a buyer returned a part, which he admitted had been damaged by his mechanic, eBay told her it would investigate but then refunded the buyer without her knowledge.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I appealed they told me to submit a police report,\u201d she says. \u201cThe police say they do not deal with such cases, so eBay told me to get a crime reference number from Action Fraud. I did so, but my appeal was rejected as I did not provide the report from the police.\u201d</p> <p>Ebay told the <em>Observer </em>that, as the buyer had declared the part \u201cnot as described\u201d, he was due a refund. Business sellers do not have the right to appeal against a decision under eBay rules which leaves a court as the only alternative, it says.</p> <p>Catherine Lewis was left out of pocket after selling a coat. When the buyer claimed she had not received it, eBay issued a refund. But when Lewis studied feedback about the buyer, she got a shock. \u201cAll the messages told the same story,\u201d she says. \u201cBuyer claimed item didn\u2019t arrive, eBay gave refund. Even on items that were signed for. Worse, the buyer has been reported to eBay three times before for this and no action has been taken.\u201d Only when the <em>Observer</em> intervened did eBay refund Lewis.</p> <p>Ebay insists that each dispute is investigated before refunds are issued. \u201cAs an online marketplace we take action to protect thousands of sellers in the UK every month, and we\u2019re constantly improving our systems to make our marketplace as safe as possible,\u201d it insists. \u201cOur team is on the lookout 24/7 for bad buyer behaviour and they\u2019re backed by large-scale, automated detection systems that examine millions of transactions every day.\u201d</p> <p>However, the company freely acknowledges that its policies are designed to keep customers spending. Buyers can, for instance, leave anonymous negative feedback against a seller, but sellers are only given a positive button to rate buyers, although they can type a more forthright comment beneath the cheery \u201c+\u201d heading. The seller\u2019s only recourse, if a comment unjustifiably damages their status, is to report a buyer to eBay and negative comments are only removed if eBay receives numerous complaints about an individual.</p> <p>Most controversially of all, any case opened by a buyer shows as a defect on the seller\u2019s record and a maximum defect rate of 2% (0.5% for top-rated sellers) is permitted before penalty fees kick in.</p> <p>Since eBay ordered its business sellers to extend their returns policy from 14 to 30 days last year, sellers complain that return rates have escalated and they are being penalised for complying. Customers who change their mind about a purchase often cite a return as \u201cnot as described\u201d rather than \u201cno longer wanted\u201d to avoid incurring postage charges and these count against a seller unless they are successfully appealed.</p> <p>Ebay counters that its penalty fees for return rates of over 2% are \u201cto ensure buyers receive the best shopping experience possible, bringing more buyers and more sales for sellers\u201d and \u201cmaliciously filed returns are stripped out of the calculations\u201d.</p> <p>Like Vishal Vora, other sellers are fighting back. Roland Grimm, a personal seller, sold a Tannoy to a buyer who, 60 days after confirming receipt, claimed it had never arrived and raised a dispute with PayPal which offers an alternative buyer protection scheme to eBay.</p> <p>\u201cProfessional scammers often never notify eBay, nor leave feedback because, if they do, sellers can respond via feedback which stays forever to warn other sellers,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, they make a PayPal claim after 60 days when the sales record for a transaction disappears from the seller\u2019s file and feedback can no longer be left on the buyer\u2019s record.\u201d</p> <p>Grimm supplied PayPal with proof of postage and the buyer\u2019s confirmation of receipt but PayPal nonetheless issued a refund. It eventually settled out of court days before the hearing. The company declined to comment.</p> <p>Grimm is now considering legal action against eBay after a seller claimed a keyboard he had sold was defective. It was returned damaged. In its response to the buyer, eBay wrote that although the item had been returned \u201cin a different condition to which it was sent\u201d he would be refunded anyway.</p> <p>Ebay claimed that, since it can\u2019t verify the condition an item is returned in, it refunds sellers on a courtesy basis, but that Grimm has made several such claims of returned goods, so no longer qualifies. Ian Ewers received a similar message to Grimm after a buyer claimed two brand new \u00a32,300 power supply units he\u2019d sold were faulty a week after leaving a five-star review of them. They were sent back unboxed, poorly packaged and apparently damaged during use.</p> <p>He sent before and after photos to eBay who told him they would refund the buyer and Ewers could appeal against their decision afterwards. When he tried to do so, he was refused. A message from customer services explained opaquely: \u201cI understand that in our return policy the buyer should return an item in same condition and most of the times we our seller how if they receive item back in different condition.

      "bodyText": "Vishal Vora used eBay to auction a \u00a3115 BabyBj\u00f6rn bouncer when his children had grown out of it. He washed it, listed it as used and accepted an offer of \u00a356 plus \u00a35 postage from an expectant mother. As soon as it was delivered the buyer complained that it was \u201cliterally covered in faeces\u201d and demanded a \u00a320 reduction in the price. Vora offered \u00a37.50, although the screenshot of a photo sent by the buyer did not show evidence of staining. The buyer then opened a case with eBay which advised she could return it and receive a refund. She was duly refunded by the company but she never sent the bouncer back. Weeks later, Vora found photos on the buyer\u2019s social media accounts showing her baby happily installed in it. For most eBay sellers the story would end there. Vora, however, decided to make a stand. He emailed the buyer demanding the item, or his money back. She then reported him to the police for harassment. So he took her to court and, two years after the sale, was awarded \u00a362. \u201cIt happens often, buyers thinking they are entitled to free goods due to eBay\u2019s liberal approach to refunds,\u201d he says. \u201cMy case wasn\u2019t about money, more about the principle.\u201d The principle came at a cost \u2013 the \u00a370 in court fees and administration outweighed the award and he must find a further \u00a370 if he wants a summary of the judgment. In 2014 Vora issued legal proceedings after selling an iPhone4 to a buyer who claimed the box arrived empty. Despite proof from the Post Office that the parcel weight corresponded with a handset, eBay refunded the buyer. It eventually settled out of court. Vora is one of a legion of sellers to have fallen victim to eBay\u2019s lavish buyer-protection policy. Launched in 2013, it refunds buyers who raise a dispute if an item is not received, or not as described. The promise was to encourage buyer confidence in the online auction site, but it can be exploited by unscrupulous buyers to obtain free goods. Scores of sellers, both private and business, have contacted the Observer over the years to complain that the company has unquestioningly refunded buyers who had failed to return the goods they bought or sent them back used, damaged or substituted. Anna Wabrobska is a business seller of car parts. When a buyer returned a part, which he admitted had been damaged by his mechanic, eBay told her it would investigate but then refunded the buyer without her knowledge. \u201cWhen I appealed they told me to submit a police report,\u201d she says. \u201cThe police say they do not deal with such cases, so eBay told me to get a crime reference number from Action Fraud. I did so, but my appeal was rejected as I did not provide the report from the police.\u201d Ebay told the Observer that, as the buyer had declared the part \u201cnot as described\u201d, he was due a refund. Business sellers do not have the right to appeal against a decision under eBay rules which leaves a court as the only alternative, it says. Catherine Lewis was left out of pocket after selling a coat. When the buyer claimed she had not received it, eBay issued a refund. But when Lewis studied feedback about the buyer, she got a shock. \u201cAll the messages told the same story,\u201d she says. \u201cBuyer claimed item didn\u2019t arrive, eBay gave refund. Even on items that were signed for. Worse, the buyer has been reported to eBay three times before for this and no action has been taken.\u201d Only when the Observer intervened did eBay refund Lewis. Ebay insists that each dispute is investigated before refunds are issued. \u201cAs an online marketplace we take action to protect thousands of sellers in the UK every month, and we\u2019re constantly improving our systems to make our marketplace as safe as possible,\u201d it insists. \u201cOur team is on the lookout 24/7 for bad buyer behaviour and they\u2019re backed by large-scale, automated detection systems that examine millions of transactions every day.\u201d However, the company freely acknowledges that its policies are designed to keep customers spending. Buyers can, for instance, leave anonymous negative feedback against a seller, but sellers are only given a positive button to rate buyers, although they can type a more forthright comment beneath the cheery \u201c+\u201d heading. The seller\u2019s only recourse, if a comment unjustifiably damages their status, is to report a buyer to eBay and negative comments are only removed if eBay receives numerous complaints about an individual. Most controversially of all, any case opened by a buyer shows as a defect on the seller\u2019s record and a maximum defect rate of 2% (0.5% for top-rated sellers) is permitted before penalty fees kick in. Since eBay ordered its business sellers to extend their returns policy from 14 to 30 days last year, sellers complain that return rates have escalated and they are being penalised for complying. Customers who change their mind about a purchase often cite a return as \u201cnot as described\u201d rather than \u201cno longer wanted\u201d to avoid incurring postage charges and these count against a seller unless they are successfully appealed. Ebay counters that its penalty fees for return rates of over 2% are \u201cto ensure buyers receive the best shopping experience possible, bringing more buyers and more sales for sellers\u201d and \u201cmaliciously filed returns are stripped out of the calculations\u201d. Like Vishal Vora, other sellers are fighting back. Roland Grimm, a personal seller, sold a Tannoy to a buyer who, 60 days after confirming receipt, claimed it had never arrived and raised a dispute with PayPal which offers an alternative buyer protection scheme to eBay. \u201cProfessional scammers often never notify eBay, nor leave feedback because, if they do, sellers can respond via feedback which stays forever to warn other sellers,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, they make a PayPal claim after 60 days when the sales record for a transaction disappears from the seller\u2019s file and feedback can no longer be left on the buyer\u2019s record.\u201d Grimm supplied PayPal with proof of postage and the buyer\u2019s confirmation of receipt but PayPal nonetheless issued a refund. It eventually settled out of court days before the hearing. The company declined to comment. Grimm is now considering legal action against eBay after a seller claimed a keyboard he had sold was defective. It was returned damaged. In its response to the buyer, eBay wrote that although the item had been returned \u201cin a different condition to which it was sent\u201d he would be refunded anyway. Ebay claimed that, since it can\u2019t verify the condition an item is returned in, it refunds sellers on a courtesy basis, but that Grimm has made several such claims of returned goods, so no longer qualifies. Ian Ewers received a similar message to Grimm after a buyer claimed two brand new \u00a32,300 power supply units he\u2019d sold were faulty a week after leaving a five-star review of them. They were sent back unboxed, poorly packaged and apparently damaged during use. He sent before and after photos to eBay who told him they would refund the buyer and Ewers could appeal against their decision afterwards. When he tried to do so, he was refused. A message from customer services explained opaquely: \u201cI understand that in our return policy the buyer should return an item in same condition and most of the times we our seller how if they receive item back in different condition. However, there are policy in place for this seller\u2019s coverage and I am afraid in this case it would not be possible to grant your appeal [sic].\u201d Ebay told the Observer that business sellers can\u2019t appeal against faulty returns and says since the buyer provided a detailed description of the problem he had a right to return the goods. It has since unleashed debt collectors to recover the \u00a32,300 from Ewers. \u201cI\u2019ve told them to take me to court and I look forward to defending the claim if it ever happens,\u201d he says. He has also withdrawn his custom from eBay to whom he\u2019s paid nearly \u00a330,000 in sellers\u2019 fees over 14 years. \u201cI have finally realised I cannot do business with this company any longer,\u201d he says. \u201cEbay sellers are like sitting ducks waiting to be scammed.\u201d",

While he makes us tea I glance at a shelf of titles by beefy, ambitious men such as Richard Branson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Elon Musk and, er, Alastair Campbell. Three minutes in the company of the man who describes himself as the UK\u2019s highest-paid personal coach, and I already feel certain that millionaires and masculinity are what he\u2019s all about. Which is worrying, because I\u2019ve come here to sort my life out, and I\u2019m not sure that he can really do it for me.</p> <p>I\u2019m a freelance writer who has held on to a journalism career despite being terrible at deadlines. I\u2019m someone who started three university degrees and only finished one \u2013 and that was by the skin of my teeth \u2013 due to the absolute chaos with which I have always sabotaged my own proceedings. Yet I have also managed to work passionately on the things I love, in my own way, and am currently writing a book. But the thing is, I\u2019ve been writing this book for some time now, and finishing the manuscript still feels as distant as Mars, and the clock is ticking. I\u2019m so tired of messing things up. Can Michael Serwa, who tends to work with corporate CEOs, help?</p> <p>Michael listens, he nods. And then he gives his diagnosis: \u201cTalent, in itself,\u201d he announces, \u201cis completely fucking useless.\u201d Well, he has a point there. \u201cWhen you add some discipline to it, that\u2019s when talent can make you great,\u201d he continues. He goes on to explain calmly that the difference between talent and success is simply accountability, and because my publishers have left me to get on with the book by myself, I don\u2019t have any. He adds that, given I\u2019m also a single mother, something he doesn\u2019t have much experience of, I might be expecting a certain level of compassion from him. But he questions \u201cwhether compassion gets the job done. All that empathy: \u2018Ahh don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 No, I want you to worry about it, because you\u2019re wasting your fucking time.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018I want you to worry,\u2019 says Michael, \u2018because you are wasting your time\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far so brutal, at least on paper. In the flesh, though, Michael is really quite funny. There is a twinkle in his eyes throughout it all, and I begin to feel strangely moved by his caring about my wasted life. He comes from a family of professionals in Poland where he shocked everyone by dropping out of high school. After moving to London he worked in high-end fashion retail for years, on the shop floor, perfecting his English, before becoming a coach (and being able to support his family in Poland). He likens himself to a Polish builder who doesn\u2019t care what day or time it is \u2013 he will simply get the job done. He understands your fears then works through your doubts, writing them up on a whiteboard as you confess them \u2013 before turning them all around and convincing you to JFDI: Just Fucking Do It. He\u2019s a night-owl, and stays up late then rises at 9am. It works for him. There\u2019s no set way to do any of this, he says.</p> <p>The thing is, I tell him, I\u2019ve been trying to JFDI for years, sometimes to a heartbreaking degree. I really do care, deeply, and worry, deeply, about all this stuff. I stay up all night trying to finish things. I lose sleep. I read so many other books, thinking I should pay attention to everyone else\u2019s writing, too, and I have ideas for films when I watch films, and I write those ideas down in detail and then I\u2019m not sure what happens after that. And I can\u2019t <em>bear</em> ruining my editors\u2019 days, and yet I do it repeatedly, distractedly. Again, Michael listens patiently, and then cuts through it all. There\u2019s no drama, no blame. \u201cYou need to switch from being a consumer,\u201d he says, \u201cto being a producer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9c77714cfd017f38a837ce5990e3ae89466ae41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9c77714cfd017f38a837ce5990e3ae89466ae41/0_2316_6200_3719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Heawood in the lotus position with her eyes shut\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018With this information, I am freed.

No unicorns, no magic \u2013 you simply replace your wishbone with a backbone, bit by bit.</p> <p>We agree that I will start writing the book in shorter bursts, three hours per day, divided into two 90-minute sessions, starting at a specific time. He feels I\u2019ve been spending too long on it, and my mind has wandered. So I go through my diary marking these hours in as an actual daily appointment, checking for prior engagements that might interfere. I start to feel like the Velveteen Rabbit, that children\u2019s book character who comes into consciousness only through the attention of others. This is real. I am real! On my way home I walk more proudly than usual. The guilt dissipates. The city feels full of opportunities; the expensive houses don\u2019t make me feel bad. At bedtime, the gnawing fear that usually accompanies my journey into sleep seems to be shifting.</p> <p><em><strong>Two weeks later</strong></em> I return to Michael\u2019s flat, delighted to report that I\u2019ve sent a chunk of new chapters to my agent and publisher and that everyone is excited. Michael has been texting me every single day when my time is up to ask my word count and, even though I\u2019ve dodged him a couple of times and been distracted by a friend\u2019s funeral, he hasn\u2019t given up and neither have I. God, the trust you can develop in yourself. It\u2019s like having a friend inside your own head. There is one day when I really feel I can\u2019t write anything at all, that everything is pointless, that my work is a disgusting joke. A quick voice message from Michael later and I end up writing for a couple of hours in bed that night, newly determined not to go to sleep without producing. From a place of disgust, this chapter turns out to be one of my favourite things I\u2019ve written.</p> <p>Another two weeks pass, more chapters, another meeting. Michael feels like a friend now. We laugh a lot. It seems I have gone from despising a business-like, corporate vibe to appreciating its fierce beauty. The book is more than halfway there! The thought that there will come a day, probably soon, when it will not be Michael Serwa\u2019s job to cheer for me on a daily basis is sad. But I guess we all have to grow up at some point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8c84779be02bab821c1006a2b6ef4cd7867b90e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c84779be02bab821c1006a2b6ef4cd7867b90e8/452_1039_4156_2495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Heawood in a bold stripey jumper leaning an arm on the shoulder of life coach Michael Serwa on the roof of his Mayfair penthouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He tends to work with corporate CEOs.

Lynne ran a highly successful PR agency in 1980s London, representing some of the biggest names in fashion and entertainment, but has long since moved into women\u2019s development, and consulting on sustainable entrepreneurialism.

I say this because at 8am, the morning after my arrival, Lynne gets me doing Buddhist chanting in front of her shrine, only she has to break off from the ferocious pace of her Sanskrit recital to take a call from a makeup artist who is outside the front door trying to get in, but Lynne is fed up because Mercury is retrograde and everyone\u2019s turning up at the wrong time, so she gets rid of the makeup artist and goes back to her chanting, and to be fair, it\u2019s my fault she\u2019s annoyed, because I found the alpaca duvet she gave me so insanely comfortable that I slept right through my alarm and was late to the shrine. \u201cI never recognised myself in <em>Ab Fab</em>,\u201d she will say later, as the feathers in her hair waft slowly in the breeze.</p> <p>Still, nobody said that setting up a centre of relaxation was in itself an act of relaxation. Lynne is now 70, which I find hard to believe, as she is an absolute titan, constantly making tea, cooking, washing up, organising builders and discussing the state of the world and our souls with the team of alternative healers she has brought together, for when <a href=\"https://www.hubatno3.com/\" title=\"\">Hub at No 3</a> officially opens in February. Since selling her PR agency she has worked in rural African villages and with women leaders in Kazakhstan, and written several books about women running businesses.

As for love \u2013 we have moved on to relationships \u2013 she doesn\u2019t really believe that I have any problems there either, despite every single sign to the contrary. \u201cYour heart is open to love. You just have to choose it,\u201d she says. Lynne is divorced but not without company, and what I am thinking of choosing, specifically, is to copy the layout of her house, where she has one bedroom for sleeping and one for sex. \u201cLeave London and you could afford that extra bedroom, too,\u201d she points out cheerily. So if I ever tell you I\u2019ve moved to the countryside for my daughter to get more fresh air, you\u2019ll know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.</p> <p>Lynne wants me to try her treatments, so I greedily take them all. First a massage, with a zapping device invented by the Soviets to clear blockages in their astronauts. The masseur, Gordon John Hughes, is also a psychic, so takes my mind off the weird Russian tingling by telling me all about my family\u2019s trauma.</p> <p>\u201cSomething happened to your father when he was three,\u201d he intuits from the knots in my back, \u201cand he has never got over it.\u201d I weigh this up, decide it could actually be true, and feel rather sad \u2013 but not to worry, he now wants to talk about my sister, and I don\u2019t have one, so that\u2019s easier to dismiss. \u201cDid your mother lose a child?\u201d he continues. Well, yes she did, as it goes. \u201cSo you do have a sister!\u201d he says proudly. \u201cShe\u2019s there, in the spirit world.\u201d Oh.</p> <p>After two and a half hours of this I feel very, very awake. So I check my phone, where there is a text from Michael, whom I have forgotten to tell that I\u2019m going on retreat. \u201cAre you producing?\u201d he asks. No, I want to text back, I\u2019m communing with my dead sister in Somerset, but I suspect he might not be the target demographic for such news.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"36209bea531b2e76e99597f61bbe0ab5fef5768c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36209bea531b2e76e99597f61bbe0ab5fef5768c/0_378_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Heawood sitting at a table doing her collage with Lynne Franks standing and looking at her work, at Lynne\u2019s retreat workshot in Somerset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When the glitter pens come out I say a firm no.

She wants us to listen to inspirational music, then create a vision board, finding pictures and words that resonate with my dream life, my future goals. When the glitter pens come out I say a firm <em>no</em> \u2013 I have a seven-year-old daughter and if my life needs a transformational journey, it is to a world in which there are no glitter pens. I do not want to do this tonight.</p> <p>It is strange, then, that long after Lynne has gone to bed, I am still there, completely engrossed in my collage. It\u2019s ridiculous \u2013 I can\u2019t stop doing it. Somehow, not only have I cut up <em>Vanity Fair</em> and <em>Grazia </em>to find headlines that relate to my future: \u201cBestselling Novelist\u201d and \u201cOutstanding Writing for a Comedy TV Series\u201d, and \u201cWarm Addictive Drama\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s my writing, not my love life \u2013 but unlikely words from my past have also popped up. My beloved grandparents\u2019 village in Devon, the town where my daughter was conceived, even my school. I cut out all these place names and stick them on to the trunk of a big knotty tree, and the big knotty journey of my life appears. I look at it, and all the things that ever made me feel wistful and sad and unfinished start to make me feel proud.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"707292a32e511d6e587504cf1e2fe67c4bf1e037\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/707292a32e511d6e587504cf1e2fe67c4bf1e037/0_1728_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of Sophie's collage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Unlikely words pop up.

I tell her I can\u2019t understand how I got so gripped and focused on it. \u201cDo you not remember taking Saskia\u2019s floral essence for procrastination beforehand?\u201d she says, her eyes twinkling. Oh my God. <em>N</em><em>o.</em> It is at this point that I notice that the kitchen doormat says \u201cA Witch Lives Here\u201d on it, and I read it aloud. \u201cWell, she does,\u201d says Lynne proudly.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, the final part of my healing then appears. It is the missing link. \u201cDo you know who you\u2019ve reminded me of the whole time you\u2019ve been here?\u201d asks Lynne. \u201cDawn French! You sound like her, you have the same sense of humour \u2013 you even look a bit like her.\u201d This means everything to me, because I grew up believing Dawn French was actual God \u2013 my work on Earth is done. \u201cYou were better at the chanting than her, though,\u201d Lynne continues. \u201cAt least you tried to learn the Lotus Sutra. When I worked with her and Jennifer Saunders I got them to sit at the shrine with me, but they wouldn\u2019t do it in Sanskrit. They just chanted \u2018Frenchandsaundersfrenchandsaunders\u2019 repeatedly.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Back in London,</strong></em> I stick my collage on my bedroom wall. I\u2019ve made peace with it all. But I have other work to do and struggle to get back into writing the book. I anticipate a bollocking from Michael, but in fact he simply tells me to do one single hour\u2019s writing. This advice saves me \u2013 again. A week later, I print out all the old and new chapters of my book, having found the thread that weaves them all together, the pulse that runs right through it, and I realise it is finally done. I could cry. I do cry. The life lessons of heartfelt hippies and brutal billionaires both had something to offer, it transpires. I\u2019m cured of chaos.* For now.</p> <p><em>*This piece was filed one week after deadline</em></p> <p><em>Coaching with Michael Serwa </em><em>costs from \u00a33,000 </em><em> (<a href=\"https://michaelserwa.com/\" title=\"\">michaelserwa.com</a>).

      "bodyText": "They say you shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover, but I feel quite able to judge the life coach Michael Serwa by all the books on display in his living room, especially since his Mayfair penthouse appears to be entirely empty otherwise. While he makes us tea I glance at a shelf of titles by beefy, ambitious men such as Richard Branson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Elon Musk and, er, Alastair Campbell. Three minutes in the company of the man who describes himself as the UK\u2019s highest-paid personal coach, and I already feel certain that millionaires and masculinity are what he\u2019s all about. Which is worrying, because I\u2019ve come here to sort my life out, and I\u2019m not sure that he can really do it for me. I\u2019m a freelance writer who has held on to a journalism career despite being terrible at deadlines. I\u2019m someone who started three university degrees and only finished one \u2013 and that was by the skin of my teeth \u2013 due to the absolute chaos with which I have always sabotaged my own proceedings. Yet I have also managed to work passionately on the things I love, in my own way, and am currently writing a book. But the thing is, I\u2019ve been writing this book for some time now, and finishing the manuscript still feels as distant as Mars, and the clock is ticking. I\u2019m so tired of messing things up. Can Michael Serwa, who tends to work with corporate CEOs, help? Michael listens, he nods. And then he gives his diagnosis: \u201cTalent, in itself,\u201d he announces, \u201cis completely fucking useless.\u201d Well, he has a point there. \u201cWhen you add some discipline to it, that\u2019s when talent can make you great,\u201d he continues. He goes on to explain calmly that the difference between talent and success is simply accountability, and because my publishers have left me to get on with the book by myself, I don\u2019t have any. He adds that, given I\u2019m also a single mother, something he doesn\u2019t have much experience of, I might be expecting a certain level of compassion from him. But he questions \u201cwhether compassion gets the job done. All that empathy: \u2018Ahh don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 No, I want you to worry about it, because you\u2019re wasting your fucking time.\u201d So far so brutal, at least on paper. In the flesh, though, Michael is really quite funny. There is a twinkle in his eyes throughout it all, and I begin to feel strangely moved by his caring about my wasted life. He comes from a family of professionals in Poland where he shocked everyone by dropping out of high school. After moving to London he worked in high-end fashion retail for years, on the shop floor, perfecting his English, before becoming a coach (and being able to support his family in Poland). He likens himself to a Polish builder who doesn\u2019t care what day or time it is \u2013 he will simply get the job done. He understands your fears then works through your doubts, writing them up on a whiteboard as you confess them \u2013 before turning them all around and convincing you to JFDI: Just Fucking Do It. He\u2019s a night-owl, and stays up late then rises at 9am. It works for him. There\u2019s no set way to do any of this, he says. The thing is, I tell him, I\u2019ve been trying to JFDI for years, sometimes to a heartbreaking degree. I really do care, deeply, and worry, deeply, about all this stuff. I stay up all night trying to finish things. I lose sleep. I read so many other books, thinking I should pay attention to everyone else\u2019s writing, too, and I have ideas for films when I watch films, and I write those ideas down in detail and then I\u2019m not sure what happens after that. And I can\u2019t bear ruining my editors\u2019 days, and yet I do it repeatedly, distractedly. Again, Michael listens patiently, and then cuts through it all. There\u2019s no drama, no blame. \u201cYou need to switch from being a consumer,\u201d he says, \u201cto being a producer.\u201d We come up with a long list of positive reasons to finish this book: honouring the commitment to my publishers, being able to buy a house and raise my professional profile. I ask, sheepishly, if it\u2019s all right to have an unhealthy reason, too, such as really wanting to fuck off certain people from my past. \u201cFucking them off,\u201d he says calmly, \u201cis my entire purpose!\u201d Michael then brings out a list of about 20 aspects of life \u2013 health, sex, friendships, home, leisure, etc \u2013 and says I must give each a mark out of 10. No discussion, just a number. The last question is about my overall happiness and off the top of my head I give it a 6. \u201cI knew you were going to say 6,\u201d he replies. I am curious \u2013 how? \u201cBecause that\u2019s the average of all your other marks. People come in here every day and ask me what the secret of happiness is \u2013 well there isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s simply the total of all those other areas of your life. So if you want to bring your happiness up to, say, an 8 or 9, you do it by raising all those other things up.\u201d And with this information, I am freed. There\u2019s no secret to happiness! No unicorns, no magic \u2013 you simply replace your wishbone with a backbone, bit by bit. We agree that I will start writing the book in shorter bursts, three hours per day, divided into two 90-minute sessions, starting at a specific time. He feels I\u2019ve been spending too long on it, and my mind has wandered. So I go through my diary marking these hours in as an actual daily appointment, checking for prior engagements that might interfere. I start to feel like the Velveteen Rabbit, that children\u2019s book character who comes into consciousness only through the attention of others. This is real. I am real! On my way home I walk more proudly than usual. The guilt dissipates. The city feels full of opportunities; the expensive houses don\u2019t make me feel bad.

Lynne wants me to try her treatments, so I greedily take them all. First a massage, with a zapping device invented by the Soviets to clear blockages in their astronauts. The masseur, Gordon John Hughes, is also a psychic, so takes my mind off the weird Russian tingling by telling me all about my family\u2019s trauma. \u201cSomething happened to your father when he was three,\u201d he intuits from the knots in my back, \u201cand he has never got over it.\u201d I weigh this up, decide it could actually be true, and feel rather sad \u2013 but not to worry, he now wants to talk about my sister, and I don\u2019t have one, so that\u2019s easier to dismiss. \u201cDid your mother lose a child?\u201d he continues. Well, yes she did, as it goes. \u201cSo you do have a sister!\u201d he says proudly. \u201cShe\u2019s there, in the spirit world.\u201d Oh. After two and a half hours of this I feel very, very awake. So I check my phone, where there is a text from Michael, whom I have forgotten to tell that I\u2019m going on retreat. \u201cAre you producing?\u201d he asks. No, I want to text back, I\u2019m communing with my dead sister in Somerset, but I suspect he might not be the target demographic for such news. Over the next two days I have a flower essences session with Saskia Marjoram, who holds a pendulum over her floral potions, a natural health consultation from Clive de Carle who believes we could all cheer up by taking magnesium, and an astrological reading from John Wadsworth, author of Your Zodiac Soul. When Lynne sets me up with a pile of old magazines to make a collage, I reach my limit. She wants us to listen to inspirational music, then create a vision board, finding pictures and words that resonate with my dream life, my future goals. When the glitter pens come out I say a firm no \u2013 I have a seven-year-old daughter and if my life needs a transformational journey, it is to a world in which there are no glitter pens. I do not want to do this tonight. It is strange, then, that long after Lynne has gone to bed, I am still there, completely engrossed in my collage. It\u2019s ridiculous \u2013 I can\u2019t stop doing it. Somehow, not only have I cut up Vanity Fair and Grazia to find headlines that relate to my future: \u201cBestselling Novelist\u201d and \u201cOutstanding Writing for a Comedy TV Series\u201d, and \u201cWarm Addictive Drama\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s my writing, not my love life \u2013 but unlikely words from my past have also popped up. My beloved grandparents\u2019 village in Devon, the town where my daughter was conceived, even my school. I cut out all these place names and stick them on to the trunk of a big knotty tree, and the big knotty journey of my life appears. I look at it, and all the things that ever made me feel wistful and sad and unfinished start to make me feel proud. The next day, Lynne is very impressed with my collage. I tell her I can\u2019t understand how I got so gripped and focused on it. \u201cDo you not remember taking Saskia\u2019s floral essence for procrastination beforehand?\u201d she says, her eyes twinkling. Oh my God. No. It is at this point that I notice that the kitchen doormat says \u201cA Witch Lives Here\u201d on it, and I read it aloud. \u201cWell, she does,\u201d says Lynne proudly. Unexpectedly, the final part of my healing then appears. It is the missing link. \u201cDo you know who you\u2019ve reminded me of the whole time you\u2019ve been here?\u201d asks Lynne. \u201cDawn French! You sound like her, you have the same sense of humour \u2013 you even look a bit like her.\u201d This means everything to me, because I grew up believing Dawn French was actual God \u2013 my work on Earth is done. \u201cYou were better at the chanting than her, though,\u201d Lynne continues. \u201cAt least you tried to learn the Lotus Sutra. When I worked with her and Jennifer Saunders I got them to sit at the shrine with me, but they wouldn\u2019t do it in Sanskrit. They just chanted \u2018Frenchandsaundersfrenchandsaunders\u2019 repeatedly.\u201d Back in London, I stick my collage on my bedroom wall. I\u2019ve made peace with it all. But I have other work to do and struggle to get back into writing the book. I anticipate a bollocking from Michael, but in fact he simply tells me to do one single hour\u2019s writing. This advice saves me \u2013 again. A week later, I print out all the old and new chapters of my book, having found the thread that weaves them all together, the pulse that runs right through it, and I realise it is finally done. I could cry. I do cry. The life lessons of heartfelt hippies and brutal billionaires both had something to offer, it transpires. I\u2019m cured of chaos.* For now. *This piece was filed one week after deadline Coaching with Michael Serwa costs from \u00a33,000 (michaelserwa.com).

      "body": "<p>David Kynaston is a historian who has written books on postwar Britain, the City of London and cricket. His latest book, co-written with his old cricketing friend Francis Green, is called <em>Engines of Privilege: Britain\u2019s Private School Problem</em>, and focuses on the unfair advantage offered by the independent education sector.</p> <p><strong>You are known for your forensic histories of modern Britain. What inspired this book?</strong><br>It\u2019s an issue I\u2019ve become deeply interested in since my sons went to a state grammar school in 2007. They both played football for their school and standing on the touchline when they played against local private and state schools I saw the full spectrum of the unequal allocation of resources, the huge difference in the quality of facilities at state and private schools. The unfairness hit me terribly hard. A few years later in 2014 I gave the Orwell lecture, focusing on the private school question, and then at the end of that year my son George and I wrote a piece on the history and cultural significance of private schools in the <em>New Statesman</em>, which provoked five further articles the following week. That was the moment that made me think this was an issue that had some traction.</p> <p><strong>You argue that private schools add significantly to a child\u2019s socio</strong><strong>economic opportunities. What do you think would have happened to you, had you not attended </strong><strong>Wellington</strong><strong> </strong><strong>college?</strong><br>If one has had a very privileged education and then one achieves anything in adult life, there\u2019s always that nagging thought \u2013 how much is down to the fact that one had good fortune and others didn\u2019t? The academic advantages conferred by the private school are not dramatic but significant, and cumulatively over the course of a childhood they amount to quite a lot.</p> <p><strong>What tangible advantages did going to private school give you?</strong><br>In my case, boarding school provided an escape from my parents\u2019 divorce. I was nine when it happened and school was friendly and cosy and it was nice to have another world to go to. Later, I had three very good history teachers and they really got me flying intellectually. In some ways I had better history teaching at school than I did when I was at Oxford. But perhaps the most important thing it gave me was confidence. Private-school students are taught that they are going to do well in life. That makes a huge psychological difference growing up.</p> <p><strong>There has been a discussion about reforming private schools for decades. Why has it not got anywhere?</strong><br>I think the liberal left find it a difficult issue because parents want to do the best for their children and if they can afford it they\u2019ll often educate their children privately, and that\u2019s entirely understandable. But attitudes become very entrenched when people have made a significant financial investment. And if one\u2019s been privately educated oneself there\u2019s the question of having advantages that others have not had, and then throwing away the ladder one\u2019s climbed up oneself. </p> <p><strong>Do you think anything will change in your or your children\u2019s lifetime?</strong><br>It\u2019s not impossible because I believe that plates shift in history in a way that is often beyond the control of individuals. There was something plate-shifting about the 1945 election, which brought in the welfare state. I think the plates shifted again at the end of the 1970s and the Thatcher/Reagan era. Now, particularly since the financial crash, we are approaching the end of free-market orthodoxy and there is an anti-privilege mood around. It is hard to see how the private schools can escape from this unscathed.</p> <p><strong>Should we bring back grammar schools?</strong><br>It is an important question and I am a bit conflicted. When grammar schools were phased out at the end of the 1960s, something was lost. At that point, they were offering real academic competition to the private schools. But you also had the problem of selection, division within families and three quarters of the population being written off. I think overall there was a good case for abolition but it was a debatable case. I am not nearly as unsympathetic towards grammars as I am towards private schools.</p> <p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong> </p> <p><strong>What should be done now?</strong><br>There\u2019s obviously the question of outright abolition, but in our view to aim at that is impractical because it would be such a difficult thing to achieve. My starting point is where we are at the moment, with these highly resourced schools for, on the whole, children of wealthy parents, entrenching already existing advantages. So anything, in a sense, is better than where we are now. We\u2019ve put our emphasis on changing the social composition of the schools. We call for a fair access scheme in which, initially, 33% of pupils at private schools would be state-subsidised. </p> <p><strong>Have you had any interesting reactions to your book so far?</strong><br>Not yet, but I honestly do not know what to expect when it is published next month. We have tried to write it in a moderate way, keeping it evidence-based and non-agitprop, not attacking parents or making futile accusations of hypocrisy.

      "bodyText": "Several days after Nelson Espinal slipped across the US southern border, he called his family back in Honduras from inside a US detention center. \u201cTell Mom not to worry \u2013 I\u2019m applying for asylum,\u201d Espinal, 28, told his sister Patricia, who recounted the December phone call with tears streaming down her sun-scarred cheeks. \u201cWe must pray to God that they give it to me. I told them I can\u2019t go back to Honduras because if I go back, they\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d Espinal had made the 4,900km journey with several thousand others who joined the migrant caravan in October in the hopes of starting a new life. Within weeks of reaching the US, however, he was deported back to his gang-infested neighborhood in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa \u2013 and the death threats that had prompted him to flee. He resolved to try his luck again in the new year: head north, save his life and find a way to help his family and provide for his seven-year-old son. But just over a week after his return, Nelson was shot dead on the street outside his home on 18 December 2018. Despite a recent drop in homicide rates in Honduras and neighboring countries, Espinal\u2019s murder is a sharp reminder that for many people in the region, the decision to migrate is one of life or death. A ruling last June by the then US attorney general Jeff Sessions made it all but impossible for victims of gang violence like Espinal to obtain asylum. And as a new migrant caravan prepares to set off from Honduras on Tuesday, more will probably suffer the same fate. Espinal lived with his parents, four sisters and son in a rough shack in the Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ulloa neighborhood. High in the mountains that cup the city centre, the area is dominated by the notorious MS-13 gang. In cities across Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, gangs terrorize residents into submission and recruit young people by force or coercion, promising \u201cwork\u201d for youths who have little prospect of finding formal employment \u2013 and threatening death for those who refuse. \u201cWhen they get their eye on someone, they search them out again and again,\u201d said Patricia Espinal. The gangs had tried to recruit her brother since he was a teenager, but he had steadfastly resisted. \u201cThey\u2019re asking if I want to work with him,\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201c[But] I\u2019d rather have rough hands [from manual labor] than join a gang.\u201d So when news broke last October that a large group of migrants was planning to head north from the city of San Pedro Sula, Espinal and a pair of friends rushed to join the caravan, calculating that there would be safety in numbers. It was unprecedented for such a large number to set out together, and Espinal believed the caravan offered the perfect opportunity to escape. In the end, however, the violence that has plagued Honduras for more than a decade proved inescapable. According to Migdonia Ayestas, director of the Violence Observatory at the National Autonomous University in Honduras, more than 70 migrants have been murdered upon returning to the country in recent years. \u201cIn a country as violent as Honduras, many of the people who are forced to migrate do so out of fear of violence \u2013 so when they are deported it\u2019s essentially a death sentence,\u201d said Joaquin Mejia, a human rights lawyer, who added that the responsibility lay with the Honduran government for its failure to guarantee the security of its citizens and the US government for not fulfilling its human rights obligations. Due to the government shutdown, the Guardian was unable to reach US Customs and Border Protection for comment. Homicide rates in Honduras peaked in 2011 at 86.5 for every 100,000 inhabitants, and have since decreased to 43.6 for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2017, according to the Violence Observatory. But that still works out to more than 10 murders a day \u2013 in a country with a population slightly larger than London \u2013 and is still the fourth-highest rate in the Americas. Across the country are neighborhoods like Espinal\u2019s, where the threat of violence is omnipresent and everyone knows someone who has been murdered. \u201cIn this neighborhood they\u2019ve killed tons of boys,\u201d said Espinal\u2019s mother, Sara Matamoros. \u201cNeighbors and friends.\u201d Men account for nearly 90% of homicide victims in Honduras. Those between the ages of 20 and 29, such as Espinal, were murdered at a rate of over 160 for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2017. But no population group escapes the bloodletting. Women make up a small percentage of victims, but the country\u2019s femicide rate is among the world\u2019s highest. And in 2017, Honduras\u2019s child homicide rate was the highest in the world, according to a report by Save the Children. Meanwhile, domestic and sexual violence is endemic, but according to the Center for Women\u2019s Rights in Tegucigalpa, remains largely unreported due to structural machismo. \u201cPeople don\u2019t migrate [just] because they fancy it, but because they are searching for a new life, a better economic situation. But also, the people migrate out of fear of violence \u2013 and that often is not understood by legislators or President Trump,\u201d said Ayestas. The Honduran government has relied heavily on hardline mano dura policies, such as the creation of a heavily armed military police, which has patrolled the streets since 2013. The new National Anti-Gang Force regularly parades young men in front of the media with small stashes of marijuana or cash allegedly from extortion. But the poverty, lack of opportunity and family disintegration that prompt gang members to choose such a life go unaddressed. Meanwhile, impunity rates are exceedingly high even for serious crimes; despite a reduced homicide rate, the terror endures. \u201cBringing back peace is not just about lowering the homicide rate,\u201d said Ayestas. \u201cBecause there are other crimes and the public\u2019s perception of security \u2013 which haven\u2019t improved.\u201d Ayestas and others argue that until Hondurans feel secure in their homes and neighborhoods, they will continue to migrate. \u201cHere in this country they just kill,\u201d said Matamoros. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about the family\u2019s pain.\u201d That pain was clear in the face of Espinal\u2019s son Yojan, who sat in the family home, staring blankly and clutching a toy car; Nelson bought it as Christmas gift, but didn\u2019t survive long enough to give to him. According to his family, Yojan has already started talking about leaving home and heading north to escape.",

It\u2019s the product of the protagonist, Cleo, scrubbing the driveway and cleaning up dog mess, which her employers, a middle-class Mexican family, chide her for not removing promptly.</p> <p>The scene, however simple and aesthetically pleasing, sends a subtle message that many Mexican moviegoers immediately understand about domestic workers like Cleo and the confusing status in the households they serve.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clearly trying to say: this maid doesn\u2019t only work for the family but she even works for the dog. She cleans up the dog\u2019s shit,\u201d said Gary Alazraki, a Mexican filmmaker and producer.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s her status in the family and yet she is so loved. They give her a home but they won\u2019t give her electricity for her rooftop room. They [Cleo and her colleague] are part of the family but then they are an underclass,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe movie\u2019s success lies in its heart, which is that many of us grew up in a home where a nanny became part of the family in a very perverse way.\u201d</p> <p>Since it was released late last year, <em>Roma</em> has won acclaim and awards \u2013 most recently a Golden Globe \u2013 and could next month capture Mexico\u2019s first foreign-language film Oscar. It has catapulted its star, Yalitza Aparicio, into the global spotlight and onto the cover of <em>Vogue\u2019s </em>Mexican edition \u2013 a first for an indigenous woman. But it has also prompted serious soul-searching about the plight of poorly paid and often-unprotected domestic workers in Mexico, where, nearly five decades after the period depicted in the film, inequality remains rife, racism stubbornly persists and social mobility seems to have stagnated.</p> <p>\u201cWhat [the director] Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n wanted to say in his film is: \u2018look at the country in which I grew up in, how different it was and how much it hasn\u2019t changed. And that\u2019s not a good thing,\u2019\u201d Alazraki said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef1b8775e1f257d2428243581e3a65284545e66d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef1b8775e1f257d2428243581e3a65284545e66d/0_211_3712_2227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n won two Golden Globes for Roma and is tipped for further success at the Oscars.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n won two Golden Globes for Roma and is tipped for further success at the Oscars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Named after the then-bourgeois Mexico City neighbourhood in which Cuar\u00f3n was raised and the film is set, <em>Roma</em> has made an impression on the middle and upper classes even as it addresses uncomfortable issues such as race and class in a country where 43% of the population is poor.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the kind of film that appeals to a certain kind of middle- and upper-income audience of a liberal persuasion, who see the film as putting into cinematic language a lot of their own concerns about class and race division in Mexico,\u201d said Andrew Paxman, professor at Mexico City\u2019s Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a lecturing film,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Mexican cinema \u2026 the poor are noble and the rich are bastards. <em>Roma</em> is very fresh in this regard. It\u2019s not vilifying the employers. These are all well-rounded human beings, and that makes this film so innovative.\u201d</p> <p><em>Roma\u2019s </em>release \u2013 first in cinemas and then on Netflix \u2013 coincided with political change in Mexico. President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/01/mexico-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-president\" title=\"\">Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador</a> swept into office in December, promising to combat inequality and put the priorities of poor and indigenous Mexicans first.</p> <p>He stokes nostalgia for past decades in the country, when the economy grew rapidly and the middle class expanded \u2013 the so-called Mexican miracle, which ran for nearly three decades after the second world war, and the tail end of which was captured in <em>Roma</em>, set in the early 1970s.

      "bodyText": "In the opening scene of the film Roma, soapy water splashes across the screen. It\u2019s the product of the protagonist, Cleo, scrubbing the driveway and cleaning up dog mess, which her employers, a middle-class Mexican family, chide her for not removing promptly. The scene, however simple and aesthetically pleasing, sends a subtle message that many Mexican moviegoers immediately understand about domestic workers like Cleo and the confusing status in the households they serve. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly trying to say: this maid doesn\u2019t only work for the family but she even works for the dog. She cleans up the dog\u2019s shit,\u201d said Gary Alazraki, a Mexican filmmaker and producer. \u201cThat\u2019s her status in the family and yet she is so loved. They give her a home but they won\u2019t give her electricity for her rooftop room. They [Cleo and her colleague] are part of the family but then they are an underclass,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe movie\u2019s success lies in its heart, which is that many of us grew up in a home where a nanny became part of the family in a very perverse way.\u201d Since it was released late last year, Roma has won acclaim and awards \u2013 most recently a Golden Globe \u2013 and could next month capture Mexico\u2019s first foreign-language film Oscar. It has catapulted its star, Yalitza Aparicio, into the global spotlight and onto the cover of Vogue\u2019s Mexican edition \u2013 a first for an indigenous woman. But it has also prompted serious soul-searching about the plight of poorly paid and often-unprotected domestic workers in Mexico, where, nearly five decades after the period depicted in the film, inequality remains rife, racism stubbornly persists and social mobility seems to have stagnated. \u201cWhat [the director] Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n wanted to say in his film is: \u2018look at the country in which I grew up in, how different it was and how much it hasn\u2019t changed. And that\u2019s not a good thing,\u2019\u201d Alazraki said. Named after the then-bourgeois Mexico City neighbourhood in which Cuar\u00f3n was raised and the film is set, Roma has made an impression on the middle and upper classes even as it addresses uncomfortable issues such as race and class in a country where 43% of the population is poor. \u201cI think it\u2019s the kind of film that appeals to a certain kind of middle- and upper-income audience of a liberal persuasion, who see the film as putting into cinematic language a lot of their own concerns about class and race division in Mexico,\u201d said Andrew Paxman, professor at Mexico City\u2019s Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lecturing film,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Mexican cinema \u2026 the poor are noble and the rich are bastards. Roma is very fresh in this regard. It\u2019s not vilifying the employers. These are all well-rounded human beings, and that makes this film so innovative.\u201d Roma\u2019s release \u2013 first in cinemas and then on Netflix \u2013 coincided with political change in Mexico. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador swept into office in December, promising to combat inequality and put the priorities of poor and indigenous Mexicans first. He stokes nostalgia for past decades in the country, when the economy grew rapidly and the middle class expanded \u2013 the so-called Mexican miracle, which ran for nearly three decades after the second world war, and the tail end of which was captured in Roma, set in the early 1970s. When the culture ministry organised a special screening of Roma, it did so at Los Pinos, the presidential palace that L\u00f3pez Obrador refuses to live in and opened to the public as a museum. But some facets of Mexican life remain stubbornly resistant to change. Examples of women like Cleo are still common, said Marcelina Bautista, founder of a union for domestic workers. Providing food and lodging is often offered as an excuse for not paying proper wages, Bautista said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to cheat and avoid the responsibilities that a person assumes when hiring someone, [and] when we demand our wages they come out and say we\u2019re ingrates for being so demanding and unthankful for having a roof over our heads and food,\u201d she said. Ingrained prejudice has also been reflected in media coverage of the film, with headlines referring to Cleo with disparaging words like \u201cservant\u201d and muchacha (girl, as maids are commonly called). The release of Roma was \u201craising consciousness\u201d, Bautista added. \u201cMany domestic workers really identify with the film.\u201d And change could also come from the supreme court, which last month ruled in favour of domestic workers, who, as informal employees, petitioned for their labour rights and to receive social benefits such as healthcare and pensions. For some, Roma has caused discomforting memories of their own families\u2019 treatment of domestic staff. \u201cI have not been able to watch it because of all the memories of the 1970s,\u201d said Rodolfo Soriano-N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a Mexico City sociologist. Soriano-N\u00fa\u00f1ez recalls his own grandmother verbally \u201cbullying\u201d the hired help or denigrating her in front of family. \u201cI think it is one of Mexico\u2019s most serious cinematic attempts at dealing with racism since Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s Los Olvidados,\u201d which was released in 1950, he said. The film\u2019s middle-class appeal has been undeniable, though. Observers say much of it stems from its portrayal of a time when the middle class could live comfortably and security was provided, even if it was through the might of a politically repressive regime. The time, however sinister, still appealed to some in a population weary of crimes such as kidnapping and extortion and seeing drug cartels and lethal fuel-theft gangs operating with impunity, said Harim Guti\u00e9rrez, historian at the Metropolitan Autonomous University. \u201cRoma depicts the swansong of the middle class produced by the Mexican miracle,\u201d under the old political regime, Guti\u00e9rrez said. \u201cIt was a time when a physician who worked for the government could have the purchasing power to maintain a household the same size as this family had,\u201d he added. \u201cThey could have a higher standard of living \u2026 with jobs that today barely allow for survival.\u201d",

A statement signed by 500 house church leaders in November says authorities have removed crosses from buildings, forced churches to hang the Chinese flag and sing patriotic songs, and barred minors from attending.</p> <p>Churchgoers say the situation will get worse as the campaign reaches more of the country. Another church in Chengdu was placed under investigation last week. Less than a week after the mass arrest of Early Rain members, police raided a children\u2019s Sunday school at a church in Guangzhou. Officials have also banned the 1,500-member Zion church in Beijing after its pastor refused to install CCTV.</p> <p>In November the Guangzhou Bible Reformed Church was shut for the second time in three months. \u201cThe Chinese Communist party (CCP) wants to be the God of China and the Chinese people. But according to the Bible only God is God. The government is scared of the churches,\u201d said Huang Xiaoning, the church\u2019s pastor.</p> <p>Local governments have also shut the state-approved \u201csanzi\u201d churches. Sunday schools and youth ministries have been banned. One of the first signs of a crackdown was when authorities forcibly removed more than 1,000 crosses from sanzi churches in Zhejiang province between 2014 and 2016.</p> <p>\u201cThe goal of the crackdown is not to eradicate religions,\u201d said Ying Fuk Tsang, director of the Christian Study Centre on Chinese Religion and Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cPresident Xi Jinping is trying to establish a new order on religion, suppressing its blistering development. [The government] aims to regulate the \u2018religious market\u2019 as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>While the CCP is officially atheist, Protestantism and Catholicism are two of five faiths sanctioned by the government and religious freedom has been enshrined in the constitution since the 1980s. For decades, authorities tolerated the house churches, which refused to register with government bodies that required church leaders to adapt teachings to follow party doctrine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3875b99488c42a2d1565fca59a0b04f8dc3c5f96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3875b99488c42a2d1565fca59a0b04f8dc3c5f96/0_0_1045_627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Early Rain Covenant Church pray during a meeting in their church before it was shut down in December 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Early Rain Covenant Church pray during a meeting in their church before it was shut down in December 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As China experienced an explosion in the number of religious believers, the government has grown wary of Christianity and Islam in particular, with their overseas links. In Xinjiang, a surveillance and internment system has been built for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/07/why-uighur-muslims-across-china-are-living-in-fear\" title=\"\">Muslim minorities, notably the Uighurs</a>.</p> <p>Xi has called for the country to guard against \u201cinfiltration\u201d through religion and extremist ideology.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens in Xinjiang and what happens to house churches is connected,\u201d said Eva Pils, a professor of law at King\u2019s College London, focusing on human rights. \u201cThose kinds of new attitudes have translated into different types of measures against Christians, which amount to intensified persecution of religious groups.\u201d</p> <p>There are at least 60 million Christians in China, spanning rural and urban areas. Congregation-based churches can organise large groups across the country and some have links with Christian groups abroad.</p> <p>Pastors such as Wang of Early Rain are especially alarming for authorities. Under Wang, a legal scholar and public intellectual, the church has advocated for parents of children killed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake \u2013 deaths many critics say were caused by poor government-run construction \u2013 or for families of those affected by faulty vaccines. Every year the church commemorates victims of the 4 June protests in 1989, which were forcibly put down by the Chinese military.</p> <p>\u201cEarly Rain church is one of the few who dare to face what is wrong in society,\u201d said one member. \u201cMost churches don\u2019t dare talk about this, but we obey strictly obey the Bible, and we don\u2019t avoid anything.\u201d</p> <p>Wang and Early Rain belong to what some see as a new generation of Christians that has emerged alongside a growing civil rights movement. Increasingly, activist church leaders have taken inspiration from the democratising role the church played in eastern European countries in the Soviet bloc or South Korea under martial law, according to Lian. Several of China\u2019s most active human rights lawyers are Christians.</p> <p>\u201cThey have come to see the political potential of Christianity as a force for change,\u201d said Lian. \u201cWhat really makes the government nervous is Christianity\u2019s claim to universal rights and values.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"258aa7e5c33ae8ad2162fbf5637318baaf3850c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/258aa7e5c33ae8ad2162fbf5637318baaf3850c5/0_0_6663_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catholics wait to take communion during the Palm Sunday mass at a \u2018house church\u2019 near Shijiazhuang.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catholics wait to take communion during the Palm Sunday mass at a \u2018house church\u2019 near Shijiazhuang.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As of 2018, the government has implemented sweeping rules on religious practices, adding more requirements for religious groups and barring unapproved organisations from engaging in any religious activity. But the campaign is not just about managing behaviour. One of the goals of a government work plan for \u201cpromoting Chinese Christianity\u201d between 2018 and 2022 is \u201cthought reform\u201d. The plan calls for \u201cretranslating and annotating\u201d the Bible, to find commonalities with socialism and establish a \u201ccorrect understanding\u201d of the text.</p> <p>\u201cTen years ago, we used to be able to say the party was not really interested in what people believed internally,\u201d said Pils. \u201cXi Jinping\u2019s response is much more invasive and it is in some ways returning to Mao-era attempts to control hearts and minds.\u201d</p> <p>Bibles, sales of which have always been controlled in China, are no longer available for purchase online, a loophole that had existed for years. In December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/24/china-cracks-down-on-christmas-celebrations\">Christmas celebrations were banned</a> in several schools and cities across China.</p> <p>\u201cLast year\u2019s crackdown is the worst in three decades,\u201d said Bob Fu, the founder of ChinaAid, a Christian advocacy group based in the US.</p> <p>In Chengdu, Early Rain has not vanished. Before the raid, a plan was in place to preserve the church, with those who were not arrested expected to keep it running, holding meetings wherever they could. Slowly, more Early Rain members are being released. As of 9 January, 25 were still in detention.</p> <p>They maintain contact through encrypted platforms. On New Year\u2019s Eve, 300 people joined an online service, some from their homes, others from cars or workplaces, to pray for 2019. Others gather in small groups in restaurants and parks. One member, a student who was sent back to Guangzhou, said he preaches the gospel to the police who monitor him.</p> <p>The church continues to send out daily scripture and posts videos of sermons. In one, pastor Wang alludes to the coming crackdown: \u201cIn this war, in Xinjiang, in Shanghai, in Beijing, in Chengdu, the rulers have chosen an enemy that can never be imprisoned \u2013 the soul of man. Therefore they are doomed to lose this war.\u201d</p>",

Over the past year, local governments have shut hundreds of unofficial congregations or \u201chouse churches\u201d that operate outside the government-approved church network, including Early Rain. A statement signed by 500 house church leaders in November says authorities have removed crosses from buildings, forced churches to hang the Chinese flag and sing patriotic songs, and barred minors from attending. Churchgoers say the situation will get worse as the campaign reaches more of the country. Another church in Chengdu was placed under investigation last week. Less than a week after the mass arrest of Early Rain members, police raided a children\u2019s Sunday school at a church in Guangzhou. Officials have also banned the 1,500-member Zion church in Beijing after its pastor refused to install CCTV. In November the Guangzhou Bible Reformed Church was shut for the second time in three months. \u201cThe Chinese Communist party (CCP) wants to be the God of China and the Chinese people. But according to the Bible only God is God. The government is scared of the churches,\u201d said Huang Xiaoning, the church\u2019s pastor. Local governments have also shut the state-approved \u201csanzi\u201d churches. Sunday schools and youth ministries have been banned. One of the first signs of a crackdown was when authorities forcibly removed more than 1,000 crosses from sanzi churches in Zhejiang province between 2014 and 2016. \u201cThe goal of the crackdown is not to eradicate religions,\u201d said Ying Fuk Tsang, director of the Christian Study Centre on Chinese Religion and Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cPresident Xi Jinping is trying to establish a new order on religion, suppressing its blistering development. [The government] aims to regulate the \u2018religious market\u2019 as a whole.\u201d While the CCP is officially atheist, Protestantism and Catholicism are two of five faiths sanctioned by the government and religious freedom has been enshrined in the constitution since the 1980s. For decades, authorities tolerated the house churches, which refused to register with government bodies that required church leaders to adapt teachings to follow party doctrine. As China experienced an explosion in the number of religious believers, the government has grown wary of Christianity and Islam in particular, with their overseas links. In Xinjiang, a surveillance and internment system has been built for Muslim minorities, notably the Uighurs. Xi has called for the country to guard against \u201cinfiltration\u201d through religion and extremist ideology. \u201cWhat happens in Xinjiang and what happens to house churches is connected,\u201d said Eva Pils, a professor of law at King\u2019s College London, focusing on human rights. \u201cThose kinds of new attitudes have translated into different types of measures against Christians, which amount to intensified persecution of religious groups.\u201d There are at least 60 million Christians in China, spanning rural and urban areas. Congregation-based churches can organise large groups across the country and some have links with Christian groups abroad. Pastors such as Wang of Early Rain are especially alarming for authorities. Under Wang, a legal scholar and public intellectual, the church has advocated for parents of children killed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake \u2013 deaths many critics say were caused by poor government-run construction \u2013 or for families of those affected by faulty vaccines. Every year the church commemorates victims of the 4 June protests in 1989, which were forcibly put down by the Chinese military. \u201cEarly Rain church is one of the few who dare to face what is wrong in society,\u201d said one member. \u201cMost churches don\u2019t dare talk about this, but we obey strictly obey the Bible, and we don\u2019t avoid anything.\u201d Wang and Early Rain belong to what some see as a new generation of Christians that has emerged alongside a growing civil rights movement. Increasingly, activist church leaders have taken inspiration from the democratising role the church played in eastern European countries in the Soviet bloc or South Korea under martial law, according to Lian. Several of China\u2019s most active human rights lawyers are Christians. \u201cThey have come to see the political potential of Christianity as a force for change,\u201d said Lian. \u201cWhat really makes the government nervous is Christianity\u2019s claim to universal rights and values.\u201d As of 2018, the government has implemented sweeping rules on religious practices, adding more requirements for religious groups and barring unapproved organisations from engaging in any religious activity. But the campaign is not just about managing behaviour. One of the goals of a government work plan for \u201cpromoting Chinese Christianity\u201d between 2018 and 2022 is \u201cthought reform\u201d. The plan calls for \u201cretranslating and annotating\u201d the Bible, to find commonalities with socialism and establish a \u201ccorrect understanding\u201d of the text. \u201cTen years ago, we used to be able to say the party was not really interested in what people believed internally,\u201d said Pils. \u201cXi Jinping\u2019s response is much more invasive and it is in some ways returning to Mao-era attempts to control hearts and minds.\u201d Bibles, sales of which have always been controlled in China, are no longer available for purchase online, a loophole that had existed for years. In December, Christmas celebrations were banned in several schools and cities across China. \u201cLast year\u2019s crackdown is the worst in three decades,\u201d said Bob Fu, the founder of ChinaAid, a Christian advocacy group based in the US. In Chengdu, Early Rain has not vanished. Before the raid, a plan was in place to preserve the church, with those who were not arrested expected to keep it running, holding meetings wherever they could. Slowly, more Early Rain members are being released. As of 9 January, 25 were still in detention. They maintain contact through encrypted platforms. On New Year\u2019s Eve, 300 people joined an online service, some from their homes, others from cars or workplaces, to pray for 2019. Others gather in small groups in restaurants and parks. One member, a student who was sent back to Guangzhou, said he preaches the gospel to the police who monitor him. The church continues to send out daily scripture and posts videos of sermons. In one, pastor Wang alludes to the coming crackdown: \u201cIn this war, in Xinjiang, in Shanghai, in Beijing, in Chengdu, the rulers have chosen an enemy that can never be imprisoned \u2013 the soul of man. Therefore they are doomed to lose this war.\u201d",

On Tuesday evening, MPs are finally due to troop through the voting lobbies to cast their judgment on Theresa May\u2019s much-maligned Brexit deal. Even for the most rebellious, it will come as a long overdue moment of clarity. \u201cThe truth is, we need to decide one way or another whether or not we want the PM\u2019s deal,\u201d said one senior Tory rebel. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to give a clear message about its acceptability to parliament, or otherwise, on Tuesday. I feel that anything else is a bit of a distraction.\u201d Downing Street insiders are adamant that the vote, which has already been delayed once to avoid a heavy defeat, will go ahead this time.

Should May\u2019s deal be rejected as expected, an even more unpredictable phase of the Brexit battle begins. So what could happen then?

      "body": "<h2>1. Lo\u0161inj, Croatia</h2> <p><em>Eva Wiseman visits a traditional \u2018wellness island\u2019 reinvented for the 21st-century traveller</em></p> <p>What is a holiday for? Once, I would have confidently said: \u201cFor a break from work\u201d, or if I was being paid by the word, \u201cFor reading bestsellers, in the sun, slightly drunk on local wine and weather, in a bikini and area of patchy phone reception, just bad enough that you have no choice but to fall behind on world news.\u201d</p> <p>But it has become clear that the point of a holiday is a fluid and changeable thing, a thing that tells us much about our seasonal anxieties and spiritual ambitions. Consider for instance the inner workings of the period when a holiday was about \u201ctravel\u201d, about journeying and exploring, broadening our minds through a long plane ride to somewhere hot. Or the focus on \u201ceco-tourism\u201d, where tourists were encouraged to believe they were saving the world by camping.</p> <p>Today, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/\">Lonely Planet</a></em>, \u201cwellness tourism\u201d is the fastest-growing sector in travel, having seen a 10% rise last year to make it a market worth over $500bn. The <a href=\"https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/\">Global Wellness Institute</a> predicts that by 2020 it will rise to $800bn. Across the globe, retreats and resorts are opening or rebranding, whether it\u2019s yurts in Cornwall or medical clinics in Greece, places to improve oneself, ideally while also getting a tan. And all because a holiday is never just a holiday.</p> <p>It is for this reason that I\u2019m sweating on a six-seater plane with my family, juddering over the Adriatic and pretending to our four-year-old that everything is completely, totally fine. Until now, the island of <a href=\"https://www.visitlosinj.hr/\">Lo\u0161inj</a> in Croatia has been accessible to many only via a five-hour road and ferry trip from Zagreb, so it\u2019s remained a holiday destination for tourists driving from Hungary or Germany. But this year the scattered five-star hotels have started chartering these tiny, terrifying flights to bring a wealthier clientele from Russia and the UK, people attracted by its historic \u201cwellness\u201d credentials.</p> <p>In the late 1800s, after Croatian botanist Ambroz Hara\u010di\u0107 helped reforest this previously rocky port, the Austro-Hungarian government declared Lo\u0161inj a health resort. Today, having dusted off the title \u201cwellness island\u201d, Lo\u0161inj is welcoming a new influx of tourists visiting to enjoy air quality so pure (a combination of salt-spray from the sea, hundreds of thousands of Aleppo pines, and a unique geographical micro-climate) it\u2019s been proven to improve lung health. That and the blue water, the heat, and its relative affordability. Typically, visitors have rented mobile homes or stayed on the campsites, all of which are metres from a stony beach, and most of which have their own massage facilities \u2013 health drills deep here, wellness is not just for the wealthy. But one draw of the newly renovated luxury hotels is the scale of their offerings, vast modern spas, air-conditioned to a gentle chill. We are greeted at the <a href=\"https://www.losinj-hotels.com/en/hotels-and-villas/hotel-bellevue/\">Bellevue</a>, its midcentury furniture suggesting a dozen new ways to relax, with the coldest glasses of water I\u2019ve ever tasted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38079037522e29fbef89d455554f7133e423e741\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38079037522e29fbef89d455554f7133e423e741/2152_0_3660_2198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Veli Lo\u0161inj, fishing village, Lo\u0161inj, Croatia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veli Lo\u0161inj fishing village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The spa here stretches across the basement of the white 1960s hotel \u2013 one end is dark-walled and soothing, with colour therapy and steam rooms, the other clinical and spare, offering Botox and cryotherapy.</p> <p>After checking in I walk through the piped music of its hallway, be-robed and dazed \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s the Lo\u0161inj air or perhaps the flight, but I feel almost medicated, floating.</p> <p>The island is only 21 miles long and just under three miles wide \u2013 a coastal path wraps around the bay of \u010cikat, and a guide walks us along it into a forest to pick herbs and plants, which we take back to the spa to blend and distil into a balm. It smells like the island, a rich green scent which follows us as we trot around the cove that evening to a fish restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.losinj-hotels.com/en/dining/konoba-cigale/\">Konoba Cigale</a>, where the proximity to Venice shows in the menu \u2013 they stuff their homemade pasta with seafood caught that morning. Again, that blissful feeling overwhelmed me as our daughter danced to the accordion player and my partner and I looked at each other over our Istrian wine with a sort of stunned disbelief at the glory of it all, at the possibility of a holiday that feels like the photos.</p> <p>Morning came with birdsong. But, a moment here to discuss the breakfast buffet. Too often, I think, hotel guests become jaded by the intense joy delivered to them daily \u2013 this, too, is a side-effect of the holiday experience. A couple of days in and you no longer marvel at the blueness of the sea or the blueness of the sky, or the crisp affordability of the local wine, or, in the case of Lo\u0161inj, the smell, that leafy smell of health and wellness. But if you are four years old and enjoying your first hotel, the breakfast buffet in a grand lobby is by far the most exciting element of any holiday, and remains so every time you emerge from the lift, into this oasis of omelettes and fruit. For the stressed and old, wellness is a simplifying of one\u2019s polluted urban life; for children, it\u2019s cake for breakfast.</p> <p>A freediver ferried us on a speedboat around the bay, stopping to show us secluded caves where we could swim, eventually pulling up to a restaurant on the shore of the tiny car-free island of Ilovik. On the way back, our daughter slept by the engine of the boat in a nest of towels.</p> <p>There was much we didn\u2019t do. We didn\u2019t visit the Museum of Apoxyomenos in the town of Mali Lo\u0161inj, which boasts a single exhibit \u2013 a Greek bronze statue of an athlete dating from the 1st century, found in the sea. We didn\u2019t cycle into the forests, or see a dolphin, or stumble into the naturist colony. We did, however, eat ice cream in the island\u2019s two fishing villages, Veli Lo\u0161inj and Mali Lo\u0161inj, and we did eat at the obscenely romantic Lanterna restaurant, in the shade of an old lighthouse, and we did take a taxi up to the Providenca at sunset, a viewpoint carved into a mountain top. And we did lie motionless on sunloungers with local aloe vera pulp smeared across our sunburned shoulders in the bloated afternoon sun.</p> <p>Though some wellness tourists expect to come home thinner, instead it felt as if we\u2019d returned with a gorgeous weightlessness, the result of a week on this perfumed island with its daily catches and clear water. We braced once more on the tiny plane, our teeth rattling as we insisted, dry-mouthed, that the wings were meant to wobble like that. At home it took some time to rejoin our old commuting routines, our school runs, our doom. Some time to recover from the undiluted joy of a holiday like this, one that left us feeling\u2026 better.<br><em>\u2022 A week\u2019s half-board stay in the four-star <a href=\"https://www.losinj-hotels.com/en/hotels-and-villas/hotel-vespera/\">Family Hotel Vespera</a> costs from \u00a3708pp. A week\u2019s half-board at the five-star Hotel Bellevue costs from \u00a31,514pp, <a href=\"https://www.losinj-hotels.com/\">losinj-hotels.com</a>.

I hadn\u2019t looked at it.</p> <p>Seven days before I was due to meet my fitness fate, my 17-year-old son also looked at the schedule. He promptly telephoned his older brother, who then rang me.</p> <p>\u201cAbout this fitness thing,\u201d he said, \u201cI hear you\u2019re doing something called \u2018insanity\u2019. Are you sure about all this?\u201d</p> <p>My sons expressing concern for their unfit mother. I was touched. And secretly alarmed. From Thursday afternoon until Sunday lunchtime, a new world awaited: of beach runs and burpees, fasted HIIT and tabatas, circuits and squat jumps.</p> <p>I emailed James Davis, who runs 38\u00b0N \u2013 specialising in luxury fitness retreats in Marbella and Ibiza \u2013 with his wife Claire.</p> <p>\u201cAm worried that I am too unfit to benefit from a weekend and that everyone else will be super-fit,\u201d I wrote.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I jumped through the rungs of a ladder on the sand, did star jumps \u2013 and wished I still had a pelvic floor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a fitness benchmark. From there, we adapt the training to the individual.\u201d </p> <p>In case he was lying, and because I dreaded the public humiliation more than the heart attack, I did some emergency pre-training: two jogs with the dog, one on my own, and two cycling and running sessions in a gym.</p> <p>The day before departure, I emailed James again: \u201cAm slightly dreading being so hideously unfit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is at their own level,\u201d he replied, \u201con their own journey, and we\u2019ll have a great time.\u201d</p> <p>And I did. In the words of the late artist Louise Bourgeois: \u201cI have been to hell and back. And let me tell you, it was wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>It really was. I did one form of high-intensity exercise after another, on the beach, on tarmac, in the gym. Just as Sisyphus pushed the rock up the mountain, so James and Claire pushed me on, and on.</p> <p>At 8am, for three mornings running, I did \u201cFasted HIIT: Metcon\u201d. This translates as, skip breakfast, then do high intensity interval training and metabolic conditioning. I jumped through the rungs of a ladder on the sand, like footballers do; did star jumps and wished I had a pelvic floor; I saw, and swung, my first ever kettle bell, thrusting my hips outwards in what looked like a misguided mating call. I picked up two ropes thick enough to moor a tanker and tried, and failed, to wiggle them up and down. By Sunday morning, they were, if not ribbons in my hands, at least airborne.</p> <p>Two boxing sessions with James and I was hooked. I\u2019ve since bought my own gloves and joined a boxing class. During the spin sessions, I slid off the saddle, swore volubly, sweated more, and felt like my legs were being ripped apart. But Claire got me through the pain barrier. She is dynamic, fun and magically motivating.</p> <p>I reported my triumphs, as well as the three-course lunches and sumptuous breakfast banquets overlooking the sea in this fabulous hotel, to the family. \u201cI\u2019m glad (and surprised) you\u2019re still alive,\u201d wrote my older son.</p> <p>I am surprised I\u2019ve since joined a gym, go to this gym, and have signed up to a 38\u00b0N bespoke, 28-day HIIT home workout plan \u2013 short bouts of exercise won\u2019t disrupt my day, so there\u2019s a high chance I\u2019ll do them, armed with my new, can-do mindset.

Undeterred by such scepticism, we pledged to give it our all. The experience on offer seemed idyllic, two nights at a hotel and spa that catered specially to families, even babies. Taking a 90-minute train from Waterloo, we set out to do the unthinkable.</p> <p>\u201cNot much nightlife around,\u201d our cabbie said, just in case we\u2019d come to Brockenhurst in search of an active local grime scene. \u201cBut families love coming here for the views.\u201d On that point, he wasn\u2019t wrong. Around 15 miles southwest of Southampton, New Park Manor Hotel &amp; Spa is set within the decidedly toothsome environs of the New Forest, and we hadn\u2019t been within its gates for 60 seconds before we sighted deer striding through the open park.</p> <p>The manor itself is a grand old house that dates, in some form or another, to the 11th century. Since then it\u2019s been inhabited by lords, landowners and, at one point, Nell Gwyn, mistress of Charles II. It\u2019s only been operating as a hotel since 1970, which rather dashed my fond imaginings of William the Conqueror towelling down in the sauna after a busy day of mutton and jousting.</p> <p>While our room was prepared, we took in one of the nearby forest trails and found the effect so calming it took us a minute to realise our son was similarly transfixed himself. Ordinarily more of a picking-up-spoons-and-throwing-them guy, the perpetual fall of orange-red leaves had placed him in a state of cherubic hypnosis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For two hours a day, we took in the luxuriously appointed spa while he was lavished with attention in the creche</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>New Park Manor is part of the Luxury Family Hotels group, which specialises in providing plush but unfussy breaks for families, and we entered our room to find a cot, changing mat, baby swimming togs and a rubber duckie. Even better were the bright and colourful creche facilities, to which we delivered the boy for two hours on both days of our stay. Fears he would fret once we parted were, in the end, unfounded. One glance at his charming new handlers was enough to scrub us from his memory, allowing us to take in the luxuriously appointed spa while he was lavished with attention.</p> <p>Leaving the fickle brute to his new pals, we made our way to the spa for the pool, treatment rooms, sauna and sanarium. This last concept was previously unknown to me, and comprised a room that\u2019s basically a sauna, but at a lower temperature and slightly increased humidity. I found it had a gloriously balmy effect on my weary joints and, better still, the information plaque which listed the difference between it and a sauna was slightly obscured from view, so I could inform everyone who came in like some kind of spa connoisseur.</p> <p>My wife and I both had deep-tissue massages, and were rendered pleasantly cross-eyed by Jeanette, who worked our tired muscles until our brains dissolved into warm goo. Upon collecting him from the creche, we took the boy for his first ever swim, an activity to which he took such an immediate and ecstatic liking, it might be the highlight of our entire trip. Better yet, the easy come and go of other families meant we never felt in anyone\u2019s way, and made us think a stay here would be truly ideal for slightly older children, as both the spa and the upstairs nook filled with books and toys, are perfect diversions for curious and mobile kids.</p> <p>We ate in the restaurant both evenings. I particularly enjoyed the chowder and my wife nearly screamed at her menu, the first she\u2019d read in a while where vegetarian was not synonymous with \u201cyou can have mushroom risotto or some leaves\u201d. The restaurant even offered baby monitors in case our little Michael Phelps rose from his slumber. He did, on both evenings, but the process of jaunting upstairs to settle him was so pain-free, it made us reflect on the true success of what was a wonderful weekend. Holidaying with a baby isn\u2019t about having the work done for you; it\u2019s about providing the tools and environment to make that work more worth it than ever.<br>\u2022 <em>The </em><em>Baby\u2019s First Stay Away package costs from \u00a3469 for two nights, with dinner, including two 30-minute spa treatments, a two-hour creche session each day and welcome hamper</em><em> <a href=\"https://www.newparkmanorhotel.co.uk/\">(newparkmanorhotel.co.uk</a>)</em></p> <h2>13.

The five-star hotel\u2019s Thalasso and Spa centre has recently launched a series of magnesium-based treatments for guests to help get their sleep cycle back on track. Sign up for a two or four-day SOS Sleep Kit programme that includes acupuncture or reflexology, a massage and magnesium body wrap and bath. <br>\u2022 <em>The two-night SOS Sleep Kit programme costs \u00a3225pp and the four-day programme \u00a3468pp. Rooms at Princesa Yaiza from \u00a3169 per night B&amp;B (<a href=\"http://www.princesayaiza.com/\">princesayaiza.com</a>)</em></p> <h2>17.

It\u2019s hot, really hot, with a gloopy, oily consistency making it move strangely \u2013 less like water than a thick milkshake. Wading in, I find it is also ridiculously buoyant. Infused with magnesium salts, it\u2019s three times denser than the Dead Sea. Why struggle to keep upright? I drop back and float. Blimey, it\u2019s relaxing. I feel weightless, and spend the prescribed 10 minutes watching clouds drift overhead.</p> <p>I\u2019m at the impressive Aquaforte spa, within Sardinia\u2019s Forte Village. When the resort built its six thalassotherapy pools 25 years ago, it was something of a pioneer. The pools become successively cooler and less murky as guests progress through each 90-minute circuit.</p> <p>The second pool has a lower concentration of sea oil, plus anti-inflammatory aloe vera and mint. The third, is a sodium-rich pool with sea salt. The fourth is pure sea water with vigorous hydrojets. Pools five and six are the coldest \u2013 a refreshing 20C. They\u2019re all in an idyllic setting surrounded by trees.</p> <p>\u201cThe term thalassotherapy comes from the Greek and means sea treatment,\u201d says Dr Angelo Cerina, who created the spa in the 1990s. \u201cIt brings together a number of factors: climate, sun, wind, iodine-laden air, sand, muds and seaweed.\u201d</p> <p>Each pool is designed for a different effect: buoyancy in the first pool is to help post-traumatic recovery, and the salt level promotes powerful draining effects. The full circuit is recommended for skin disorders, such as psoriasis, and joint problems \u2013 and for people like me for, simply, wonderful relaxation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I\u2019m wrapped in a fluffy robe, I sip herbal tea and read the tempting menu of body treatments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>(Note: it\u2019s less relaxing if you shave your legs immediately before coming to the spa, because the salty water will sting like a thousand bees \u2013 but, happily, the sharp pain soon passes.)</p> <p>Forte Village is a giant beach resort 45 minutes from Cagliari airport, but arranged to feel small \u2013 intimate and exclusive. It has variety of room options in its eight hotels dotted around the lush gardens, from the bijou to palatial villas. During high season there are 21 restaurants (Sardinian, Mexican, Brazilian, pizza, gourmet\u2026)</p> <p>Also, in high season, however, Forte Village is expensive, the shops packed with slick designer labels and restaurants run by celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay. We went in October when it was blissfully \u2013 sometimes eerily \u2013 quiet. Perfect for a spa break, and much easier on the wallet, though quite a few of the hotels, restaurants and facilities were closed.</p> <p>I was knackered and needed time-out, but others come for the high-tech medical centre, offering expert sports medicine, nutrition advice and osteopathy.</p> <p>Indeed, Forte Village is quite a magnet for top-ranking tennis players. While I was there, many up-and-coming pros worked out in the gym and relaxed their muscles in the pools after matches. Professor Pier Francesco Parra, medical specialist to the Italian Davis Cup national team who has treated the likes of Novak Djokovic and Venus Williams, is on hand during key periods to sort out the bad backs of the tennis players \u2013 and normal guests alike.</p> <p>The 90-minute pool circuit is as active as I get during our short stay. When I\u2019ve dried off and wrapped myself in a fluffy bathrobe, I relax in the spa\u2019s beautiful reception, sipping herbal tea, and reading from the tempting menu of hands-on body treatments. Salt exfoliation, followed by Ayurvedic massage using warm Sardinian honey? Or a water-based massage while floating in pool three?</p> <p>I went for the first: wonderful. But the best thing about being at Forte Village is to visit those magic pools every day, wade into that murky-brown water, and repeat the restful circuit again and again. <br>\u2022 <em>Forte Village Resort, Sardinia (<a href=\"https://www.fortevillageresort.com/\">fortevillageresort.com</a>) offers three nights from \u00a3689pp, half board including return flights from Stansted with EasyJet (available April, May, September and October).

      "bodyText": "1. Lo\u0161inj, Croatia Eva Wiseman visits a traditional \u2018wellness island\u2019 reinvented for the 21st-century traveller What is a holiday for? Once, I would have confidently said: \u201cFor a break from work\u201d, or if I was being paid by the word, \u201cFor reading bestsellers, in the sun, slightly drunk on local wine and weather, in a bikini and area of patchy phone reception, just bad enough that you have no choice but to fall behind on world news.\u201d But it has become clear that the point of a holiday is a fluid and changeable thing, a thing that tells us much about our seasonal anxieties and spiritual ambitions. Consider for instance the inner workings of the period when a holiday was about \u201ctravel\u201d, about journeying and exploring, broadening our minds through a long plane ride to somewhere hot. Or the focus on \u201ceco-tourism\u201d, where tourists were encouraged to believe they were saving the world by camping. Today, according to Lonely Planet, \u201cwellness tourism\u201d is the fastest-growing sector in travel, having seen a 10% rise last year to make it a market worth over $500bn. The Global Wellness Institute predicts that by 2020 it will rise to $800bn. Across the globe, retreats and resorts are opening or rebranding, whether it\u2019s yurts in Cornwall or medical clinics in Greece, places to improve oneself, ideally while also getting a tan. And all because a holiday is never just a holiday. It is for this reason that I\u2019m sweating on a six-seater plane with my family, juddering over the Adriatic and pretending to our four-year-old that everything is completely, totally fine. Until now, the island of Lo\u0161inj in Croatia has been accessible to many only via a five-hour road and ferry trip from Zagreb, so it\u2019s remained a holiday destination for tourists driving from Hungary or Germany. But this year the scattered five-star hotels have started chartering these tiny, terrifying flights to bring a wealthier clientele from Russia and the UK, people attracted by its historic \u201cwellness\u201d credentials. In the late 1800s, after Croatian botanist Ambroz Hara\u010di\u0107 helped reforest this previously rocky port, the Austro-Hungarian government declared Lo\u0161inj a health resort. Today, having dusted off the title \u201cwellness island\u201d, Lo\u0161inj is welcoming a new influx of tourists visiting to enjoy air quality so pure (a combination of salt-spray from the sea, hundreds of thousands of Aleppo pines, and a unique geographical micro-climate) it\u2019s been proven to improve lung health. That and the blue water, the heat, and its relative affordability. Typically, visitors have rented mobile homes or stayed on the campsites, all of which are metres from a stony beach, and most of which have their own massage facilities \u2013 health drills deep here, wellness is not just for the wealthy. But one draw of the newly renovated luxury hotels is the scale of their offerings, vast modern spas, air-conditioned to a gentle chill. We are greeted at the Bellevue, its midcentury furniture suggesting a dozen new ways to relax, with the coldest glasses of water I\u2019ve ever tasted. The spa here stretches across the basement of the white 1960s hotel \u2013 one end is dark-walled and soothing, with colour therapy and steam rooms, the other clinical and spare, offering Botox and cryotherapy. After checking in I walk through the piped music of its hallway, be-robed and dazed \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s the Lo\u0161inj air or perhaps the flight, but I feel almost medicated, floating. The island is only 21 miles long and just under three miles wide \u2013 a coastal path wraps around the bay of \u010cikat, and a guide walks us along it into a forest to pick herbs and plants, which we take back to the spa to blend and distil into a balm. It smells like the island, a rich green scent which follows us as we trot around the cove that evening to a fish restaurant, Konoba Cigale, where the proximity to Venice shows in the menu \u2013 they stuff their homemade pasta with seafood caught that morning. Again, that blissful feeling overwhelmed me as our daughter danced to the accordion player and my partner and I looked at each other over our Istrian wine with a sort of stunned disbelief at the glory of it all, at the possibility of a holiday that feels like the photos. Morning came with birdsong. But, a moment here to discuss the breakfast buffet. Too often, I think, hotel guests become jaded by the intense joy delivered to them daily \u2013 this, too, is a side-effect of the holiday experience. A couple of days in and you no longer marvel at the blueness of the sea or the blueness of the sky, or the crisp affordability of the local wine, or, in the case of Lo\u0161inj, the smell, that leafy smell of health and wellness. But if you are four years old and enjoying your first hotel, the breakfast buffet in a grand lobby is by far the most exciting element of any holiday, and remains so every time you emerge from the lift, into this oasis of omelettes and fruit. For the stressed and old, wellness is a simplifying of one\u2019s polluted urban life; for children, it\u2019s cake for breakfast. A freediver ferried us on a speedboat around the bay, stopping to show us secluded caves where we could swim, eventually pulling up to a restaurant on the shore of the tiny car-free island of Ilovik. On the way back, our daughter slept by the engine of the boat in a nest of towels. There was much we didn\u2019t do. We didn\u2019t visit the Museum of Apoxyomenos in the town of Mali Lo\u0161inj, which boasts a single exhibit \u2013 a Greek bronze statue of an athlete dating from the 1st century, found in the sea. We didn\u2019t cycle into the forests, or see a dolphin, or stumble into the naturist colony. We did, however, eat ice cream in the island\u2019s two fishing villages, Veli Lo\u0161inj and Mali Lo\u0161inj, and we did eat at the obscenely romantic Lanterna restaurant, in the shade of an old lighthouse, and we did take a taxi up to the Providenca at sunset, a viewpoint carved into a mountain top. And we did lie motionless on sunloungers with local aloe vera pulp smeared across our sunburned shoulders in the bloated afternoon sun. Though some wellness tourists expect to come home thinner, instead it felt as if we\u2019d returned with a gorgeous weightlessness, the result of a week on this perfumed island with its daily catches and clear water. We braced once more on the tiny plane, our teeth rattling as we insisted, dry-mouthed, that the wings were meant to wobble like that. At home it took some time to rejoin our old commuting routines, our school runs, our doom. Some time to recover from the undiluted joy of a holiday like this, one that left us feeling\u2026 better. \u2022 A week\u2019s half-board stay in the four-star Family Hotel Vespera costs from \u00a3708pp. A week\u2019s half-board at the five-star Hotel Bellevue costs from \u00a31,514pp, losinj-hotels.com.

Califa Hamam, Vejer de la Frontera, Spain This year the \u201cwhite town\u201d of Vejer de la Frontera will see the return of a traditional hamam after an absence of several hundred years. Communal bathhouses were a common feature of Andalusian towns under Moorish rule. The Califa Hamam will combine a Roman-inspired caldarium, tepidarium and a frigidarium (hot, warm and cold baths) with a Moroccan steam room, massage room and a domed atrium where mint tea will be served. The company behind the new venture, the Califa Group, will also open a boutique hotel in Vejer\u2019s medieval old town this spring. Plaza No 18 will have six stylish guest rooms set within a 19th-century merchant\u2019s house with courtyard and roof terrace.

The Love Trails Festival on the Gower Peninsula (4-7 July, tickets from \u00a362pp) takes a more hedonistic approach with pub-crawl runs and a line-up of bands alongside the race programme, campfire talks, wood-fired hot tubs and wellbeing workshops. At the Big Retreat in Pembrokeshire, you can choose from more than 200 fitness and wellbeing classes, plus creative workshops (24-27 May, early-bird adult weekend tickets with camping from \u00a3144). 4. Tamina Therme, Bad Ragaz, Switzerland People have been coming to take the waters at Bad Ragaz for almost 800 years, ever since Benedictine monks first discovered the healing properties of the warm spring water. The Grand Resort Bad Ragaz is home to one of the leading medical spas in the world, but a night at the hotel here will set you back at least \u00a3300. However, you can bathe in those same mineral-rich waters for the less terrifying price of \u00a322. The Tamina Therme is a contemporary public bathhouse which opened in the town nine years ago. Forget any negative notions of municipal baths: this place is stunning, with soaring ceilings, marble floors and mountain views. The entry price gives you access to various indoor and outdoor pools, whirlpools, steam baths and saunas and, for an additional fee, you can book treatments such as Haki \u2013 a relaxing cross between massage and yoga. \u2022 Entry to Tamina Therme costs from \u00a322 for up to 2 hours (taminatherme.ch). A double room at the Hotel Garni Torkelb\u00fcndte, a 500m walk from the Tamina Therme, costs from \u00a376 per night, torkelbuendte.ch 5. Soul &amp; Surf, Algarve, Portugal Soul &amp; Surf, which has gained a devoted following for its laid-back yoga and surf holidays in Kerala and Sri Lanka, will open its first permanent European base in Portugal in April. Following a series of successful pop-up retreats in the Algarve, the British founders Ed and Sofie Templeton will set up shop in a rustic Iberian farmhouse on the outskirts of Lagos, a 40-minute drive from Faro. This stretch of coastline is known for its great surf conditions for all abilities. Families are welcome and the company will launch some kid-friendly breaks later this year. \u2022 A week\u2019s retreat costs from \u00a3712pp full-board, based on two sharing, including surf tuition, yoga and meditation sessions. Three-night breaks start from \u00a3370pp (soulsandsurf.com) 6. Yoga, Ulpotha, Sri Lanka It would be hard to conjure up a more enchanting setting for a retreat than the village of Ulpotha, surrounded by jungle in central Sri Lanka, with a lotus-strewn freshwater lake for swimming. Despite its location and rustic accommodation \u2013 off-grid wattle-and-daub huts \u2013 its reputation attracts burned-out travellers from all over the world. Retreats run for a fortnight at a time for six months of the year (from November to March and June to August) with each one being led by a different yoga teacher. \u2022 Two-week programmes cost from \u00a32,335pp including accommodation on a twin share basis, vegetarian meals, snacks, two yoga classes a day, a consultation with an Ayurveda doctor, a full day excursion per week, a massage per week (ulpotha.com) 7. Hiking and swimming, Caribbean Hike Caribbean has launched two new \u201chike and swim\u201d trips for 2019, combining challenging hikes with an open-water swim from Nevis to St Kitts. The group tours depart in March and will give participants the chance to summit the peaks of Nevis, Antigua and St Kitts. Tours will be timed to coincide with the annual 4km swim from Oualie Beach on Nevis to Cockleshell Beach on St Kitts on 31 March. It finishes with a breakfast party on the beach. \u2022 Prices start from \u00a31,299pp for the seven-night Double Summit and Swim trip (departs 27 March). Includes accommodation, based on two sharing, transfers and inter-island flights (hikecaribbean.com) 8. Winter and spring wellbeing breaks, Ibiza The White Isle has reinvented itself in recent years as a wellness destination, a canny move given that its original clubbing clientele have (mostly) grown up and are more interested in soaking in a hot tub than dancing on a podium. At the forefront of this reinvention are two of the island\u2019s most iconic hotels. Atzaro \u2013 one of Ibiza\u2019s best-loved agroturismos, whose celebrity fans include Kate Hudson and Rihanna \u2013 has upgraded its spa facilities as part of a major revamp and launched walking and cycling breaks for winter and spring. Packages include guided hikes or bike rides with a nature guide, foraging for medicinal wild herbs and access to spa, yoga and wellness classes. In the evenings, chill out in the brand new Scandi-inspired garden sauna pod, or in front of one of the hotel\u2019s log fires. And for further proof that times are changing: Pikes, the party hotel where the video for Wham\u2019s Club Tropicana was famously shot, will host its first-ever fitness retreat this spring. The Rockovery Retreat is being billed as an extravaganza of \u201cfun, frolics and fitness\u201d. \u2022 A three-night nature walking or biking package at Atzaro costs \u00a3595 (plus tax), based on two sharing a double room and B&amp;B (atzaro.com). The three-night Rockovery Retreat at Pikes (12-15 May) costs \u00a31,352pp, including accommodation, meals, fitness training, yoga, talks and workshops (pikesibiza.com) 9. Mindfulness retreats, Sharpham Trust, Devon Mindfulness and environmental sustainability are the cornerstones of the Sharpham Trust, an educational charity based just outside Totnes in Devon. Most of the retreats are in the charity\u2019s Grade I-listed Georgian mansion, or in a barn set in its grounds, but if you really want to make a connection with nature, opt for one of the Woodland retreats which include accommodation in bell tents. The days include guided meditations, sensory exercises and periods of silence, with evenings around the campfire. For something more active, the popular Walking Retreats feature daily guided walks through the countryside, along the Devon coast path or in the Trust\u2019s Capability Brown-designed gardens. \u2022 A three-night Nature Connection retreat costs \u00a3335, with full-board camping, next retreat 25 July; a four-night Mindfulness and Walking Retreat costs from \u00a3385pp including single-occupancy accommodation in the mansion, 13 May (sharphamtrust.org) 10. In:spa retreat, Tuscany, Italy An estate in Tuscany, surrounded by lavender fields, vineyards and orchards is the new location for luxury retreat company in:spa. The family-run Locanda Cugnanello, which is 20 miles from Siena, features a luxurious villa alongside an 800-year-old farmhouse that blends rustic style with modern comforts. There are 12 comfortable guestrooms, a saltwater pool, outdoor sofas and a large hammock. Its rural location offers guests a peaceful retreat in which to detox and de-stress, with a combination of yoga and fitness classes, hikes, spa treatments and nutritional consultations. Also, new for this year, in:spa is offering guests the chance to sign up for a pre-retreat consultation with a health screening company who will check blood sugar, cardiovascular function and cholesterol levels and give recommendations on ways to improve health during the retreat. \u2022 A week-long retreat costs from \u00a32,095pp, based on two sharing on an all-inclusive basis. Retreat dates are 4-11 May and 7-14 September. Pre-retreat health consultations cost \u00a3499 (inspa-retreats.com) 11. Beach bootcamp, Marbella Genevieve Fox defies her sons\u2019 scepticism \u2013 and her own expectations \u2013 on a fitness retreat Ten days before my fitness bootcamp in Marbella, a friend came over and glanced at my fitness schedule, pinned to the fridge. \u201cIt says \u2018hit\u2019 here,\u201d she said, \u201cbut with two i\u2019s.\u201d \u201cMust be a typo,\u201d I said. I hadn\u2019t looked at it. Seven days before I was due to meet my fitness fate, my 17-year-old son also looked at the schedule. He promptly telephoned his older brother, who then rang me. \u201cAbout this fitness thing,\u201d he said, \u201cI hear you\u2019re doing something called \u2018insanity\u2019. Are you sure about all this?\u201d My sons expressing concern for their unfit mother. I was touched. And secretly alarmed. From Thursday afternoon until Sunday lunchtime, a new world awaited: of beach runs and burpees, fasted HIIT and tabatas, circuits and squat jumps. I emailed James Davis, who runs 38\u00b0N \u2013 specialising in luxury fitness retreats in Marbella and Ibiza \u2013 with his wife Claire. \u201cAm worried that I am too unfit to benefit from a weekend and that everyone else will be super-fit,\u201d I wrote. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a fitness benchmark. From there, we adapt the training to the individual.\u201d In case he was lying, and because I dreaded the public humiliation more than the heart attack, I did some emergency pre-training: two jogs with the dog, one on my own, and two cycling and running sessions in a gym. The day before departure, I emailed James again: \u201cAm slightly dreading being so hideously unfit.\u201d \u201cEveryone is at their own level,\u201d he replied, \u201con their own journey, and we\u2019ll have a great time.\u201d And I did. In the words of the late artist Louise Bourgeois: \u201cI have been to hell and back. And let me tell you, it was wonderful.\u201d It really was. I did one form of high-intensity exercise after another, on the beach, on tarmac, in the gym. Just as Sisyphus pushed the rock up the mountain, so James and Claire pushed me on, and on. At 8am, for three mornings running, I did \u201cFasted HIIT: Metcon\u201d. This translates as, skip breakfast, then do high intensity interval training and metabolic conditioning. I jumped through the rungs of a ladder on the sand, like footballers do; did star jumps and wished I had a pelvic floor; I saw, and swung, my first ever kettle bell, thrusting my hips outwards in what looked like a misguided mating call. I picked up two ropes thick enough to moor a tanker and tried, and failed, to wiggle them up and down. By Sunday morning, they were, if not ribbons in my hands, at least airborne. Two boxing sessions with James and I was hooked. I\u2019ve since bought my own gloves and joined a boxing class. During the spin sessions, I slid off the saddle, swore volubly, sweated more, and felt like my legs were being ripped apart. But Claire got me through the pain barrier. She is dynamic, fun and magically motivating. I reported my triumphs, as well as the three-course lunches and sumptuous breakfast banquets overlooking the sea in this fabulous hotel, to the family. \u201cI\u2019m glad (and surprised) you\u2019re still alive,\u201d wrote my older son. I am surprised I\u2019ve since joined a gym, go to this gym, and have signed up to a 38\u00b0N bespoke, 28-day HIIT home workout plan \u2013 short bouts of exercise won\u2019t disrupt my day, so there\u2019s a high chance I\u2019ll do them, armed with my new, can-do mindset. I even fancy a 38\u00b0N pop-up fitness weekend in London later this year. I know I sound as if a cult has got me, but feeling energised is a revelation. Count me in. \u2022 38\u00b0N\u2019s Body: Reset Weekend at the Puente Romano Beach Resort and Spa, 7-10 March, costs \u00a31,399pp based on two people sharing (thirtyeightdegreesnorth.com) 12. Baby spa break, New Forest Are babies and relaxation incompatible? S\u00e9amas O\u2019Reilly finds out on a family spa break \u201cOh right\u2026 wow,\u201d replied one pal, when we said we were doing a spa break with our four-month old. \u201cGood for you,\u201d they added, in the strained, halted speech you\u2019d use if someone had announced their intention to eat the contents of a vacuum bag. Undeterred by such scepticism, we pledged to give it our all. The experience on offer seemed idyllic, two nights at a hotel and spa that catered specially to families, even babies. Taking a 90-minute train from Waterloo, we set out to do the unthinkable. \u201cNot much nightlife around,\u201d our cabbie said, just in case we\u2019d come to Brockenhurst in search of an active local grime scene. \u201cBut families love coming here for the views.\u201d On that point, he wasn\u2019t wrong. Around 15 miles southwest of Southampton, New Park Manor Hotel &amp; Spa is set within the decidedly toothsome environs of the New Forest, and we hadn\u2019t been within its gates for 60 seconds before we sighted deer striding through the open park. The manor itself is a grand old house that dates, in some form or another, to the 11th century. Since then it\u2019s been inhabited by lords, landowners and, at one point, Nell Gwyn, mistress of Charles II. It\u2019s only been operating as a hotel since 1970, which rather dashed my fond imaginings of William the Conqueror towelling down in the sauna after a busy day of mutton and jousting. While our room was prepared, we took in one of the nearby forest trails and found the effect so calming it took us a minute to realise our son was similarly transfixed himself. Ordinarily more of a picking-up-spoons-and-throwing-them guy, the perpetual fall of orange-red leaves had placed him in a state of cherubic hypnosis. New Park Manor is part of the Luxury Family Hotels group, which specialises in providing plush but unfussy breaks for families, and we entered our room to find a cot, changing mat, baby swimming togs and a rubber duckie. Even better were the bright and colourful creche facilities, to which we delivered the boy for two hours on both days of our stay. Fears he would fret once we parted were, in the end, unfounded. One glance at his charming new handlers was enough to scrub us from his memory, allowing us to take in the luxuriously appointed spa while he was lavished with attention. Leaving the fickle brute to his new pals, we made our way to the spa for the pool, treatment rooms, sauna and sanarium. This last concept was previously unknown to me, and comprised a room that\u2019s basically a sauna, but at a lower temperature and slightly increased humidity. I found it had a gloriously balmy effect on my weary joints and, better still, the information plaque which listed the difference between it and a sauna was slightly obscured from view, so I could inform everyone who came in like some kind of spa connoisseur. My wife and I both had deep-tissue massages, and were rendered pleasantly cross-eyed by Jeanette, who worked our tired muscles until our brains dissolved into warm goo. Upon collecting him from the creche, we took the boy for his first ever swim, an activity to which he took such an immediate and ecstatic liking, it might be the highlight of our entire trip. Better yet, the easy come and go of other families meant we never felt in anyone\u2019s way, and made us think a stay here would be truly ideal for slightly older children, as both the spa and the upstairs nook filled with books and toys, are perfect diversions for curious and mobile kids. We ate in the restaurant both evenings. I particularly enjoyed the chowder and my wife nearly screamed at her menu, the first she\u2019d read in a while where vegetarian was not synonymous with \u201cyou can have mushroom risotto or some leaves\u201d. The restaurant even offered baby monitors in case our little Michael Phelps rose from his slumber. He did, on both evenings, but the process of jaunting upstairs to settle him was so pain-free, it made us reflect on the true success of what was a wonderful weekend. Holidaying with a baby isn\u2019t about having the work done for you; it\u2019s about providing the tools and environment to make that work more worth it than ever. \u2022 The Baby\u2019s First Stay Away package costs from \u00a3469 for two nights, with dinner, including two 30-minute spa treatments, a two-hour creche session each day and welcome hamper (newparkmanorhotel.co.uk) 13. Aqua Sana Spa, Center Parcs, Nottinghamshire Center Parcs is known for many things \u2013 the weatherproof \u201csub-tropical swimming paradise\u201d and a mind-boggling array of child-pleasing activities \u2013 but it\u2019s not necessarily the first place you\u2019d head to in search of a zen-like state of relaxation. Which is a shame as its Aqua Sana spas are pretty good. The pick of the bunch is the spa at Center Parcs\u2019 Sherwood Forest site, which recently underwent a multi-million pound overhaul, resulting in a grown-up Scandinavian-inspired space which has been designed to make the most of the woodland environment and boasts the world\u2019s first \u201ctreetop sauna\u201d. The spa at the Longleat Forest location will undergo a similar revamp this year. \u2022 Spa day packages start from \u00a389pp and include access to the spa, with its heated outdoor pool and hot tubs, thermal suites and treetop sauna, plus lunch and refreshments. Overnight spa breaks with apartment accommodation cost from \u00a3169pp (aquasana.co.uk) 14. Surf, yoga and spa, Paradis Plage, Agadir, Morocco If you want a dose of sunshine with your soul-searching, but don\u2019t want to travel long-haul, Morocco provides an affordable alternative to the five-star Asian spa resorts. Just north of Agadir, near to the surfing village of Taghazout, Paradis Plage offers surf tuition, yoga classes and an impressive spa. Start your day with sun salutations in the beachfront yoga shala, before testing your surf skills on one of Morocco\u2019s most famous breaks. Finish by unwinding in the spa with traditional Moroccan hamam treatments. \u2022 Health and Fitness Travel offers a three-night Body Break from \u00a3435pp, including a choice of fitness classes and spa treatments (healthandfitnesstravel.com) 15. Revive &amp; Renew, the Retreat, Costa Rica Founded by American chef, wellness coach and author Diana Stobo, the Retreat offers an intimate \u201chome from home\u201d experience, surrounded by jungle on a mist-wreathed mountainside. There are a handful of different healthy living programmes to choose from, but the most popular is the four or six-night Revive &amp; Renew package, which includes daily yoga classes and nature hikes, a massage, healthy cooking classes and meals made with organic food grown on the hotel\u2019s own farm. Accommodation is in charming casitas with balconies overlooking the lush Nicoya peninsula and guests have full access to the steam room, pool, gym and a spa that offers locally inspired treatments, such as a Costa Rican coffee scrub and fruit smoothie facials. \u2022 Health and Fitness Travel offers six nights at The Retreat from \u00a31,600pp, based on two sharing on a fullboard basis (healthandfitnesstravel.com) 16. SOS Sleep Kit, Princesa Yaiza, Lanzarote A good night\u2019s sleep is the 21st-century holy grail: elusive for many, but essential to our wellbeing. The Princesa Yaiza Suite Hotel Resort in Lanzarote claims to have the answer \u2013 magnesium. Research has shown that the mineral plays a key role in regulating melatonin levels, the hormone responsible for our sleep patterns. The five-star hotel\u2019s Thalasso and Spa centre has recently launched a series of magnesium-based treatments for guests to help get their sleep cycle back on track. Sign up for a two or four-day SOS Sleep Kit programme that includes acupuncture or reflexology, a massage and magnesium body wrap and bath. \u2022 The two-night SOS Sleep Kit programme costs \u00a3225pp and the four-day programme \u00a3468pp. Rooms at Princesa Yaiza from \u00a3169 per night B&amp;B (princesayaiza.com) 17. Pause Retreats, London Not everyone has the luxury of taking a week or more out of their life to indulge in a far-flung spa break or retreat. It was for this reason that pyschotherapist and author Danielle Marchant launched her Pause Retreats to give busy people a chance to step off the treadmill and take stock. In Danielle\u2019s own words, the retreats \u201care not about finding answers, but about asking the right questions\u201d and combine meditation, yoga and \u201csacred circle\u201d rituals, with life coaching. Her one-day Instant Pause retreats take place in London and Somerset a couple of times a year. You can also opt for a two-and-a-half-day Wild Pause that includes camping in Cornwall and a five-day Deep Pause retreat which takes place in Cornwall and Bali once a year. \u2022 Instant Pause day workshops cost \u00a3129pp. The two-day Wild Pause in Cornwall costs \u00a3389pp (5-7 July) and the five-day Deep Pause in Cornwall costs \u00a3849pp (lifebydanielle.com) 18. Raw Horizons retreat, Yorkshire A breast cancer diagnosis in her 30s was the catalyst for Claire Maguire to retrain as a life coach and yoga instructor and to open up Split Farthing Hall, her Georgian home near Thirsk in North Yorkshire, to detox, yoga and emotional wellbeing retreats for women. As the name suggests, Raw Horizons retreats incorporate a diet of gourmet raw food, complimented by kundalini yoga, meditation and personal-growth workshops and exercises. Among the retreats on offer are weekend rejuvenating breaks, three-night juice detoxes and five-night life-coaching retreats. \u2022 A three-night Juice Detox and Holistic Retreat costs from \u00a3575pp, based on two sharing (rawhorizons.co.uk) 19. Anahata Retreat, Goa, India If signing up for a full-blown yoga or wellness retreat feels a bit daunting (or expensive), Goa has no shortage of affordable, low-key places where daily yoga classes and ayurvedic treatments are available, but you\u2019ll still have most of the day free for lounging on the beach, learning to surf or sightseeing. One such place is the charming Anahata, a rustic collection of thatched beach cottages set in a palm grove just behind Mandrem beach. Morning and sunset beach yoga sessions are available, as well as a choice of martial arts and mindfulness classes. Authentic ayurvedic massages are offered in a thatched cabana and the restaurant serves healthy, home-cooked food. \u2022 Retreats cost from \u00a388. Anahata is closed from May to October during the monsoon (i-escape.com) 20. Trill Farm, Devon Romy Fraser has been offering healthy living, nutrition and creative courses on her 200-acre organic farm in Devon for 10 years. The ever-popular Seasonal Nutrition weekends, led by chef and medicinal nutritionist Daphne Lambert, are all about harmonising your diet with the changing seasons, with lots of practical advice on using home-grown and foraged seasonal foods. The spring workshop will examine the relationship between soil and gut biodiversity, and will feature ingredients and recipes that support digestion. Communal meals are taken around the farmhouse table and accommodation can be booked in the on-site guesthouse. Other workshops include beekeeping, creative writing, herbal medicine and singing. \u2022 The Seasonal Nutrition weekends cost \u00a3395pp, including two nights\u2019 accommodation, and take place four times a year. Non-residential courses cost \u00a3295 (trillfarm.co.uk) 21. Avani, Koh Samui, Thailand The Thai hotel group Anantara is a leader in the field when it comes to luxury spa hotels. Six years ago it launched Avani Hotels &amp; Resorts \u2013 an affordable spin-off brand designed to appeal to younger travellers, which has gone from strength to strength. The latest opening is on Koh Samui, a sleek, contemporary seaside hideaway on the quiet side of the island, which offers gorgeous design and top-notch facilities at a fraction of the price of many luxury Asian spa hotels. As well as the spa and well-equipped gym, there are regular yoga and fitness classes, plus nature hikes and stand-up paddleboarding tuition. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a3131 per night, pool villas from \u00a3235 (avanihotels.com) 22. The Campus, Algarve, Portugal Whether you\u2019re looking to brush up on your golf or tennis game, perfect your swimming technique or simply get into a better fitness routine, the Algarve\u2019s state-of-the-art sports and fitness centre will have something to suit. Work recently finished on the final phase of the Campus in Quinta do Lago, a high-performance training facility pitched at elite athletes and enthusiastic amateurs alike. Book some professional-level tuition on the tennis courts (Judy Murray runs a tennis camp here), sign up for one of the dozens of daily classes in the gym or exercise studios, from ballet to boxfit, or make a splash in the 25m outdoor pool. At the Bike Shed, you can rent a bike or book a guided cycling tour through the Ria Formosa Natural Park. Children\u2019s classes and tuition are also available. The nearby Magnolia Hotel \u2013 a cool, contemporary retreat with motel-style rooms overlooking an outdoor pool \u2013 offers a free transfer service to the Campus. \u2022 Adult group tennis coaching \u00a318 per session; fitness classes \u00a318 (quintadolago.com). Double rooms at the Magnolia Hotel from \u00a388 on a B&amp;B basis (themagnoliahotelqdl.com) 23. Body Camp, Mallorca, Spain Since launching three years ago, Body Camp Ibiza has gained something of a cult following, attracting celebrity endorsements from the likes of Emma Willis, Donna Air, Caroline Flack and Mel C, for its blend of holistic wellbeing and fitness with a relaxed, Balearic vibe. This summer will see the opening of a permanent site in Mallorca, allowing the camps to operate year-round (Ibiza is March to September only). Like its sister camp, Body Camp Mallorca will offer a full timetable of exercise classes and activities, but there will be a slightly stronger emphasis on fitness and nutrition and, unlike Ibiza, guests will have the option of taking the afternoon off for relaxing by the pool, hiking, mountain biking or booking a spa treatment if they want some downtime. \u2022 Body Camp Mallorca opens on 3 May. A seven-night programme costs from \u00a31,150pp based on four sharing. Three and four-night breaks are available from \u00a3600pp (thebodycamp.com) 24. Madhyamaka Buddhist Centre, Yorkshire For a friendly and accessible introduction to meditation, the beginners\u2019 weekends hosted by the Madhyamaka Buddhist Centre in the Yorkshire Wolds are hard to beat. Housed in a sprawling Georgian mansion, the retreats are aimed at all levels, with introductory talks on modern Buddhism. As well as the beginners\u2019 courses, there are year-round Rest and Reflect weeks where you can drop into as many meditation classes you like or, if you just want some time out from the rat race, you can book a bed in a dorm or one of the single or double rooms on a B&amp;B basis and soak up the peaceful atmosphere. Check the calendar for special workshops such as the Overcoming Stress Anxiety and Depression weekend (3-5 May). \u2022 Learn to Meditate weekends cost from \u00a3105pp, based on shared dormitory accommodation, including all meals and classes. The next one is 15-17 March. B&amp;B from \u00a340pp (madhyamaka.org) 25. Pool therapy, Sardinia Circling six thalassotherapy pools gives Harriet Green the blissful relaxation she is after I push one toe into the murky-brown water. It\u2019s hot, really hot, with a gloopy, oily consistency making it move strangely \u2013 less like water than a thick milkshake. Wading in, I find it is also ridiculously buoyant. Infused with magnesium salts, it\u2019s three times denser than the Dead Sea. Why struggle to keep upright? I drop back and float. Blimey, it\u2019s relaxing. I feel weightless, and spend the prescribed 10 minutes watching clouds drift overhead. I\u2019m at the impressive Aquaforte spa, within Sardinia\u2019s Forte Village. When the resort built its six thalassotherapy pools 25 years ago, it was something of a pioneer. The pools become successively cooler and less murky as guests progress through each 90-minute circuit. The second pool has a lower concentration of sea oil, plus anti-inflammatory aloe vera and mint. The third, is a sodium-rich pool with sea salt. The fourth is pure sea water with vigorous hydrojets. Pools five and six are the coldest \u2013 a refreshing 20C. They\u2019re all in an idyllic setting surrounded by trees. \u201cThe term thalassotherapy comes from the Greek and means sea treatment,\u201d says Dr Angelo Cerina, who created the spa in the 1990s. \u201cIt brings together a number of factors: climate, sun, wind, iodine-laden air, sand, muds and seaweed.\u201d Each pool is designed for a different effect: buoyancy in the first pool is to help post-traumatic recovery, and the salt level promotes powerful draining effects. The full circuit is recommended for skin disorders, such as psoriasis, and joint problems \u2013 and for people like me for, simply, wonderful relaxation. (Note: it\u2019s less relaxing if you shave your legs immediately before coming to the spa, because the salty water will sting like a thousand bees \u2013 but, happily, the sharp pain soon passes.) Forte Village is a giant beach resort 45 minutes from Cagliari airport, but arranged to feel small \u2013 intimate and exclusive. It has variety of room options in its eight hotels dotted around the lush gardens, from the bijou to palatial villas. During high season there are 21 restaurants (Sardinian, Mexican, Brazilian, pizza, gourmet\u2026) Also, in high season, however, Forte Village is expensive, the shops packed with slick designer labels and restaurants run by celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay. We went in October when it was blissfully \u2013 sometimes eerily \u2013 quiet. Perfect for a spa break, and much easier on the wallet, though quite a few of the hotels, restaurants and facilities were closed. I was knackered and needed time-out, but others come for the high-tech medical centre, offering expert sports medicine, nutrition advice and osteopathy. Indeed, Forte Village is quite a magnet for top-ranking tennis players. While I was there, many up-and-coming pros worked out in the gym and relaxed their muscles in the pools after matches. Professor Pier Francesco Parra, medical specialist to the Italian Davis Cup national team who has treated the likes of Novak Djokovic and Venus Williams, is on hand during key periods to sort out the bad backs of the tennis players \u2013 and normal guests alike. The 90-minute pool circuit is as active as I get during our short stay. When I\u2019ve dried off and wrapped myself in a fluffy bathrobe, I relax in the spa\u2019s beautiful reception, sipping herbal tea, and reading from the tempting menu of hands-on body treatments. Salt exfoliation, followed by Ayurvedic massage using warm Sardinian honey? Or a water-based massage while floating in pool three? I went for the first: wonderful. But the best thing about being at Forte Village is to visit those magic pools every day, wade into that murky-brown water, and repeat the restful circuit again and again. \u2022 Forte Village Resort, Sardinia (fortevillageresort.com) offers three nights from \u00a3689pp, half board including return flights from Stansted with EasyJet (available April, May, September and October). Spa packages can be arranged in advance or directly with the hotel. To book, visit citalia.com",

The obvious answer is that they are influenced by what they see, hear and read in mainstream media. But until now that was just an anecdotal conjecture. The good news is that we now have some empirical support for it, in the shape of <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-12/Brennen_UK_Media_Coverage_of_AI_FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">a remarkable investigation</a> by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University into how <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/risj-review/uk-media-coverage-artificial-intelligence-dominated-industry-and-industry-sources\" title=\"\">UK media cover artificial intelligence</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This research reveals why so many people seem oblivious to, or complacent about, the challenges that AI poses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The researchers conducted a systematic examination of 760 articles published in the first eight months of 2018 by six mainstream UK news outlets, chosen to represent a variety of political leanings \u2013 the <em>Telegraph</em>, Mail Online (and the <em>Daily Mail</em>), the <em>Guardian</em>, HuffPost, the BBC and the UK edition of <em>Wired</em> magazine. The main conclusion of the study is that media coverage of AI is dominated by the industry itself. Nearly 60% of articles were focused on new products, announcements and initiatives supposedly involving AI; a third were based on industry sources; and 12% explicitly mentioned Elon Musk, the would-be colonist of Mars.</p> <p>Critically, AI products were often portrayed as relevant and competent solutions to a range of public problems. Journalists rarely questioned whether AI was likely to be the best answer to these problems, nor did they acknowledge debates about the technology\u2019s public effects.</p> <p>\u201cBy amplifying industry\u2019s self-interested claims about AI,\u201d said one of the researchers, \u201cmedia coverage presents AI as a solution to a range of problems that will disrupt nearly all areas of our lives, often without acknowledging ongoing debates concerning AI\u2019s potential effects. In this way, coverage also positions AI mostly as a private commercial concern and undercuts the role and potential of public action in addressing this emerging public issue.\u201d</p> <p>This research reveals why so many people seem oblivious to, or complacent about, the challenges that AI technology poses to fundamental rights and the rule of law. The tech industry narrative is explicitly designed to make sure that societies don\u2019t twig this until it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. (In the same way that it\u2019s now too late to do anything about fake news.) The Oxford research suggests that the strategy is succeeding and that mainstream journalism is unwittingly aiding and abetting it.</p> <p>Another plank in the industry\u2019s strategy is to pretend that all the important issues about AI are about ethics and accordingly the companies have banded together to finance numerous initiatives to study ethical issues in the hope of earning brownie points from gullible politicians and potential regulators. This is what is known in rugby circles as \u201cgetting your retaliation in first\u201d and the result is what can only be described as \u201cethics theatre\u201d, much like the security theatre that goes on at airports.</p> <p>Nobody should be taken in by this kind of deception. There <em>are</em> ethical issues in the development and deployment of <em>any</em> technology, but in the end it\u2019s law, not ethics, that should decide what happens, as Paul Nemitz, principal adviser to the European commission, points out in a <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.2018.0089\" title=\"\">terrific article just published by the Royal Society</a>. Just as architects have to think about building codes when designing a house, he writes, tech companies \u201cwill have to think from the outset\u2026 about how their future program could affect democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law and how to ensure that the program does not undermine or disregard\u2026 these basic tenets of constitutional democracy\u201d.</p> <p>Yep.

The researchers conducted a systematic examination of 760 articles published in the first eight months of 2018 by six mainstream UK news outlets, chosen to represent a variety of political leanings \u2013 the Telegraph, Mail Online (and the Daily Mail), the Guardian, HuffPost, the BBC and the UK edition of Wired magazine. The main conclusion of the study is that media coverage of AI is dominated by the industry itself. Nearly 60% of articles were focused on new products, announcements and initiatives supposedly involving AI; a third were based on industry sources; and 12% explicitly mentioned Elon Musk, the would-be colonist of Mars. Critically, AI products were often portrayed as relevant and competent solutions to a range of public problems. Journalists rarely questioned whether AI was likely to be the best answer to these problems, nor did they acknowledge debates about the technology\u2019s public effects. \u201cBy amplifying industry\u2019s self-interested claims about AI,\u201d said one of the researchers, \u201cmedia coverage presents AI as a solution to a range of problems that will disrupt nearly all areas of our lives, often without acknowledging ongoing debates concerning AI\u2019s potential effects. In this way, coverage also positions AI mostly as a private commercial concern and undercuts the role and potential of public action in addressing this emerging public issue.\u201d This research reveals why so many people seem oblivious to, or complacent about, the challenges that AI technology poses to fundamental rights and the rule of law. The tech industry narrative is explicitly designed to make sure that societies don\u2019t twig this until it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. (In the same way that it\u2019s now too late to do anything about fake news.) The Oxford research suggests that the strategy is succeeding and that mainstream journalism is unwittingly aiding and abetting it. Another plank in the industry\u2019s strategy is to pretend that all the important issues about AI are about ethics and accordingly the companies have banded together to finance numerous initiatives to study ethical issues in the hope of earning brownie points from gullible politicians and potential regulators. This is what is known in rugby circles as \u201cgetting your retaliation in first\u201d and the result is what can only be described as \u201cethics theatre\u201d, much like the security theatre that goes on at airports. Nobody should be taken in by this kind of deception. There are ethical issues in the development and deployment of any technology, but in the end it\u2019s law, not ethics, that should decide what happens, as Paul Nemitz, principal adviser to the European commission, points out in a terrific article just published by the Royal Society. Just as architects have to think about building codes when designing a house, he writes, tech companies \u201cwill have to think from the outset\u2026 about how their future program could affect democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law and how to ensure that the program does not undermine or disregard\u2026 these basic tenets of constitutional democracy\u201d. Yep. So lets have no more \u201csoft\u201d coverage of artificial intelligence and some real, sceptical journalism instead.

The worst were the people who had money: the more money it seemed that somebody had, the cheaper they were.\u201d One particular man hired the limousine for the afternoon to propose to his girlfriend: Shorr bought flowers and drinks for the couple, and it took military precision, timing and coordination to get them from their upmarket brownstone building to Times Square for the exact moment a sign would appear on the billboard with her name on it, asking her to marry him. It all went off without a hitch: they got there at the right time, saw the message, she said yes. But at the end of the trip, nothing. The next day the man complained, saying the limousine was too cold.</p> <p>Even more galling, because of all the strategising involved, she didn\u2019t even get a picture of them. In 1989, as a recent graduate of New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts, Shorr had decided to take a job as a limousine driver in her native Brooklyn to photograph the people she drove around. At first she had considered driving taxis, but the customers would have been in and out too quickly, constantly in a hurry, while driving a limo gave her several hours with her passengers. So, for nine months in 1989 and 1990, she worked weekends for a downtown limo company. \u201cI would describe them as being on the low end of the limousine hierarchy,\u201d she says. \u201cDrivers had to provide liquor and mixers for their clients, and everything was a bit shabby and cheap.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d9945148a9ec7fa6a0683a699d04404d6bf41b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d9945148a9ec7fa6a0683a699d04404d6bf41b0/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Friends, Brooklyn, 1989\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Friends, Brooklyn, 1989: \u2018The boy on the left was part of a wedding party and was waiting to go in.

To her surprise, with the exception of one client, everyone said yes. When she revealed herself as a photographer, the dynamic inside the car would change. At first, they would treat her like an employee, giving her orders. \u201cBut then when I made that proclamation that I was a photographer doing a project, suddenly the guests in the car were working for me: everybody was like \u2018Oh Kathy\u2019, very friendly, and we were on the same level. You\u2019d feel like you were no longer somebody that was going to be told what to do, you were going to be asked.\u201d</p> <p>Most journeys were festive, joyous occasions: apart from one funeral, Shorr worked on weddings, proms, sweet-16 parties. \u201cPeople were in a good mood and when you\u2019re in that kind of mood there are very few things that will fluster you. There was a lot of laughing and drinking and extending the festivities of the day into the car.\u201d At the time, limousines were not an unusual way of getting to and from special events: for a couple of hundred dollars, anyone could feel like a celebrity for a few hours. \u201cIf you were a working-class person you knew that if you saved, you could afford a limousine if you had an event.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d55c3884799d971aa6305af17e5335a4b756d411\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d55c3884799d971aa6305af17e5335a4b756d411/0_0_4000_2666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ladies Looking In, Brooklyn, 1989\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ladies Looking In, Brooklyn, 1989: \u2018These women were curious to see what the back of a limo looked like.

I hope it stops, I want to see them get out\u2019,\u201d says Shorr, remembering the crowds that would form. \u201cIt had a cachet to it \u2013 usually when there\u2019s a group of people that are dressed up, anybody in the vicinity is going to stop and watch, because it is kind of a spectacle.\u201d</p> <p>There were also less thrilling sides to the job. Events could last five or six hours, which meant a lot of alone time for the waiting driver. Once, with her guests deposited at a party, Shorr parked the limousine and went to the cinema on her own; at other times she watched the TV in the back of the car. On another occasion, a young couple vaguely asked her to drive through Central Park. \u201cSo I drove through the park and I remember I had <em>The Magic Flute</em> on and I had the sun roof open and it was a nice night and all of a sudden the car started rocking back and forth.\u201d She laughs. \u201cSo I had an inkling what was going on in the back seat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f989ba3e475d053b7f4aee59e0fc8049f9dd8528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f989ba3e475d053b7f4aee59e0fc8049f9dd8528/0_0_4000_2557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Commitment Ceremony, New York City, 1989\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Commitment Ceremony, New York City, 1989: \u2018This was two women \u2013 same-sex marriage wasn\u2019t legal in New York at the time, so it was some kind of commitment ceremony.

They weren\u2019t jobs that required an education per se, but these were people that did what they had to do, and they also played hard. They liked to enjoy themselves, they <em>lived</em> life.

In 1989, as a recent graduate of New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts, Shorr had decided to take a job as a limousine driver in her native Brooklyn to photograph the people she drove around. At first she had considered driving taxis, but the customers would have been in and out too quickly, constantly in a hurry, while driving a limo gave her several hours with her passengers. So, for nine months in 1989 and 1990, she worked weekends for a downtown limo company. \u201cI would describe them as being on the low end of the limousine hierarchy,\u201d she says. \u201cDrivers had to provide liquor and mixers for their clients, and everything was a bit shabby and cheap.\u201d Shorr would wait until half an hour or so into the ride \u2013 assignments could last from a couple of hours to the whole day \u2013 and ask if she could take a few pictures. To her surprise, with the exception of one client, everyone said yes. When she revealed herself as a photographer, the dynamic inside the car would change. At first, they would treat her like an employee, giving her orders. \u201cBut then when I made that proclamation that I was a photographer doing a project, suddenly the guests in the car were working for me: everybody was like \u2018Oh Kathy\u2019, very friendly, and we were on the same level. You\u2019d feel like you were no longer somebody that was going to be told what to do, you were going to be asked.\u201d Most journeys were festive, joyous occasions: apart from one funeral, Shorr worked on weddings, proms, sweet-16 parties. \u201cPeople were in a good mood and when you\u2019re in that kind of mood there are very few things that will fluster you. There was a lot of laughing and drinking and extending the festivities of the day into the car.\u201d At the time, limousines were not an unusual way of getting to and from special events: for a couple of hundred dollars, anyone could feel like a celebrity for a few hours. \u201cIf you were a working-class person you knew that if you saved, you could afford a limousine if you had an event.\u201d Still, there was something about the limousine that fascinated onlookers. \u201cSeeing that big white car, it was always like: \u2018Oh, who\u2019s in the car? I hope it stops, I want to see them get out\u2019,\u201d says Shorr, remembering the crowds that would form. \u201cIt had a cachet to it \u2013 usually when there\u2019s a group of people that are dressed up, anybody in the vicinity is going to stop and watch, because it is kind of a spectacle.\u201d There were also less thrilling sides to the job. Events could last five or six hours, which meant a lot of alone time for the waiting driver. Once, with her guests deposited at a party, Shorr parked the limousine and went to the cinema on her own; at other times she watched the TV in the back of the car. On another occasion, a young couple vaguely asked her to drive through Central Park. \u201cSo I drove through the park and I remember I had The Magic Flute on and I had the sun roof open and it was a nice night and all of a sudden the car started rocking back and forth.\u201d She laughs. \u201cSo I had an inkling what was going on in the back seat.\u201d Almost 30 years on, Shorr \u2013 now a freelance photographer and teacher of documentary photography at New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts \u2013 looks back on her limo-driving days fondly. Limousines have become less fashionable, partly due to increased transport options such as Uber, partly due to the changing nature of fame. \u201cMost celebrities drive in black 4x4 cars now,\u201d says Shorr. \u201cThat says \u2018Stay away, I don\u2019t want to be looked at\u2019, where with the limousine it was very much about \u2018Look at me, I\u2019m having a good time.\u2019 I can\u2019t even remember the last time I saw a limousine in New York.\u201d The photos are a document of their time: people were smoking, smartphones didn\u2019t exist, no one was taking selfies. \u201cNobody was interested in giving you a sanitised version of what they were,\u201d says Shorr. \u201cThis was a collaboration between photographer and subject.\u201d Most of all, the photos are documents of people: the types of people Shorr grew up with, who lived in Brooklyn before it was an aspirational place to live. \u201cI think all the people I drove had jobs that they worked hard at. They weren\u2019t jobs that required an education per se, but these were people that did what they had to do, and they also played hard. They liked to enjoy themselves, they lived life. They knew how to have a good time.\u201d kathyshorr.com",

That\u2019s about \u00a340,000 a try in today\u2019s money, which instinctively feels like decent work if you can get it. That is, of course, until your thoughts turn to the nag\u2019s corporate namesake \u2013 the housebuilder Persimmon \u2013 where City wags reckon former chief executive Jeff Fairburn trousered \u00a375m for performing a similar job on the firm\u2019s reputation. Fairburn, of course, spent much of 2018 trotting out optimistic defences for his grotesque pay packet, with one of his better cracks being an insistence that the figure was \u201cin line with accepted practice\u201d. That was quite an ambitious line to deliver with a straight face \u2013 and became more so when chairman Nicholas Wrigley, plus the chair of Persimmon\u2019s remuneration committee, Jonathan Davie, both quit over the scandal. Fairburn was then left to limp on, courageously doing a runner of his own from a BBC Look North interviewer, which in turn seemed to hasten the executive\u2019s own retirement. Which brings us to this week and the Persimmon trading statement \u2013the first since the former chief exec was forced out in November and the first in more than a year that won\u2019t be about Fairburn\u2019s package. As analysts at the online stockbrokers The Share Centre put it: \u201cThe media focus will now shift to the group\u2019s performance rather than its previous CEO\u2019s pay packet. The shares have been lifted at the start of 2019 as peer Taylor Wimpey reported a relatively positive update for the year ending 2018 while the outlook for 2019 remained resilient despite the political and macroeconomic backdrop. Investors will ... be on the lookout for comments on the potential impact of Brexit and whether the costs of labour and materials are heading higher.\u201d Certainly Persimmon will be hoping that this could be the moment when the whiff of Fairburn is finally scrubbed from the company stables, and history suggests that there are worse points in the calendar to attempt that trick. This week\u2019s statement happens to be scheduled at a traditionally propitious time of year for housebuilders \u2013 with the first quarter often proving to be a period when the sector is seen as being in decent fettle. Shares in housebuilders tend to rise between January and March, when the news flow is skewed towards the all-important spring selling season. That, in turn, focuses investors\u2019 attention, and the companies seem to be able to find buyers for both houses and shares. For four out of the past five years, shares in Persimmon have risen between January and March. Admittedly, last year was the exception, and maybe right now is not the time to be confidently applying long-term trends. Still, if you have to start rebuilding Persimmon\u2019s public image in the middle of a national maelstrom, then you might as well do it in January, particularly as the Brexit downside is known and partly priced in. A note looking at the sector\u2019s prospects for 2019, published by financial services firm Canaccord Genuity in December, stated: \u201cThe sector appears to be broadly pricing in a 5% fall in house prices and a 10% fall in volumes, and if the actual outcome for 2019 is at or close to current consensus expectations, we would expect a sharp value rally.\u201d Translating from the jargon into English, that means: if Brexit isn\u2019t that bad, Persimmon might give somebody a big payday.

      "body": "<p>Something had kicked off the night before and the guys on the corner were keen to offer advice. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be hanging around here too long,\u201d one said, refusing to elaborate. They were standing near Crispe house, a tower block on east London\u2019s Gascoigne estate, undisputed territory of Hellbanianz.</p> <p>The gang, an Albanian street crew of drug dealers, is known locally for its violence and more widely for a social media output featuring Ferraris, wads of \u00a350 notes and gold Rolex watches to help enhance its reputation and recruit \u201cyoungers\u201d. The Gascoigne estate, built in the 1960s and occupying land that slopes south of Barking town centre to the Thames, is its historical home turf.</p> <p>It was getting dark, another two men appeared and, when asked if they were Hellbanianz, one said: \u201cYou should go.\u201d The <em>Observer</em> was escorted off the estate and told not to return.</p> <p>Hellbanianz belong to the \u201cretail game\u201d of the cocaine trade. They are the street dealers and enforcers of the Mafia Shqiptare, the Albanian organised criminal syndicates who, the <a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">National Crime Agency </a>believe,<strong> </strong>are consolidating power within the UK criminal underworld and on their way to a near total takeover of the UK\u2019s \u00a35bn cocaine market.</p> <p>The gang\u2019s glossily produced trap music videos remind viewers \u201cHB are ready for violence\u201d and that they possess the requisite manpower and firearms. Yet, police sources say, Hellbanianz occupy the lowest rung of the Albanian mafia.</p> <p>To better understand the Albanians\u2019 remarkable rise in the UK one might climb to the 12th floor of the Gascoigne estate\u2019s high-rise blocks. From there, the skyline of London, where much of their cocaine will be snorted, stretches west. In the opposite direction, several miles along the Thames, lie the mammoth container ports where their cocaine is offloaded in multi-kilo shipments. But it is across the Atlantic, to the jungles of Latin America, where the story of the Mafia Shqiptare starts. </p> <p>How Albanians came to conquer the UK\u2019s cocaine market is a lesson in criminal savvy; the value of making friends with the world\u2019s most dangerous mafias; and the absolute threat of violence.</p> <p>It began with a business model that was simple in concept, but sufficiently bold to subvert the existing order. For years cocaine\u2019s international importers worked separately from its wholesalers and the gangs. Pricing structure varied, depending on the drug\u2019s purity; the higher it was, the more it cost.</p> <p>The Albanians ditched the entire model. They began negotiating directly with the Colombian cartels who control coca production. Huge shipments were arranged direct from South America. Supply chains were kept in-house.</p> <p>Intelligence obtained by British experts revealed that the Albanians were procuring cocaine from the cartels for about \u00a34,000 to \u00a35,500 a kilo, at a time when rivals thought they were getting a decent deal using Dutch wholesalers selling at \u00a322,500 a kilo. The Albanians lowered the price of cocaine \u2013 and increased its purity. More massive consignments were brought into the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1622757b3858132744c4331ab92b28ff5790e124\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1622757b3858132744c4331ab92b28ff5790e124/269_0_2120_1272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Hellbanianz\u2019s slickly made drill rap videos, set on the Gascoigne estate in Barking, east London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Hellbanianz\u2019s slickly made drill rap videos, set on the Gascoigne estate in Barking, east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony Saggers, the former head of drugs threat and intelligence at the National Crime Agency, who has spent 30 years analysing the rhythms of the global narcotics economy, said: \u201cWhat they have done very intelligently is say: \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got these margins to play with and we\u2019re going to give a good slice of that to the customer.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Albanian effect has profoundly shaped the use, production and economy of cocaine. The drug is at its cheapest in the UK since 1990 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/07/purity-of-cocaine-in-europe-at-highest-level-in-decade-report-finds\" title=\"\">purer than it has been for a decade</a>, which has caused record fatalities. The UK has the highest number of young users in Europe. More broadly, far bigger and more frequent shipments of the drug have been seized entering the UK as cocaine production in south America has hit record levels - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/19/colombia-cocaine-production-breaks-record\" title=\"\">up 31% on 2016</a>.</p> <p>Rivals to the Albanian gangs like Hellbanianz initially struggled to compete because they had an inferior, more expensive product. Their only option has been to buy cocaine sourced from the Mafia Shqiptare.</p> <p>Saggers said: \u201cThey have shown that you don\u2019t have to be greedy to dominate drug markets. They\u2019ve gone down the route of sustainable prices, good quality.\u201d</p> <p>Mohammed Qasim, a research fellow at Leeds Beckett University who studys drug dealers, described the Albanian business approach as \u201cfantastic\u201d, adding: \u201cIf they were on <em>Dragon\u2019s Den</em> with this model, all the dragons would be giving them money.\u201d</p> <p>Yet for the Albanians\u2019 model to truly work it required control of Europe\u2019s ports. For that the Mafia Shqiptare needed to collaborate with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/ndrangheta-mafia-mcdonalds-deutsche-bank-study\" title=\"\">\u2018Ndrangheta, the most powerful and globalised of the Italian mafias</a>, which controls mainland Europe\u2019s cocaine trade.</p> <p>There is considerable evidence that not only are the Albanians working with the \u2018Ndrangheta, but that they have formed the tightest of alliances. Sources say the Italian mafia consider the Albanians as equals. Saggers said: \u201cThere\u2019s a strong Italian-organised mafia link with Albanians now, Albanians are working with them \u2013 not in competition with them. Plus, historically, the Italians have good contacts in Latin America.\u201d</p> <p>Rotterdam in the Netherlands is Europe\u2019s largest seaport, with eight million containers passing through each year. Many arrive via the direct \u201cColombian express\u201d route before crossing to Harwich in Essex or Hull.</p> <p>The second busiest European port is Antwerp in Belgium, which connects to the Thames port of Tilbury, 15 miles from Hellbanianz territory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fbd3a107d00dd5f3e5a4433be54704c29562fccb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd3a107d00dd5f3e5a4433be54704c29562fccb/0_121_4116_2470/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seizures of cocaine have risen as the drug has flooded into the UK in recent years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seizures of cocaine have risen as the drug has flooded into the UK in recent years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Collectively, the Belgian and Dutch ports employ 240,000 people, a cohort of whom, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/cocaine-smuggling-is-corrupting-antwerp-politics-says-mayor\" title=\"\">police intelligence indicates</a>, work for the \u2018Ndrangheta and Mafia Shqiptare.</p> <p>\u201cThis gives the Albanians based on the near continent, direct access and control of it [cocaine] at the ports,\u201d said Saggers.</p> <p>An NCA source described Belgium and the Netherlands as \u201ckey nexus points of consolidation and onward trafficking of illicit commodities\u201d and confirmed Albanian groups were \u201cexpanding their influence upstream\u201d \u2013 police-speak for strengthening their grip on international cocaine supply.</p> <p>Anna Sergi, a lecturer in criminology at the University of Essex who specialises in mafia relationships, confirmed Albanians and the southern Italian crime group have joined forces. \u201cWhenever the \u2018Ndrangheta is shipping things over, they work a lot with the Albanians,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Last month <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46452934\" title=\"\">Operation Pollino</a>, named after the area of southern Italy where the \u2018Ndrangheta has its roots, arrested 90 suspects. Anti-mafia prosecutors described how the \u2018Ndrangheta relied on \u201cpermanent groups working in ports and harbours\u201d along with Albanian criminal networks.</p> <p>In 2017 an Albanian cocaine dealer was caught at a London petrol station with false Italian identification documents on his car and two kilos of the drug hidden in its boot.</p> <p>The most vulnerable point for drug smugglers is the port of entry. Security is tight, options are finite. Sources say that the \u2018Ndrangheta has outsourced this element of the supply chain to the Albanians.</p> <p>\u201cYou need the best people to get it out of port. If you are good at moving things then you stay ahead of your competitors \u2013 and the Albanians are good at this,\u201d said Sergi.</p> <p>Yet even the most senior Albanians are caught sometimes. Klodjan Copja, 30, who ran a \u00a360m cocaine imports syndicate, was jailed in 2017 after his couriers were intercepted meeting drug-laden lorries arriving in Kent.</p> <p>One striking facet of what the NCA term the Albanians\u2019 \u201cincreasing prominence\u201d is their having \u2013 so far \u2013 avoided becoming embroiled in tit-for-tat feuds with rivals. The latest UK criminal threat assessment says that the Albanians are unusually skilled at developing relationships and \u201cforging links with other OCGs [organised criminal gangs]\u201d.</p> <p>Such relationship-building has left Liverpool as the only part of England not routinely selling Albanian-sourced cocaine. Not only has the Merseyside port its own direct access to South America, Saggers says that its turf is jealously guarded by the city\u2019s own criminal gangs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f14fc20a074c43cc250333cce374988bb298bdd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f14fc20a074c43cc250333cce374988bb298bdd3/357_0_2643_1586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Cocaine grower in Colombia.

Saggers says the backdrop of the Kosovo conflict has given them a swagger comparable to that of Irish criminals during and after the Troubles.</p> <p>\u201cThey are quite charismatic and known to prioritise relationship-building rather than competitive feuds.

      "bodyText": "Something had kicked off the night before and the guys on the corner were keen to offer advice. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be hanging around here too long,\u201d one said, refusing to elaborate. They were standing near Crispe house, a tower block on east London\u2019s Gascoigne estate, undisputed territory of Hellbanianz. The gang, an Albanian street crew of drug dealers, is known locally for its violence and more widely for a social media output featuring Ferraris, wads of \u00a350 notes and gold Rolex watches to help enhance its reputation and recruit \u201cyoungers\u201d. The Gascoigne estate, built in the 1960s and occupying land that slopes south of Barking town centre to the Thames, is its historical home turf. It was getting dark, another two men appeared and, when asked if they were Hellbanianz, one said: \u201cYou should go.\u201d The Observer was escorted off the estate and told not to return. Hellbanianz belong to the \u201cretail game\u201d of the cocaine trade. They are the street dealers and enforcers of the Mafia Shqiptare, the Albanian organised criminal syndicates who, the National Crime Agency believe, are consolidating power within the UK criminal underworld and on their way to a near total takeover of the UK\u2019s \u00a35bn cocaine market. The gang\u2019s glossily produced trap music videos remind viewers \u201cHB are ready for violence\u201d and that they possess the requisite manpower and firearms. Yet, police sources say, Hellbanianz occupy the lowest rung of the Albanian mafia. To better understand the Albanians\u2019 remarkable rise in the UK one might climb to the 12th floor of the Gascoigne estate\u2019s high-rise blocks. From there, the skyline of London, where much of their cocaine will be snorted, stretches west. In the opposite direction, several miles along the Thames, lie the mammoth container ports where their cocaine is offloaded in multi-kilo shipments. But it is across the Atlantic, to the jungles of Latin America, where the story of the Mafia Shqiptare starts. How Albanians came to conquer the UK\u2019s cocaine market is a lesson in criminal savvy; the value of making friends with the world\u2019s most dangerous mafias; and the absolute threat of violence. It began with a business model that was simple in concept, but sufficiently bold to subvert the existing order. For years cocaine\u2019s international importers worked separately from its wholesalers and the gangs. Pricing structure varied, depending on the drug\u2019s purity; the higher it was, the more it cost. The Albanians ditched the entire model. They began negotiating directly with the Colombian cartels who control coca production. Huge shipments were arranged direct from South America. Supply chains were kept in-house. Intelligence obtained by British experts revealed that the Albanians were procuring cocaine from the cartels for about \u00a34,000 to \u00a35,500 a kilo, at a time when rivals thought they were getting a decent deal using Dutch wholesalers selling at \u00a322,500 a kilo. The Albanians lowered the price of cocaine \u2013 and increased its purity. More massive consignments were brought into the UK. Tony Saggers, the former head of drugs threat and intelligence at the National Crime Agency, who has spent 30 years analysing the rhythms of the global narcotics economy, said: \u201cWhat they have done very intelligently is say: \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got these margins to play with and we\u2019re going to give a good slice of that to the customer.\u2019\u201d The Albanian effect has profoundly shaped the use, production and economy of cocaine. The drug is at its cheapest in the UK since 1990 and purer than it has been for a decade, which has caused record fatalities. The UK has the highest number of young users in Europe. More broadly, far bigger and more frequent shipments of the drug have been seized entering the UK as cocaine production in south America has hit record levels - up 31% on 2016. Rivals to the Albanian gangs like Hellbanianz initially struggled to compete because they had an inferior, more expensive product. Their only option has been to buy cocaine sourced from the Mafia Shqiptare. Saggers said: \u201cThey have shown that you don\u2019t have to be greedy to dominate drug markets. They\u2019ve gone down the route of sustainable prices, good quality.\u201d Mohammed Qasim, a research fellow at Leeds Beckett University who studys drug dealers, described the Albanian business approach as \u201cfantastic\u201d, adding: \u201cIf they were on Dragon\u2019s Den with this model, all the dragons would be giving them money.\u201d Yet for the Albanians\u2019 model to truly work it required control of Europe\u2019s ports. For that the Mafia Shqiptare needed to collaborate with the \u2018Ndrangheta, the most powerful and globalised of the Italian mafias, which controls mainland Europe\u2019s cocaine trade. There is considerable evidence that not only are the Albanians working with the \u2018Ndrangheta, but that they have formed the tightest of alliances. Sources say the Italian mafia consider the Albanians as equals. Saggers said: \u201cThere\u2019s a strong Italian-organised mafia link with Albanians now, Albanians are working with them \u2013 not in competition with them. Plus, historically, the Italians have good contacts in Latin America.\u201d Rotterdam in the Netherlands is Europe\u2019s largest seaport, with eight million containers passing through each year. Many arrive via the direct \u201cColombian express\u201d route before crossing to Harwich in Essex or Hull. The second busiest European port is Antwerp in Belgium, which connects to the Thames port of Tilbury, 15 miles from Hellbanianz territory. Collectively, the Belgian and Dutch ports employ 240,000 people, a cohort of whom, police intelligence indicates, work for the \u2018Ndrangheta and Mafia Shqiptare. \u201cThis gives the Albanians based on the near continent, direct access and control of it [cocaine] at the ports,\u201d said Saggers. An NCA source described Belgium and the Netherlands as \u201ckey nexus points of consolidation and onward trafficking of illicit commodities\u201d and confirmed Albanian groups were \u201cexpanding their influence upstream\u201d \u2013 police-speak for strengthening their grip on international cocaine supply. Anna Sergi, a lecturer in criminology at the University of Essex who specialises in mafia relationships, confirmed Albanians and the southern Italian crime group have joined forces. \u201cWhenever the \u2018Ndrangheta is shipping things over, they work a lot with the Albanians,\u201d she said. Last month Operation Pollino, named after the area of southern Italy where the \u2018Ndrangheta has its roots, arrested 90 suspects. Anti-mafia prosecutors described how the \u2018Ndrangheta relied on \u201cpermanent groups working in ports and harbours\u201d along with Albanian criminal networks. In 2017 an Albanian cocaine dealer was caught at a London petrol station with false Italian identification documents on his car and two kilos of the drug hidden in its boot. The most vulnerable point for drug smugglers is the port of entry. Security is tight, options are finite. Sources say that the \u2018Ndrangheta has outsourced this element of the supply chain to the Albanians. \u201cYou need the best people to get it out of port. If you are good at moving things then you stay ahead of your competitors \u2013 and the Albanians are good at this,\u201d said Sergi. Yet even the most senior Albanians are caught sometimes. Klodjan Copja, 30, who ran a \u00a360m cocaine imports syndicate, was jailed in 2017 after his couriers were intercepted meeting drug-laden lorries arriving in Kent. One striking facet of what the NCA term the Albanians\u2019 \u201cincreasing prominence\u201d is their having \u2013 so far \u2013 avoided becoming embroiled in tit-for-tat feuds with rivals. The latest UK criminal threat assessment says that the Albanians are unusually skilled at developing relationships and \u201cforging links with other OCGs [organised criminal gangs]\u201d. Such relationship-building has left Liverpool as the only part of England not routinely selling Albanian-sourced cocaine. Not only has the Merseyside port its own direct access to South America, Saggers says that its turf is jealously guarded by the city\u2019s own criminal gangs. Also working in the Albanians\u2019 favour is their reputation for violence. Saggers says the backdrop of the Kosovo conflict has given them a swagger comparable to that of Irish criminals during and after the Troubles. \u201cThey are quite charismatic and known to prioritise relationship-building rather than competitive feuds. Also, when you come from a country where there\u2019s been conflict and you have a reputation for ruthlessness the charisma is underlined with an element of \u2018actually, we do need to get on with these people\u2019,\u201d he said. Qasim also points to how the Albanian are regarded in criminal circles. \u201cThey are sophisticated, professional and they do what they promise. They always deliver,\u201d he said. This has much to do with the Albanian code of besa \u2013 \u201cto keep the promise\u201d \u2013 but Sergi adds that the reputation of the Mafia Shqiptare must also be viewed through the ancestral code of kanun, the right to take revenge: that blood must pay with blood. \u201cYou most trust the ones similar to you,\u201d she said. The concept was meant to keep things internal, close. Then the younger generation began making flashy videos and waving money around, and along came Hellbanianz. The Gascoigne estate is bordered on its south and west by the A13 and the North Circular roads, urban bulwarks against neighbouring gangs such as Newham\u2019s Beckton Black Squad. In the mid-1990s the estate was run by white working-class crime families. \u201cIf you were black and went there you\u2019d come out in an ambulance,\u201d said David, a former resident. Deprivation and drugs blighted the estate long before a Jamaican gang run by Delroy \u201cthe King\u201d Lewis started a ruthlessly efficient 24-hour operation on the estate, selling crack cocaine and heroin. Lewis was jailed in 2004 at a time when the estate\u2019s Albanian population was growing through a new refugee crisis following fresh unrest in Kosovo, five years after the war there brought the first arrivals. By the time of the 2011 census, Albanian was the second language on the estate. Soon after, Hellbanianz took over. Rookwood House, a five-minute walk from Barking Abbey, became their notional headquarters. Linked by interlocking walkways and limited access points, the tower block was easy to defend from police and rivals. It was seen in the video for Hellbanianz\u2019s trap track Hood Life. But five months ago Rookwood House was knocked down as part of a sweeping regeneration project. Locals say Hellbanianz has moved operations north, to a prime spot near the Kings Lounge pub. \u201cThey gather at 9pm, same faces, same lot,\u201d one said. Some might recognise the faces from YouTube where Hellbanianz posts footage to try to lure \u201cfalcons\u201d \u2013 fresh recruits - with shots of scantily clad women, wheel-spinning Bentleys and the ubiquitious wads of money. Saggers said: \u201cThe retail market is the get-rich-quick environment. If they\u2019re importing kilos for a few thousand dollars, imagine how much money those youngsters are turning over if they\u2019re selling at \u00a340 a gram?\u201d Before its account was closed in November, Hellbanianz had 115,000 Instagram followers.

      "body": "<p>As the wrangling over how Britain should leave the EU reaches fever pitch, one country is already experiencing a Brexit dividend: Bulgaria.</p> <p>Resorts in the south-eastern European country have seen a surge in bookings from British holidaymakers as families seek out alternative summer destinations.</p> <p>Traditionally popular tourist spots in the eurozone have become pricier as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/mar/27/how-to-plan-a-post-brexit-holiday-from-serbia-to-the-lake-district\" title=\"\">pound has slumped against the euro</a> since the vote to leave the EU in 2016. Now families are taking action to guard against future fluctuations in the event of no deal.</p> <p>During the busiest holiday booking period of the year, travel agents report that more people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/12/brexit-effect-sterling-holidays-cost\" title=\"\">opting for all-inclusive deals</a>, in effect locking in costs for food, drink and accommodation.</p> <p>Banks currently give about \u20ac1.11 to the pound, a sharp drop from just before the referendum, when \u00a31 bought \u20ac1.30. In December, travellers at some UK airports were receiving only \u20ac0.90 for every \u00a31 they changed as Brexit turmoil pushed sterling to fresh lows. Expectations are that a no-deal will result in a further drop in the value of sterling, making this summer even more expensive for anyone travelling to Europe.</p> <p>But Bulgaria, a low-cost destination for both sun and skiing holidays, has seen the benefit of the currency uncertainty. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said there had been an increase of almost one third in the number of holiday bookings to the country this year compared with 2018, when there had already been a rise on the previous year.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are looking at different destinations and the length of time that they go in order to make sure that they can get the best value for money when they are being increasingly cost-conscious,\u201d said Abta. </p> <p>Dire warnings have been made about what would happen to sterling on the currency markets under a no-deal. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said last summer that it was likely there would be a drop in value, while the Bank of England said in November that a disorderly exit from the EU could result in a fall of 25% \u2013 lowering the pound to below parity with the dollar.</p> <p>Last weekend was one of the busiest periods of the year for travel agents as people sought to offset the January blues by booking a summer holiday. Travel agents reported strong sales despite the Brexit uncertainty, with travel firm Tui saying summer 2019 was ahead of last year.</p> <p>But if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal the outlook could change.</p> <p>For example, the consumer group Which? has warned that, even if people have bought and paid for their holiday already, they are not fully protected from price increases that may come into effect in the case of a no-deal. Holiday companies have the right to raise the price of a holiday by up to 8% if they incur additional costs as a result of new taxes and fees imposed by third parties, it said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond the currency fluctuations, a no-deal could result in a series of administrative headaches for travellers. Abta has warned that UK-issued European health insurance cards, which allow EU citizens access to state healthcare in other EU countries, would no longer be valid. Drivers may need to apply for an international driving permit and also carry a physical card issued by their insurance company to show their cover is applicable while abroad.</p> <p>There would also probably be changes to the documents and health checks required for pets. Rules around roaming for mobile phones would probably change, although some companies have said they will continue to offer the same prices after a no-deal.</p> <p>Insecurity around the future of Brexit has also affected the housing market, with sellers and buyers sitting tight because of the uncertainty over the future. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last month reported that the market was at its weakest level in more than six years.</p> <p>David Hollingworth of mortgage brokers London &amp; Country said the uncertainty had contributed to the slow market and that it was unlikely to change now that the new year was here, as people adopt a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the wrangling over how Britain should leave the EU reaches fever pitch, one country is already experiencing a Brexit dividend: Bulgaria. Resorts in the south-eastern European country have seen a surge in bookings from British holidaymakers as families seek out alternative summer destinations. Traditionally popular tourist spots in the eurozone have become pricier as the pound has slumped against the euro since the vote to leave the EU in 2016. Now families are taking action to guard against future fluctuations in the event of no deal. During the busiest holiday booking period of the year, travel agents report that more people are opting for all-inclusive deals, in effect locking in costs for food, drink and accommodation. Banks currently give about \u20ac1.11 to the pound, a sharp drop from just before the referendum, when \u00a31 bought \u20ac1.30. In December, travellers at some UK airports were receiving only \u20ac0.90 for every \u00a31 they changed as Brexit turmoil pushed sterling to fresh lows. Expectations are that a no-deal will result in a further drop in the value of sterling, making this summer even more expensive for anyone travelling to Europe. But Bulgaria, a low-cost destination for both sun and skiing holidays, has seen the benefit of the currency uncertainty. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said there had been an increase of almost one third in the number of holiday bookings to the country this year compared with 2018, when there had already been a rise on the previous year. \u201cPeople are looking at different destinations and the length of time that they go in order to make sure that they can get the best value for money when they are being increasingly cost-conscious,\u201d said Abta. Dire warnings have been made about what would happen to sterling on the currency markets under a no-deal. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said last summer that it was likely there would be a drop in value, while the Bank of England said in November that a disorderly exit from the EU could result in a fall of 25% \u2013 lowering the pound to below parity with the dollar. Last weekend was one of the busiest periods of the year for travel agents as people sought to offset the January blues by booking a summer holiday. Travel agents reported strong sales despite the Brexit uncertainty, with travel firm Tui saying summer 2019 was ahead of last year. But if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal the outlook could change. For example, the consumer group Which? has warned that, even if people have bought and paid for their holiday already, they are not fully protected from price increases that may come into effect in the case of a no-deal. Holiday companies have the right to raise the price of a holiday by up to 8% if they incur additional costs as a result of new taxes and fees imposed by third parties, it said. Beyond the currency fluctuations, a no-deal could result in a series of administrative headaches for travellers. Abta has warned that UK-issued European health insurance cards, which allow EU citizens access to state healthcare in other EU countries, would no longer be valid. Drivers may need to apply for an international driving permit and also carry a physical card issued by their insurance company to show their cover is applicable while abroad. There would also probably be changes to the documents and health checks required for pets. Rules around roaming for mobile phones would probably change, although some companies have said they will continue to offer the same prices after a no-deal. Insecurity around the future of Brexit has also affected the housing market, with sellers and buyers sitting tight because of the uncertainty over the future. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last month reported that the market was at its weakest level in more than six years. David Hollingworth of mortgage brokers London &amp; Country said the uncertainty had contributed to the slow market and that it was unlikely to change now that the new year was here, as people adopt a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach.",

      "body": "<p>New year, new regime. Radio 2 starts its big shake-up on 14 January, with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08h8z5t/episodes/player\" title=\"\">Zoe Ball</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b25n9h\" title=\"\">Sara Cox</a> sliding into their fresh weekday time slots of breakfast and drivetime respectively: expect tabloid coverage and on-air laffs. Radio 1\u2019s Charlie Sloth bowed out from the station in October, with the young yet experienced Tiffany Calver taking over his 9pm Saturday night <em>Rap Show</em> slot, and Rickie, Melvin and Charlie, ex-Kiss FM, due to start in his weekday evening <em>The 8th</em> slot soon. Calver had her first show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00012dh\" title=\"\">on 5 January</a>, so I\u2019ll review her in a couple of weeks; Rickie, Melvin and Charlie aren\u2019t on 1 for a while, but should be just the ticket.</p> <p>So shall we turn to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music\" title=\"\">6 Music</a>? All BBC national radio stations have been under pressure to change their rosters since Ofcom started overseeing the Beeb in 2017. It stated explicitly that the BBC should \u201creflect the diversity of the United Kingdom\u201d. Oops, thought Radios 2 and 6, as they looked at their weekday schedules, utterly dominated, as they were, by straight, white middle-aged men. Luckily for 6 Music, it already employed great women DJs, so it simply embarked on a game of musical chairs. Since last Monday, 6 Music weekdays offer <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00c000j\" title=\"\">Lauren Laverne</a> </strong>at breakfast, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0001yyb\" title=\"\">Mary Anne Hobbs</a></strong> from 10.30am-1pm, and Shaun Keavenyin the afternoons.</p> <p>And off we go\u2026 To launch the new schedule, the 6 Music marketing bods came up with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06x6msl\" title=\"\">Hello Music Lover</a> as a hashtag. A little naff, perhaps, but Laverne\u2019s show certainly lived up to the label. Always one of the most wide-ranging of 6\u2019s curators, her new breakfast show skipped from soul to strange electronica to Shirley Bassey. There was an up-and-at-em feel. (On Tuesday, she played Deee-Lite\u2019s Groove Is in the Heart, followed by Planningtorock\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7u8nUFH6C0\" title=\"\">Beulah Loves Dancing</a>, and then the Roots and J Dilla, almost stopping me from taking my daughter to school.) Music absolutely dominated the early part of her shows, Laverne speaking only to introduce, back-announce and involve listeners through social media shout-outs. Essentially, from 7.30am to around 9, Laverne was busy playing killer track after killer track. In this first week, she managed to squeeze in 40ish tracks per show, 10 more than the breakfast show used to play. Excellent stuff.</p> <p>Later on, the show opened up, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fryrsquared?lang=en\" title=\"\">Dr Hannah Fry</a> talking science on Tuesday and listener Claire Marsden on Wednesday being the first phoner-in (on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurenlaverne/status/1082333728519663618\" title=\"\">the new Social Recall segment</a>). Live interviews - Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney, Steve Coogan \u2013 were handled with Laverne\u2019s usual light hand. It will be interesting to see if we hear more from Laverne herself as the show settles, but anyone looking for a reason to get up and jump around the kitchen has got themselves a new programme for sure.</p> <p>Hobbs, on straight afterwards, has made a bigger personal leap. Her previous weekend shows were eclectic, but with a slow, almost reverent, day-break atmosphere; and as a personality, she\u2019s naturally more serious. Can she do upbeat weekday mornings? On this week\u2019s evidence, definitely: she had a smile in her voice at all times and the interviews (a pre-recorded Idris Elba and Slowthai, possibly not done with Hobbs; Sharon Van Etten with her in the studio) were on the money. Hobbs occasionally needs to be less intimate with the mic, to turn it up a bit, but she\u2019s well on her way, and the music choices are exemplary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32525868647648119a3483f2398301ceacea5731\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32525868647648119a3483f2398301ceacea5731/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shaun Keaveny.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018freewheeling, offbeat\u2019 Shaun Keaveny.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leigh Keily/BBC/Leigh Keily</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0072l9k\" title=\"\">Shaun Keaveny</a></strong> is completely at home in his new afternoon slot.

      "bodyText": "New year, new regime. Radio 2 starts its big shake-up on 14 January, with Zoe Ball and Sara Cox sliding into their fresh weekday time slots of breakfast and drivetime respectively: expect tabloid coverage and on-air laffs. Radio 1\u2019s Charlie Sloth bowed out from the station in October, with the young yet experienced Tiffany Calver taking over his 9pm Saturday night Rap Show slot, and Rickie, Melvin and Charlie, ex-Kiss FM, due to start in his weekday evening The 8th slot soon. Calver had her first show on 5 January, so I\u2019ll review her in a couple of weeks; Rickie, Melvin and Charlie aren\u2019t on 1 for a while, but should be just the ticket. So shall we turn to 6 Music? All BBC national radio stations have been under pressure to change their rosters since Ofcom started overseeing the Beeb in 2017. It stated explicitly that the BBC should \u201creflect the diversity of the United Kingdom\u201d. Oops, thought Radios 2 and 6, as they looked at their weekday schedules, utterly dominated, as they were, by straight, white middle-aged men. Luckily for 6 Music, it already employed great women DJs, so it simply embarked on a game of musical chairs. Since last Monday, 6 Music weekdays offer Lauren Laverne at breakfast, Mary Anne Hobbs from 10.30am-1pm, and Shaun Keavenyin the afternoons. And off we go\u2026 To launch the new schedule, the 6 Music marketing bods came up with Hello Music Lover as a hashtag. A little naff, perhaps, but Laverne\u2019s show certainly lived up to the label. Always one of the most wide-ranging of 6\u2019s curators, her new breakfast show skipped from soul to strange electronica to Shirley Bassey. There was an up-and-at-em feel. (On Tuesday, she played Deee-Lite\u2019s Groove Is in the Heart, followed by Planningtorock\u2019s Beulah Loves Dancing, and then the Roots and J Dilla, almost stopping me from taking my daughter to school.) Music absolutely dominated the early part of her shows, Laverne speaking only to introduce, back-announce and involve listeners through social media shout-outs. Essentially, from 7.30am to around 9, Laverne was busy playing killer track after killer track. In this first week, she managed to squeeze in 40ish tracks per show, 10 more than the breakfast show used to play. Excellent stuff. Later on, the show opened up, with Dr Hannah Fry talking science on Tuesday and listener Claire Marsden on Wednesday being the first phoner-in (on the new Social Recall segment). Live interviews - Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney, Steve Coogan \u2013 were handled with Laverne\u2019s usual light hand. It will be interesting to see if we hear more from Laverne herself as the show settles, but anyone looking for a reason to get up and jump around the kitchen has got themselves a new programme for sure. Hobbs, on straight afterwards, has made a bigger personal leap. Her previous weekend shows were eclectic, but with a slow, almost reverent, day-break atmosphere; and as a personality, she\u2019s naturally more serious. Can she do upbeat weekday mornings? On this week\u2019s evidence, definitely: she had a smile in her voice at all times and the interviews (a pre-recorded Idris Elba and Slowthai, possibly not done with Hobbs; Sharon Van Etten with her in the studio) were on the money. Hobbs occasionally needs to be less intimate with the mic, to turn it up a bit, but she\u2019s well on her way, and the music choices are exemplary. And Shaun Keaveny is completely at home in his new afternoon slot. Actually, it\u2019s as though he\u2019s always been there; his freewheeling, offbeat presentation style is great at this time. Matt Everett, Keaveny\u2019s long-time show-crony, provides a funny foil, and the whole effect is not so far off Radcliffe and Maconie when they first came to 6 Music, though it\u2019s wilder when it comes to presen tation and silly clips. There were those who found Keaveny too weird for breakfast (too many pauses, too much daftness). You have a feeling that they\u2019d enjoy his new slot: just the thing to get you through these dark January afternoons. Three shows about food The Food Chain This excellent World Service show examines the business, science and cultural significance of food and has loads of episodes. You could start with the celebrity ones (Madhur Jaffrey, Gordon Ramsay, Antonio Carluccio and, weirdly, Kelis all give you \u201cMy Life in Five Dishes\u201d), or go to the more interesting programmes about food banks, abattoirs, chewing gum and the food tasters whose tongues are insured for more than $1m.

Even more seldom do they squander it in the way Jeremy Corbyn has so far.</p> <p>Five weeks have passed since Theresa May postponed the parliamentary vote on her withdrawal deal. That\u2019s five valuable weeks during which MPs could have shaped what happens next. In fact, the only thing that has changed in that time is that May\u2019s chances of getting her deal through have increased. Her strategy is clear: to leave no deal, despite all its ruinous effects, on the table and let the clock run down until the only choice MPs face is a binary one between her deal and no deal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The truth is that Labour\u2019s current approach is just as irresponsible as the government\u2019s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The person with the greatest power to thwart May is Corbyn. In recent weeks, we have seen backbench leadership from both sides of the Commons, which, together with a Speaker who has championed the rights of MPs over the executive, has resulted in some important procedural wins in terms of how the next few weeks will unfold. But there remains no parliamentary majority in favour of any one option. While these procedural wins are not insignificant, they are not sufficient to push the government on to a different course. It is difficult to envisage how a group of cross-party MPs, led by backbenchers, could hold together a Commons majority outside the party system for the weeks, if not months, that would be required.</p> <p>This is why opposition leadership, in the face of a weak and divided cabinet, has never been so critical: the only way to force the government to change direction is through party leadership and whipping MPs behind an alternative position. Yet the truth is that Labour\u2019s current approach \u2013 that it wants a mandate via a general election to negotiate a better withdrawal deal \u2013 is just as irresponsible as the government\u2019s. There is no realistic route to a general election; May\u2019s DUP coalition partners and her Eurosceptic MPs may not support her deal, but neither will they vote to trigger a general election. The Labour leadership\u2019s pretence that they can negotiate a Brexit that maintains the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45640548\" title=\"\">exact same\u201d benefits of EU membership</a> while curtailing freedom of movement is sheer fantasy.</p> <p>Labour must move to support a referendum as soon as she loses the vote on her deal this week, if necessary via the no confidence vote it will surely lose. As we have long argued, a referendum on the deal versus the status quo is right in principle; the 2016 referendum provided a narrow mandate for the government to negotiate the best deal it could, not a blank cheque for it to take Britain out of the EU any way it saw fit, regardless of the costs. The withdrawal agreement that May has negotiated perfectly highlights the Brexit conundrum: there is no deal that lives up to the illusory unicorn the Leave campaign promised voters. There are painful trade-offs and it is up to voters to decide if they want to make them.</p> <p>Principle aside, a referendum is the only practical alternative Labour can swing behind. The gridlock in parliament only strengthens a pragmatic case for putting the deal to voters. A \u201cNorway plus\u201d Brexit, the other option being talked up, may be the best of all the Brexit options, but it involves Britain sacrificing any say over the rules of the club in which we will effectively remain a member. It will not settle the European question; if anything, having to live by rules set by Europe that we have no influence over will give succour to those Eurosceptics who will campaign to take us further out of Europe and will heighten public hostility to the EU. Moreover, it is difficult to see how Labour can ensure this outcome before Brexit happens on a practical level. Even if the political declaration were redrafted to indicate a Norway-style final destination, it would not be binding on any British prime minister.</p> <p>The longer Corbyn puts off backing a referendum, the more he creates the impression that he too is simply letting the clock run down in order to avoid making a decision, in the hope that voters will blame Conservatives for any Brexit fiasco. But if Labour enables May\u2019s Brexit, history will not forgive the party. Voters will rightly hold the whole political establishment accountable for a withdrawal deal that will inevitably make Britain into a rule-taker, jeopardise the union and make people poorer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition are engaged in a dangerous game of brinkmanship</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some have made the case that we should avoid another referendum as it will be divisive, but we should be wary of these arguments. There are indeed risks associated with another referendum, but every path facing Britain at this juncture involves considerable risk of popular backlash. Our political discourse has already deteriorated and a tiny minority with hateful views has become emboldened to the extent that MPs going about their daily jobs now get intimidated, harassed and called \u201cNazi\u201d by thugs in the street.</p> <p>But what sort of response is it for a cabinet minister to warn MPs they must back the prime minister or risk unleashing a wave of neo-Nazi extremism, as <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6583091/Ministers-grave-warning-poll-shows-Tory-voters-support-PMs-deal-Brussels.html\" title=\"\">Chris Grayling</a> did? Since when has it been acceptable for the government to imply extremist violence is an effective way to bring about change, by publicly telling MPs they should vote out of fear of neo-Nazis rather than based on what is right for their constituents? Grayling\u2019s insinuation that Britain cannot bear another referendum without descending into civil conflict is irresponsible and patronising.</p> <p>Both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition are engaged in a dangerous game of brinkmanship. The longer it goes on, the more certain its conclusion becomes: a Brexit that could split the union and sharpen the inequalities and resentments between the richest and poorest parts of the country. Corbyn faces a choice: he can help prevent it or he can go down in history as having been entirely complicit in making this tragedy happen.</p>",

This is why opposition leadership, in the face of a weak and divided cabinet, has never been so critical: the only way to force the government to change direction is through party leadership and whipping MPs behind an alternative position. Yet the truth is that Labour\u2019s current approach \u2013 that it wants a mandate via a general election to negotiate a better withdrawal deal \u2013 is just as irresponsible as the government\u2019s. There is no realistic route to a general election; May\u2019s DUP coalition partners and her Eurosceptic MPs may not support her deal, but neither will they vote to trigger a general election. The Labour leadership\u2019s pretence that they can negotiate a Brexit that maintains the \u201cexact same\u201d benefits of EU membership while curtailing freedom of movement is sheer fantasy. Labour must move to support a referendum as soon as she loses the vote on her deal this week, if necessary via the no confidence vote it will surely lose. As we have long argued, a referendum on the deal versus the status quo is right in principle; the 2016 referendum provided a narrow mandate for the government to negotiate the best deal it could, not a blank cheque for it to take Britain out of the EU any way it saw fit, regardless of the costs. The withdrawal agreement that May has negotiated perfectly highlights the Brexit conundrum: there is no deal that lives up to the illusory unicorn the Leave campaign promised voters. There are painful trade-offs and it is up to voters to decide if they want to make them. Principle aside, a referendum is the only practical alternative Labour can swing behind. The gridlock in parliament only strengthens a pragmatic case for putting the deal to voters. A \u201cNorway plus\u201d Brexit, the other option being talked up, may be the best of all the Brexit options, but it involves Britain sacrificing any say over the rules of the club in which we will effectively remain a member. It will not settle the European question; if anything, having to live by rules set by Europe that we have no influence over will give succour to those Eurosceptics who will campaign to take us further out of Europe and will heighten public hostility to the EU. Moreover, it is difficult to see how Labour can ensure this outcome before Brexit happens on a practical level. Even if the political declaration were redrafted to indicate a Norway-style final destination, it would not be binding on any British prime minister. The longer Corbyn puts off backing a referendum, the more he creates the impression that he too is simply letting the clock run down in order to avoid making a decision, in the hope that voters will blame Conservatives for any Brexit fiasco. But if Labour enables May\u2019s Brexit, history will not forgive the party. Voters will rightly hold the whole political establishment accountable for a withdrawal deal that will inevitably make Britain into a rule-taker, jeopardise the union and make people poorer. Some have made the case that we should avoid another referendum as it will be divisive, but we should be wary of these arguments. There are indeed risks associated with another referendum, but every path facing Britain at this juncture involves considerable risk of popular backlash. Our political discourse has already deteriorated and a tiny minority with hateful views has become emboldened to the extent that MPs going about their daily jobs now get intimidated, harassed and called \u201cNazi\u201d by thugs in the street. But what sort of response is it for a cabinet minister to warn MPs they must back the prime minister or risk unleashing a wave of neo-Nazi extremism, as Chris Grayling did? Since when has it been acceptable for the government to imply extremist violence is an effective way to bring about change, by publicly telling MPs they should vote out of fear of neo-Nazis rather than based on what is right for their constituents? Grayling\u2019s insinuation that Britain cannot bear another referendum without descending into civil conflict is irresponsible and patronising. Both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition are engaged in a dangerous game of brinkmanship. The longer it goes on, the more certain its conclusion becomes: a Brexit that could split the union and sharpen the inequalities and resentments between the richest and poorest parts of the country. Corbyn faces a choice: he can help prevent it or he can go down in history as having been entirely complicit in making this tragedy happen.",

      "body": "<p>Towards the end of the Channel 4 drama <em>Brexit: The Uncivil War</em> which was broadcast last Monday evening, the leaders of the rival Remain and Leave campaigns meet in a central London bar. By coincidence Craig Oliver, David Cameron\u2019s then director of communications, and Dominic Cummings, director of Vote Leave and inventor of the slogan \u201ctake back control\u201d, spot one another across platforms at Moorgate tube station. They had regular rows when they worked as Tory advisers before the campaign began and have been at daggers drawn throughout it. But both are physically and emotionally exhausted as voting day approaches and \u2013 in an encounter Oliver has insisted was fictional \u2013 they agree to talk over a pint.</p> <p>It is shortly after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a right-wing extremist in her West Yorkshire constituency. Oliver clearly feels things are slipping away from Remain. Sitting opposite his foe, the look on his face betrays his grim and growing realisation that Cummings is winning the war and heading for a stunning victory with unimaginable consequences for the country \u2013 albeit, he feels, by employing the basest of campaigning methods.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeding a toxic culture where the very notion of evidence-based truth is dead, where one side never believes the other, no one listens any more, we just yell,\u201d Oliver says. Twitching a little, Cummings replies that Leave \u201chad to yell, to be heard\u201d and adds that the binary \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d question on which the British people would vote within days was always going to force people \u201cinto tribes\u201d.</p> <p>Oliver then says his greatest fear is that the tribal divisions which the campaign has already established will become permanent. \u201cI worry it won\u2019t heal.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, before that broadcast, ugly scenes \u2013 of exactly the kind to which Oliver had alluded in the film \u2013 were playing out outside the House of Commons. And, in this case, they were all too real.</p> <p>Anna Soubry, the Tory MP and Remain campaigner, was mobbed by far-right pro-Brexit campaigners who yelled that she was a \u201cNazi\u201d, a \u201ctraitor\u201d and a \u201cfascist\u201d. The indomitable Soubry was shaken by the hostility that Brexit had fostered. In the House of Commons there were calls for the police to do more to protect MPs caught up in the feverish atmosphere created by Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf313155e9c999ea62568e25d338d849c8c52b66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf313155e9c999ea62568e25d338d849c8c52b66/0_77_3146_1889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Soubry, Femi Oluwole, James Goddard and others\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Soubry and pro-EU activist Femi Oluwole are surrounded by pro-Brexit supporters including James Goddard, far left, who was later arrested.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Cracknell/LNP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two days later Soubry was equally horrified when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCKbkt9pock\" title=\"\">the outspoken columnist Brendan O\u2019Neill mocked a fellow MP </a>for invoking the memory of Cox during a podcast in which they all took part. \u201cI was on [this Sky News podcast] with [Labour MP] Jess Phillips discussing the problem of how to get women into public life \u2013 which is very real, a hugely important subject \u2013 and Jess mentioned Jo Cox,\u201d Soubry tells the <em>Observer</em> after the incident. \u201cAnd then this deeply offensive man \u2013 who if they had told me beforehand was on it, I wouldn\u2019t have gone on, so I was already cross \u2013 he said: \u2018Oh, to use a murder for political purpose\u2019. And I lost it.</p> <p>\u201cHow dare he? We are talking about something that actually happened. It was clearly linked to the far right, which some of these people who are roaming outside parliament are, and he kept belittling it. This is a very present threat. It is not protest \u2013 they are thugs.\u201d</p> <p>It was not just outside parliament that democracy had gone awry and turned sour. On Wednesday in the House of Commons \u2013 totally deadlocked on Brexit with just over two months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU \u2013 there was constitutional uproar.</p> <p>The speaker John Bercow had controversially allowed an amendment that will force Theresa May to come up with a Brexit Plan B within three days if the prime minister\u2019s crucial meaningful vote is lost on Tuesday. On the government front bench five cabinet ministers, including May, Julian Smith, the chief whip, and the leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, sat shaking their heads in fury at Bercow.</p> <p>Pro-Brexit MPs shouted about \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d and claimed Bercow was biased. One Labour MP observed later that \u201canarchy had spread from outside to inside the mother of parliaments\u201d. Rather than parliament \u201ctaking back control\u201d \u2013 which was what Brexiters had insisted Brexit was really about \u2013 it seemed to have completely lost it.</p> <p>When Cameron announced in January 2013 that the British people would be able to vote in a referendum on whether the UK should stay in or leave the European Union he assumed this great exercise in democracy would settle the decades-old argument for good.</p> <p>\u201cIt is time for the British people to have their say,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt is time to settle this European question in British politics.\u201d Many predictions by politicians and commentators over recent years have proved wildly wide of the mark, but none, perhaps, more so than this. This weekend, two and a half years after the UK voted narrowly to leave the EU, and as Tuesday\u2019s crucial vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal approaches, nothing is settled at all. Divisions in Westminster and the country are deeper, wider, and more visceral than ever. Our parliament, to which Brexiters want to return sovereignty, is gridlocked and unruly to the point of paralysis. At the point when its decisions are most urgently needed, it is unable to agree on a way forward.</p> <p>\u201cThe political bubble has never been polarised like this before,\u201d says Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative former minister, father of the House of Commons and a lifetime pro-European. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy ... a parody of democracy.\u201d </p> <p>With May facing seemingly inevitable defeat this week, Clarke, who will retire at the next election after more than five decades at the forefront of politics, cannot see a way out of an interminable mess he never imagined could develop, and fears things will get worse before they get better.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Some people roaming outside are clearly linked to the far right. It isn't protest \u2013 they are thugs</p> <footer> <cite>Anna Soubry MP</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From his lofty position as parliament\u2019s wise old man he is also scornful of the prime minister. \u201cIt was always the plan of government to lose this first vote [on Tuesday] and then raise the Project Fear stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what do we do if [May] gets up in front of the House again and says: \u2018The sky will fall in if we don\u2019t vote for this deal\u2019 and all this crap? If she comes out and says there is no deal now, she will have a lot of ministerial resignations and I don\u2019t quite know what will happen then.\u201d </p> <p>On his office wall Clarke, a survivor of European arguments that scarred, and in the end did for, the premierships of Margaret Thatcher and John Major as well as Cameron, has a framed copy of a 2017 front page in which he and 14 colleagues were notoriously branded Brexit mutineers. He considers it a reminder to keep going. But he fears the current prime minister simply has no idea where she is going. \u201cThe key events now are: what is Theresa May\u2019s reaction to this three-day deadline she\u2019s got?,\u201d he asks. \u201cWill she actually tell anybody what her Plan B is, beyond her rather lightweight entourage? I would be faintly appalled if I learned she wasn\u2019t even turning her mind on what to do.\u201d</p> <p>When Soubry reflects on the wider politics and the impact on her party she, too, is scathing about May and says she has never known times so uncertain and turbulent. \u201cIt is an utterly remarkable time,\u201d she says. She believes the prime minister is trying to force her deal through the house despite the huge risk of ending up with a no-deal Brexit that many in her own cabinet have admitted would be economically catastrophic. It is a kind of political suicide mission. \u201cHer tactics are to run the clock down deliberately,\u201d Soubry says. \u201cI think she\u2019s prepared to crash out without a deal.\u201d</p> <p>But would that not spell the end of the Conservative party, and disaster for the country with it? \u201cI agree, but she\u2019s prepared to do it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>There is one thing, however, that has brought together MPs on all sides of the Brexit divide \u2013 even Soubry and May. She reveals that the prime minister \u2013 \u201cwho I have no relationship with\u201d \u2013 sent her a handwritten letter about the abuse against her outside the Commons.</p> <p>\u201cDear Anna,\u201d it reads, \u201cI hoped to see you in the House today, but I wanted to write and say how sorry I was to see the treatment you received near parliament yesterday. That was appalling and no one should be subject to such abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Soubry continues to read aloud. \u201cWe all know there are differing views, often very strongly held on the European issue, but everyone should be able to put their views without the risk of intimidation and abuse. I know you are a robust person, but incidents like this are unsettling and I\u2019m sorry you were subject to such behaviour. Yours ever, Theresa.\u201d</p> <p>Despite such occasional shows of solidarity between opposing sides in parliament, arguments over Brexit are all that newer MPs have known during their times as parliamentarians. Layla Moran, the first ethnic minority Liberal Democrat MP, who has been serving the voters of Oxford west and Abingdon since 2017 and is pushing hard for a second referendum, says she\u2019s exhausted by it all and now regards it as the norm.</p> <p>For her there is no respite and the fear of what may lurk outside the safe interior of the Palace of Westminster is ever present. \u201cWe\u2019re in the situation where we\u2019re all in campaign mode,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been on the precipice of a general election for the whole time I\u2019ve been an MP; we know we\u2019re in the middle of a moment of history that will be written about, but not knowing what happens next is making it really tense and emotional.\u201d She fears for her safety and that of others. \u201cThey\u2019re bruisy men out there. You\u2019d cross the road at night if you saw them.\u201d</p> <p>Outside parliament the yelling from both sides of the Brexit argument continues. In recent weeks dozens have lined up with banners, flags and placards by mid-afternoon every day. The activity ramped up in the weeks before Christmas. \u201cThat\u2019s when the yellow jacket lot first came,\u201d confirms a policeman outside Black Rod\u2019s garden last week.</p> <p>Has it made his job much harder? \u201cWell it\u2019s not got easier,\u201d he sighs in the cold. Behind him, and dotted in pairs across Westminster, at almost every entrance and gate, are police armed with machine guns.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I can't understand why people want it. We all have phones. We're all connected and have friends and family all over the world</p> <footer> <cite>Andy Curzon, engineer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Andy Curzon, an engineer from Manchester, finds it \u201ccrazy that many people, including MPs, are incapable of understanding the basic facts of trade and that we\u2019re going to sever these links.\u201d</p> <p>He waves an EU flag next to a sign for passing cars that reads \u201cTOOT TO STOP BREXIT\u201d. Asked whether he has talked to any of the Leave protesters today, Curzon sighs. \u201cYou try but ... nationalism now is just crackers \u2013 I can\u2019t understand why people want it. We all have phones. We\u2019re all connected and have friends and family all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>Two male Ukip protesters, who won\u2019t share their names, blame \u201cfake news\u201d, under which they classify all major media, with no exceptions. \u201cLeave means leave. We\u2019re not unreasonable,\u201d insists the younger man, dressed in a parka and blue jeans. He describes himself as \u201ca citizen journalist from southwest London\u201d. About the Soubry incident, he is flippant: \u201cThis is a Westminster bubble, that\u2019s how people talk in the pub. Get used to it. There is no such thing as hate speech, it\u2019s just different opinions. I find your paper offensive. I won\u2019t shut you down or get you arrested.\u201d</p> <p>On the street, the man still bellowing a full-throated \u201cout means out\u201d is enraged by a host of conspiracy theories he believes in. \u201cI find news the way I need to find it,\u201d he says when asked about his information. \u201cI research people that I get it off. If I can get it from a family member then that\u2019s it. If you were on my side, you\u2019d be doing all that.\u201d</p> <p>The country should prepare for riots, he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t expect the people to be law-abiding citizens when government is as corrupt as it is. All them people in here,\u201d he claims, \u201care getting paid backhanders all the way through the system.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfae50009ef0eec799339af11cb27638e4946ecf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfae50009ef0eec799339af11cb27638e4946ecf/173_81_3327_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former prime minister David Cameron took a gamble that backfired spectacularly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JASON LEE/POOL/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 23 June 2016 the British people voted by 51.9% to leave the EU and 48.1% to stay in. Cameron\u2019s gamble not only backfired by delivering a Brexit vote which forced his resignation and set the UK on a road out of the EU, but his hope that a referendum would lance the European boil has been exposed as appallingly misplaced \u2013 for the precise opposite has happened.</p> <p>The British public is now more divided, more aware and more conscious of who is on which side of the argument at the heart of British public life. Politicians, communities, families are \u2013 31 months on from the vote \u2013 unable to come together and seem largely immune to persuasion, unbiddable and unwilling to budge from entrenched positions. The country stands just 75 days away from the supposed moment of Brexit but with no national or political consensus over what Brexit should entail, or whether it should go ahead at all.</p> <p>Deadlock in parliament reflects division in the country. \u201cBrexit has paralysed the democratic system,\u201d says a senior Tory MP. \u201cAnd the really alarming thing is I cannot see how this does not endure for decades. We will all be defined as Remainers or Leavers for decades to come. This is not a passing argument. It really is close to civil war.\u201d</p> <p>Normal alliances have broken down, and parties have split many ways, raising questions about whether Brexit will deliver a new political alignment, in the form of new party in the centre and at the extremes. \u201cThe real legacy of Brexit could be a completely different British politics and party system,\u201d says a Labour frontbencher.</p> <p>Cameron\u2019s referendum has left the Conservative party split between hard Brexiters, soft Brexiters, and Remainers, while Labour, although its membership and supporters are overwhelmingly pro-Remain, has its own deep divides.</p> <p>Its leader Jeremy Corbyn seems unwilling to commit to what most of his party wants \u2013 a second referendum \u2013 because he is a lifelong Eurosceptic. Labour has staggered through the last two and half years with a policy of deliberate ambiguity in order to offend the fewest possible of its supporters.</p> <p>Outside the party system, there are two broad camps, fairly evenly split, if the polls are to be believed. On the one side are those who believe that because the country voted for Brexit it must go ahead with it \u2013 either because they think it is a good thing instrinsically or that not to do so would be dangerous for democracy, or both. In the other camp are those who believe that we should find a way out of activating Article 50 and stay in, perhaps by holding a second referendum with Remain on the ballot paper or by simply cancelling the whole project.</p> <p>Prominent supporters of both sides have been turning up the rhetoric before next week\u2019s vote in the hope of winning the day. Yesterday the pro-Brexit cabinet minister Chris Grayling said blocking Brexit could end the 350 years of \u201cmoderate\u201d politics that Britain has enjoyed since the English civil war. Last week leading businesses, including Jaguar, Land Rover and Ford, warned of job losses, while Greg Clark, the business secretary, said a no-deal Brexit would be economically \u201cdisastrous\u201d. This week, the Brexit saga and uncertainty will enter another phase.</p> <p>What will happen if May\u2019s deal is voted down \u2013 as it almost certainly will be \u2013 nobody knows. Downing Street is determined to press ahead with the vote, although it is aware that the prime minister is facing a massive defeat \u2013 another indication of how impossible her position has become. What then?</p> <p>\u201cWe could head for a no-deal Brexit, but Parliament voted last week to block that option off as it would be catastrophic,\u201d says a senior Tory MP. \u201cWe could have a second referendum to sort out the mess, but there is no sign of a parliamentary majority for that either. So God only knows.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the Commons the protests go on. \u201cThis is civil war without the muskets,\u201d says Helen Slater, who has come from Bristol to campaign. \u201cIt is appalling.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Towards the end of the Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War which was broadcast last Monday evening, the leaders of the rival Remain and Leave campaigns meet in a central London bar. By coincidence Craig Oliver, David Cameron\u2019s then director of communications, and Dominic Cummings, director of Vote Leave and inventor of the slogan \u201ctake back control\u201d, spot one another across platforms at Moorgate tube station. They had regular rows when they worked as Tory advisers before the campaign began and have been at daggers drawn throughout it. But both are physically and emotionally exhausted as voting day approaches and \u2013 in an encounter Oliver has insisted was fictional \u2013 they agree to talk over a pint. It is shortly after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a right-wing extremist in her West Yorkshire constituency. Oliver clearly feels things are slipping away from Remain. Sitting opposite his foe, the look on his face betrays his grim and growing realisation that Cummings is winning the war and heading for a stunning victory with unimaginable consequences for the country \u2013 albeit, he feels, by employing the basest of campaigning methods. \u201cYou\u2019re feeding a toxic culture where the very notion of evidence-based truth is dead, where one side never believes the other, no one listens any more, we just yell,\u201d Oliver says. Twitching a little, Cummings replies that Leave \u201chad to yell, to be heard\u201d and adds that the binary \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d question on which the British people would vote within days was always going to force people \u201cinto tribes\u201d. Oliver then says his greatest fear is that the tribal divisions which the campaign has already established will become permanent. \u201cI worry it won\u2019t heal.\u201d Earlier on Monday, before that broadcast, ugly scenes \u2013 of exactly the kind to which Oliver had alluded in the film \u2013 were playing out outside the House of Commons. And, in this case, they were all too real. Anna Soubry, the Tory MP and Remain campaigner, was mobbed by far-right pro-Brexit campaigners who yelled that she was a \u201cNazi\u201d, a \u201ctraitor\u201d and a \u201cfascist\u201d. The indomitable Soubry was shaken by the hostility that Brexit had fostered. In the House of Commons there were calls for the police to do more to protect MPs caught up in the feverish atmosphere created by Brexit. Two days later Soubry was equally horrified when the outspoken columnist Brendan O\u2019Neill mocked a fellow MP for invoking the memory of Cox during a podcast in which they all took part. \u201cI was on [this Sky News podcast] with [Labour MP] Jess Phillips discussing the problem of how to get women into public life \u2013 which is very real, a hugely important subject \u2013 and Jess mentioned Jo Cox,\u201d Soubry tells the Observer after the incident. \u201cAnd then this deeply offensive man \u2013 who if they had told me beforehand was on it, I wouldn\u2019t have gone on, so I was already cross \u2013 he said: \u2018Oh, to use a murder for political purpose\u2019. And I lost it. \u201cHow dare he? We are talking about something that actually happened. It was clearly linked to the far right, which some of these people who are roaming outside parliament are, and he kept belittling it. This is a very present threat. It is not protest \u2013 they are thugs.\u201d It was not just outside parliament that democracy had gone awry and turned sour. On Wednesday in the House of Commons \u2013 totally deadlocked on Brexit with just over two months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU \u2013 there was constitutional uproar. The speaker John Bercow had controversially allowed an amendment that will force Theresa May to come up with a Brexit Plan B within three days if the prime minister\u2019s crucial meaningful vote is lost on Tuesday. On the government front bench five cabinet ministers, including May, Julian Smith, the chief whip, and the leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, sat shaking their heads in fury at Bercow. Pro-Brexit MPs shouted about \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d and claimed Bercow was biased. One Labour MP observed later that \u201canarchy had spread from outside to inside the mother of parliaments\u201d. Rather than parliament \u201ctaking back control\u201d \u2013 which was what Brexiters had insisted Brexit was really about \u2013 it seemed to have completely lost it. When Cameron announced in January 2013 that the British people would be able to vote in a referendum on whether the UK should stay in or leave the European Union he assumed this great exercise in democracy would settle the decades-old argument for good. \u201cIt is time for the British people to have their say,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt is time to settle this European question in British politics.\u201d Many predictions by politicians and commentators over recent years have proved wildly wide of the mark, but none, perhaps, more so than this. This weekend, two and a half years after the UK voted narrowly to leave the EU, and as Tuesday\u2019s crucial vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal approaches, nothing is settled at all. Divisions in Westminster and the country are deeper, wider, and more visceral than ever. Our parliament, to which Brexiters want to return sovereignty, is gridlocked and unruly to the point of paralysis. At the point when its decisions are most urgently needed, it is unable to agree on a way forward. \u201cThe political bubble has never been polarised like this before,\u201d says Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative former minister, father of the House of Commons and a lifetime pro-European. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy ... a parody of democracy.\u201d With May facing seemingly inevitable defeat this week, Clarke, who will retire at the next election after more than five decades at the forefront of politics, cannot see a way out of an interminable mess he never imagined could develop, and fears things will get worse before they get better. From his lofty position as parliament\u2019s wise old man he is also scornful of the prime minister. \u201cIt was always the plan of government to lose this first vote [on Tuesday] and then raise the Project Fear stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what do we do if [May] gets up in front of the House again and says: \u2018The sky will fall in if we don\u2019t vote for this deal\u2019 and all this crap? If she comes out and says there is no deal now, she will have a lot of ministerial resignations and I don\u2019t quite know what will happen then.\u201d On his office wall Clarke, a survivor of European arguments that scarred, and in the end did for, the premierships of Margaret Thatcher and John Major as well as Cameron, has a framed copy of a 2017 front page in which he and 14 colleagues were notoriously branded Brexit mutineers. He considers it a reminder to keep going. But he fears the current prime minister simply has no idea where she is going. \u201cThe key events now are: what is Theresa May\u2019s reaction to this three-day deadline she\u2019s got?,\u201d he asks. \u201cWill she actually tell anybody what her Plan B is, beyond her rather lightweight entourage? I would be faintly appalled if I learned she wasn\u2019t even turning her mind on what to do.\u201d When Soubry reflects on the wider politics and the impact on her party she, too, is scathing about May and says she has never known times so uncertain and turbulent. \u201cIt is an utterly remarkable time,\u201d she says. She believes the prime minister is trying to force her deal through the house despite the huge risk of ending up with a no-deal Brexit that many in her own cabinet have admitted would be economically catastrophic. It is a kind of political suicide mission. \u201cHer tactics are to run the clock down deliberately,\u201d Soubry says. \u201cI think she\u2019s prepared to crash out without a deal.\u201d But would that not spell the end of the Conservative party, and disaster for the country with it? \u201cI agree, but she\u2019s prepared to do it,\u201d she says. There is one thing, however, that has brought together MPs on all sides of the Brexit divide \u2013 even Soubry and May. She reveals that the prime minister \u2013 \u201cwho I have no relationship with\u201d \u2013 sent her a handwritten letter about the abuse against her outside the Commons. \u201cDear Anna,\u201d it reads, \u201cI hoped to see you in the House today, but I wanted to write and say how sorry I was to see the treatment you received near parliament yesterday. That was appalling and no one should be subject to such abuse.\u201d Soubry continues to read aloud. \u201cWe all know there are differing views, often very strongly held on the European issue, but everyone should be able to put their views without the risk of intimidation and abuse. I know you are a robust person, but incidents like this are unsettling and I\u2019m sorry you were subject to such behaviour. Yours ever, Theresa.\u201d Despite such occasional shows of solidarity between opposing sides in parliament, arguments over Brexit are all that newer MPs have known during their times as parliamentarians. Layla Moran, the first ethnic minority Liberal Democrat MP, who has been serving the voters of Oxford west and Abingdon since 2017 and is pushing hard for a second referendum, says she\u2019s exhausted by it all and now regards it as the norm. For her there is no respite and the fear of what may lurk outside the safe interior of the Palace of Westminster is ever present. \u201cWe\u2019re in the situation where we\u2019re all in campaign mode,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been on the precipice of a general election for the whole time I\u2019ve been an MP; we know we\u2019re in the middle of a moment of history that will be written about, but not knowing what happens next is making it really tense and emotional.\u201d She fears for her safety and that of others. \u201cThey\u2019re bruisy men out there. You\u2019d cross the road at night if you saw them.\u201d Outside parliament the yelling from both sides of the Brexit argument continues. In recent weeks dozens have lined up with banners, flags and placards by mid-afternoon every day. The activity ramped up in the weeks before Christmas. \u201cThat\u2019s when the yellow jacket lot first came,\u201d confirms a policeman outside Black Rod\u2019s garden last week. Has it made his job much harder? \u201cWell it\u2019s not got easier,\u201d he sighs in the cold. Behind him, and dotted in pairs across Westminster, at almost every entrance and gate, are police armed with machine guns. Andy Curzon, an engineer from Manchester, finds it \u201ccrazy that many people, including MPs, are incapable of understanding the basic facts of trade and that we\u2019re going to sever these links.\u201d He waves an EU flag next to a sign for passing cars that reads \u201cTOOT TO STOP BREXIT\u201d. Asked whether he has talked to any of the Leave protesters today, Curzon sighs. \u201cYou try but ... nationalism now is just crackers \u2013 I can\u2019t understand why people want it. We all have phones. We\u2019re all connected and have friends and family all over the world.\u201d Two male Ukip protesters, who won\u2019t share their names, blame \u201cfake news\u201d, under which they classify all major media, with no exceptions. \u201cLeave means leave. We\u2019re not unreasonable,\u201d insists the younger man, dressed in a parka and blue jeans. He describes himself as \u201ca citizen journalist from southwest London\u201d. About the Soubry incident, he is flippant: \u201cThis is a Westminster bubble, that\u2019s how people talk in the pub. Get used to it. There is no such thing as hate speech, it\u2019s just different opinions. I find your paper offensive. I won\u2019t shut you down or get you arrested.\u201d On the street, the man still bellowing a full-throated \u201cout means out\u201d is enraged by a host of conspiracy theories he believes in. \u201cI find news the way I need to find it,\u201d he says when asked about his information. \u201cI research people that I get it off. If I can get it from a family member then that\u2019s it. If you were on my side, you\u2019d be doing all that.\u201d The country should prepare for riots, he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t expect the people to be law-abiding citizens when government is as corrupt as it is. All them people in here,\u201d he claims, \u201care getting paid backhanders all the way through the system.\u201d On 23 June 2016 the British people voted by 51.9% to leave the EU and 48.1% to stay in. Cameron\u2019s gamble not only backfired by delivering a Brexit vote which forced his resignation and set the UK on a road out of the EU, but his hope that a referendum would lance the European boil has been exposed as appallingly misplaced \u2013 for the precise opposite has happened. The British public is now more divided, more aware and more conscious of who is on which side of the argument at the heart of British public life. Politicians, communities, families are \u2013 31 months on from the vote \u2013 unable to come together and seem largely immune to persuasion, unbiddable and unwilling to budge from entrenched positions. The country stands just 75 days away from the supposed moment of Brexit but with no national or political consensus over what Brexit should entail, or whether it should go ahead at all. Deadlock in parliament reflects division in the country. \u201cBrexit has paralysed the democratic system,\u201d says a senior Tory MP. \u201cAnd the really alarming thing is I cannot see how this does not endure for decades. We will all be defined as Remainers or Leavers for decades to come. This is not a passing argument. It really is close to civil war.\u201d Normal alliances have broken down, and parties have split many ways, raising questions about whether Brexit will deliver a new political alignment, in the form of new party in the centre and at the extremes. \u201cThe real legacy of Brexit could be a completely different British politics and party system,\u201d says a Labour frontbencher. Cameron\u2019s referendum has left the Conservative party split between hard Brexiters, soft Brexiters, and Remainers, while Labour, although its membership and supporters are overwhelmingly pro-Remain, has its own deep divides. Its leader Jeremy Corbyn seems unwilling to commit to what most of his party wants \u2013 a second referendum \u2013 because he is a lifelong Eurosceptic. Labour has staggered through the last two and half years with a policy of deliberate ambiguity in order to offend the fewest possible of its supporters. Outside the party system, there are two broad camps, fairly evenly split, if the polls are to be believed. On the one side are those who believe that because the country voted for Brexit it must go ahead with it \u2013 either because they think it is a good thing instrinsically or that not to do so would be dangerous for democracy, or both. In the other camp are those who believe that we should find a way out of activating Article 50 and stay in, perhaps by holding a second referendum with Remain on the ballot paper or by simply cancelling the whole project. Prominent supporters of both sides have been turning up the rhetoric before next week\u2019s vote in the hope of winning the day. Yesterday the pro-Brexit cabinet minister Chris Grayling said blocking Brexit could end the 350 years of \u201cmoderate\u201d politics that Britain has enjoyed since the English civil war. Last week leading businesses, including Jaguar, Land Rover and Ford, warned of job losses, while Greg Clark, the business secretary, said a no-deal Brexit would be economically \u201cdisastrous\u201d. This week, the Brexit saga and uncertainty will enter another phase. What will happen if May\u2019s deal is voted down \u2013 as it almost certainly will be \u2013 nobody knows. Downing Street is determined to press ahead with the vote, although it is aware that the prime minister is facing a massive defeat \u2013 another indication of how impossible her position has become. What then? \u201cWe could head for a no-deal Brexit, but Parliament voted last week to block that option off as it would be catastrophic,\u201d says a senior Tory MP. \u201cWe could have a second referendum to sort out the mess, but there is no sign of a parliamentary majority for that either. So God only knows.\u201d Outside the Commons the protests go on. \u201cThis is civil war without the muskets,\u201d says Helen Slater, who has come from Bristol to campaign. \u201cIt is appalling.\u201d",

Price-wise it occupies the sweet spot between top-end high street and designer. The hand-printed tie-dye T-shirts and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/16/heritage.ruralaffairs\" title=\"\">Cerne Abbas giant</a> motif fleece designed with artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/25/jeremy-deller-creates-monumental-party-for-stonehenge-centenary\" title=\"\">Jeremy Deller</a> are among our favourites. <em>T-shirt, \u00a395, <a href=\"https://www.ariesarise.com/\" title=\"\">ariesarise.com</a></em></p> <h2>2. Alex Orso</h2> <p>Men\u2019s jewellery can be tricky terrain to navigate, but this London-based brand makes it easy with dialled-down bling. Pendants of found objects like paperclips and bottle tops are cast in brass and plated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2011/dec/30/3\" title=\"\">ruthenium</a>. Chains are offered in two lengths and while the rings are simple, the gold and ruby cuff features three 1.8mm square rubies discreetly fitted flush into one end. <em>Necklace, \u00a399, <a href=\"https://www.alexorso.com/\" title=\"\">alexorso.com</a></em></p> <h2>3.

Factor in the Scandi love of simple design and an ability to look chic at all times and you get Nufferton, purveyors of Instagram-friendly PJs. Think old school cotton stripe styles in shades of navy and claret and candy pastels that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a Wes Anderson movie. <em>Pyjamas, \u00a3123.35, <a href=\"https://nufferton.com/\" title=\"\">nufferton.com</a></em></p> <h2>4.

Hamilton and Hare</h2> <p>Having redesigned the humble boxer short to a well-fitting piece of kit, Hamilton and Hare set their sights on lounge wear. Their sleep shirts can take you straight from bed, on an emergency supermarket milk run and back to bed again without giving you away. Take advantage of the complimentary monogramming on cotton-cashmere items. <em>Sleep shirt, \u00a3295, <a href=\"https://www.hamiltonandhare.com/\" title=\"\">hamiltonandhare.com</a></em></p> <h2>6.

Fact. <em>Pants, from \u00a327, <a href=\"https://cdlp.com/\" title=\"\">cdlp.com</a></em></p> <h2>7. Goya</h2> <p>Drawing on Spanish heritage, Goya sandals are a luxury version of the classic \u201cmenorquina\u201d sandal, upgraded with a deep rubber boot sole for city-wear durability. Madrid-based British designer Kimberley Tecles-Byrom worked with Alicante artisans to create this summer must for anyone who shies away from sandals because they dislike their toes. <em>Sandals, \u00a3</em><em>258, <a href=\"https://www.thegoyabrand.com/\" title=\"\">thegoyabrand.com</a></em></p> <h2>8.

Think elevated authentic sportswear with its own basketball-inspired line, Sonny NYC (and even its own tournament). A few AW18 pieces from well appointed collaborations with Timberland and Woolrich can still be snapped up. Inject colour into January with their colour block rugby jersey. <em>Top, \u00a3215, <a href=\"https://www.endclothing.com/gb/\" title=\"\">endclothing.com</a></em></p> <h2>9.

It\u2019s the backbone of many style insiders\u2019 wardrobes, with great quality and design at wallet-friendly prices. This season we love the bold knitwear and bleached denim. Be quick though, it sells like hotcakes. <em>Jacket, \u00a334.90, <a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/home/\" title=\"\">uniqlo.com</a></em></p> <h2>10. Instrmnt</h2> <p>Pete Sunderland and Ross Baynham founded Instrmnt, a multidisciplinary design studio, in Glasgow in 2014. Their minimal watches are easy on the eye, the clever packaging as elegant as the watch itself. They come in a box, unassembled, with tools provided for the customer to build their own watch. All styles have a two-year guarantee. <em>Watch, \u00a3180 <a href=\"https://www.instrmnt.co.uk/\" title=\"\">instrmnt.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>11.

Designer Pierre Mah\u00e9o describes it as \u201cclothes for the everyday life\u2026 made in Europe in the most ethical way\u201d.

Representatives for Sears did not immediately accept the new offer, leaving shoppers like Atkins wondering whether the warranty would be honored if they bought a Sears-branded appliance. Bad publicity, others said, did not help foster confidence in Sears.</p> <p>If creditors reject Lampert\u2019s offer, the only bidders left plan to shut Sears and Kmart, the discount firm Lampert merged Sears with in an $11bn deal in 2006, and sell off its assets, primarily its real estate.</p> <p>That would come as a blow to Sears\u2019 longtime customers but in the age of Amazon, as US bricks-and-mortar chains struggle to compete, it will come as little surprise against a backdrop of what has been called <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-retail-debt/\">\u201cAmerica\u2019s retail apocalypse\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky situation,\u201d noted one Sears customer, who asked to be referred to as Miss Bennett, as she perused a women\u2019s footwear aisle.

Shares in Macy\u2019s dropped 17.7%, their biggest one-day sell-off on record, after the department store cut its sales and earnings guidances having recently upgraded them.</p> <p>The pessimism on Wall Street spread quickly from department stores to virtually all retail sectors as investors discounted retail\u2019s ability to grasp the changes coming as consumers shift to online shopping.</p> <p>But while online shopping has hurt Sears, its problems are in some ways exceptional. Through the 60s,70s and 80s, customers went to Sears for appliances and workwear but they lost touch with that customer, says Hitha Herzog, retail analyst at H Squared Research, who describes Sears\u2019s problems as \u201ca near-perfect storm as to what can go wrong with a retailer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere was mismanagement on Lampert\u2019s part getting the correct product mix into the stores, then they couldn\u2019t figure out who their customer base was and didn\u2019t cater to that base, and they had flagship stores in malls that are losing foot-traffic like crazy.\u201d</p> <p>The collapse of many of America\u2019s chain stores is not as simple as blaming Amazon.</p> <p>\u201cIn general, people don\u2019t want to go to these massive department stores any more,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cWhen they want specific products, they go directly to the brand or to the manufacturer.\u201d</p> <p>One common factor for these troubled chains is that they are overloaded with debt \u2013 often from leveraged buyouts led by private equity firms. Sustaining that debt in an economy that may well be heading for recession can only become harder.</p> <p>In September, Toys R Us surprised investors by filing for bankruptcy \u2013 the third-largest retail bankruptcy in US history \u2013 after struggling to refinance just $400m of its $5bn in debt.</p> <p>According to Fitch, the amount of retail debt set to mature rose from $100m in 2017 to $1.9bn in 2018. From 2019 to 2025, it will balloon to a yearly average of almost $5bn.</p> <p>And the demand for refinancing in the retail sector comes just as credit markets tighten. Part of the reason Sears filed for bankruptcy in October was that Lampert found he could no longer raise capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65e0055ed991c042101243a1166907c49d5899a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65e0055ed991c042101243a1166907c49d5899a9/0_150_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker removes sale banners inside a closed Sears department store in Nanuet, New York, one day after it closed as part of multiple store closures on 7 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker removes sale banners inside a closed Sears department store in Nanuet, New York, one day after it closed on 7 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Sears employees and creditors wait for the outcome, the US faces another problem: what to do with the real estate vacated by chains.</p> <p>Even before the e-commerce boom, US retail was considered massively overbuilt \u2013 a result of the big-box era that saw huge stores built across the country in almost every category of retailing. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, 6,752 locations were scheduled to close through the first nine months of 2017. Of those, 550 were department stores, equating to 43m sq feet of retail space, or about half the total. This year\u2019s figures may well be higher.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of low-paid jobs will go with those closures. States like Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan and Illinois have been among the hardest hit. But others which have relied on retail job growth, including Nevada, Florida and Arkansas, may now feel the impact.</p> <p>That leaves mall owners struggling to find opportunities to bring foot traffic back to their locations. But even they don\u2019t want department stores as their flagship tenants.</p> <p>In court papers, mall owners Simon Property Group and Brixmor Property Group said Sears\u2019 plan to keep stores open rather than pursue going-out-of-business sales was \u201can unjustified and foolhardy gamble with other people\u2019s money\u201d.</p> <p>According to Herzog, mall owners are open to offers. \u201cThose big-box stores are probably going to turn into entertainment centres, maybe service centres, gyms or hospitals. Maybe there could be a real estate play on housing. A go-cart track. Anything is possible, but we know for a fact it probably won\u2019t be a retailer in.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s like a staple of the neighborhood,\u201d said Waverly Atkins, who\u2019d come to buy a new filter for her refrigerator. \u201cI\u2019d miss it if it were gone.\u201d Last week, Sears narrowly avoided a deadline for liquidation after a New York bankruptcy judge permitted Eddie Lampert, whose hedge fund ranks as Sears\u2019 biggest shareholder and creditor, more time to improve his offer for the company\u2019s assets, another step in his decade-long, seemingly quixotic, effort to keep the ailing retailer afloat. On Monday the company\u2019s fate will be decided at an auction when Lampert\u2019s now $5bn bid will go up against liquidators who are planning to shut the retailer down. Sears has been teetering on the edge of collapse since October when Lampert, who holds around $2.5bn of the $5.5bn debt load, placed the 133-year-old company in bankruptcy protection. A company representative said the new offer \u2013 which includes an additional $600m to cover severance costs and suppliers\u2019 bills - provided \u201csubstantially more value to stakeholders than would be the case in liquidation and is the only option to save an iconic American retailer and up to 50,000 jobs\u201d. \u201cWe believe in Sears and will continue to do everything we can to ensure that it has a profitable future.\u201d Few others do. Representatives for Sears did not immediately accept the new offer, leaving shoppers like Atkins wondering whether the warranty would be honored if they bought a Sears-branded appliance. Bad publicity, others said, did not help foster confidence in Sears. If creditors reject Lampert\u2019s offer, the only bidders left plan to shut Sears and Kmart, the discount firm Lampert merged Sears with in an $11bn deal in 2006, and sell off its assets, primarily its real estate. That would come as a blow to Sears\u2019 longtime customers but in the age of Amazon, as US bricks-and-mortar chains struggle to compete, it will come as little surprise against a backdrop of what has been called \u201cAmerica\u2019s retail apocalypse\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky situation,\u201d noted one Sears customer, who asked to be referred to as Miss Bennett, as she perused a women\u2019s footwear aisle. To survive, she said, \u201cthey\u2019d have to come with something new. What that is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d The grave condition of US retailers was underscored again last week when, despite a booming economy and record consumer confidence, major US retailers recorded disappointing results from the holiday period. Some of the biggest US retailers, including Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s and Target, saw $34bn wiped from their market value. Shares in Macy\u2019s dropped 17.7%, their biggest one-day sell-off on record, after the department store cut its sales and earnings guidances having recently upgraded them. The pessimism on Wall Street spread quickly from department stores to virtually all retail sectors as investors discounted retail\u2019s ability to grasp the changes coming as consumers shift to online shopping. But while online shopping has hurt Sears, its problems are in some ways exceptional. Through the 60s,70s and 80s, customers went to Sears for appliances and workwear but they lost touch with that customer, says Hitha Herzog, retail analyst at H Squared Research, who describes Sears\u2019s problems as \u201ca near-perfect storm as to what can go wrong with a retailer\u201d. \u201cThere was mismanagement on Lampert\u2019s part getting the correct product mix into the stores, then they couldn\u2019t figure out who their customer base was and didn\u2019t cater to that base, and they had flagship stores in malls that are losing foot-traffic like crazy.\u201d The collapse of many of America\u2019s chain stores is not as simple as blaming Amazon. \u201cIn general, people don\u2019t want to go to these massive department stores any more,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cWhen they want specific products, they go directly to the brand or to the manufacturer.\u201d One common factor for these troubled chains is that they are overloaded with debt \u2013 often from leveraged buyouts led by private equity firms. Sustaining that debt in an economy that may well be heading for recession can only become harder. In September, Toys R Us surprised investors by filing for bankruptcy \u2013 the third-largest retail bankruptcy in US history \u2013 after struggling to refinance just $400m of its $5bn in debt. According to Fitch, the amount of retail debt set to mature rose from $100m in 2017 to $1.9bn in 2018. From 2019 to 2025, it will balloon to a yearly average of almost $5bn. And the demand for refinancing in the retail sector comes just as credit markets tighten. Part of the reason Sears filed for bankruptcy in October was that Lampert found he could no longer raise capital. As Sears employees and creditors wait for the outcome, the US faces another problem: what to do with the real estate vacated by chains. Even before the e-commerce boom, US retail was considered massively overbuilt \u2013 a result of the big-box era that saw huge stores built across the country in almost every category of retailing. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, 6,752 locations were scheduled to close through the first nine months of 2017. Of those, 550 were department stores, equating to 43m sq feet of retail space, or about half the total. This year\u2019s figures may well be higher. Tens of thousands of low-paid jobs will go with those closures. States like Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan and Illinois have been among the hardest hit. But others which have relied on retail job growth, including Nevada, Florida and Arkansas, may now feel the impact. That leaves mall owners struggling to find opportunities to bring foot traffic back to their locations. But even they don\u2019t want department stores as their flagship tenants. In court papers, mall owners Simon Property Group and Brixmor Property Group said Sears\u2019 plan to keep stores open rather than pursue going-out-of-business sales was \u201can unjustified and foolhardy gamble with other people\u2019s money\u201d. According to Herzog, mall owners are open to offers. \u201cThose big-box stores are probably going to turn into entertainment centres, maybe service centres, gyms or hospitals. Maybe there could be a real estate play on housing. A go-cart track. Anything is possible, but we know for a fact it probably won\u2019t be a retailer in.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The icy winds whistling off the Great Lakes will take temperatures to well below freezing in Detroit this week. Not that the cold will deter hundreds of thousands of visitors from pouring into Motor City for the North American International Auto Show, arguably the world\u2019s most famous car show, when it opens on Monday.</p> <p>This will be the last year that warmly wrapped gear heads will face an icy dash between the show and the city\u2019s sold-out hotels and restaurants to discuss this year\u2019s models and parties. Next year NAIAS \u2013 which can trace its history back to 1899 \u2013 moves to the balmy month of June. The plan is to show the resurgent city at its best and allow manufacturers to demonstrate their new cars \u2013 and technology \u2013 outside in the fresh air.</p> <p>It may seem like an obvious move but some fear the shift could kill an event that pumped $480m into the region last year, filling hotels and restaurants with car fans, corporate accounts and journalists in the post-holiday lull and giving the still-troubled city a much-needed boost. This year that boost comes as Detroit\u2019s largest industry appears to be heading for <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2019-01-10/ford-to-shake-up-european-business-cut-jobs\">trouble</a> again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the new US morning briefing\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4300\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"A different kind of daily email\" data-form-description=\"Sign up and get a daily US news briefing from the Guardian\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks, you'll start getting the US morning briefing soon.\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the new US morning briefing</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Locals are worried. \u201cWe\u2019ll survive but I guarantee you others won\u2019t,\u201d said Timothy Tharp, board chair of the Detroit Restaurant Association and co-owner of several downtown restaurants including the historic <a href=\"http://www.grandtrunk.pub/\">Grand Trunk Pub</a>, a lively spot housed in the former ticket office of the Grand Trunk Railway.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBEz5wGu1Co\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KBEz5wGu1Co?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Detroit Auto Show moves to summer.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>June is already a big month for downtown Detroit, he said. \u201cJanuarys are traditionally a very slow month for restaurants but thanks to the show they have been great for us,\u201d he said. Until now.</p> <p>Grand Trunk is a five-minute walk from the giant Cobo Center convention hall where NAIAS takes place. \u201cWe have so many international visitors, people speaking Japanese, German, French,\u201d said Tharp. \u201cAre they going to come in summer?\u201d He\u2019s not convinced. The impact on staff, who are likely to have hours cut \u201cwill be enormous,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But car shows, and not just Detroit\u2019s, have issues. The industry has changed \u2013 unveiling new technology is now just \u2013 if not more \u2013 important than launching new models. Over in always sunny Las Vegas the Consumer Electronics Show, which overlaps with NAIAS, has stolen many of the headlines in car news in recent years. Even hometown giants Ford and General Motors have used CES to show off their tech chops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a4f62ab38c936a4e6cbb7e016dbbdd326c54cc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a4f62ab38c936a4e6cbb7e016dbbdd326c54cc8/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"General Motors chair Mary Barra speaks during a keynote address at the 2016 CES trade show in Las Vegas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The General Motors chair, Mary Barra, speaks during a keynote address at the 2016 CES trade show in Las Vegas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Marcus/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said his family used to make an annual trip to the Detroit show when he was a child. \u201cIt was exciting. There were exotic cars you would never see otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019ll go but not with any great excitement. I asked my neighbors recently if they\u2019d go and they kinda shrugged.\u201d</p> <p>Gordon said Detroit would probably remain the epicenter of US car manufacturing but the buzz had moved on. Moving the show was unlikely to change that. </p> <p>And after bouncing back from near-collapse automakers are also re-evaluating how much money they spend at auto shows. Major European carmakers including Audi, Land Rover, Mercedes Benz and Mini have all dropped out of Detroit this year, making the International \u201cI\u201d in NAIAS superfluous.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see why the car companies are cutting back. Some $127bn (\u00a3100bn) was wiped off the value of car companies last year. Sales held up in the US but few are expecting that trend to hold in 2019 or 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/27/general-motors-ohio-auto-car-layoffs\">'A kick in the stomach': massive GM layoffs leave workers distraught \u2013 and angry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last November <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/26/general-motors-set-to-cut-workforce-as-slowing-sales-and-steel-tariffs-bite\">GM announced </a>it was shedding 14,700 jobs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/27/general-motors-ohio-auto-car-layoffs\">closing plants</a> as it deals with slowing sales of sedans.

Car sales are cyclical and Detroit has faced down bigger worries. But shifting the car show is still a big gamble.</p> <p>Last year it attracted more than 800,000 visitors and the money it pumped into the local economy is equivalent to holding two Super Bowls. But the risk of not moving the show outweighs the risk of leaving it alone, said Sandy Baruah, chief executive officer of the Detroit Regional Chamber.</p> <p>Baruah, a car fan who has been attending the show for over a decade, said the show had to change or die.\u201d</p> <p>Car shows used to be about \u201cshowing off sheet metal\u201d, he said. \u201cThe new design, the new interiors.

It is certainly something the industry needs.</p> <p>Public polling shows most drivers don\u2019t currently trust autonomous cars. According to a survey conducted by the insurer AAA, <a href=\"https://newsroom.aaa.com/2018/05/aaa-american-trust-autonomous-vehicles-slips/\">73% of American drivers </a>report they would be too afraid to ride in a fully self-driving vehicle.

      "bodyText": "The icy winds whistling off the Great Lakes will take temperatures to well below freezing in Detroit this week. Not that the cold will deter hundreds of thousands of visitors from pouring into Motor City for the North American International Auto Show, arguably the world\u2019s most famous car show, when it opens on Monday. This will be the last year that warmly wrapped gear heads will face an icy dash between the show and the city\u2019s sold-out hotels and restaurants to discuss this year\u2019s models and parties. Next year NAIAS \u2013 which can trace its history back to 1899 \u2013 moves to the balmy month of June. The plan is to show the resurgent city at its best and allow manufacturers to demonstrate their new cars \u2013 and technology \u2013 outside in the fresh air. It may seem like an obvious move but some fear the shift could kill an event that pumped $480m into the region last year, filling hotels and restaurants with car fans, corporate accounts and journalists in the post-holiday lull and giving the still-troubled city a much-needed boost. This year that boost comes as Detroit\u2019s largest industry appears to be heading for trouble again. Locals are worried. \u201cWe\u2019ll survive but I guarantee you others won\u2019t,\u201d said Timothy Tharp, board chair of the Detroit Restaurant Association and co-owner of several downtown restaurants including the historic Grand Trunk Pub, a lively spot housed in the former ticket office of the Grand Trunk Railway. June is already a big month for downtown Detroit, he said. \u201cJanuarys are traditionally a very slow month for restaurants but thanks to the show they have been great for us,\u201d he said. Until now. Grand Trunk is a five-minute walk from the giant Cobo Center convention hall where NAIAS takes place. \u201cWe have so many international visitors, people speaking Japanese, German, French,\u201d said Tharp. \u201cAre they going to come in summer?\u201d He\u2019s not convinced. The impact on staff, who are likely to have hours cut \u201cwill be enormous,\u201d he said. But car shows, and not just Detroit\u2019s, have issues. The industry has changed \u2013 unveiling new technology is now just \u2013 if not more \u2013 important than launching new models. Over in always sunny Las Vegas the Consumer Electronics Show, which overlaps with NAIAS, has stolen many of the headlines in car news in recent years. Even hometown giants Ford and General Motors have used CES to show off their tech chops. Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said his family used to make an annual trip to the Detroit show when he was a child. \u201cIt was exciting. There were exotic cars you would never see otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019ll go but not with any great excitement. I asked my neighbors recently if they\u2019d go and they kinda shrugged.\u201d Gordon said Detroit would probably remain the epicenter of US car manufacturing but the buzz had moved on. Moving the show was unlikely to change that. And after bouncing back from near-collapse automakers are also re-evaluating how much money they spend at auto shows. Major European carmakers including Audi, Land Rover, Mercedes Benz and Mini have all dropped out of Detroit this year, making the International \u201cI\u201d in NAIAS superfluous. It\u2019s easy to see why the car companies are cutting back. Some $127bn (\u00a3100bn) was wiped off the value of car companies last year. Sales held up in the US but few are expecting that trend to hold in 2019 or 2020. Last November GM announced it was shedding 14,700 jobs and closing plants as it deals with slowing sales of sedans. Interest rates are rising in the US and new car sales are expected to decline. The price of a new car hit a record $35,957 in December, about 2% higher than the previous year. according to Edmunds.com. And then there is Donald Trump. His ongoing trade wars, with China in particular, have rattled auto executives and their shareholders and steel tariffs have increased manufacturers\u2019 costs. They have also contributed to a slowdown in China, the world\u2019s largest car market. Chinese car sales just experienced their first slowdown in more than 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a pretty quiet show this year,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Auto Trader. \u201cEverybody is pulling in the reins on spending.\u201d One quiet year doesn\u2019t spell doom. Car sales are cyclical and Detroit has faced down bigger worries. But shifting the car show is still a big gamble. Last year it attracted more than 800,000 visitors and the money it pumped into the local economy is equivalent to holding two Super Bowls. But the risk of not moving the show outweighs the risk of leaving it alone, said Sandy Baruah, chief executive officer of the Detroit Regional Chamber. Baruah, a car fan who has been attending the show for over a decade, said the show had to change or die.\u201d Car shows used to be about \u201cshowing off sheet metal\u201d, he said. \u201cThe new design, the new interiors. Now it\u2019s not just about those things it\u2019s about the technology in your vehicle and what it\u2019s going to do for you.\u201d The classic car show display with a car on a pedestal revolving slowly under bright lights accompanied by a statuesque model (usually female and underdressed for a Detroit winter) just doesn\u2019t cut it these days. Instead he expects to see a lot more hands-on demonstrations of all the new self-driving tech that the car companies are developing. It is certainly something the industry needs. Public polling shows most drivers don\u2019t currently trust autonomous cars. According to a survey conducted by the insurer AAA, 73% of American drivers report they would be too afraid to ride in a fully self-driving vehicle. That\u2019s a problem for an industry currently spending billions on robot vehicles. \u201cThat number changes 180 degrees when you put people in a vehicle to experience it,\u201d said Baruah. An outdoor car show will allow Detroit to demonstrate the future of driving in a way that the cold-bound indoor event never could, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opportunity to educate people,\u201d he said. The move will be a body blow to Detroit\u2019s burgeoning bar and restaurant scene. Not so long ago car execs would drive miles out of town to take visitors for dinner after the show passing miles of burned-out houses and blacked-out streets. Now once scary streets are filled with bars and restaurants selling local beers, craft cocktails and posh pizza. But as the car industry knows, you can\u2019t stand still, said Baruah. \u201cThe greater risk is not moving to the summer. Any change has inherent risk but sometimes making no change is the greatest risk of all.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Two months after Donald Trump fired his original attorney general, the Senate will on Tuesday cross-examine his proposed replacement, William Barr, a Washington stalwart who served in the role under George HW Bush. The pick has been welcomed by Republicans and even some Trump detractors, who reason that Barr is a known quantity and that Trump might have done much worse, given his extraordinary views on presidential impunity and his expressed hostility toward the Department of Justice (DoJ). But some Democrats, former federal prosecutors and DoJ figures are warning that Barr might not be such a known quantity after all, and that confirming him as attorney general would threaten the work of the special counsel Robert Mueller and the justice department more broadly. Barr\u2019s nomination has surfaced at an unusually fraught moment in Washington. While clashes between the White House and justice department are not unheard of, Trump\u2019s war on the former attorney general Jeff Sessions, his attacks on top justice department figures such as the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, and former FBI director, James Comey, and his stated belief that he should be able to direct justice department investigations \u2013 all combined with the sheer magnitude of alleged criminal conduct by former Trump aides and business associates and possibly Trump himself \u2013 means the next attorney general will wield power with likely historic consequences. The announcement last week of the planned departure of Rosenstein, who is seen as having faithfully protected the Mueller investigation against serious pressure from the White House, ratcheted stakes even higher. Critics of Barr have raised an alarm about a memo that Barr submitted to the department last year, ostensibly unsolicited, arguing that Mueller\u2019s investigation of Trump for alleged obstruction of justice was \u201cfatally misconceived\u201d. \u201cThe new Barr memo makes it clear that his view is outside the mainstream even of conservative, basic unitary executive theory,\u201d said Neil Kinkopf, a Georgia State law professor who worked in the Office of Legal Counsel during the Clinton administration. \u201cIt goes beyond that, to the point where it comes very close to putting the president above the law.\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a Democrat on the judiciary committee, which will question Barr and vote on his nomination, said: \u201cThe memorandum is deeply worrisome because in effect he says the president is above the law. \u201cThat\u2019s incorrect as a matter of law, but certainly for an attorney general to have that position is deeply wrong.\u201d Other critics have raised concerns that Barr, who as attorney general in the early 1990s recommended that Bush pardon six Reagan officials caught up in the Iran-Contra affair, was nominated to defend the White House, not just to run the justice department. These critics point to Barr\u2019s recent record as a Trump apologist. After the firing of Comey in 2017, Barr published an op-ed in the Washington Post praising the move. He also has supported Trump\u2019s call for a criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to a uranium mining company that benefited from a decision made while she was secretary of state, a marginal view mainly consigned to the fever swamps of the far right. Barr, 68, grew up in New York City and graduated from George Washington University law school before taking up a post on Ronald Reagan\u2019s domestic policy staff. At the justice department he served in the Office of Legal Counsel, as deputy attorney general and finally, from 1991 to 1993, as attorney general, spotlighting gang violence and prison conditions \u2013 Barr argued that judges were dictating unrealistic quality-of-life standards. Barr \u2013 who is in his spare time an expert bagpiper \u2013 was also an immigration hardliner, hiring hundreds of new border guards and, according to a 1992 CBS News report that called him \u201ca tough guy who\u2019s not afraid to ruffle feathers\u201d, swearing in some of them himself \u201cto underscore he meant business\u201d. A 1991 Los Angeles Times report noted Barr\u2019s \u201cdry, self-deprecating wit and full-bodied laugh\u201d but called him \u201ca staunch conservative who rarely hesitates to put his hardline views into action\u201d, citing a 1989 legal opinion in which Barr authorized federal agents to seize fugitives overseas without a foreign government\u2019s permission. However, even some strong Trump critics believe that, based on his past career, Barr would reprise his leadership of the justice department in good faith and not with undue deference to the White House. \u201cCount me as one Democrat who thinks President Trump has made an excellent choice in his decision to nominate William P Barr,\u201d Harry Litman, a former prosecutor who worked under Barr, wrote in December. \u201cWas he, and is he, very conservative? You bet \u2026 But the roots of his political views concern the rule of law, public safety and the fair application of legal rules to all.\u201d But others believe that Barr\u2019s memo criticizing Mueller is an indication that his judgment or perspective might have changed in the 25 years since he was known for steering the justice department with a fair hand. \u201cThat reputation would make him all the more effective an attack dog for Trump,\u201d said Kinkopf, who has argued elsewhere that Barr\u2019s \u201cexpansive view of presidential power\u201d laid the legal groundwork for the George W Bush-era torture program. \u201cIf he has gone over the to the dark side, so to speak, his past credible service makes him all the more effective in undermining the rule of law, and all the more dangerous.\u201d",

Hoping to prove that the early bird catches the worm, he did so all the way back in July 2017. He has been hustling for votes ever since, with a Kennedy-inspired message of common purpose. Critics, opinion polls and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnkdelaney?lang=en\">his campaign Twitter account</a> (with just 12,000 followers) suggest he is more Don Quixote, embarked on a romantic but doomed quest.</p> <p>Delaney has made 21 trips to Iowa, the first caucus state, visiting all 99 counties and making 214 stops. He has also made 10 trips to New Hampshire, the first primary state, visiting seven counties and making 96 stops. Having spent $3.5m, recruited staff and opened offices, he has become Exhibit A for America\u2019s never-ending campaign, in stark contrast to the UK and other countries where general elections take a month or two, four or five years apart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Who\u2019s going to be our nominee in 2020 and how do we beat Trump is something every Democrat wants to talk about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI do think our election cycles are very long and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s great,\u201d admits the affable Delaney. But he reasons: \u201cThe presidency of the United States is a very unique elected position. So if anything merits a longer vetting process, the presidency does to some extent. In general our election cycles are too long, but this job is so consequential that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing to give people more time to get to know you.\u201d</p> <p>Weren\u2019t people sick of politics after the traumatic 2016 election? Not a bit of it.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were totally excited to talk about 2020,\u201d he says. \u201cDemocrats are quite excited to turn the page on the current president, so for most it\u2019s not too early to talk about 2020. Most Democrats are not saying, \u2018Well, let\u2019s give this guy a chance.\u2019 They\u2019re way past that. The notion of who\u2019s going to be our nominee in 2020 and how do we beat him is something every Democrat in this country really wants to talk about.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A sense of stewardship\u2019</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/30/if-being-representative-is-your-goal-illinois-should-be-the-first-primary-state/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.3c88355a6f81\">Another much scrutinised quirk</a> of the American electoral system is the arbitrary power of Iowa and New Hampshire, neither representative of the country\u2019s racial diversity. Warren, a Massachusetts senator and the first major candidate to enter the contest after announcing an exploratory committee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/05/elizabeth-warren-2020-iowa-donald-trump\">earlier this month campaigned in Iowa</a> until she went hoarse. There are still more than 650 days until election day.</p> <p>Again, Delaney defends a process that requires politicians to meet voters in their living rooms and coffee shops rather than run nationally.</p> <p>\u201cIf you had a primary on one day and everyone voted the same day they\u201d \u2013 he points to a big flatscreen TV showing cable news \u2013 \u201cwould determine the nominees. So I think there\u2019s a valuable role for a few states to go early and the states have to be of a size that you can actually campaign in them. You can\u2019t campaign in California in a grassroots way. It\u2019s too big.</p> <p>\u201cIowa and New Hampshire fit that size, and you get the sense that the people who are engaged in politics in Iowa and New Hampshire carry a sense of stewardship with them of the role they play. They don\u2019t actually think they pick the president. They think they ask the right questions and there\u2019s a valuable role for that.\u201d</p> <p>Delaney backed Hillary Clinton last time but offers an unexpected criticism: \u201cNeither Hillary or Bernie [Sanders] campaigned in Iowa or New Hampshire the way you\u2019re supposed to. They came and did big events. That\u2019s not what the people expect. They expect to sit down in small group gatherings and ask you questions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d67e634a82904044301b56bed9e3fdf1a72372b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d67e634a82904044301b56bed9e3fdf1a72372b5/0_0_3000_2140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delaney canvasses a neighborhood in Clinton, Iowa in October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Delaney canvasses a neighborhood in Clinton, Iowa, in October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA Press/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/politics/presidential-campaigns-2020.html\">Recent research by the New York Times</a> found that American elections have always been long, drawn out affairs by international standards. In 1960, Kennedy declared his candidacy 11 months before polling day. In 1992, Bill Clinton threw his hat in the ring more than a year ahead of the vote. For 2008, Republican John McCain formed his exploratory committee in November 2006. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/17/us/politics/17obama.html\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/20/us/politics/20cnd-clinton.html\">Hillary Clinton</a> launched theirs in January 2007.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have the right vision, but not enough people knew who I was and so the way to solve that problem is to get in early</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the epic 2016 election, it was December 2014 when Republican establishment favourite Jeb Bush said he would \u201cactively explore\u201d a bid. Senator Ted Cruz was the first major candidate to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/us/politics/ted-cruz-2016-presidential-race.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">formally announce</a>, in March 2015. Clinton entered the race a month later, followed in June by Trump\u2019s now infamous descent on a Trump Tower escalator.</p> <p>Delaney, however, has broken all records for hitting the ground running. His logic is simple: name recognition.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the right person for the job,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have the right vision, but not enough people knew who I was and so the way to solve that problem is to get in early. To some extent the race is starting now and I had to almost run a pre-race so that I was in the game when the race started.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, it appears he will soon be joined by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/08/democrats-2020-possible-presidential-candidates-liberal-progressive-split\">enough Democratic candidates</a> to constitute a football team and a Broadway chorus. When Delaney finds himself on a crowded debate stage, how will he try to stand out? \u201cYou have to have tremendous clarity as to why you\u2019re running for president,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And why are you? \u201cThe central issue facing this country is how deeply divided we are and someone has to bring us together so that we can actually do the kind of things we need to do to prepare our country for the future. The world is changing so fast and we\u2019re just sitting on our hands and unless we actually get back to this notion of common purpose \u2013 which doesn\u2019t mean we agree with each other on everything, far from it, we should have great debates \u2013 but some notion of common purpose, I really worry about our future.\u201d</p> <p>Among his ideas is getting the president to debate on the floor of the House of Representatives four times a year, similar to prime minister\u2019s questions in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThat would fundamentally change how the American people think about these issues and think about their leaders and think about common ground,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything can change. We\u2019ve seen that across history. Trends that you think are unshakeable get shaken, so we can change these trends. We just have to be committed to do it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/tulsi-gabbard-run-president-2020-democrat-hawaii\">Tulsi Gabbard: Democrat says she will run for president in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Delaney is the author of a book, The Right Answer, the title of which refers to <a href=\"https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/life-of-john-f-kennedy/john-f-kennedy-quotations\">a 1958 speech</a> in which Kennedy said: \u201cLet us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer.\u201d He is hoping to provide the antidote to the current hyperpartisan malaise.</p> <p>Viable candidates also need a personal narrative and <a href=\"https://www.johnkdelaney.com/about/\">Delaney has one</a>. \u201cI think I have the perfect background,\u201d he insists, while admitting he is hardly objective.

      "bodyText": "At an old electricity substation in north-west Washington, perhaps fittingly for the Donald Trump era, colourful murals of John F Kennedy have disappeared behind wooden boards for months, due to construction work. But a few minutes\u2019 walk away, past a Metro station, a bland shopping mall and the Maryland border, is the new election campaign headquarters of a man working hard and spending big in an attempt to assume the Kennedy mantle. Elizabeth Warren, Tulsi Gabbard and Juli\u00e1n Castro may now have stolen his thunder, but former congressman John Delaney was the first Democrat with national political experience to formally announce a 2020 presidential campaign. Hoping to prove that the early bird catches the worm, he did so all the way back in July 2017. He has been hustling for votes ever since, with a Kennedy-inspired message of common purpose. Critics, opinion polls and his campaign Twitter account (with just 12,000 followers) suggest he is more Don Quixote, embarked on a romantic but doomed quest. Delaney has made 21 trips to Iowa, the first caucus state, visiting all 99 counties and making 214 stops. He has also made 10 trips to New Hampshire, the first primary state, visiting seven counties and making 96 stops. Having spent $3.5m, recruited staff and opened offices, he has become Exhibit A for America\u2019s never-ending campaign, in stark contrast to the UK and other countries where general elections take a month or two, four or five years apart. \u201cI do think our election cycles are very long and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s great,\u201d admits the affable Delaney. But he reasons: \u201cThe presidency of the United States is a very unique elected position. So if anything merits a longer vetting process, the presidency does to some extent. In general our election cycles are too long, but this job is so consequential that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing to give people more time to get to know you.\u201d Weren\u2019t people sick of politics after the traumatic 2016 election? Not a bit of it. \u201cPeople were totally excited to talk about 2020,\u201d he says. \u201cDemocrats are quite excited to turn the page on the current president, so for most it\u2019s not too early to talk about 2020. Most Democrats are not saying, \u2018Well, let\u2019s give this guy a chance.\u2019 They\u2019re way past that. The notion of who\u2019s going to be our nominee in 2020 and how do we beat him is something every Democrat in this country really wants to talk about.\u201d \u2018A sense of stewardship\u2019 Another much scrutinised quirk of the American electoral system is the arbitrary power of Iowa and New Hampshire, neither representative of the country\u2019s racial diversity. Warren, a Massachusetts senator and the first major candidate to enter the contest after announcing an exploratory committee, earlier this month campaigned in Iowa until she went hoarse. There are still more than 650 days until election day. Again, Delaney defends a process that requires politicians to meet voters in their living rooms and coffee shops rather than run nationally. \u201cIf you had a primary on one day and everyone voted the same day they\u201d \u2013 he points to a big flatscreen TV showing cable news \u2013 \u201cwould determine the nominees. So I think there\u2019s a valuable role for a few states to go early and the states have to be of a size that you can actually campaign in them. You can\u2019t campaign in California in a grassroots way. It\u2019s too big. \u201cIowa and New Hampshire fit that size, and you get the sense that the people who are engaged in politics in Iowa and New Hampshire carry a sense of stewardship with them of the role they play. They don\u2019t actually think they pick the president. They think they ask the right questions and there\u2019s a valuable role for that.\u201d Delaney backed Hillary Clinton last time but offers an unexpected criticism: \u201cNeither Hillary or Bernie [Sanders] campaigned in Iowa or New Hampshire the way you\u2019re supposed to. They came and did big events. That\u2019s not what the people expect. They expect to sit down in small group gatherings and ask you questions.\u201d Recent research by the New York Times found that American elections have always been long, drawn out affairs by international standards. In 1960, Kennedy declared his candidacy 11 months before polling day. In 1992, Bill Clinton threw his hat in the ring more than a year ahead of the vote. For 2008, Republican John McCain formed his exploratory committee in November 2006. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton launched theirs in January 2007. For the epic 2016 election, it was December 2014 when Republican establishment favourite Jeb Bush said he would \u201cactively explore\u201d a bid. Senator Ted Cruz was the first major candidate to formally announce, in March 2015. Clinton entered the race a month later, followed in June by Trump\u2019s now infamous descent on a Trump Tower escalator. Delaney, however, has broken all records for hitting the ground running. His logic is simple: name recognition. \u201cI think I\u2019m the right person for the job,\u201d he said, \u201cand I have the right vision, but not enough people knew who I was and so the way to solve that problem is to get in early. To some extent the race is starting now and I had to almost run a pre-race so that I was in the game when the race started.\u201d Even so, it appears he will soon be joined by enough Democratic candidates to constitute a football team and a Broadway chorus. When Delaney finds himself on a crowded debate stage, how will he try to stand out? \u201cYou have to have tremendous clarity as to why you\u2019re running for president,\u201d he said. And why are you? \u201cThe central issue facing this country is how deeply divided we are and someone has to bring us together so that we can actually do the kind of things we need to do to prepare our country for the future. The world is changing so fast and we\u2019re just sitting on our hands and unless we actually get back to this notion of common purpose \u2013 which doesn\u2019t mean we agree with each other on everything, far from it, we should have great debates \u2013 but some notion of common purpose, I really worry about our future.\u201d Among his ideas is getting the president to debate on the floor of the House of Representatives four times a year, similar to prime minister\u2019s questions in the UK. \u201cThat would fundamentally change how the American people think about these issues and think about their leaders and think about common ground,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything can change. We\u2019ve seen that across history. Trends that you think are unshakeable get shaken, so we can change these trends. We just have to be committed to do it.\u201d Delaney is the author of a book, The Right Answer, the title of which refers to a 1958 speech in which Kennedy said: \u201cLet us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer.\u201d He is hoping to provide the antidote to the current hyperpartisan malaise. Viable candidates also need a personal narrative and Delaney has one. \u201cI think I have the perfect background,\u201d he insists, while admitting he is hardly objective. Born and raised in New Jersey, the son of an electrician, he describes himself as \u201ca blue-collar kid, first in the family to go to college\u201d, who went on to found two financial companies, becoming the youngest chief executive on the New York stock exchange. In 2012 Delaney \u201crolled up my sleeves and went into the Congress\u201d, showing willingness to work across the aisle. \u201cI\u2019ve had the experiences you need,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve lived the American dream. I know how the private sector works, but we should never elect someone who\u2019s never done public service as our our president, and I think we\u2019re seeing that with our current president.\u201d A hard sell to the left? A father of four daughters who enjoys watching the Washington Capitals ice hockey team, Delaney was the sixth-richest member of Congress with an estimated net worth of $93m. He is friends with Tom Steyer, the billionaire philanthropist seeking Trump\u2019s impeachment. His plush new campaign HQ in Friendship Heights, with campaign posters decorating cubicles for 35 staff, shares a floor with RBC Wealth Management. All of which means that the white, male 55-year-old centrist is a hard sell to the left. The progressive group Democracy for America\u2019s first presidential pulse poll was led by Sanders on 36.14%, followed by former vice-president Joe Biden at 14.87%. Delaney limped in 22nd, on 0.09%. Asked if Sanders or Warren can win the nomination, he replies carefully: \u201cI think that someone who comes forth and wants to build a big tent party has a better chance of winning. \u201cIf we as a Democratic party say we\u2019re going to become the party the American people are looking for, which is a party that\u2019s honest, civil, respectful, focusing on common ground, positive, optimistic and has big ideas about the future and welcomes progressives, centrists and disaffected Republicans, I think we\u2019ll run the table in 2020. If we step forward and say we\u2019re going to be the party of \u2018half the country is wrong about everything they believe\u2019 and drive further divisions, then we\u2019re not going to win.\u201d Delaney is likely to be up against African American candidates such as senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris. There are some who argue that a person of his gender and race is the last thing the party, which just elected its most diverse contingent to the House, needs in 2020. \u201cIf people feel that way, I respect their views,\u201d he says. \u201cI think their reasons for feeling that way are good intentions. Do I think that is where the whole party is? No, and that\u2019s for the Democratic voters. I tend to think that the American people in general and the Democratic party voters in particular make a deeper analysis of who they\u2019re looking for. \u201cYou could have someone who\u2019s an African American running for president who doesn\u2019t stand for any of the things that the Democratic party stands for. I just don\u2019t think the Democratic party is going to vote for someone because of the colour of their skin. They care about their values. They care what they\u2019re going to fight for. They care about their vision for the future.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Judy Murray, Andy\u2019s mum, was a guest on the most recent series of <em>A League of Their Own</em>, the sports panel show. She didn\u2019t say much (guests on the show never really do) and her main role was to giggle at jokes about her son. \u201cNo offence,\u201d said comedian Rob Beckett. \u201cAndy\u2019s an incredible tennis player, but he\u2019s not exactly Professor Bubbles when it comes to banter, is he?\u201d The audience laughed, although host James Corden admitted he wasn\u2019t clear exactly who Professor Bubbles was.</p> <p>It\u2019s strange how many of these misconceptions cling resiliently to Andy Murray, the 31-year-old tennis star who has announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jan/11/andy-murray-announces-impending-retirement-from-tennis-live\" title=\"\">he will retire</a> this year. That he has no sense of humour. That he prefers the US Open to Wimbledon. That he is somehow anti-English. Some people would choose never to forgive him for these failings, but for the vast majority of us he has became a national treasure, perhaps the greatest British sportsperson of modern times and a pioneer to boot.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that when he arrived on the scene in 2005, as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/11/andy-murray-from-gangly-kid-to-genuine-sporting-grown-up\" title=\"\">18-year-old wild card</a> at Wimbledon, he was hard to get a read on. Murray didn\u2019t look much like an athlete: too skinny, even scrawny. And he certainly didn\u2019t act like other British tennis players we knew; reaching the third round, he seemed to have a grit and a talent we hadn\u2019t seen before. In interviews, he could be blunt and combative. The Wimbledon faithful would respond by churlishly refusing to rename Henman Hill.</p> <p>But Murray won most of them over eventually. The simplest explanation for this is that he brought us success, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/jul/08/fred-perry-wimbledon-andy-murray-video\" title=\"\">a phenomenon</a> you\u2019d have had to be at least in your mid-80s to remember. He won Wimbledon thrillingly in 2013 and then with disconcerting ease in 2016; he also claimed the US Open, two Olympic golds and basically singlehandedly won the Davis Cup (though, a proud team player, he would hate that analysis).</p> <p>That, however, was only part of the reason we grew to love him. He softened a little and we learned to appreciate his honesty and wry humour. If you still don\u2019t think he\u2019s funny, watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR-LLVZYBMU\" title=\"\"><em>Andy Murray: The Movie</em></a>, a short he made with Richard Ayoade for Stand up to Cancer. Or the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andy_murray/status/548285821326217216?lang=en\" title=\"\">grinchy picture</a> in a festive jumper he posted in Christmas 2014.</p> <p>Murray has evolved into that rare thing: a thoughtful, opinionated sports-person who is prepared to speak his mind while still an active athlete. He is a staunch advocate for women\u2019s rights, whether it is supporting equal prize money or his appointment of the French ex-player Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo as his coach in 2014. As <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/andy-murray/andy-murray-building-modern-men_b_12730232.html?utm_hp_ref=uk\" title=\"\">guest editor</a> of Huffington Post UK, he commissioned a video of men talking about the last time they cried and encouraged them to open up about depression. The criticism he received in some quarters after his tearful announcement on Friday, notably from TalkSport presenter <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6581805/TalkSport-host-Alan-Brazil-branded-caveman-slamming-Andy-Murrays-tears.html\" title=\"\">Alan Brazil</a>, suggests that some men are still not comfortable with such openness.</p> <p>If Murray were, say, a Hollywood actor, he would be constantly pestered in interviews: \u201cAre you going to run for political office one day?\u201d He isn\u2019t, but maybe we should ask the question. So Andy, how about it?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Judy Murray, Andy\u2019s mum, was a guest on the most recent series of A League of Their Own, the sports panel show. She didn\u2019t say much (guests on the show never really do) and her main role was to giggle at jokes about her son. \u201cNo offence,\u201d said comedian Rob Beckett. \u201cAndy\u2019s an incredible tennis player, but he\u2019s not exactly Professor Bubbles when it comes to banter, is he?\u201d The audience laughed, although host James Corden admitted he wasn\u2019t clear exactly who Professor Bubbles was. It\u2019s strange how many of these misconceptions cling resiliently to Andy Murray, the 31-year-old tennis star who has announced that he will retire this year. That he has no sense of humour. That he prefers the US Open to Wimbledon. That he is somehow anti-English. Some people would choose never to forgive him for these failings, but for the vast majority of us he has became a national treasure, perhaps the greatest British sportsperson of modern times and a pioneer to boot. It\u2019s true that when he arrived on the scene in 2005, as an 18-year-old wild card at Wimbledon, he was hard to get a read on. Murray didn\u2019t look much like an athlete: too skinny, even scrawny. And he certainly didn\u2019t act like other British tennis players we knew; reaching the third round, he seemed to have a grit and a talent we hadn\u2019t seen before. In interviews, he could be blunt and combative. The Wimbledon faithful would respond by churlishly refusing to rename Henman Hill. But Murray won most of them over eventually. The simplest explanation for this is that he brought us success, a phenomenon you\u2019d have had to be at least in your mid-80s to remember. He won Wimbledon thrillingly in 2013 and then with disconcerting ease in 2016; he also claimed the US Open, two Olympic golds and basically singlehandedly won the Davis Cup (though, a proud team player, he would hate that analysis). That, however, was only part of the reason we grew to love him. He softened a little and we learned to appreciate his honesty and wry humour. If you still don\u2019t think he\u2019s funny, watch Andy Murray: The Movie, a short he made with Richard Ayoade for Stand up to Cancer. Or the grinchy picture in a festive jumper he posted in Christmas 2014. Murray has evolved into that rare thing: a thoughtful, opinionated sports-person who is prepared to speak his mind while still an active athlete. He is a staunch advocate for women\u2019s rights, whether it is supporting equal prize money or his appointment of the French ex-player Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo as his coach in 2014. As guest editor of Huffington Post UK, he commissioned a video of men talking about the last time they cried and encouraged them to open up about depression. The criticism he received in some quarters after his tearful announcement on Friday, notably from TalkSport presenter Alan Brazil, suggests that some men are still not comfortable with such openness. If Murray were, say, a Hollywood actor, he would be constantly pestered in interviews: \u201cAre you going to run for political office one day?\u201d He isn\u2019t, but maybe we should ask the question. So Andy, how about it?",

Tony has to perform two tasks \u2013 take his daughter Meadow to a college admissions interview and knock off fugitive informant Febby Petrulio \u2013 without letting his worlds collide.</p> <p>Showrunner David Chase wanted Tony to garrotte Febby but HBO CEO, Chris Albrecht, blenched. Although HBO had been bold enough to pick up the show after every network had rejected it, Albrecht feared that viewers wouldn\u2019t root for a protagonist who strangled a man in cold blood. That didn\u2019t happen in 1999. Chase responded that if Tony didn\u2019t do it, \u201che\u2019s full of shit and therefore the show\u2019s full of shit\u201d. He got his way. Viewers loved it.

Tony has to perform two tasks \u2013 take his daughter Meadow to a college admissions interview and knock off fugitive informant Febby Petrulio \u2013 without letting his worlds collide. Showrunner David Chase wanted Tony to garrotte Febby but HBO CEO, Chris Albrecht, blenched. Although HBO had been bold enough to pick up the show after every network had rejected it, Albrecht feared that viewers wouldn\u2019t root for a protagonist who strangled a man in cold blood. That didn\u2019t happen in 1999. Chase responded that if Tony didn\u2019t do it, \u201che\u2019s full of shit and therefore the show\u2019s full of shit\u201d. He got his way. Viewers loved it.

After all, she is a mere woman and I was concerned that she would do something stupid or feminine. (Same thing?) Instead, armed with only decades of professional experience, Bruce skilfully did the job that she was asked to do, asking questions, being firm with panellists, steering the debate, without once talking about her feelings. It\u2019s just amazing what women can do these days \u2013 serious television gigs aren\u2019t so easy when you haven\u2019t got the right male body parts to command instant respect...</p> \n<p>That\u2019s quite enough snark. I had some thoughts about Bruce\u2019s previous stint on <em>Antiques Roadshow</em> but I\u2019ll leave that to whoever covers the <em>Question Time</em> where Jeremy Corbyn appears in that adorable dusty Breton mariner\u2019s cap. (\u201cWhat\u2019s that worthless relic you\u2019ve got dangling beneath your hat?\u201d). I\u2019m more minded to talk about sexism, specifically, the kind of thinly veiled sexism that tends to dart about in the shadows, in the manner of a media-cum-Twitter Nosferatu whenever a woman takes over a man\u2019s job.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/11/fiona-bruce-proves-safe-hands-with-national-treasure-question-time\">Fiona Bruce acclaimed for cool, calm Question Time debut</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Admittedly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/22/david-dimbleby-rebuffs-sneering-john-humphrys-in-interview\" title=\"\">David Dimbleby</a> was the <em>Question Time</em> anchor for a quarter of a century, so anyone taking over, male or female, would have felt the heat. Arguably though, Bruce, the first permanent female host in the show\u2019s 40-year history, received rather more scrutiny.

      "bodyText": "Phew. Let\u2019s be thankful that Fiona Bruce didn\u2019t mess up during her first outing as host on Question Time. By Bruce messing up, I mean, by crying, becoming hysterical, fiddling with her bra strap, that kind of thing. After all, she is a mere woman and I was concerned that she would do something stupid or feminine. (Same thing?) Instead, armed with only decades of professional experience, Bruce skilfully did the job that she was asked to do, asking questions, being firm with panellists, steering the debate, without once talking about her feelings. It\u2019s just amazing what women can do these days \u2013 serious television gigs aren\u2019t so easy when you haven\u2019t got the right male body parts to command instant respect... That\u2019s quite enough snark. I had some thoughts about Bruce\u2019s previous stint on Antiques Roadshow but I\u2019ll leave that to whoever covers the Question Time where Jeremy Corbyn appears in that adorable dusty Breton mariner\u2019s cap. (\u201cWhat\u2019s that worthless relic you\u2019ve got dangling beneath your hat?\u201d). I\u2019m more minded to talk about sexism, specifically, the kind of thinly veiled sexism that tends to dart about in the shadows, in the manner of a media-cum-Twitter Nosferatu whenever a woman takes over a man\u2019s job. Admittedly, David Dimbleby was the Question Time anchor for a quarter of a century, so anyone taking over, male or female, would have felt the heat. Arguably though, Bruce, the first permanent female host in the show\u2019s 40-year history, received rather more scrutiny. The fuss was at once funny and deeply tiring and not just because, beforehand, we had to endure what was frequently (and doubtless falsely) portrayed as some kind of TV lady catfight between other female presenters in the running for the role. When Bruce took over, it was genuinely interesting to see how she\u2019d play it, but that should have been it, so far as suspense went. It wasn\u2019t her first presenting gig and she has a news background \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as though she\u2019d been drafted in from CBeebies or Hollyoaks.

However, among the genuine, deserved accolades, was there the occasional malodorous whiff of \u201cdidn\u2019t the little lady do well?\u201d.

Back on Planet Sane, even if Bruce hadn\u2019t done well, even if she\u2019d done horribly, it would have had nothing to do with her sex. So bravo, Ms Bruce, the first female presenter of Question Time \u2013 it should only take certain people another 40 years to get over the novelty. Breaking up is never easy to do... but the megabucks help Admit it, the super-rich split up better than the rest of us. They \u201cplay nice\u201d, at least in public.

It symbolises the perceived failure of established elites to comprehend, let alone solve, the \u201cproblem\u201d. It is a potent electoral weapon. When Salvini talks of a rebooted Europe founded on \u201cnew blood, new strength, new energy\u201d, there are unmistakable rhetorical echoes of another benighted era of instability, of another crazed demagogue, of another pan-European crisis of leadership and legitimacy. The way things are going, perhaps they should be praying in Brussels for a repeat in May of 2014\u2019s record low turnout. Or perhaps we should all put our hands to our ears and scream. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is an Observer writer",

The French education minister <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/france-gives-tired-pupils-given-extra-hour-in-bed-8jz5d5fgm\">approved a proposal</a> to push back by an hour the start of the school day to 9am for students aged 15-18 in Paris.</p> <p>It followed the publication in December of a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/12/181212140741.htm\">study of teenagers in Seattle</a> which found a \u201csignificant improvement in the sleep duration of students\u201d after the start of the school day was delayed by almost an hour.</p> <p>\u201cThe Paris decision can only be a good thing for the children,\u201d said Dr Neil Stanley, author of <em tabindex=\"-1\">How To Sleep Well,</em> who has noted increasing sleep problems in children and teenagers. \u201cFor the benefit of our children start times should be moved later, bringing them more in line with teenagers\u2019 biological rhythms.\u201d</p> <p>Mandy Gurney, founder of Millpond Children\u2019s Sleep Clinic, has seen a 30% rise in referrals of school-aged children in the last 12 months. Lisa Artis of the Sleep Council also said there had been a \u201cnoticeable rise\u201d in sleep deprivation among school children. \u201cA change in the school day would be beneficial to teenagers, but it would take a massive campaign for it to happen. The school day is designed to fit in with the standard working day.\u201d</p> <p>School leaders are increasingly raising concerns about overtired children, both in secondary schools and the upper end of primary schools, according to James Bowen, director of NAHT Edge, an offshoot of the head teachers\u2019 union.</p> <p>But there was not enough \u201chard evidence\u201d to justify the \u201cdrastic step\u201d of changing school hours, he added. \u201cThe bottom line is that school leaders are very interested in any approach that may have a positive impact on pupils\u2019 learning, but there are significant logistical barriers to changing the school day\u201d especially for working families, he said.</p> <p>The Education Endowment Foundation funds Teensleep, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and-evaluation/projects/teensleep/\">a research project</a> by Oxford and Durham universities. Teensleep wanted to evaluate the impact of a later start to the school day, but not enough schools signed up for a trial. Now it is examining the consequences of \u201csleep education\u201d in schools, with the results due to be published in the spring.</p> <p>Guidance in providing sleep lessons for pupils aged seven to 16 was rolled out to teachers last month.</p> <p>Scientists say that humans\u2019 circadian rhythms \u2013 the body clock that manages the cycle of sleep and wakefulness \u2013 change in adolescence. The cycle shifts two hours in teenagers which means that they are wired to go to sleep and wake up later. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re in a different time zone,\u201d said Dr Michael Farquhar, a consultant in paediatric sleep medicine at the Evelina children\u2019s hospital in London.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re asking them to get up before their body clock is ready, because that\u2019s the way the adult world works. So most teenagers end up sleep-deprived.\u201d</p> <p>Sleep is the \u201cstrongest predictor of wellbeing among teenagers\u201d, said Russell Viner, professor of adolescent health at University College London and president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.</p> <p>He co-authored a paper, <a href=\"https://bmjpaedsopen.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000335\">published in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> in November</a>, based on a study of more than 120,000 15-year-olds which pointed to increasing evidence of the dangers of inadequate sleep.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we think about all the things parents worry about, the effects of sleep are about four times higher than the effects of smartphone use,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is major development of the brain in puberty. We need to go back to basics: more focus on sleep, physical activity and diet.\u201d</p> <p>Farquhar said: \u201cIf we could rewire the world to suit teenagers, we\u2019d see benefits. But there are practical difficulties in doing that. So, as a start, schools could not schedule double maths at 8.30am and perhaps make PE the first lesson of the day.\u201d</p>",

It followed the publication in December of a study of teenagers in Seattle which found a \u201csignificant improvement in the sleep duration of students\u201d after the start of the school day was delayed by almost an hour. \u201cThe Paris decision can only be a good thing for the children,\u201d said Dr Neil Stanley, author of How To Sleep Well, who has noted increasing sleep problems in children and teenagers. \u201cFor the benefit of our children start times should be moved later, bringing them more in line with teenagers\u2019 biological rhythms.\u201d Mandy Gurney, founder of Millpond Children\u2019s Sleep Clinic, has seen a 30% rise in referrals of school-aged children in the last 12 months. Lisa Artis of the Sleep Council also said there had been a \u201cnoticeable rise\u201d in sleep deprivation among school children. \u201cA change in the school day would be beneficial to teenagers, but it would take a massive campaign for it to happen. The school day is designed to fit in with the standard working day.\u201d School leaders are increasingly raising concerns about overtired children, both in secondary schools and the upper end of primary schools, according to James Bowen, director of NAHT Edge, an offshoot of the head teachers\u2019 union. But there was not enough \u201chard evidence\u201d to justify the \u201cdrastic step\u201d of changing school hours, he added. \u201cThe bottom line is that school leaders are very interested in any approach that may have a positive impact on pupils\u2019 learning, but there are significant logistical barriers to changing the school day\u201d especially for working families, he said. The Education Endowment Foundation funds Teensleep, a research project by Oxford and Durham universities. Teensleep wanted to evaluate the impact of a later start to the school day, but not enough schools signed up for a trial. Now it is examining the consequences of \u201csleep education\u201d in schools, with the results due to be published in the spring. Guidance in providing sleep lessons for pupils aged seven to 16 was rolled out to teachers last month. Scientists say that humans\u2019 circadian rhythms \u2013 the body clock that manages the cycle of sleep and wakefulness \u2013 change in adolescence. The cycle shifts two hours in teenagers which means that they are wired to go to sleep and wake up later. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re in a different time zone,\u201d said Dr Michael Farquhar, a consultant in paediatric sleep medicine at the Evelina children\u2019s hospital in London. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them to get up before their body clock is ready, because that\u2019s the way the adult world works. So most teenagers end up sleep-deprived.\u201d Sleep is the \u201cstrongest predictor of wellbeing among teenagers\u201d, said Russell Viner, professor of adolescent health at University College London and president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. He co-authored a paper, published in the British Medical Journal in November, based on a study of more than 120,000 15-year-olds which pointed to increasing evidence of the dangers of inadequate sleep. \u201cWhen we think about all the things parents worry about, the effects of sleep are about four times higher than the effects of smartphone use,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is major development of the brain in puberty. We need to go back to basics: more focus on sleep, physical activity and diet.\u201d Farquhar said: \u201cIf we could rewire the world to suit teenagers, we\u2019d see benefits. But there are practical difficulties in doing that. So, as a start, schools could not schedule double maths at 8.30am and perhaps make PE the first lesson of the day.\u201d",

A fully toqued Chinese chef lays it on a board table-side and sets to work, first taking off a thin layer of fatless skin, presented in squares with a bowl of sugar to dip it in. We pluck away daintily with our chopsticks, and ooh and sigh, because this cost \u00a3100. The least we can do is look like we are enjoying our act of conspicuous consumption. They bring bamboo steamer baskets of hand-shaped pancakes, alongside shredded spring onions, cucumber and hoisin sauce. All is good. Here are slices of the duck, and yes, it\u2019s delightful: soft meat, crisp skin, the liquorice, soy and caramel kick of the hoisin.</p> <p>As I eat, I glance at the duck. Hurrah. There is so much more to go. The legs have barely been touched. There\u2019s a ballast of glistening skin and meat around the arse end, and more around its back. Suddenly the chef lays down his blade, picks up the platter, bows and walks off back to the kitchen. Hang on a second. That bird is barely half-cut. I paid a ton for it. And you\u2019re taking it away? At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/04/chinese-restaurant-london-w8\" title=\"\">Min Jiang</a> on the top floor of the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington where the dish costs \u00a372 and is also available by the half, the meat returns in a second service, perhaps as a stir fry or in a soup.

      "bodyText": "Imperial Treasure, 9 Waterloo Place, London SW1Y 4BE (020 3011 1328). Starters \u00a312-\u00a336. Main courses \u00a318-\u00a3100+. Peking Duck \u00a3100. Desserts \u00a37.50. Wines from \u00a338 There is an assumption that the more you spend on an experience, the better it will be. I am forever guilty of such a delusion, borne more of hopefulness than stupidity. Few things give the lie to this better than the grinding, laboured, thudding mediocrity of a meal at Imperial Treasure, the London outpost of a gilded Chinese restaurant group which is to joy, what a public enema is to dignity. It is the manner in which they serve their \u201csignature\u201d Peking duck which most spectacularly deadens the soul, though why anybody would want to sign this beats me. Granted, Peking duck can be a truly marvellous thing. If your only experience of the Chinese way with duck is the aromatic crispy variety, the crowd-pleasing effect achieved via a journey through the deep fat fryer, then consider the joys to come. Peking duck is aromatic crispy duck\u2019s grown-up sibling, the one that\u2019s been to finishing school and learnt a few manners. Often, it must be ordered in advance, for this is cooking as performance: the bird must be steamed or plunged into boiling water, dried, seasoned and left to hang for 24 hours before being roasted so that the skin becomes like amber glass. And yes, it costs. Here, it\u2019s \u00a3100. Ouch. But look, this is Imperial Treasure. It occupies a huge marbled space just off Pall Mall, with ceilings so high they are hidden in the shadows. It is decorated in sexy strips of textured, golden wood, soft leather and finely chiselled hubris. The website announces they have Michelin stars at their other restaurants in China. Hug yourself with pleasure, sell a kidney, or plunder a former Soviet central Asian state. You might as well. Many of the clientele who can afford this place probably will have done. For here it comes and oh, what a beauty, shimmering gold and copper and bronze. Do we eat this bird or hang it on the wall?

The Don was plagued by ill-health, though. Federer has been blessed in every way.</p> <p>\u201cHis body took the decision, unfortunately,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI remember when I played with him in Glasgow [in late 2017, as Murray contemplated a comeback], I couldn\u2019t believe he actually played. But it was for a good cause. It must have been a very long couple of years for him. I was disappointed and sad, a little bit shocked, to know now that we\u2019re going to lose him at some point. I hope that he can play a good Australian Open and can keep playing beyond that, finish the way he wants to at Wimbledon.\u201d</p> <p>Those are noble sentiments. The reality is Murray is near breaking point. Only more surgery could prolong his career. There is no defying the calendar.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Maybe it\u2019s also the way I play tennis, smoother than the other guys</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Largely immune to the ravages of time himself, the defending champion \u2013 who plays Denis Istomin on Monday evening - described on Sunday how players slowly crumble as the years pass.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s say when you\u2019re young, you have, I don\u2019t know, a pain in the elbow. Next day you can play with it; two days later it\u2019s like you never had it. All of a sudden \u2013 at maybe 30, 35, 40, depending on who you are, what problems you\u2019ve had \u2013 you will feel it for two weeks. You can still play, but now you\u2019re playing with pain. It takes longer to get rid of.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody is very different. Everybody takes the pain differently. That\u2019s also where you have to be very wise [about] what kind of schedule you\u2019re playing with, what problem you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p> <p>So, how has the Methuselah of sport held the demons at bay for so long?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"699926c0590d46e9328edd5b2af00284d35f2c2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/699926c0590d46e9328edd5b2af00284d35f2c2f/0_0_4118_2546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Switzerland\u2019s Roger Federer prepares to serve during a practice session before the Australian Open tennis championships in Melbourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"618\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Switzerland\u2019s Roger Federer prepares to serve during a practice session before the Australian Open tennis championships in Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you look at how unlucky things were with the incident here a few years ago when I ran the bath, I guess the knee was ready to go.

You also need a bit of luck.</p> <p>\u201cThen, I understand my body very well. I know when something hurts and I can play with it; I know when something hurts and I should not play with it, but I can still play maybe a match, maybe a week, a month, whatever. Sometimes that helps. But every player has that. My team know when to push me, when they are happy that I don\u2019t practise so much.\u201d</p> <p>The core difference between Federer and his rivals is his unshakeable belief in his talent, to trust his genius.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always believed I can play tennis when I don\u2019t train so much,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been maybe one thing, the confidence I have in my game, even if I don\u2019t play so much, where I still feel I can come up to a good level.

It maybe looks that way [but] I work extremely hard in the matches as well. It just doesn\u2019t come across so much.\u201d</p> <p>Now he has to deliver again to launch another assault on history. In the last match of day one on Rod Laver Arena, where he has celebrated most of his 94 wins here in 107 matches stretching back to the turn of the millennium, he plays Istomin for the seventh time. The world No99 has taken just two sets off him, both in front of Federer\u2019s Swiss friends in Basel, in their last two meetings.</p> <p>Two years ago, though, he put an ailing Novak Djokovic out in five sets in the first round, his only success against the Serb in six attempts.</p> <p>Federer says, \u201cI know what Denis did to Novak. I watched the entire game. I\u2019ve had some tough ones against him in the past. He can play well on fast courts, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be here as well. But I\u2019m playing good tennis. I\u2019m confident it needs a good performance by my opponent to beat me.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Roger Federer, who is ageing with the irresistible longevity of an oak tree, is the very antithesis of Andy Murray. While the Scot\u2019s 31-year-old body screams at him every morning when he puts on his socks and shoes, and whose match against Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open might round out his career, Federer, at 37, continues to float on his own cloud. His younger contemporaries are suffering to the point of resignation in the struggle to stay in a sport that has become cruelly brutal, yet Federer appears to be what Alex Corretja described Murray as when coaching him at his physical peak between 2008 and 2011: \u201cindestructible.\u201d The Swiss has had his aches and pains \u2013 even late-career knee surgery \u2013 but, as he sets about chasing a seventh Australian Open championship and the 100th title of a career that began last century, astonishingly he is among the fittest of the 128 contenders. There has only ever been one player named Federer in tennis, just as there was only one Bradman in cricket. The Don was plagued by ill-health, though. Federer has been blessed in every way. \u201cHis body took the decision, unfortunately,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI remember when I played with him in Glasgow [in late 2017, as Murray contemplated a comeback], I couldn\u2019t believe he actually played. But it was for a good cause. It must have been a very long couple of years for him. I was disappointed and sad, a little bit shocked, to know now that we\u2019re going to lose him at some point. I hope that he can play a good Australian Open and can keep playing beyond that, finish the way he wants to at Wimbledon.\u201d Those are noble sentiments. The reality is Murray is near breaking point. Only more surgery could prolong his career. There is no defying the calendar. Largely immune to the ravages of time himself, the defending champion \u2013 who plays Denis Istomin on Monday evening - described on Sunday how players slowly crumble as the years pass. \u201cLet\u2019s say when you\u2019re young, you have, I don\u2019t know, a pain in the elbow. Next day you can play with it; two days later it\u2019s like you never had it. All of a sudden \u2013 at maybe 30, 35, 40, depending on who you are, what problems you\u2019ve had \u2013 you will feel it for two weeks. You can still play, but now you\u2019re playing with pain. It takes longer to get rid of. \u201cEverybody is very different. Everybody takes the pain differently. That\u2019s also where you have to be very wise [about] what kind of schedule you\u2019re playing with, what problem you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d So, how has the Methuselah of sport held the demons at bay for so long? \u201cIf you look at how unlucky things were with the incident here a few years ago when I ran the bath, I guess the knee was ready to go. Could easily have happened in the match against Novak [Djokovic], but it didn\u2019t, maybe because I was warmed up. I have no idea what happened. You also need a bit of luck. \u201cThen, I understand my body very well. I know when something hurts and I can play with it; I know when something hurts and I should not play with it, but I can still play maybe a match, maybe a week, a month, whatever. Sometimes that helps. But every player has that. My team know when to push me, when they are happy that I don\u2019t practise so much.\u201d The core difference between Federer and his rivals is his unshakeable belief in his talent, to trust his genius. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed I can play tennis when I don\u2019t train so much,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been maybe one thing, the confidence I have in my game, even if I don\u2019t play so much, where I still feel I can come up to a good level. Maybe that takes away some pressure.\u201d He added \u2013 confirming the silent thoughts of everyone in the room \u2013 that, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s also the way I play tennis, smoother than the other guys. It maybe looks that way [but] I work extremely hard in the matches as well. It just doesn\u2019t come across so much.\u201d Now he has to deliver again to launch another assault on history. In the last match of day one on Rod Laver Arena, where he has celebrated most of his 94 wins here in 107 matches stretching back to the turn of the millennium, he plays Istomin for the seventh time. The world No99 has taken just two sets off him, both in front of Federer\u2019s Swiss friends in Basel, in their last two meetings. Two years ago, though, he put an ailing Novak Djokovic out in five sets in the first round, his only success against the Serb in six attempts. Federer says, \u201cI know what Denis did to Novak. I watched the entire game. I\u2019ve had some tough ones against him in the past. He can play well on fast courts, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be here as well. But I\u2019m playing good tennis. I\u2019m confident it needs a good performance by my opponent to beat me.\u201d",

I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s warm relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has long set alarm bells ringing. The day after firing Comey, he hosted Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in the Oval Office \u2013 and disclosed intelligence from an Israeli counterterrorism operation. At a summit in Helsinki last summer, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/16/trump-finds-putin-denial-of-election-meddling-powerful\">appeared to side with Putin</a> over his own intelligence agencies on the question of election interference.</p> <p>On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that Trump took the notes from of a 2017 meeting with Putin in Hamburg from his own interpreter. Citing current and former US officials, the paper also said Trump instructed the linguist not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials.</p> <p>Asked why he would not release the conversations, Trump said: \u201cI would.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has strongly denied the stunning claim that he was secretly working on behalf of Russia and again threatened to declare a national emergency to fund a border wall. In 20-minute live phone interview with Fox News on Saturday night, he described as an \u201cinsult\u201d the New York Times story that alleged the FBI launched an investigation into whether the he was acting as a Russian asset, against his own country\u2019s interests. Trump said the story, which claimed the investigation opened after Trump fired the FBI director James Comey in May 2017, was \u201cthe most insulting article ever written\u201d. \u201cIf you read the article you\u2019ll see that they found absolutely nothing,\u201d he said during the Fox News interview. \u201cI think [the story] was a great insult and the New York Times is a disaster of a paper. It\u2019s a very horrible thing they said.\u201d Citing anonymous sources, the Times said the investigation was part counterintelligence, to determine whether Trump was knowingly or unknowingly working for Moscow and posed a threat to national security. It was also part criminal, to ascertain whether Trump\u2019s dismissal of Comey constituted obstruction of justice. The FBI effort was soon absorbed into the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Moscow, the Times reported, adding that it was unclear if the counterintelligence aspect is still being pursued. The president again called Comey a \u201cliar\u201d and claimed the entire Russia investigation was a \u201cterrible hoax\u201d. \u201cEverybody knows it. It\u2019s really a shame because it takes time; it takes effort. Everybody knows there\u2019s no collusion,\u201d he said. Trump repeated baseless claims that the FBI mishandled an investigation into his election rival, Hillary Clinton. The president insisted that he had been far tougher on Russia than any other president, repeating claims he tweeted earlier on Saturday. \u201cI have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMaybe tougher than any other President. At the same time, &amp; as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!\u201d Trump\u2019s warm relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has long set alarm bells ringing. The day after firing Comey, he hosted Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in the Oval Office \u2013 and disclosed intelligence from an Israeli counterterrorism operation. At a summit in Helsinki last summer, Trump appeared to side with Putin over his own intelligence agencies on the question of election interference. On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that Trump took the notes from of a 2017 meeting with Putin in Hamburg from his own interpreter. Citing current and former US officials, the paper also said Trump instructed the linguist not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials. Asked why he would not release the conversations, Trump said: \u201cI would. I don\u2019t care ... I\u2019m not keeping anything under wraps. I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d In December the president startled his own national security officials by suddenly announcing the withdrawal of troops from Syria, widely seen as handing a strategic victory to Russia and prompting the defense secretary James Mattis to quit. He also bizarrely endorsed the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. The House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, said in a statement he did not \u201ccomment on the specifics of the New York Times report\u201d but said \u201ccounterintelligence concerns about those associated with the Trump campaign, including the president himself, have been at the heart of our investigation since the beginning\u201d. His committee, he said, \u201chas a responsibility to the American people to ensure that the president is working in our national interest and is not motivated by any other factor\u201d. Holed up at the White House, Trump turned to the other subject dominating US politics: the partial government shutdown which, going into its 23rd day, is now the longest in history, eclipsing the record set under Bill Clinton. He called on the Democrats to do a deal and again threatened to declare a national emergency if they don\u2019t \u201ccome to their senses\u201d. \u201cI have the absolute right to call a national emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cOther presidents have called national emergencies for lesser importance than this.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check out the report off today\u2019s game. The Colts take over from their own 35 and put together a nice consolation drive, moving it all the way down to the Kansas City 11. But the clock runs out before they can even take a crack at the end zone. Appropriate. The Chiefs were in control from wire to wire and play in the AFC championship game for the first time in 25 years \u2013 and their first ever at Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs take over from their own 39 with under five minutes to go and begin taking chunks of yardage one after another. The drive stalls at the Indianapolis 38, but a (dubious) running into the kicker penalty against Najee Goode gives Kansas City another first down with 3:42 remaining. One minute later Darien Williams is into the end zone on a six-yard rush up the gut, completing a game-sealing scoring drive of nine plays and 56 yards. That should do it. TOUCHDOWN! Indianapolis 13-24 Kansas City 5:31, 4th quarter Another Luck pass is knocked down at the line of scrimmage and the Colts fall to 0-for-8 on third down. It\u2019s 4th and 9 from the Kansas City 41 with less than six minutes to go. This feels like it could be the ball game. And Luck completes a 12-yard pass to Rogers, moving the sticks and keeping Indy\u2019s season alive. Then one play later Luck finds TY Hilton in the front left corner of the end zone for a 29-yard touchdown! And this stadium has been silenced! Vinatieri comes out for the extra point and he misses it! This time it sails right of the goalpost. Shocking. Indianapolis 7-24 Kansas City 8:45, 4th quarter It\u2019s a quick three-and-out for the Chiefs, who exhaust just about two minutes of game clock before returning possession to the Colts. A booming 50-yard punt by Colquitt pins Indianapolis back to their own 13. Indianapolis 7-24 Kansas City 10:55, 4th quarter The Colts manage a scant 11 yards on five plays before they\u2019re forced to punt. Kansas City\u2019s Steven Nelson dropped an interception on 3rd and 15 that would have been a touchdown. So it\u2019s not all bad. Indianapolis 7-24 Kansas City 12:11, 4th quarter Another Kansas City drive stalls when Mahomes is sacked by Kenny Moore II on 3rd and 7 at the Indianapolis 34. That forces a Colquitt punt and the Colts will have another chance to get back in this game, but they\u2019re running out of time and will need to put something on the board soon. The time of possession tells you everything you need to know: 31:45 for Kansas City, 13:15 for Indianapolis. Fifteen minutes to go and the Chiefs are in excellent shape. Only real question, it seems, is whether they\u2019ll catch the fan caught by NBC\u2019s cameras throwing a snowball onto the field. Indianapolis 7-24 Kansas City 0:50, 3rd quarter The Colts keep possession for all of 10 seconds before Luck is sacked by Dee Ford for a nine-yard loss on 2nd and 9 and fumbles it away. Ford scoops it up and the Chiefs will take over from their own 32. Indianapolis 7-24 Kansas City 1:05, 3rd quarter The Chiefs take over from their own 20 and Mahomes completes a pass to Sammy Walkins, but he fumbles as he\u2019s dragged down and it\u2019s recovered by Darius Leonard. Another huge break for Indianapolis. Can they make something of it? Indianapolis 7-24 Kansas City 1:06, 3rd quarter A good start for the Colts, who immediately cross midfield after a 20-yard completion to Inman. On the next play Marlon Mack runs for three yards, then busts free up the middle for a 14-yard gain ... but it\u2019s coming back on a holding penalty. Nothing going right for Indy today. Luck completes for 11 yards to TY Hilton on 2nd and 17, but Kansas City\u2019s Justin Houston wraps him up for a 12-yard sack on third down and the Colts will punt yet again. Indianapolis 7-24 Kansas City 8:40, 3rd quarter The Colts go with the no-huddle offense, not simply due to the three-possession deficit but because it worked so well for them during the two-minute drill to close the first half. Alas, they make it only to their own 37 before they\u2019re forced to punt. Indy falls to 0-for-5 on third-down conversions on the day. Not ideal. Indianapolis 7-24 Kansas City 8:40, 3rd quarter The Chiefs will start on their own 14 after the kickoff and they\u2019ve picked up right where they left off in the first half, mixing up the rush and the pass with aplomb and crossing midfield. A botched snap and fumble on 1st and 10 from the Indianapolis 49 sets up 2nd and 17 and the Colts have a golden opportunity to get the Chiefs off the field, but Mahomes whips an outrageous sidearm pass for a 15-yard gain to Travis Kelce. The third-down play comes up short but the Chiefs convert on 4th and 1, marching further into Indianapolis territory. The Colts manage to hold again, however, forcing the Chiefs into a 4th and 5th from the 33 and this time forcing Mahomes into an incompletion. Yet thanks to an off-color unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after the flag, they\u2019ll take over on their own 18 after the break. It\u2019s a tall order for the Colts, who trail by 17 points and will kick off to the Chiefs to start the second half. Before we write them off completely, however, it was only five years ago when Andrew Luck led Indianapolis back from a 38-10 second-half deficit to a 45-44 win over these same Chiefs. The 28-point comeback was the second largest in NFL playoff history. While we wait for the start of the second half, enjoy this photo of Kansas City legend smoking a cigarette and drinking a Fresca during halftime of Super Bowl I. Indianapolis 7-24 Kansas City 0:00, 2nd quarter The Colts take over from their own 20 after the touchback. One hundred seconds for Luck and he makes the most of them, completing passes to Eric Ebron, Dontrelle Inman and Carlos Rogers. Finally, signs of life. Luck marches Indy within five yards of the end zone before time pressure forces the field goal unit onto the field. It\u2019s a chip shot from 23 yards for Adam Vinatieri ... and it hits the left upright! Oh no! An eight-play, 70-yard drive for the Colts and they walk away with nothing. Vinatieri, the longtime New England kicker who famously scored the game-tying and game-winning field goals in a snowstorm against the Raiders in the Tuck Rule game back in January 2002, can\u2019t deliver from extra-point range ... a detail not lost on longtime Oakland defensive back Charles Woodson. This Kansas City offense sure is something. Patrick Mahomes leads the Chiefs on a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown drive, delivering the score himself on a four-yard scramble to the right pylon and brushing aside whatever momentum Indianapolis might have wrested after their special teams surprise. Guess the knee is OK. The Chiefs have 18 first downs. The Colts have *checks notes* zero. The Indianapolis defense finally holds and forces Kansas City to punt from their own 19 ... and they get just the break they so desperately need when Dustin Colquitt\u2019s punt is blocked by Najee Goode, who burst through the line practically unmolested. The ball dribbles backward past the goal line and Indy\u2019s Zach Pascal is there to fall on it for the touchdown. Wow. A rare special teams blunder for the Chiefs and they\u2019re back in the game despite having not recorded a single first down in the first half so far. Indianapolis 0-17 Kansas City 10:06, 2nd quarter And it\u2019s a fourth consecutive three-and-out for Indianapolis, who can\u2019t get anything going on offense. Luck actually completed a pass to Eric Ebron on 3rd and 6, but the wide receiver ran his route about a yard short of the sticks. I\u2019m talking ugly. Good news about Mahomes, though. It appears the injury wasn\u2019t as bad as it looked. The Indy defense manages to keep the Chiefs out of the end zone, but Harrison Butker drills a 39-yard field goal to cap a 15-play, 48-yard scoring drive and open a three-possession lead. A hush fell over the stadium when Mahomes went down in a cluster of white jerseys and appeared to injure his knee. He stayed in the game to finish the drive, but limped off the field as the field goal team came on. The Chiefs, who start from their own 26 after the kickoff, are on the march once more. They dink and dunk across midfield before they\u2019re forced into a 4th and 1 on the Indianapolis 35, but Reid decides to go for it and Damien Williams converts on a four-yard rush. Another Williams rush, this one for two yards, brings us to the end of the first quarter. The numbers aren\u2019t pretty: Kansas City outgained Indy by a 185-12 margin in the opening frame. Then there\u2019s this. I\u2019m not sure I see it. Indianapolis 0-14 Kansas City 4:21, 1st quarter It\u2019s a third consecutive three-and-out for the Colts after Luck is sacked by the Chiefs\u2019 Justin Houston for a three-yard loss on 3rd and 2. They\u2019ve run nine plays from scrimmage for a grand total of 12 yards. The Colts are getting protection and giving Luck time to throw, but the Chiefs\u2019 man-to-man coverage has been well-drilled and airtight. The horror show continues for the Colts. Mahomes leads the Chiefs on an eight-play, 70-yard touchdown drive capped by a bit of trickery: wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who set a franchise record with 1,479 receiving yards during the regular season, takes the handoff on a lead reverse and darts 36 yards to paydirt. This could well be a first-round knockout if Indianapolis, who have generated an anemic seven yards from six plays, can\u2019t manage a response here. Indianapolis 0-7 Kansas City 9:32, 1st quarter The Colts take over from their own 26 after a nice 24-yard return by Zach Pascal, but it\u2019s another three-and-out for the visitors as Luck attempts three passes and all three are batted down by the Chiefs defense. The 33-second drive is over before it can practically start and Kansas City will have a chance to open things up early. Remember: the Chiefs have scored 16 touchdowns and averaged 7.5 yards per play on their opening two drives this year, both NFL bests. Well, that was quick. The Chiefs march straight down the field: a five-play, 90-yard touchdown drive capped by Damien Williams\u2019 10-yard touchdown scamper off the right tackle. Mahomes was 3-for-3 for 61 yards passing on the drive and Kansas City, which has made a habit of burying opponents during the first quarter all season long, are off to a dream start. Indianapolis 0-0 Kansas City 13:05, 1st quarter The Colts will begin from their own 20 after the kickoff and it\u2019s not an auspicious start. Marlon Mack is stuffed for a three-yard loss before running off the right guard for 10 yards, setting up a 3rd and 3. But Luck\u2019s first pass attempt is incomplete and the Colts will punt after a brisk three-and-out. The Chiefs have won the toss and they have deferred. Indianapolis will get the ball first and they\u2019ll turn it over to Andrew Luck, who passed for 222 yards, two touchdowns and one interception against the Texans last week. His last playoff appearance against the Chiefs was a memorable one: 443 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Colts from 28 points down, the second biggest comeback in postseason history. Football weather! Say what you want about how it may impact today\u2019s game, but no one can deny it makes for good photos. Hello and welcome to Arrowhead Stadium for today\u2019s AFC divisional playoff matchup between the Chiefs and the Colts. More than seven inches of snow was dumped on Kansas City before 7am local time and adverse conditions can be expected even though the flakes have slowed and the field is mostly dry. We can only hope the weather won\u2019t undercut this jewel of a quarterback matchup between the Chiefs\u2019 Patrick Mahomes and the Colts\u2019 Andrew Luck. Mahomes, who led the NFL with 50 touchdown passes, and Luck, who ranked second with 39, have the most combined regular-season passing touchdowns (89) among any pair of opposing quarterbacks in a playoff game in the Super Bowl era. It marks the fifth time since 2002 that the top two passing touchdown leaders from the regular season will face off in the postseason. Indianapolis (11-6), who went on the road to defeat the Houston Texans in last week\u2019s Wild Card round, can become the first No 6 seed to reach a conference championship game since 2010, when the Green Bay Packers and New York Jets accomplished the feat. But they\u2019ll surely have their hands full with the high-octane Chiefs (12-4), who led the NFL in total offense (425.6 yards per game) and scoring offense (35.3), the third-highest points per game in NFL history. Kickoff is about 20 minutes away. Plenty more to come. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Hunter Felt\u2019s lookahead to the NFL\u2019s divisional playoff weekend.",

He lost to him again in Shenzhen \u2013 and that was it for 2018 \u2013 12 matches, seven defeats and nothing to show for it but a seemingly ineradicable limp and dwindling hopes after 15 years as a professional. \u201cI know I\u2019ve got no chance of winning this tournament and most likely I\u2019m going to lose in the first round. I\u2019m not happy about that. Because of the way the last six months of competing have gone, I could win but it\u2019s likely that I won\u2019t. It\u2019s going to be uncomfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is my last match, I want to try and enjoy it \u2013 enjoy the whole experience, which is maybe something during my career that I\u2019ve not done. I\u2019ve always been focused on tactics and winning and finding a way; that\u2019s been the most important thing.\u201d What Murray wants to do after spending nearly his entire life playing tennis is to have some fun, play five-a-side with his mates, and fit in some golf \u2013 which might have been his chosen sport, if his father, Willie, had had his way, rather than his mother, Judy, who steered him towards tennis. He could have been a footballer. But tennis, with its inbuilt frustrations and challenges, its quirks of scoring and circumstances, suited his mercurial rhythm. It gave him a canvas on which to paint his particular art. Few did it more artfully. Manufacturing a graceful departure has not been easy, though. \u201cComing in here, my mindset is\u2026 it feels very different. Like, the other day, I was saying to my team: \u2018The thing that\u2019s difficult \u2013 because I\u2019m not practising anywhere near as much as I used to \u2013 is I can\u2019t just go back on the practice court and work on my serve or whatever I\u2019m not happy with \u2013 I can\u2019t do that any more.\u2019 \u201cBut it\u2019s interesting because once I\u2019d started thinking about stopping, that there was a possibility that I wasn\u2019t going to be playing much longer, all of the things that I thought I would quite like to do, I have zero interest in doing right now. \u201cI have no motivation to do anything else just now. Thinking about what I do when I finish playing and rushing into decisions \u2013 from speaking to psychologists \u2013 is the worst thing I should be doing. It\u2019s going to take time for me to deal with it. I need time to get over it and then to know what my next steps are going to be. \u201cI know that will be difficult. I love tennis. I love playing the game.\u201d",
