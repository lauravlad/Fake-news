      "body": "<p>It was already a fairly lively Tuesday morning when the former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell agreed to an interview with the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>The party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/may/26/european-election-latest-results-2019-uk-england-scotland-wales-ni-eu-parliament\" title=\"\">disastrous performance </a>in the European elections had reopened a painful debate about a second referendum on any Brexit deal, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission had said it was launching an investigation into claims of antisemitism within Labour.</p> <p>But Campbell wanted to talk about his new podcast. His daughter Grace had been pushing him to work on a series together and the two were keen to promote their new project \u2013 a chatty knockabout entitled<em> Football, Feminism And Everything In Between</em> featuring the likes of Ed Miliband and Rachel Riley as guests.</p> <p>Except that, two hours before we were due to meet, Campbell was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/31/alastair-campbell-labour-expulsion-discrimination-appeal\" title=\"\">thrown out of the Labour party </a>for having voted Liberal Democrat in the European elections. He voiced his bewilderment on Twitter and prompted a scramble on newsdesks across the country. One of the most controversial figures in recent British politics was suddenly back on the front pages.</p> <p>At home in north London, father and daughter fuss over making tea. We sit in a triangle at the kitchen table, Campbell on the left, Grace to the right. Rows blaze online and camera crews take their position outside on the doorstep. Campbell\u2019s phone doesn\u2019t stop buzzing. Every now and then, he scans incoming messages or breaks off to take a call in another room.</p> <p>\u201cYou know in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/25/thick-of-it-bbc-political-satire-ends\" title=\"\"><em>The Thick Of It</em> </a>when Malcolm Tucker leaves [government] and he\u2019s just hunched over working in his kitchen which, by the way, looks freakishly like this one?\u201d Grace waves her hand across the room for emphasis. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell scoffs. Tucker, an aggressive media manipulator, was a creation always assumed to be based on Campbell in his years working in government for Tony Blair. These days he says he prefers silence to listening to the <em>Today </em>programme, and despite being acutely attuned to everything on the political agenda that morning \u2013 the polls, the tweets, the breaking developments \u2013 he insists: \u201cI don\u2019t even read the papers any more. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>At 62, and with 40 years of Labour membership behind him, Campbell seems weary, rather than furious. \u201cThe breach of the rule is in supporting another party and I am very clear I do not support the Liberal Democrats,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted Lib Dem because I support Labour. I\u2019m not a Liberal Democrat. I never will be. I did it because I want the Labour party to do the right thing and this is the only way I can bring that back. I could have \u2013 and this would have merited expulsion \u2013 I could have made hay with it, but I didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>To the Labour leadership, it seemed he already had. Last Thursday, Corbyn said the matter was \u201ca question of what Mr Campbell said two days before the election, in which he apparently appeared to be supporting the Liberal Democrats. That is clearly not acceptable\u201d.</p> <p>It remains unclear what Corbyn was referring to. On the record, Campbell disclosed his vote only after the polls had closed, when he was directly asked on air by the LBC broadcaster Iain Dale. But, whatever the trigger, the result came last Tuesday in the form of an email \u201cwith regards from the legal and governance unit\u201d from party HQ.</p> <p>\u201cIf you start expelling everyone who voted Lib Dem in these elections,\u201d Campbell blows a raspberry, \u201cthere won\u2019t be a lot left.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c67812f16fd01f0797179f8fa85b98d351f26b3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c67812f16fd01f0797179f8fa85b98d351f26b3e/0_0_1714_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alastair Campbell with former prime minister Tony Blair days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Campbell with former prime minister Tony Blair days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By last Wednesday a movement supporting Campbell had sprung up online under the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/expelmetoo?src=hash\" title=\"\">#expelmetoo</a>, with party members publicly declaring they had not voted Labour in the European elections. Cherie Blair and former Labour cabinet ministers Charles Clarke and Bob Ainsworth were among them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had messages today from people I\u2019ve never had messages from before,\u201d says Campbell, with a shrug. \u201cPeople I don\u2019t expect it from, people that are much closer to [Corbyn] and his sort of politics, but who say one of two things: either, this is really stupid and it will backfire, or secondly, this is no way to treat somebody who has dedicated most of his life to the party.\u201d</p> <p>Grace, 25, born just a month before her father joined Blair\u2019s team, is more forthright. Unsurprisingly, perhaps: their podcast was inspired by a <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/alastair-campbell-daughter-feminism-advice/\" title=\"\">frank radio exchange last year</a> when she ambushed her father live on air over, among other things, his use of the word \u201cbirds\u201d to refer to women. Today, though, she is resolutely loyal. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off about it [the expulsion] and I\u2019ve lost a lot of faith in the Labour party. I am sure [Corbyn is] loving it.\u201d She leans in and rests her cheek in her hand. \u201cIt just feels very personal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure he will be, you know,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cAnd you love Seb [Corbyn, Jeremy\u2019s son].\u201d Still, Grace is upset that many newer members of the party will be gleeful at the news. \u201cMomentum\u2019s tweet was unbelievable,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of them hate Dad.\u201d Earlier that morning, the pro-Corbyn grassroots movement had tweeted: \u201cAlastair Campbell\u2019s \u2018sexed up\u2019 dossier started the Iraq war and left a million dead. Being kicked out of the party is the least he deserves.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell brushes it off, casually dropping in the fact that Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, can\u2019t hate him all that much. She delivered a handwritten note asking him for support.</p> <p>To Campbell, it is clear the Labour party is being destroyed and that there are cracks among Corbyn\u2019s senior team. \u201cI\u2019ve had three people in his office today send me messages saying, \u2018What the fuck? I had no idea this was going to happen\u2019\u201d. Campbell\u2019s partner, education campaigner Fiona Millar, left the party months ago after Keir Starmer, sitting at the same kitchen table, promised her the claims of antisemitism within the party would be dealt with within six months. The glacial pace at which the party has moved to deal with the issue compared with the speed at which Campbell was dismissed is an irony not lost on him, but he is unconvinced that there is any coherent strategy behind it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s so arrogant to think it\u2019s even about Corbyn \u2013 as if he\u2019s this little baby that everyone has to protect</p> <footer> <cite>Grace Campbell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey make it up as they go along. They don\u2019t have a strategy, they have a fantasy. Seumas Milne [Corbyn\u2019s adviser] is an old-fashioned posh-boy Stalinist. He\u2019s not really Labour \u2013 he never has been. The idea that he stands up for or represents working class people in the north does my head in. They haven\u2019t got a clue about people like that. They\u2019re not motivated by people like that. So far as they have a strategy, it\u2019s basically to get the Tories to implode, make Brexit happen and try not to get the blame.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell has campaigned vociferously for a people\u2019s vote. Did he ever consider that his endorsement might have been damaging? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s so simple for them to say \u2018Oh Tony Blair, urrghh Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson, Andrew Adonis\u2019 but who else is moving the debate? We\u2019ve been out there the whole time. Does Nigel Farage worry about the fact he\u2019s hated by a lot of people? No, he just campaigns.\u201d</p> <p>The EU election results can fairly be taken as a proxy vote on Brexit; nonetheless, Campbell ardently believes a people\u2019s vote could deliver a win for Remainers. \u201cListen, more people signed that revoke petition than voted for the Brexit party \u2026 I honestly believe that if we had another referendum where the choice was to remain in a reformed EU, against a credible, deliverable form of hard Brexit \u2013 which is all you\u2019re going to get now \u2013 then I think we\u2019ll win, and we will win well. I\u2019m so confident of that.\u201d</p> <p>Given the party\u2019s position on the second referendum, does he think Corbyn should stand down? \u201cI\u2019m not engaging on that because they are desperate to say this people\u2019s vote campaign has just been a plot to get rid of Jeremy which is fucking bullshit. The people\u2019s vote campaign is cross party, involving Tories, Lib Dems, SNP, Greens\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so arrogant to think it\u2019s even about Corbyn,\u201d adds Grace. \u201cAs if he\u2019s this little baby that everyone has to protect because he can\u2019t look after himself.\u201d A standup taking her first show to Edinburgh this summer (title: <em>Why I\u2019m Never Going Into Politics</em>), Grace insists she would still \u201cdefinitely vote Labour\u201d despite her antipathy for the current party leader.</p> <p>Campbell doesn\u2019t confirm that he would \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t, either. Does he feel less Labour today? \u201cNo, I feel more Labour because of the responses I\u2019ve had.\u201d What does it mean to him, feeling Labour? Campbell pauses, as if it\u2019s obviously rooted in his DNA. \u201cI\u2019m very tribally Labour. The party represents to me a set of values and principles that are standing up for the right people, and they\u2019re not doing that.</p> <p>\u201cThey can parrot \u2018For the many, not the few\u2019, but they are becoming a party of the few for the few.\u201d</p> <h2>DREAM TEAMS</h2> <p><strong><em>Grace and Alastair Campbell ask their podcast guests to pick a</em></strong><strong><em> six-a-side team, either dead or alive, to change the world. </em></strong><strong><em>Here is their own selection:</em></strong></p> <p><em>GRACE CAMPBELL:</em><br><em>1.

      "body": "<h2>Katherine Butler, joint head of Guardian Opinion</h2> <p>Seven million people turned to the wisdom of the Guardian\u2019s comment writers in the 24 hours after the EU referendum result in June 2016. Three years on, it feels disturbing to admit that Brexit, for our small team of opinion editors, is the gift that keeps on giving.</p> <p>With political opinions two a penny on the web, the scale of our traffic perhaps says a lot about the value of rapid but trusted, carefully commissioned and edited<strong> </strong>analysis in helping navigate an issue as polarising and open to factual distortion as Brexit. As the theatrics of Westminster voting, resignations and government defeats played out, many readers said they also found the Brexit-themed satire provided by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marinahyde\">Marina Hyde</a> on our Saturday pages an essential form of therapy.</p> <p>The big surprise is how even the seemingly dry detail can ignite fierce debate. Article 50. Customs union. WTO rules. Meaningful votes. Indicative votes. Backstop to the backstop. With the stakes so high, bring it on, readers seem to say.</p> <p>Seeing this level of engagement with the complexities of the UK/EU relationship can be bittersweet. Back in the 1990s I reported on the EU from Brussels, competing (in vain, it usually felt) to convey the complicated reality against the Eurosceptic drumbeat.</p> <p>So tense has the national mood been lately that you have to guard against unwittingly raising hopes of the impasse ending. A recent column was initially headlined: \u201cBritain will have a second referendum - on 23 May\u201d. Only when it started to spread like wildfire around the internet did it become clear that people were frantically sharing it because they hoped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/18/european-elections-second-brexit-referendum-vote-register\">our columnist had exclusive news to impart</a>, rather than a view on the EU elections.</p> <h2>Joseph Harker, deputy opinion editor</h2> <p>The first appearance of the word \u201cBrexit\u201d in a Guardian Opinion article was written by our columnist Timothy Garton Ash in December 2012. Headlined \u201cA referendum on Europe? Bring it on, for all our sakes\u201d, it read:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unlike many of my pro-European friends, I think we will win. I do not believe the brains of the British people have been so addled by the Sun and Daily Mail that they will, confronted with the facts about what it is really like to be Norway (without the oil) or Switzerland, decide that exit \u2013 Brexit or Brixit \u2013 is the best option for this country.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fateful words.</p> <p>Our in-house columnists have been amazing at filing within minutes of some of the most dramatic and unexpected moments. And, beyond that, we\u2019ve tried to give bigger-picture pieces as well.</p> <p>One of the first, and still most memorable, was Mike Carter\u2019s report of his walk through Britain\u2019s post-industrial heartlands shortly before the vote. Headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/liverpool-london-brexit-leave-eu-referendum\">I walked from Liverpool to London.

A nightmare not just because of what\u2019s actually at stake \u2013 the outcome of Brexit will of course determine the future of our country for decades to come \u2013 but, on a much more parochial level, how to respond when something significant seems to happen every week, but nothing ever seems to change.</p> <p>My approach has been to try to focus on what all the Westminster shenanigans could mean for where we ultimately end up, rather than on the archaic parliamentary procedure. It would be easy to let the excitement and unpredictability that comes with being in politically uncharted territory mask the troubling lack of responsible political leadership that has left us where we are today. It\u2019s our job to point that out.<br></p> <h2>Toby Moses, deputy opinion editor</h2> <p>Never has a news story of such importance lasted so long, with such a high frequency of crunch moments that have failed to deliver any kind of resolution. The challenge of commissioning on a topic which is constantly developing and yet somehow never changes lies in finding new angles.</p> <p>Views can be predictable, so when we can find an expert to present a perspective on what Brexit is doing in their area \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/09/trade-deals-standards-employment-farmers-brexit\">farmer</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/31/prescription-drug-brexit-pharmacy-supply-chains-shortages\">pharmacist</a> \u2013 it adds something new.</p> <p>The fact that the appetite from readers is voracious, with every twist and turn pored over, means other stories can be crowded out. Most of the problems with the world that pre-date Brexit are still there, and getting worse, but the space for them has narrowed. Thankfully, we have excellent columnists who are all too aware of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/12/britain-austerity-brexit-economy-recession-regions\">continuing harm being done by austerity</a> and the conflicts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/05/jamal-khashoggi-coverage-victim-saudi\">costing thousands of lives around the world.</a> Our responsibility as editors is to make sure those stories are promoted to give our readers a broad range of comment to absorb. It can feel as if Brexit is the only thing happening in the world. It isn\u2019t, and the opinion pages reflect that.</p> <h2>David Shariatmadari, deputy opinion editor</h2> <p>Editing in times of Brexit can be a lot of fun and really rewarding. There\u2019s a delight for the obsessive (a category most editors fall into) in following the drama. Brexit is stuffed full of gossip, speculation and nailbiting votes. Therein, however, lies the danger. The science of Brexitology can be impenetrable to the uninitiated, and as a paper we have a responsibility to communicate the issues of the day accessibly. That means that blow-by-blow coverage must be balanced by pieces that give you a feeling for the bigger picture, the sweep of history.</p> <p>I covered the 2016 US presidential election as opinion editor from New York. There was the constant risk of losing sight of underlying factors amid the extraordinary twists and turns. The minutiae of Trump\u2019s gaffes and outrages provided plenty of fodder for columnists, but broader currents were ultimately more important. These included voter disaffection with the status quo, a feeling of economic alienation, and splitting of the country along broadly cultural lines. It\u2019s no coincidence that these are the animating issues in Brexit Britain as well. Our challenge is not to lose sight of them.</p> <h2>Maya Wolfe-Robinson, assistant opinion editor</h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The prospect of our morning ideas meetings being dominated by Brexit for years to come is, frankly, pretty terrifying</p> <footer> <cite>Maya Wolfe-Robinson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brexit is like Marmite. I often cover the early morning shift, where I review the morning papers and news sites and aim to have commissioned the first piece of the day by 8am. Some writers are so obsessively following every aspect, they are aghast if you suggest a non-Brexit-related topic. And then there are those who plead \u201cAnything but the B-word!\u201d as soon as they answer the phone.</p> <p>When we invited teenage environmentalist school strikers into the office to guest-edit, their frustration that we were debating an article 50 extension vote amendment instead of discussing the climate emergency offered a healthy sense of perspective. Yet it\u2019s been valuable to edit pieces that show Brexit\u2019s huge effects beyond Westminster, such as Frances Ryan on how an economic downturn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/23/austerity-brexit-suffering-eu-anger\">would affect those already hit by the benefits freeze</a> and Kimberley McIntosh and Shehreen Ali on how Brexit will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/22/brexit-ethnic-minorities-hit-job-losses-poverty-eu\">affect the UK\u2019s ethnic minorities</a>. There\u2019s very little good news though, so the prospect of our morning ideas meetings being dominated by Brexit for years to come is, frankly, pretty terrifying.</p> <h2>Charlotte Naughton, production editor, opinion</h2> <p>Three hours past our normal print deadline, I\u2019ve just picked up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/29/may-brexit-brady-amendment\">a hastily rewritten column</a>. A parliamentary vote has just passed and Rafael Behr has updated his article at speed \u2013 but it\u2019s too long for the space. Behr is standing at my shoulder. \u201cThis Malthouse detail, let\u2019s lose that,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, good,\u201d he says. Another minute and pre-press will be clamouring for this last page so we can get the newspaper to the printers on time. I finish reading it, print out a proof, another subeditor checks it and I send the page.</p> <p>We have sometimes had to choose between getting pieces live on the web first or getting the next day\u2019s paper out on time. At such an incredible time, the production team pulls together \u2013 one person writes a headline while another edits copy and a third adds a picture. Behr\u2019s article is live in minutes, and we can all finally relax. Until the next day.</p>",

Views can be predictable, so when we can find an expert to present a perspective on what Brexit is doing in their area \u2013 a farmer or a pharmacist \u2013 it adds something new. The fact that the appetite from readers is voracious, with every twist and turn pored over, means other stories can be crowded out. Most of the problems with the world that pre-date Brexit are still there, and getting worse, but the space for them has narrowed. Thankfully, we have excellent columnists who are all too aware of the continuing harm being done by austerity and the conflicts costing thousands of lives around the world. Our responsibility as editors is to make sure those stories are promoted to give our readers a broad range of comment to absorb. It can feel as if Brexit is the only thing happening in the world. It isn\u2019t, and the opinion pages reflect that. David Shariatmadari, deputy opinion editor Editing in times of Brexit can be a lot of fun and really rewarding. There\u2019s a delight for the obsessive (a category most editors fall into) in following the drama. Brexit is stuffed full of gossip, speculation and nailbiting votes. Therein, however, lies the danger. The science of Brexitology can be impenetrable to the uninitiated, and as a paper we have a responsibility to communicate the issues of the day accessibly. That means that blow-by-blow coverage must be balanced by pieces that give you a feeling for the bigger picture, the sweep of history. I covered the 2016 US presidential election as opinion editor from New York. There was the constant risk of losing sight of underlying factors amid the extraordinary twists and turns. The minutiae of Trump\u2019s gaffes and outrages provided plenty of fodder for columnists, but broader currents were ultimately more important. These included voter disaffection with the status quo, a feeling of economic alienation, and splitting of the country along broadly cultural lines. It\u2019s no coincidence that these are the animating issues in Brexit Britain as well. Our challenge is not to lose sight of them. Maya Wolfe-Robinson, assistant opinion editor Brexit is like Marmite. I often cover the early morning shift, where I review the morning papers and news sites and aim to have commissioned the first piece of the day by 8am. Some writers are so obsessively following every aspect, they are aghast if you suggest a non-Brexit-related topic. And then there are those who plead \u201cAnything but the B-word!\u201d as soon as they answer the phone. When we invited teenage environmentalist school strikers into the office to guest-edit, their frustration that we were debating an article 50 extension vote amendment instead of discussing the climate emergency offered a healthy sense of perspective. Yet it\u2019s been valuable to edit pieces that show Brexit\u2019s huge effects beyond Westminster, such as Frances Ryan on how an economic downturn would affect those already hit by the benefits freeze and Kimberley McIntosh and Shehreen Ali on how Brexit will affect the UK\u2019s ethnic minorities. There\u2019s very little good news though, so the prospect of our morning ideas meetings being dominated by Brexit for years to come is, frankly, pretty terrifying. Charlotte Naughton, production editor, opinion Three hours past our normal print deadline, I\u2019ve just picked up a hastily rewritten column. A parliamentary vote has just passed and Rafael Behr has updated his article at speed \u2013 but it\u2019s too long for the space. Behr is standing at my shoulder. \u201cThis Malthouse detail, let\u2019s lose that,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, good,\u201d he says. Another minute and pre-press will be clamouring for this last page so we can get the newspaper to the printers on time. I finish reading it, print out a proof, another subeditor checks it and I send the page. We have sometimes had to choose between getting pieces live on the web first or getting the next day\u2019s paper out on time. At such an incredible time, the production team pulls together \u2013 one person writes a headline while another edits copy and a third adds a picture. Behr\u2019s article is live in minutes, and we can all finally relax. Until the next day.",
