      "bodyText": "A body has been recovered from the wreckage of the plane that crashed in the Channel with footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson on board, three days after the aircraft was found. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has not said whether the body is that of the Argentinian striker or that of the pilot, following their disappearance on 21 January. Using remotely operated vehicles in \u201cchallenging conditions\u201d in poor weather, the AAIB and its specialist contractors successfully recovered the body previously seen amid the wreckage following extensive visual examinations of the accident site. \u201cThe operation was carried out in as dignified a way as possible and the families were kept informed of progress,\u201d the AAIB said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, attempts to recover the aircraft wreckage were unsuccessful before poor weather conditions forced us to return the ROV to the ship. \u201cThe weather forecast is poor for the foreseeable future and so the difficult decision was taken to bring the overall operation to a close. The body is currently being taken to Portland to be passed into the care of the Dorset coroner.\u201d The Piper Malibu plane taking Sala to Cardiff from Nantes in France disappeared shortly after the 28-year-old signed for the Premier League club Cardiff City, with scrutiny focusing on the pilot for using a loophole enabling him to fly on his US licence. Ibbotson, 59, had requested to descend before losing contact with Jersey air traffic control during the flight from France to Wales. The aircraft wreckage remains where it was found, more than 60 metres underwater, 21 miles north of the Channel island of Guernsey. The footballer\u2019s family are desperate for the plane to be recovered from the seabed. However, the AAIB said it had not been possible to recover the aircraft. \u201cThe extensive video record captured by the ROV is expected to provide valuable evidence for our safety investigation,\u201d the AAIB statement said. \u201cWe expect our next update to be an interim report, which we intend to publish within one month of the accident occurring.\u201d The AAIB said previously that the work of the ROVs was hampered by the difficult tidal conditions around the Channel Islands.

She says her bowel, ilium and uterus were perforated by Gayed in a number of places with the cuts ranging from 1cm to 5cm. Gayed is reprimanded and ordered to undergo a performance assessment. Informal counselling is recommended.</p> <p><strong>1998</strong></p> <p>\u2013 A complaint is made by a patient who says that after Gayed performed her surgery she needed further surgery to stop bleeding from an unknown source.</p> <p>\u2013 The HCCC receives a complaint from Southern Area health service advising that a number of incidents have occurred involving Gayed and he has been suspended. The allegations made are breaches of protocols for infection control and universal precautions, adequacy of patient consents, alteration of a medical record, clinical competence, possible visual impairment and communication issues.</p> <p>\u2013 The HCCC receives a complaint from Cooma health service concerning care provided by Gayed to two patients. One of those patients alleges that after he performed her hysterectomy, she needed further surgery to stop the bleeding from an unknown source. The other patient says she has suffered ongoing problems with her health after she developed bleeding in her stomach requiring a laparoscopy, hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage, all<strong> </strong>performed by Gayed. The matters are investigated and no further action is taken.</p> <p>\u2013 A patient complains to the HCCC that she has suffered from incontinence since Gayed performed surgery on her in August 1997. Her complaint is referred to the professional standards committee.</p> <p>- In total, 15 adverse events at Cooma Hospital are reported to Southern Area Health Service between May 1997 and October 1998.</p> <p>- Three complaints to HCCC arise from Gayed\u2019s treatment at Cooma Hospital, one of which resulted in no further action as a result of no clinical criticism, one discontinued following investigation as a result of no clinical criticism, and one prosecuted before Professional Standards Committee but not until years later, in 2001.</p> <p><strong>1999</strong></p> <p>- Gayed resigns from Cooma Hospital.</p> <p>- He begins working at Manning Hospital and Kempsey District Hospital.</p> <p><strong>2000</strong></p> <p>\u2013 A complaint is received from a patient alleging that she required further surgery because she developed internal bleeding after surgery performed by Gayed. She alleges that during a third operation Gayed stitched a section of her bowel to one of her ovaries. That complaint is investigated but no further action is taken.</p> <p>\u2013 A patient makes a complaint to the HCCC alleging that intercourse became painful after Gayed performed a vaginal prolapse repair, that further surgery he performed failed to fix the problem, and subsequent surgery performed by another gynaecologist did. This complaint is referred to the professional standards committee.</p> <p>- Two complaints to HCCC arising from treatment at Cooma Hospital, one of which prosecuted before professional standards committee in 2001 and the other resulted in no further action because of no clinical criticism.</p> <p><strong>2001</strong></p> <p>\u2013 A professional standards inquiry considers nine complaints about Gayed. He is found to be guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct and to be an impaired practitioner, owing to his vision problems. He is allowed to continue practising but conditions are imposed on his registration limiting the types of surgical procedures he can perform.</p> <p><strong>2002</strong></p> <p>- Gayed begins working at Mona Vale Hospital, with a good reference from a senior staff member at Manning Rural Referral Hospital.

      "bodyText": "1976 \u2013 Gayed graduates as a bachelor of medicine and a bachelor of surgery in Egypt. 1993 \u2013 He becomes a fellow of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. 1994 \u2013 Gayed registers in New South Wales as a medical practitioner. - Gayed commences work at Grafton Hospital. 1996 - Dr Gayed commences work at Cooma Hospital. 1997 \u2013 The Health Care Complaints Commission receives a complaint from a patient alleging that she consented to a laparoscopy but Gayed performed a laparotomy instead. She says her bowel, ilium and uterus were perforated by Gayed in a number of places with the cuts ranging from 1cm to 5cm. Gayed is reprimanded and ordered to undergo a performance assessment. Informal counselling is recommended. 1998 \u2013 A complaint is made by a patient who says that after Gayed performed her surgery she needed further surgery to stop bleeding from an unknown source. \u2013 The HCCC receives a complaint from Southern Area health service advising that a number of incidents have occurred involving Gayed and he has been suspended. The allegations made are breaches of protocols for infection control and universal precautions, adequacy of patient consents, alteration of a medical record, clinical competence, possible visual impairment and communication issues. \u2013 The HCCC receives a complaint from Cooma health service concerning care provided by Gayed to two patients. One of those patients alleges that after he performed her hysterectomy, she needed further surgery to stop the bleeding from an unknown source. The other patient says she has suffered ongoing problems with her health after she developed bleeding in her stomach requiring a laparoscopy, hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage, all performed by Gayed. The matters are investigated and no further action is taken. \u2013 A patient complains to the HCCC that she has suffered from incontinence since Gayed performed surgery on her in August 1997. Her complaint is referred to the professional standards committee. - In total, 15 adverse events at Cooma Hospital are reported to Southern Area Health Service between May 1997 and October 1998. - Three complaints to HCCC arise from Gayed\u2019s treatment at Cooma Hospital, one of which resulted in no further action as a result of no clinical criticism, one discontinued following investigation as a result of no clinical criticism, and one prosecuted before Professional Standards Committee but not until years later, in 2001. 1999 - Gayed resigns from Cooma Hospital. - He begins working at Manning Hospital and Kempsey District Hospital. 2000 \u2013 A complaint is received from a patient alleging that she required further surgery because she developed internal bleeding after surgery performed by Gayed. She alleges that during a third operation Gayed stitched a section of her bowel to one of her ovaries. That complaint is investigated but no further action is taken. \u2013 A patient makes a complaint to the HCCC alleging that intercourse became painful after Gayed performed a vaginal prolapse repair, that further surgery he performed failed to fix the problem, and subsequent surgery performed by another gynaecologist did. This complaint is referred to the professional standards committee. - Two complaints to HCCC arising from treatment at Cooma Hospital, one of which prosecuted before professional standards committee in 2001 and the other resulted in no further action because of no clinical criticism. 2001 \u2013 A professional standards inquiry considers nine complaints about Gayed. He is found to be guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct and to be an impaired practitioner, owing to his vision problems. He is allowed to continue practising but conditions are imposed on his registration limiting the types of surgical procedures he can perform. 2002 - Gayed begins working at Mona Vale Hospital, with a good reference from a senior staff member at Manning Rural Referral Hospital. He resigns from Kempsey District Hospital. 2003 \u2013 North Sydney Area health service temporarily suspends Gayed\u2019s appointment at Mona Vale because of a \u201ccluster of seemingly adverse patient events\u201d. He is then reinstated with the condition that his appointment be reconsidered if further complaints are made. 2004 \u2013 A complaint is made to the HCCC by a patient alleging that when she went into labour at 22 weeks pregnant with twins, Gayed refused to transfer her from the regional hospital to another hospital with facilities to care for very premature babies. She alleges her babies were \u201cleft to die when they were born at 23 weeks\u201d. There is an investigation but no further action is taken. \u2013 A performance assessment is conducted. Gayed is ordered not to undertake microsurgery and to be periodically assessed by an ophthalmologist. But his professional performance is found to be \u201cat the standard reasonably expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level of training or experience\u201d. He is ordered to undergo counselling. 2005 \u2013 Gayed undergoes counselling. 2006 \u2013 The medical tribunal conducts a review of the conditions on Gayed\u2019s registration and removes them, allowing him to perform all obstetric and gynaecological procedures once again. 2007 \u2013 The NSW Medical Board receives notice about a number of clinical incidents involving Gayed that led to him resigning from Mona Vale hospital.

      "body": "<p>Manchester City have had to wait 52 days to remind themselves what it is like to look down on the rest of the Premier League and, having played that game of catchup for so long, it is fair to assume they must be happily enjoying the view from the top. True, Liverpool have a game in hand to add into the equation. Yet City are entitled to feel invigorated when there was a seven-point deficit at one point and the possibility, as Pep Guardiola has acknowledged, that the champions looked done.</p> <p>Only a small possibility, mind, and more fool anyone for believing that a team with City\u2019s assorted gifts would relinquish their title without a heck of a struggle. City look primed for battle and their latest triumph was precisely the kind of victory, to borrow the old cliche, that every successful team requires in a championship season. Not at their most fluent, perhaps, but talented enough for that not to matter, scoring in the final seconds of the first period and then repeating the trick in the second half.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/06/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-top-lesson-not-giving-up\">\u2018The lesson is never give up,\u2019 says Pep Guardiola after Manchester City go top</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nerves? City, like Liverpool, have not been immune recently but there was nothing fretful about this performance and that, more than anything, must worry the team who are now second in the league.</p> <p>There are times when City blitz their opponents, when they attack from every angle and just about everything clicks. This was another type of victory and, if we were to be generous, an improvement for Everton bearing in mind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/31/everton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">in the corresponding match last season </a>the away side had 82% of the possession. This time the split was a relatively moderate 61-39 in City\u2019s favour and for a long time it looked as though they might win through a set-play goal off the head of one of their defenders.</p> <p>City could not relax properly until the second goal arrived via Gabriel Jesus, one of their substitutes.

      "bodyText": "Manchester City have had to wait 52 days to remind themselves what it is like to look down on the rest of the Premier League and, having played that game of catchup for so long, it is fair to assume they must be happily enjoying the view from the top. True, Liverpool have a game in hand to add into the equation. Yet City are entitled to feel invigorated when there was a seven-point deficit at one point and the possibility, as Pep Guardiola has acknowledged, that the champions looked done. Only a small possibility, mind, and more fool anyone for believing that a team with City\u2019s assorted gifts would relinquish their title without a heck of a struggle. City look primed for battle and their latest triumph was precisely the kind of victory, to borrow the old cliche, that every successful team requires in a championship season. Not at their most fluent, perhaps, but talented enough for that not to matter, scoring in the final seconds of the first period and then repeating the trick in the second half. Nerves? City, like Liverpool, have not been immune recently but there was nothing fretful about this performance and that, more than anything, must worry the team who are now second in the league. There are times when City blitz their opponents, when they attack from every angle and just about everything clicks. This was another type of victory and, if we were to be generous, an improvement for Everton bearing in mind in the corresponding match last season the away side had 82% of the possession. This time the split was a relatively moderate 61-39 in City\u2019s favour and for a long time it looked as though they might win through a set-play goal off the head of one of their defenders. City could not relax properly until the second goal arrived via Gabriel Jesus, one of their substitutes. That was not until the seventh minute of added time, but the bottom line is they were always superior to the team in the darker shade of blue. All of which should probably be no surprise given Everton had won three of their previous 12 league fixtures, losing seven times in the process, and came into this match on the back of a downward spiral that meant only two other clubs, Huddersfield and Fulham, had gathered fewer points since the beginning of December. This was Everton\u2019s fifth home defeat of the season, as many as the last campaign in its entirety, and Marco Silva will have to expect scrutiny even if his players could not be accused of a lack of effort.

They also had the backing of a crowd that, contrary to rumour, did not show any outward signs of rooting for City, aka Anyone But Liverpool. And unlike Arsenal and Newcastle, City\u2019s previous two opponents, they did at least stop Sergio Ag\u00fcero opening the scoring inside the first minute. Indeed, they held off their opponents for longer than many might have anticipated. Not that Everton should be too pleased with themselves when they did not manage a single attempt on target and it was difficult to remember Ederson, City\u2019s goalkeeper, being in any real danger. Silva talked about it being an improvement on their recent performances but it will not help his cause that Aymeric Laporte\u2019s goal came from a familiar route.

In a rare move and at the direction of the NSW health minister Brad Hazzard, NSW Health will also provide the report to police for investigation. The deputy secretary of NSW Health, Dr Nigel Lyons, paid tribute to those who had come forward before and during the review. \u201cWe would like to thank the brave patients and staff members who contributed to the inquiry, he said. \u201cThey assisted greatly in identifying the systems failure in the administration of Dr Gayed\u2019s appointments and management, which affected the care he provided.\u201d Lyons said NSW Health had accepted the report and its recommendations in full.

But Guardian Australia then revealed complaints were made about Gayed more than two decades ago while he worked in Canberra. This triggered a broader investigation led by Furness and which examined the five health districts where he was known to have worked.

Twelve months ago Bong accused Jay Rodriguez of racially abusing him during a Premier League match, leading to an FA charge against the striker. Bong said he was \u201c100% sure\u201d that Rodriguez said \u201cYou\u2019re black and you stink\u201d, whereas Rodriguez claimed he had said \u201cBreath fucking stinks\u201d. After hiring lip-readers, who were unable to validate either version, the FA declared the charge to be \u201cnot proven\u201d. At the Hawthorns, a section of West Brom fans greeted Bong with chants of \u201cYou smelly bastard\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we heard tonight is not nice,\u201d said Hughton. \u201cWhat we have in Ga\u00ebtan is a very upright, respectable individual.

The game in recent years has acted on such things really well. All Ga\u00ebtan wants to do is very much get on with his football. He has conducted himself impeccably.\u201d</p> <p>The chants were all the more audible because the crowd was so sparse, less than 9,000 choosing to turn up to watch a replay between two weakened sides. At least those who concentrated on the game were treated to some entertainment, as it was an open affair with numerous chances.

      "bodyText": "Glenn Murray scored twice in extra time to ensure this tie reached a conclusion and book a fifth-round meeting with Derby but more will surely be heard about uglier events that happened on and off the pitch. The Brighton striker Florin Andone could be called by the Football Association to explain an off-the-ball incident in the first half in which he appeared to drive an elbow into the face of West Brom\u2019s Sam Field. Both managers said they did not see what happened. Chris Hughton certainly heard the boos and abusive chants that were aimed later in the game at Ga\u00ebtan Bong, the Brighton left-back who was introduced from the bench in extra time. Twelve months ago Bong accused Jay Rodriguez of racially abusing him during a Premier League match, leading to an FA charge against the striker. Bong said he was \u201c100% sure\u201d that Rodriguez said \u201cYou\u2019re black and you stink\u201d, whereas Rodriguez claimed he had said \u201cBreath fucking stinks\u201d. After hiring lip-readers, who were unable to validate either version, the FA declared the charge to be \u201cnot proven\u201d. At the Hawthorns, a section of West Brom fans greeted Bong with chants of \u201cYou smelly bastard\u201d. \u201cWhat we heard tonight is not nice,\u201d said Hughton. \u201cWhat we have in Ga\u00ebtan is a very upright, respectable individual. For those who make those chants that\u2019s their individual choice and it\u2019s down to the authorities and governors of the game to deal with. The game in recent years has acted on such things really well. All Ga\u00ebtan wants to do is very much get on with his football. He has conducted himself impeccably.\u201d The chants were all the more audible because the crowd was so sparse, less than 9,000 choosing to turn up to watch a replay between two weakened sides. At least those who concentrated on the game were treated to some entertainment, as it was an open affair with numerous chances. The first two fell to Rodriguez, who forced saves from Jonathan Bond. Leon Balogun then nearly opened the scoring for the visitors, only for his header to come back off the crossbar. Just before half-time Brighton\u2019s bar was left rattling by an exquisite long-range volley by Hal Robson-Kanu. The Championship side took the lead in the 78th minute in farcical fashion. Wes Hoolahan curled a free-kick in from the left and Dan Burn looped a defensive header towards the far post, where Balogun inexplicably stood by as Kyle Bartley hooked it into the net from one yard. The lead did not last long. Four minutes later Andone pounced on a loose pass by Bartley before finishing neatly to send the tie into extra time. West Brom suffered a blow early in the additional period when Robson-Kanu limped off to leave them with 10 men, Darren Moore having made all his substitutions. Hughton introduced Murray from the bench and the 35-year-old scored within two minutes, on hand to nudge the ball over the line from close range after a low cross by J\u00fcrgen Locadia. Murray completed the scoring with a crisp finish after being set up by Davy Pr\u00f6pper.",

      "bodyText": "A federal government minister has admitted he \u201cbehaved like an idiot\u201d while on a taxpayer-funded exchange with the Australian defence force, after a female air force officer lodged a complaint about his conduct. The ABC reported Scott Buchholz was forced to apologise to a female defence officer after she lodged a complaint over the Queensland MP\u2019s behaviour during a military exchange program in Darwin last year. The defence department did not detail the complaint or the actions, but a spokesman said Buchholz had apologised. \u201cDefence can confirm that a complaint was made by an Australian defence force member about the behaviour of a parliamentarian during Exercise Pitch Black 2018,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe parliamentarian was participating in the exercise as part of the Australian defence force parliamentary program. \u201cThe complaint was referred to the office of the minister for defence personnel. \u201cDefence subsequently received an apology from the parliamentarian and is satisfied with the response.\u201d In a statement released by Buccholz, who was promoted from the backbench to the ministry by Scott Morrison just weeks after the incident, the assistant roads minister admitted to poor behaviour. \u201cI behaved like an idiot on a parliamentary exchange last year and I recognise how inappropriate my actions were. I apologised for my conduct and the offence I caused, and I reiterate my deep respect for the ADF and its members,\u201d he said. Buchholz was part of a federal parliamentarian group who attended the Exercise Pitch Black event, a biennial training exercise in northern Australia involving the Royal Australian Air Force and up to 4,000 personnel from Australia\u2019s military allies. The Liberal National party MP has held the southern Queensland seat of Wright since its creation in 2010 on a comfortable margin, despite a One Nation insurgence in parts of his electorate. Following the August leadership spill which led to his promotion from the backbench, Buchholz said he was guided by his \u201cmoral compass of loyalty, integrity and patriotism to our country\u201d in making his decision of who to back. \u201cThis week my vote went behind the office of the prime minister,\u201d he said in a statement at the time. \u201cWe need a return to our core principles \u2013 ones that I learned growing up in regional Queensland, building small business, lower taxes and a voice for the hard-working Australians who made this country the lucky one.\u201d",

Researchers working as part of a Nasa-led study found the cavern, which they said was 300 metres tall and two-thirds the size of Manhattan, at the bottom of the massive Thwaites glacier. The space is big enough to have contained 14bn tonnes of ice and most of that ice has melted during the past three years. In a paper published in Science Advances, the scientists said the rapid change in the ice was \u201cunexpected\u201d at some points on the glacier. The researchers found the cavity using Italian and German satellites and ice-penetrating radar from Nasa\u2019s Operation IceBridge, which uses research aircraft to monitor changes in polar ice. \u201c[The size of] a cavity under a glacier plays an important role in melting,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Pietro Milillo, who is scientist at the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \u201cAs more heat and water get under the glacier, it melts faster.\u201d But Milillo told the Guardian the size of the underwater cavity was not the main concern because the 14bn tonnes it released were already underwater and so would not contribute to sea level rise. The important aspect of the paper, he said, was what it revealed about the interaction between sea and ice. Jeremie Mouginot, a co-author of the paper and a research scientist at the Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, said ocean water was filling a widening gap between the floating ice shelf and the bedrock. Thwaites, he said, was a 120km-wide \u201cmonster glacier\u201d that is continuing its retreat with huge future implications, because it could potentially add 0.6 metres to rising seas. Thwaites also supports neighbouring glaciers that, if they melted, would increase sea levels by an additional 2.44 metres, threatening coastal communities worldwide. Mouginot said further studies would be needed on where and how Thwaites will decline. \u201cThe current question is not if the glaciers will retreat but at which pace.\u201d There are already new investigations of Thwaites under way, including one by a UK team, as well as studies of other Antarctic regions. The hole is on the glacier\u2019s western side and has been melting at a rate of about 0.6 to 0.8km a year since 1992, a rate that while stable was \u201cextremely high\u201d, Nasa said. Eric Rignot, a co-author of the study, said understanding how warming oceans were melting the glacier away was \u201cessential to project its impact on sea level rise in the coming decades\u201d. \u201cWe have suspected for years that Thwaites was not tightly attached to the bedrock beneath it,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. It was an excellent game, particularly in the first half. Real were extremely impressive for an hour and created the better chances to score a second, but faded with a combination of tiredness and the arrival of Messi in the final half-hour. Thanks for being here. Bye! The second leg will be played at the Bernabeu on the 27th, and is likely to be decent. 90+4 mins: And that\u2019s it! A high-quality, high-tempo game ends with spoils deservedly shared. 90+3 mins: Jordi Alba\u2019s cross is a little strong for Vidal, but he keeps it in play and pulls back to Suarez, whose volley from outside the box hits a defender. 90+1 mins: Messi goes down on the edge of the area again, but this time Ramos\u2019s challenge was precise - and had to be. 90+1 mins: There will be three minutes or so of stoppage time. 88 mins: Messi loses the ball on the edge of the Real area and Barcelona players compete to give away the free kick that will stop Real\u2019s break. Busquets commits the first foul, but Real keep the ball and the referee waves play on. Vidal commits the second, on Casemiro, and this time the referee blows his whistle. 87 mins: Good pressure from Real, who work the ball around the Barcelona area for a while. In the end the ball rolls to the edge of the area where Kroos runs onto it, but Pique gets in the way of the shot! 85 mins: Kroos curls a lovely free kick into the area, but Varane mistimes his jump and the ball goes wide off his back. 85 mins: The night\u2019s final substitution sees Marco Asensio comes on for Llorente. 84 mins: Semedo does well to win and keep the ball on the right, and then pulls back to Messi, but Alena (I think) gets in his way and nothing comes of it. 81 mins: What a chance for Real Madrid! Ter Stegen sprints from his area to win the ball but it goes to Benzema, who instantly finds Bale, who takes too long over shooting, allows Ter Stegen to race back to his line, and then hits a defender. 79 mins: Suarez goes down in the area, with Carvajal behind him looking guilty. It was an idiotic challenge, with Suarez right in the corner of the area by the byline, and I think that anywhere outside the area it would certainly have been a free kick. Here, though, the referee is not so keen. 77 mins: A Barca break end with Alena, who collects Messi\u2019s pass but is instantly closed down by two defenders. Had he managed to lift the ball beyond them Suarez was entirely unmarked, but instead he tried to shoot, and Carvajal blocked. 76 mins: Perhaps Malcom\u2019s quiet spell was more down to injury than tactical adjustments. He\u2019s just gone off, with Alena replacing him. 75 mins: Sergio Ramos, already on a booking, goes in late on Arthur. Free kick, but no second yellow. 73 mins: Malcom has been switched from right to left in the last 10 minutes, and has become a little less influential. 70 mins: Messi shoots into the middle of the wall. 69 mins: Messi pickpockets Casemiro and hares goalwards. Vazquez clips his heels on the edge of the D, and Messi will have a decent shooting chance from the free-kick. 67 mins: Messi runs past two people but then runs straight into Varane. A moment later he has the ball again, with an easy pass available to play Suarez in, but he overhits it! 65 mins: There\u2019s a bit more swagger about Barcelona\u2019s play since their equaliser. Perhaps Real\u2019s rabid harrying is also slowing as they tire, which would help. 63 mins: It\u2019s a magic roundabout on the touchline. Real take off Llorente, who appears to be feeling a muscle tweak of some description, and bring on Casemiro. Also: Bale comes on for Vinicus Jr, and Messi for Coutinho. 63 mins: Vidal replaces Rakitic. Messi is about to come on too. 62 mins: Coutinho has another shot from outside the area, but it\u2019s straight down the middle and Navas catches easily. 61 mins: Barcelona are about to make a change and ... it\u2019s Vidal. 60 mins: Alba was booked in the aftermath of the goal, presumably for being mean to the referee. 58 mins: The goal stands! Jordi Alba was played in on the left, but Navas comes out quickly and blocks the shot. It rebounds to Suarez, miles out, with no time, and from an unpromising angle, and he somehow hits the post! The ball rebounds to Malcom, with several defenders now on the line, but he beats them all from 15 yards! Malcom is celebrating! His team-mates are surrounding the referee! Is it a goal? Is it not? What\u2019s happening? Who knows? 57 mins: Another booking, this time for Marcelo, who tripped Pique after the ball had gone. There was very little contact, but the ball ha very much gone. 55 mins: Suarez clips Ramos as they race towards the ball inside the penalty area. He gestures angrily at the referee after the whistle goes, and is booked as a result. 54 mins: The crowd has been loudly calling for Messi\u2019s introduction for a few minutes now. The great man appears to be doing his shoelaces, which is encouraging. 53 mins: Coutinho has a shot from just outside the area, the ball dipping and curling but clearing the bar by a distance. 52 mins: Arthur very nicely dispossesses Modric on the edge of the Barcelona area, the Croatian mid-shot when the ball disappeared and falling over with astonishment after his foot hits nothing but air (and perhaps a bit of the disappearing Arthur). 49 mins: Barcelona have had a lot of the ball in these early minutes of the second half, but done absolutely nothing with it. 46 mins: Jordi Alba has the ball on the left edge of the area. Carvajal closes him down, holding his hands behind his back to keep his arms by his side. Alba blasts the ball into Carvajal and then has the gall to demand a penalty. 46 mins: And they\u2019re off! Again! The players are gathering in the tunnel ahead of half two. It doesn\u2019t look like there will be any immediate changes. He had an excellent first half, but the scoreline might be even better for Real had he passed on a couple of those occasions instead of shooting. \u201cHas Ramos been booked yet? Or is he waiting for Messi?\u201d wonders Ruth Purdue. Oh, he was booked long ago, and is ripe for a second-half, Messi-inspired red. 45+1 mins: And that\u2019s half-time. It\u2019s been an excellent half of high-tempo, hotly-contested football. Real certainly started the better and might have scored more than once before Barcelona got into the game, but having done so perhaps they might have equalised before the break. 45 mins: Modric fouls Arthur, who does well to stay on his feet and keep going. So Modric fouls him again. Arthur again stays upright, but the referee\u2019s had enough and blows his whistle. No yellow for that double-whammy, though. 43 mins: Nelson Semedo goes into the referee\u2019s notebook, for pushing Vinicius in the chest as he tried to change direction. A harsh booking, in my opinion. 41 mins: Rakitic gives the ball away, wins it back excellently, passes to Malcom, gets it back and then gives it away again. 38 mins: Malcom\u2019s selection was the chief talking-point pre-match but he has had an excellent half, and is combining very well with Nelson Semedo. 37 mins: Nearly a fluke chance for Barcelona! A clearance hits Coutinho in the head and rebounds beautifully for Suarez, but the Uruguayan\u2019s attempt to take the ball around Varane only gives it to Navas. 35 mins: Good save! Malcom is the creator again, picking up a long ball on the right, dribbling into the area and poking to Suarez, whose curler from the edge of the box is palmed wide by Navas! 32 mins: And Real nearly double their lead on the counter! He runs down the left and tries to pick out Benzema with his cross, but it\u2019s just too far in front of the Frenchman! 32 mins: Barcelona hit the bar! Malcom wins another free-kick on the right, sends it in nicely, and Rakitic heads against the woodwork! 31 mins: Barcelona come close! Malcom cuts in from the right and plays in Semedo. Navas roars off his line, Semedo blindly crosses and it finds a white shirt! 29 mins: Busquets slides in to dispossess Vinicius Jr, but the ball hits his hand as he slides and the referee gives a free kick. 27 mins: Malcom wins a free-kick on the right and curls it in nicely. Pique heads over, though the referee gives a corner so perhaps it was deflected on its way. Malcom\u2019s delivery from the corner isn\u2019t as good as it was from the free-kick. 26 mins: The ball is played through to Jordi Alba, busting his gut on the left flank, but it skims unhelpfully off the surface and Navas gets to it first. 23 mins: Malcom nearly dribbles through the Barcelona defence, only to be dispossessed at the last. Real break at pace, Vinicius Junior drives down the left and then picks out Kroos, who has to stretch a fraction too far to land boot on ball and can\u2019t control his shot. 20 mins: Suarez slides through to Malcom, who runs clear but his shot is unconvincing and saved by Navas, and then the whistle blows - Malcom was fractionally offside (though Suarez should have played the ball a bit sooner, and then he wouldn\u2019t have been). 19 mins: The corner is cleared to Llorente, who slams a volley wide from 20 yards. 17 mins: Coutinho gives the ball away this time. Benzema passes to Vinicius to his left, and the Brazilian wildly miscues his shot, and is lucky that it hit Pique so Real at least get a corner out of it. 13 mins: Rakitic is dispossessed in midfield and three white shirts run towards goal, with only two defenders in their way. Vinicius Junior and Benzema practically grapple with each other for the right to run with the ball, both ignore the totally unmarked Kroos to their left, and Vinicius\u2019s shot is charged down by Pique. That should have been No2. 10 mins: A good moment for Barcelona, who get bodies in the box but Sergio Ramos clears Arthur Melo\u2019s cross. Then seconds later Ramos fouls Semedo on the Real left, and is booked. 8 mins: Navas clears the ball to Marcelo on the left, who tries an outlandish and frankly irresponsible backheel flick-volley infield which sends it straight to Busquets. An early goal for Real! Vinicius Junior carries the ball down the left, cuts in and then chips the ball beyond the far post, where Jordi Alba misjudges his header, Benzema chests down and cuts back, and Vazquez finishes nicely! 5 mins: A shot! Kroos, teed up by Vinicius Junior, powers in a drive from 25 yards and Ter Stegen beats it away. 3 mins: Coutinho is played through on the left, but is offside. 2 mins: Almost all the play so far has been down Real\u2019s left flank, and most of that has happened within 10 yards of the halfway line. The visitors have had a few throw-ins, but there has been no early excitement. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! Real Madrid get the game started! To commemorate Chinese new year, the Barcelona players have their names on the back of their shirts in both the Latin and Chinese alphabets. The players are emerging from the tunnel! Much vigorous flag-waving in the stands. \u201cI\u2019ve been out of touch with Spanish football for a while, but why are Bale, Asensio, Isco and Casemiro all on the bench?\u201d asks Sanchit Sabhlok. It\u2019s not such a surprise: only Bale and Casemiro of those players started in the league at the weekend. Isco has started only five league games this season, and Asensio\u2019s substitute appearance against Alaves was his first since before Christmas. Llorente for Casemiro is an interesting call, but not an unjustifiable one. Barcelona have distributed some 40,000 little plastic flags to their fans tonight, and many are already waving them with gusto. The players are all out and warming up. As you\u2019d probably expect. They tend to come out much later in Barcelona than at the average Premier League ground, presumably because they do the first part of their warm-up inside somewhere. Also not starting tonight is Gareth Bale, who may well be \u201cready for El Clasico\u201d but is not, for the moment, needed for El Clasico. He\u2019s only made one substitute appearance in the Copa del Rey this season, and has been a bit injured of late. Lionel Messi starts on the bench for Barcelona, with Malcom taking his place in the starting XI. Talking of Messi, his casual attire appears to have angered Darren Huckerby: The teams are in, and these are they: Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Semedo, Pique, Lenglet, Alba, Rakitic, Busquets, Arthur, Malcom, Suarez, Coutinho. Subs: I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a, S Roberto, Messi, Arturo Vidal, Ale\u00f1\u00e1, Boateng, Murillo. Real Madrid: Navas, Carvajal, Ramos, Varane, Marcelo, Kroos, Modric, Lucas, Llorente, Vinicius, Benzema. Subs: Courtois, Nacho, Bale, Casemiro, Asensio, Isco, Ceballos. Simon will be here shortly.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister, offering to throw Labour\u2019s support behind her Brexit deal if she makes five legally binding commitments \u2013 including joining a customs union. The Labour leader held private talks with Theresa May last week for the first time since her deal was rejected by a historic margin of 230 votes in January. In a follow-up letter sent on Wednesday, he laid out in the clearest terms yet what commitments he is seeking in exchange for offering Labour support. His intervention will dismay backbench Labour MPs and grassroots activists still hoping he will switch the party\u2019s policy towards demanding a second Brexit referendum \u2013 which is not mentioned in the letter. And it comes as No 10 prepares to publish legislation underpinning workers\u2019 rights, perhaps as early as next week, in an attempt to win support from Labour backbenchers. In his letter, Corbyn calls for the government to rework the political declaration setting the framework for Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU \u2013 and then enshrine these new negotiating objectives in UK law, so that a future Tory leader could not sweep them away after Brexit. He says the changes to the political declaration must include: A \u201cpermanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union\u201d, including a say in future trade deals. Close alignment with the single market, underpinned by \u201cshared institutions\u201d. \u201cDynamic alignment on rights and protections\u201d, so that UK standards do not fall behind those of the EU. Clear commitments on future UK participation in EU agencies and funding programmes. Unambiguous agreements on future security arrangements, such as use of the European arrest warrant. There is no mention of the second of the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer\u2019s six tests, which said that Labour would not support any deal that failed to deliver the \u201cexact same benefits\u201d as single market and customs union membership. Labour\u2019s approach, which Corbyn called \u201cconstructive\u201d, appears to be focused firmly on the forward-looking political declaration, rather than the 585-page withdrawal agreement, which contains the Irish backstop and the divorce bill. \u201cWe recognise that your priority is now to seek legally binding changes to the backstop arrangements contained within the withdrawal agreement, as we discussed when we met,\u201d Corbyn writes. \u201cHowever, without changes to your negotiating red lines, we do not believe that simply seeking modifications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response either to the scale of your defeat last month in parliament, or the need for a deal with the EU that can bring the country together and protect jobs,\u201d he says. He does not explicitly say that article 50 should be extended \u2013 a move that the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, described as \u201csensible\u201d on Wednesday. But he said that because of the government\u2019s negotiating failures \u201ctime has run out for the necessary preparation and for legislation to be finalised\u201d. He added: \u201cFollowing last week\u2019s rejection by the House of Commons of no deal, all necessary steps must be taken to avoid such an outcome.\u201d He concluded: \u201cMy colleagues and I look forward to discussing these proposals with you further, in the constructive manner in which they are intended, with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together.\u201d May has so far vehemently resisted the prospect of reopening the political declaration, focusing instead on securing changes to the Irish backstop, which has been the flashpoint for Brexiter Conservative MPs. But at the same time, her government has been trying to win over Labour backbenchers with new legally binding promises on workers\u2019 rights. She could propose a new draft bill as early as next week guaranteeing that UK workers\u2019 rights will keep pace with Europe. Backbench Labour sources said the new bill was in the late stages of drafting and would include a \u201cregression lock\u201d that the UK parliament would ensure workers\u2019 rights would never slip below European standards. That approach appears likely to come close to meeting one of Corbyn\u2019s five tests. Multiple Labour MPs who have met May over the past few months have made it clear to her that they needed the guarantees to be made in primary legislation \u2013 because they do not trust that May will remain in No 10 for much longer. Those who are in negotiations with the government have insisted that the bill must be tabled and have had at least one day of second reading within the next few months. The Labour MP John Mann, one of the key figures behind the push for legislation, said: \u201cThere needs to be a bill produced soon. We aren\u2019t basing anything on a promise, with all due respect to the prime minister. We are doing it based on statute.\u201d The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who has also intimated she could back May\u2019s deal, said the right offer from No 10 could win over up to 60 Labour MPs. \u201cIf she were able to come back, and stop this eternal circular conversation within the Tory Party, and start reaching out to the rest of parliament and the rest of the country and give us those assurances, I think you\u2019d get somewhere between 40 and 60 Labour [MPs] who would be prepared to step forward and say: we\u2019ve got to come together around this, otherwise we leave with no deal,\u201d Nandy told BBC Radio 5 Live. But Phil Wilson, the Labour MP for Sedgefield and a leading supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, said: \u201cIt was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer \u2026 In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour party \u2013 a people\u2019s vote.\u201d Trade unions are understood to have been pushing for the legislation to include an easing of restrictions on union activity. Union leaders had been seeking more concrete proposals for regulation of the labour market after Brexit and the enforcement of existing law. \u201cTheir desire to bring in seasonal agricultural workers from around the globe, as well as barista visas, really does ring alarm bells,\u201d one union source said. \u201cOur fear is that when workers depend on their bosses for their visas, exploitation is sure to follow.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And read Andy Hunter on City \u2026 Well, we have ourselves a title race. A dogged effort by a City side perhaps not at their imperious best was enough to earn the resuklt and move level on points with Liverpool, though, crucially, ahead on goal difference. Be sure to check out Daniel Taylor\u2019s full report from Goodison Park and thanks as always for following along with us! City, who trailed Liverpool by seven points at Christmas, are top of the Premier League table once more on goal difference, albeit with one more match played. A fair result for the defending champions despite a resolute showing from the hosts, who never really conjured the attacking spark that might have made things interesting. And City are going back to the top of the table after Jesus runs onto a De Bruyne offering. His initial shot is saved by Pickford, but the remains spin directly into his path and he deposits an arching header into the net. 90 min+6: City collectively doing well to take the wind out of these final minutes. 90 min+4: City win a corner, this one fairly, and it\u2019s played short before it\u2019s fired all the way back to Ederson. Tick ... tick ... tick .... 90 min+2: Man City are gifted a corner on a ball that clearly went out on Jesus. Everton clear it easily and snap into a counter-attack, but a long ball sent through and is easily handled by Ederson. 90 min: Fourth official Mike Dean signals for seven minutes of stoppage time. Not over yet. 89 min: Richarlison wins a throw on the left side and Man City make their final sub with Kevin De Bruyne coming on for David Silva. A healthy chunk of stoppage time likely awaits. 87 min: Play resumes after a few minutes of treatment for Tosun and Otamendi, who went down after colliding over a 50-50 ball. 83 min: Richarlison slips one through on the counter into space for Tosun, but Ederson springs off his line and he\u2019s able to arrive first. Just. 82 min: Zouma earns a fast yellow after a hard challenge on Jesus. And Fernandinho takes his right old time on the restart ... 80 min: Both side make attacking changes with 10 minutes to go. For City, Gabriel Jesus is on for Sergio Aguero. For the hosts, it\u2019s Cenk Tosun in place of Theo Walcott. 78 min: Only a dozen or so minutes to go and Everton, for all their possession, are no closer now to the spark of creativity that might unlock the City back four than in the opening minutes. 73 min: Yikes. Another overzealous challenge by Fernandinho, who\u2019s comes in hard on Gueye and steps on the foot of the Everton man, who goes down in a heap. The Brazilian has gotten away with one assault after another tonight, but it\u2019s finally caught up with him as he\u2019s shown yellow to the vocal gratitude of the home supporters. Moments after Everton make their second sub as Richarlison comes on for Bernard. 70 min: Another chance for City is subverted when Gundogan\u2019s shot is blocked by Davies. The visitors appear at full speed once more after a quiet spell early in the half. 68 min: A bit of a quiet patch for both sides abruptly ends when Man City have a few looks at goal as the ball rattles around in the area. It\u2019s finally Sterling who sends it toward the goal, but his shot catches a team-mate and sails just over the crossbar. 64 min: It\u2019s an offensive switch for Everton as Sigurdsson replaces Gomes. The hosts win another corner moments later when Stones heads out a cross by Walcott, who\u2019s become a featured player in the last quarter-hour. But Digne\u2019s effort is easily cleared and sent back to Pickford. 62 min: Walcott pounces on a lackadaisical Stones pass to Laporte on the right side, but the quick-fire counter goes up in smoke when his poor cross is easily handled by Ederson. 60 min: Guardiola makes the first substitution of the night for either side, inserting Raheem Sterling for Leroy Sane. 58 min: City move it quickly down the pitch with a series of sharp, accurate passes, a menacing attack that\u2019s finally snuffed out when Aguero\u2019s subsequent overhead kick with the keeper stranded is sent inches wide of the post. 54 min: Everton win another free kick, this one about 30 yards from goal, after Fernandinho comes in late on Davies, fortunate to escape the referee\u2019s book. Digne\u2019s effort is poor, sent directly into the bottom of the wall. 51 min: Laporte comes back on ahead of Digne\u2019s corner and it\u2019s the Frenchman who heads it away at the near post. It\u2019s not entirely cleared, though, and Gueye\u2019s effort from 25 yards is easily corralled by Ederson. 50 min: Digne stands over the ball and prepares to restart play with a free kick. Guardiola is not happy that Laporte will not be allowed back on to defend it. Digne targets Zouma in the area, but it goes out off Fernandinho past the goal line for a corner. 49 min: Laporte gets an earful from the home supporters as he groggily makes his way to the touchline. 47 min: And they off and running in the second half! And less than a minute passes before Laporte lays waste to Walcott as he\u2019s mid-air looking to advance the ball with a header. Walcott is down in a heap (as is Laporte), but the replay shows the Everton man completely blindsided by a reckless challenge. Both training staffs are on the pitch and it\u2019s Walcott who makes it to his feet first. More statistical arcana as we wait for the start of the second half. First time\u2019s the charm for City this year, it seems. Here\u2019s one for the trivia wonks. Can anyone help Scott? City end the first half on a high note that may feel cruel for the hosts but is not undeserved, even factoring in the quarter-hour when the visitors\u2019 attack failed to generate anything resembling an attack. The defending champions wore down their opponents and ultimately broke through. City win a free kick when Gueye comes in hot on Fernandinho about 25 yards from the target. David Silva uncorks an effort drizzled with spin that caroms off Laporte and into the goal. 43 min: A pair of close calls for the hosts as the first half winds down. First the ball ping-pongs among a cluster of players in the Everton area but won\u2019t fall for the visitors. Then moments later Sane is caught offside after mistiming his run onto a nicely hit entry. The flag is up, but Pickford\u2019s wonderful hair-trigger save on the dead play warrants mention! 41 min: Everton win another corner when a Walcott cross is deflected past the goal line, but Zouma\u2019s effort comes up empty. 39 min: City win a corner. It\u2019s played to the far post and initially cleared to the middle third. City resume the attack momentarily until Gomes picks Aguero\u2019s pocket to key a rapid Everton counter. The crowd swells as deft interplay between Bernard and Gomes move it the left flank, but Gomes\u2019 pass into Calvert-Lewin is overcooked and runs through to Ederson. Threat averted. 36 min: Everton win another corner on the counter-attack but nothing comes of it. It\u2019s City on the attack moments later, but the pass to Sane on the edge of the area has a little too much on it and it\u2019s out for a goal kick. Unusually, it\u2019s City\u2019s attack that\u2019s gone cold over the last 10 minutes. 30 min: Everton have their first attempt just before the half-hour mark as Walcott picks out Bernard in the the center of the area, but the Brazilian\u2019s header is deflected out for an Everton corner, their first the night. It\u2019s a just reward for a disciplined build-up. Walker is able to hold off the second effort and clear it. 27 min: David Silva tries to find Sane once more down the left flank but he\u2019s blanketed by Kenny and the ball trickles out for a goal kick. 23 min: Everton continue to founder in attack: a long ball from Keane to Walcott is disrupted and returns possession to the visitors. It\u2019s not done much to elevate a curiously flat (tense?) atmosphere at Goodison Park, but for a few moments it\u2019s slowed the City tide. 19 min: City are knocking on the door with mounting intensity. Moments after an Aguero threat, Gundogan runs onto a pass from David Silva and rattles the bar from six with the keeper beaten. 16 min: Gundogan finds Sane in acres of space on the edge of area, but his attempt is blocked by a fast-closing Everton defender and is out for a corner. The subsequent effort curls toward the far post and the the keeper Jordan Pickford completely loses flight of the ball! How lucky for Everton that Laporte\u2019s free header is off target. Should have been 1-0 to City after that! 12 min: A well organized Everton have done well to contain the City attack early on. They\u2019ve kept possession well, but haven\u2019t been able to crack the final third. 9 min: Sane gives it away near the halfway line and Everton win a throw-in moments later. Davies\u2019 delivers an ambitious ball through to the far post but no one is there for it. 7 min: Everton have their first extended spell of possession of attack after Walker is caught offside, but have yet to generate a meaningful chance. 3 min: Man City resume their attack and win the first corner. Nervy moment early for the hosts. The ball is cleared to the edge of the area but Sane has a clear line on goal, but sends an effort wide of the post. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! Man City kicks off and immediately moves it down the left flank, but a giveaway leads to an Everton counter-attack led by Calvert-Lewin, who centers to Gomes in the area ... but Bernard is whistled for a clear foul on Otamendi. Quick start! The teams have emerged from the tunnel. We should be under way any moment now. Manchester City trailed Liverpool by seven points at Christmas. But the margin is down to three after a series of slip-ups by the leaders and the defending champions can regain the top spot on goal difference with a win today at Goodison Park. The importance of the tie-breaker is not lost on Pep Guardiola, who is urging his men to press the advantage and pound in as many goals as possible: \u201cThe first message is to win the game and the second one is if you can score, score, and if you can avoid conceding, do it,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThe Premier League could go to goal difference, I agree, though we are not going to say to the guys: \u2018Today we have to win 25-zero.\u2019 I have never said that. First you have to win the game and then second try [to score more], because it can happen.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s last two results have been draws, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team spurning the chance to pull seven points ahead of City. Guardiola, asked whether he felt reassured that his players have experience of winning the title, said: \u201cI think [your] question is whether Liverpool can handle the pressure or not \u2013 really I don\u2019t know. \u201cWhat I would say is that I trust my players because, and I use this example always, we were 3-0 down in the Champions League at Anfield [last season] and the reaction when we played them in the second leg \u2026 when we scored a legal goal [Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s effort was incorrectly ruled out for offside] and an incredible penalty in the second half via Andy Robertson on Raheem Sterling [which was not given]. \u201cThe way we reacted and the way we [proceeded] to play despite all of this \u2013 that\u2019s good. The only moment in the last two seasons when we lost back-to-back league games was this season against Crystal Palace and Leicester [in December]. I have the feeling that when I put them under pressure they react well. They accept the challenge when I say: \u2018OK, show me again how good you are, come on.\u2019 And they do it, they try it.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s teams. Manchester City, who can go top of the Premier League on goal difference with three points today, have made two changes from the team that beat Arsenal on Sunday with John Stones and Leroy Sane inserted in place of Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling. Everton, in the mix for seventh and a possible Europa League berth, make five changes to the side that were beaten by Wolves over the weekend: Marco Silva plugs in Jonjoe Kenny, Lucas Digne, Idrissa Gueye, Bernard and Dominic Calvert-Lewin in place of Leighton Baines, Seamus Coleman, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Richarlison and Cenk Tosun. Everton XI: Pickford, Kenny, Zouma, Keane, Digne, Gueye, Walcott, Davies, Andre Gomes, Bernard, Calvert-Lewin Subs: Sigurdsson, Tosun, McCarthy, Schneiderlin, Stekelenburg, Coleman, Richarlison Man City XI: Ederson, Walker, Otamendi, Laporte, Stones, Fernandinho, Bernardo Silva, Gundogan, Silva, Sane, Aguero Subs: Danilo, Sterling, De Bruyne, Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus, Zinchenko, Muric Referee: Craig Pawson (South Yorkshire) Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s Paul Wilson on Everton\u2019s current troubles: Liverpool\u2019s latest attack of stage fright means Manchester City can regain the Premier League leadership with a win at Everton on Wednesday. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team would have a game in hand, but if City can prove unflappable at Goodison in a way their rival were unable to manage against Leicester and West Ham the sense of a pendulum swinging would surely add to the nervous tension surrounding Anfield. What Liverpool need most, apart from the break FA Cup weekend will provide to rest some weary legs and bring a few key players back from injury, is a favour from their neighbours in blue. Everton beating City, or even drawing against them as they did at the Etihad last season, would offer Liverpool some breathing space at the top of the table. Were City to show fallibility at Goodison, Liverpool would feel a lot better about a two- or three-point lead with a game in hand. You can read the full article below:",

These began on the first night of the month, and caused major disruption to travellers: first in the south and east of England, and later in western and northern England, Wales and finally Scotland, where Balmoral, on Deeside, had 42cm of snow lying on 7 February. This was the first time the whole of the UK had been affected by widespread snowfalls for almost two decades, since the winter of 1990-91. But more was to come: the following two winters, 2009/10 and 2010/11, were both very cold and snowy.",

      "bodyText": "The fund manager who asked Tim Wilson to coordinate parliamentary committee hearings with his lobbying work once boasted to investors that the impost of Labor\u2019s franking credit policy is trivially easy to avoid. Geoff Wilson \u2013 the chairman of Wilson Asset Management and a distant relative of Tim Wilson \u2013 when talking to concerned retirees claimed the reform would devastate their livelihoods but told his own investors that Labor\u2019s revenue claims were \u201cludicrous\u201d because they could simply restructure their affairs. Labor has called for Tim Wilson to be sacked as chair of the house economics committee after revelations that Geoff Wilson asked the Liberal MP to set committee dates to align with meetings of shareholders who the fund manager then encouraged to attend and protest. Tim Wilson has failed to declare at committee hearings that he has a shareholding in two funds managed by Wilson Asset Management through Wilson-Bolger Superannuation Pty Ltd, although he did declare it in his pecuniary interest register. He has also refused to rule out that Geoff Wilson has contributed funding for the stoptheretirementtax.com website, authorised by the Liberal MP, which encourages people to sign a petition and make a form submission to his own inquiry. Labor is canvassing a number of options to force the government\u2019s hand, including a binding House of Representatives resolution to remove Tim Wilson as chair, as the Coalition controls the numbers on the committee itself. The prime minister and Coalition members backed the embattled chair on Wednesday. The Greens MP and committee member Adam Bandt told Guardian Australia that Tim Wilson had \u201cfailed to declare a conflict of interest, turned the hearings into a farce and he should do the right thing and stand down\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a higher standard expected of a committee chair,\u201d Bandt said. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told Radio National on Wednesday that Wilson was \u201chopelessly compromised\u201d because he \u201chas been caught colluding with a relative whose company he owns shares in to manipulate processes of the parliament\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s put on a committee hearing at a date and at a place that coincided with the company\u2019s AGM, presumably so that many people who were at the AGM could flock along.\u201d Tim Wilson responded that he \u201cabsolutely worked with stakeholders to ensure Australians participated in the inquiry\u201d. The government is determined not to let Labor deter it from prosecuting a campaign designed to turn retirees against the opposition but the connection with Geoff Wilson has blunted its attack. At a shareholder presentation in November, Geoff Wilson said that \u201call you\u2019ve got to do is change from a company structure to a trust structure\u201d to avoid the impact of Labor\u2019s policy, which scraps the cash refunds for excess imputation credits claimed by retirees and self-managed superannuation funds. Geoff Wilson explained that entities managed by Wilson Asset Management could become trusts that wouldn\u2019t pay two-thirds of dividends in tax, meaning they could pay out a higher actual dividend but it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be fully franked\u201d. He mocked Labor\u2019s claims the measure would raise billions, labelling the revenue \u201ca mirage\u201d and likening it to the failed mining tax. \u201cDo they think we\u2019re all stupid? Don\u2019t they think we\u2019re all going to change our behaviour? \u201cAnd the people that are getting the refunds \u2026 they\u2019ll go into offshore equities or trust structures or change their structures like we can.\u201d Geoff Wilson said it was \u201cludicrous\u201d to think people would \u201cstay there and just give them the $5-6bn\u201d. \u201cAnd everyone who sells that share, that has benefited from that franking credit will sell it to someone that might be on a higher tax rate who will utilise that franking credit.\u201d Geoff Wilson suggested the reforms were \u201czero sum\u201d but also acknowledged some people would not restructure their affairs and \u201cmiss out and Labor will get [some revenue from] that\u201d. Earlier in November, he told the Alliance for a Fairer Retirement summit that Labor\u2019s franking credit was \u201ca very real threat to the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of Australians\u201d. At times emotional, he read testimonials from affected retirees including a 68-year-old who receives $25,000 in franking credit refunds which she says pays her rent and to help support a disabled dependent adult child, also set to lose $800. Geoff Wilson concluded by suggesting Labor\u2019s policies would have a \u201cdramatic implication for equity and property markets resulting in the first recession in Australia for 27 years\u201d. \u201cLabor\u2019s policies will not only significantly impact retirees and low-income earners, but they will destroy the aspirations of a generation of young Australians.\u201d",

Last year the commonwealth struck long-term education funding agreements with every state and territory except Victoria, locking in place the amount of money to be spent on public and private schools. But a new analysis of the agreements claims a special clause could cost government schools as much as $19bn between 2018 and 2027 by allowing states and territories to include funding for things like building maintenance in their overall contribution to the public sector. An education researcher and public schools advocate, Trevor Cobbold, said the government sector was being \u201cswindled\u201d by \u201cspecial deals\u201d which were allowing the states to \u201cartificially boost their funding\u201d for public schools. In 2017 the former education minister, Simon Birmingham, passed his Gonski 2.0 reforms, which required states to lift their overall funding to public schools to at least 75% of what\u2019s known as the School Resourcing Standard by 2023. The SRS is the Gonski review\u2019s needs-based formula for measuring how much government funding each school is entitled to. When the SRS was first developed it explicitly excluded items such as the cost of capital, depreciation, transport costs and umbrella services, such as each state\u2019s board of studies. But in September Guardian Australia revealed that state and territory governments were planning to use the commonwealth\u2019s deal with the private and independent school sectors to push back against the way its funding commitments for public schools were calculated. And the long-term bilateral agreements struck between the commonwealth and every state and territory except Victoria late last year show the original definition of the SRS has been railroaded to allow states and territories to include \u201cextra expenditure items\u201d as up to 4% of their total SRS. It means that every state and territory bar the ACT is able to partially count expenditure explicitly excluded from the original definition of the School Resourcing Standard as part of their overall education budget. Each state\u2019s agreement is different, meaning they\u2019re able to claim different expenditure as part of the deal. In New South Wales, for example, the state\u2019s education standards authority and capital depreciation costs are able to be partially taken into account in its SRS calculation. Rob Stokes, the state\u2019s education minister, said it \u201cdoes not impact on the $6.4bn in additional funding for NSW government schools\u201d. \u201cUnlike some states, NSW will only include expenditure that directly relates to public education in this 4%, including NESA (the proportion that serves public schools) and capital depreciation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis funding is real additional money and will be delivered in full.\u201d In Western Australia, direct school transport, capital depreciation, kindergarten expenditure and all regulatory funding associated with the state\u2019s school curriculum authority can be included in the 4% SRS allowance. The Australian Capital Territory is the only state or territory which does not include the 4% exemption in its bilateral agreement with the commonwealth. According to a new analysis by Cobbold, the \u201cadditional\u201d expenditure items could cost public schools $19bn in the decade after the agreement if the states and territories claim the full 4% exemption. And the same expenditure cannot be used to count against the state\u2019s contribution to private schools. \u201cOnly public schools are being defrauded by this sleight of hand in the bilateral agreements,\u201d Cobbold writes in his analysis. \u201cThe allowance for state governments to substitute other expenditures for actual increases in recurrent funding as defined for the SRS does not apply to private schools. Yet, private schools benefit from capital funding by state governments, school transport funding and regulatory and standards authorities funded by the states.\u201d Published on Thursday, Cobbold\u2019s analysis shows public schools could be short-changed to the tune of $60bn over the decade to 2027. The terms of the Gonski agreement struck by Birmingham required the majority of states to reach 75% of the SRS for public schools by 2023 while the commonwealth funded 20%, leaving a 5% shortfall. And data published in the bilateral agreements shows public schools are now funded at less than 95% of the SRS in every state except the ACT and WA. Cobbold estimates that if the deals remain in place until 2027, it could mean a \u201ccumulative\u201d loss of $41bn for the public sector. \u201cPublic schools are being defrauded by school funding agreements finalised at the end of last year between the commonwealth and the state and territory governments,\u201d Cobbold writes in the paper. \u201cPublic schools in all states except the ACT will only ever be funded at 95% of their School Resourcing Standard at best, and likely less. \u201cIn contrast, private schools in all states except the Northern Territory are guaranteed funding at 100% or more of their SRS by 2023. \u201cThe agreements are heavily biased against public schools and in favour of private schools.\u201d",

The Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, has sent a message to activists, explaining \u201cthere is still everything to play for\u201d, and \u201cthe People\u2019s Vote is alive and well\u201d \u2013 but his party does not plan to table a referendum amendment yet. Campaigners believe that, with less than 50 days to go until exit day on 29 March, they would still fall short of commanding a majority among MPs if they attempted to force the issue of a referendum now. Instead, they plan to wait and see what if any changes to the backstop the prime minister manages to secure from her diplomatic offensive in Dublin and Brussels. The prime minister has promised that if she has not struck a revised deal with the EU27, including \u201calternative arrangements\u201d on the backstop, she will table a statement to the House of Commons on 13 February \u2013 which MPs will be able to amend and vote on. That could be a chance to test parliament\u2019s appetite for alternatives, but it is thought unlikely that the full \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on her revised withdrawal agreement will take place next week, with speculation it could be pushed back until the end of the month. Cable plans to send a regretful message to supporters about the decision to postpone seeking a second referendum amendment yet again, acknowledging many will be disappointed. In the message to members seen by the Guardian, the Lib Dem leader hinted at a difference of opinion about how it could be pursued. \u201cThe first step is to remove the danger of No Deal,\u201d the message reads. \u201cSince nobody but the archest Europhobes want Britain to leave without an agreement, it is high time that the country faced the real choice, which is between accepting the prime minister\u2019s agreement or staying in the European Union.\u201d Cable said that the first step was to persuade more Conservatives to block a no-deal Brexit, including those in the cabinet. \u201cWith no deal off the table the pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to get off the fence and support a People\u2019s Vote will be immense,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLiberal Democrats are working across party lines to bring about a united front against \u2018no deal\u2019, which we believe will pave the way for the public to have the final say.\u201d Anti-Brexit campaigners from all the major parties are in talks about how to proceed \u2013 but several senior backbenchers involved in previous bids to force the prime minister\u2019s hand told the Guardian they believed little could be achieved next week, aside from reiterating parliament\u2019s objections to a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe will have to wait and see what she comes back with, and what she says to parliament,\u201d said one Conservative remainer. Another committed backbench campaigner pointed out that an amendment like that tabled by Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles last time, which would have handed MPs the power to extend article 50, would not succeed without some Conservative MPs switching sides \u2013 and that may not happen until her deal has been defeated again in a second \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. A fresh version of a Cooper-Boles type amendment is likely to be tabled next week \u2013 but perhaps in the name of a new alliance of MPs. Downing Street reiterated its commitment to tabling a motion to parliament on 13 February but hinted that any voting could be delayed until the following week when parliament was originally scheduled to be in recess.",

The talks saw hundreds of Afghan representatives, veterans of wars for and against both the US and the Soviets, and rounds of civil war, descend on the marble lobby of Moscow\u2019s President hotel. The negotiations took place in a grand conference room flanked by souvenir shops, with occasional breaks for prayer. Anwar ul-Haq Ahady, a former finance minister, said in an interview that the conference\u2019s location showed that Russia was once again becoming \u201crelevant\u201d in Afghanistan. \u201cIn the past few years, Russia has reasserted its role\u201d in Afghanistan, said Ahady. \u201cIt has relations with the Taliban and some of the leading personalities of Afghanistan. I think it\u2019s a sign of the re-emergence of Russia in Afghan politics.\u201d The Moscow talks are officially being organised by members of the Afghan diaspora. But there is little question of official support, not least because the Taliban delegation given visas to travel are all still on a terror watchlist. The meeting was also held at a Kremlin-owned hotel. Women\u2019s rights have played a prominent role in the talks, with concerns that an empowered Taliban could seek to roll back new civil rights if they gain great power. The two women delegates called for women\u2019s rights to be at the heart of any settlement, and protected by the international community. The Taliban at the talks have disavowed responsibility for some of the most heinous acts of violence against women in areas controlled by the group, and have said they will grant all women their rights under Islamic law. But Fawzia Koofi, a politician and women\u2019s rights activist, said Afghan women wanted a mechanism to enforce any promises. \u201cHow do you ensure that all these nice statements are not just made to convince the US and international community to leave and then life goes back to how it was under the Taliban?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe have to be very careful with these nice statements. If there\u2019s no guarantor, how can we ensure that things won\u2019t return to how they were under the Taliban?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The youngest of the 13 people whose deaths formed the basis for the most recent coronial inquiry into Aboriginal youth suicides in Western Australia was just 10 years old when she took her life on 6 March 2016. They were born between 1991 and 2006, in communities around the Kimberley region of Western Australia and in the Northern Territory. They died between 20 November 2012 and 24 March 2016 at Halls Creek, Kununurra, Broome, Wyndham and in smaller remote Aboriginal communities in between. But it was the suicide of a 10-year-old girl in 2016 which shocked the nation and motivated state coroner Ros Fogliani to call a joint inquest in June 2017 to address why, after dozens of previous inquiries, rates of suicide among Indigenous children and young people in the Kimberley appeared to be worsening. By some estimates, 2018 will be the worst year on record for Indigenous youth suicides. This year alone, eight Aboriginal children have taken their lives; two of them were 12-year-old girls. But the long-awaited inquest findings, which will be handed down in Perth on Thursday, won\u2019t include these deaths. It won\u2019t include the names of the children, whose names have been suppressed for cultural reasons. Instead, it will refer to the children and young people by number. And the numbers are devastating. Here are some more. Two of the boys and one of the girls had a reported history of child sexual abuse. Four had been hospitalised as infants with failure to thrive, meaning they had fallen drastically below expected growth and weight percentiles. Almost all had been exposed to alcohol abuse and significant domestic violence. One boy had a full academic scholarship to leave his home community for a boarding school in Victoria. He was to leave two weeks after the date when he, without warning or any previous known self-harm attempts, took his own life a week before his 13th birthday. Five: the number of deaths in this inquest that concern the suicide of someone aged between 10 and 13. Forty: the number of government and non-governments reports into Aboriginal suicide in Western Australia delivered between 2002 and 2016. Seven hundred: the number of recommendations made in those reports, most of which, according to a WA parliamentary inquiry released in November 2016, have not been fully implemented. Eight: the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 17 and younger throughout Australia who have killed themselves so far in 2019. That last number could be higher, said Gerry Georgatos, the coordinator of the National Indigenous Critical Response Service. He has supported the families of four more people who have attempted suicide. \u201cThere are more attempts than ever before and more attempts by young people than ever before,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that [coronial report] does not come back with a call for mass investment or a reallocation of funding for more outreach services, it\u2019s going to fall as usual a long way short.\u201d Georgatos represents one side of the argument on suicide response, saying the driving cause is poverty and a sense of hopelessness, not a lack of connection to culture. \u201cWe are seeing the highest suicide rates in the most culture-rich areas \u2013 the Kimberley region, the central desert region,\u201d he said. \u201cPoverty is the number one issue. People who live above the poverty line who are First Nations people are not taking their own lives.\u201d That is not to say that culture is not important \u2013 only that, in Georgatos\u2019s argument, it is not absent. \u201cThey have got culture \u2026 they need opportunity,\u201d he said. The Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Culture Centre (KALACC) said that culture is the missing ingredient in previous attempts to manage the suicide crisis. There is extensive research on the role of culture healing intergenerational trauma, and extensive research on the influence of intergenerational trauma on disproportionate suicide rates. The rate of suicide among Indigenous people in the Kimberley is three times the national Indigenous suicide rate and seven times the national non-Indigenous rate, according to a 2016 report in the Medical Journal of Australia. Nationally, Indigenous people die from suicide at twice the rate of non-Indigenous people. Indigenous children aged five to 17 die from suicide at five times the rate of non-Indigenous children. It was declared a \u201cnational tragedy\u201d in a Senate inquiry into mental health in rural and remote areas, which released its final report in December. The 2016 WA parliamentary inquiry into Indigenous suicide quoted in its introduction a scathing comment from the Telethon Kids Institute director, Professor Jonathan Carapetis, who said but for the physical and societal distance between policymakers in Perth and children killing themselves in the Kimberley it would be considered a \u201cstate emergency\u201d. Even when an emergency is declared \u2013 such as when the previous WA coroner, Alastair Hope, handed down a damning report on the deaths of 22 young people in the Kimberley in 2008, and again on the deaths of five young people in 2011 \u2013 reforms are either not made or not followed through.

In 2015 changes were made to reporting requirements in the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s code of conduct. \u201cOnce a leader in transparency, Australia is now falling behind other countries,\u201d the study published in BMJ Open on Thursday concluded. \u201cThis study provides a clear example of the limitations of a self-regulatory system, which can be quietly changed in such a way as to reduce overall public reporting of industry funding in the healthcare sector. We recommend that countries insist on legislation rather than self-regulation to promote long-lasting public transparency around industry spending.\u201d</p> <p><strong>More than 16,000 people on the contentious ParentsNext program received a payment suspension in the first six months of its operation, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/07/one-in-five-parents-had-payments-cut-in-first-six-months-of-new-welfare-program\">representing 21% of the 75,000 participants</a>. The suspension rate for Indigenous parents \u2013 who are targeted for eligibility and make up 19% of participants \u2013 is higher at 27%. The suspensions are considered particularly concerning because all ParentsNext participants have children between six months and five years old and generally have no other source of income. The Australian Human Rights Commission claims that the program is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with Australia\u2019s human rights obligations and social services and legal groups have called for it to be overhauled or scrapped.</p> <p><strong>A Liberal Senate candidate has been revealed as the driving force behind a self-styled \u201cgrassroots\u201d campaign opposed to Labor\u2019s proposed changes to the franking credit system.</strong> The Defenders of Self Funded Retirees was set up last year and has taken out newspaper and Facebook ads and made submissions to parliament. But although it purports to be a \u201ccommunity group\u201d, one of the chief organiser\u2019s of its activities is Robert Gunning, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/07/liberal-candidate-helps-grassroots-campaign-against-labor-tax-policy\">a leading light in ACT Liberals</a>. The group\u2019s advertising material refers to Labor\u2019s \u201ctidal wave of taxes\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 7 February. Top stories Self-regulation by the pharmaceutical industry has led to less transparency, a report by Sydney University\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre has found. In 2015 changes were made to reporting requirements in the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s code of conduct. \u201cOnce a leader in transparency, Australia is now falling behind other countries,\u201d the study published in BMJ Open on Thursday concluded. \u201cThis study provides a clear example of the limitations of a self-regulatory system, which can be quietly changed in such a way as to reduce overall public reporting of industry funding in the healthcare sector. We recommend that countries insist on legislation rather than self-regulation to promote long-lasting public transparency around industry spending.\u201d More than 16,000 people on the contentious ParentsNext program received a payment suspension in the first six months of its operation, representing 21% of the 75,000 participants. The suspension rate for Indigenous parents \u2013 who are targeted for eligibility and make up 19% of participants \u2013 is higher at 27%. The suspensions are considered particularly concerning because all ParentsNext participants have children between six months and five years old and generally have no other source of income. The Australian Human Rights Commission claims that the program is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with Australia\u2019s human rights obligations and social services and legal groups have called for it to be overhauled or scrapped. A Liberal Senate candidate has been revealed as the driving force behind a self-styled \u201cgrassroots\u201d campaign opposed to Labor\u2019s proposed changes to the franking credit system. The Defenders of Self Funded Retirees was set up last year and has taken out newspaper and Facebook ads and made submissions to parliament. But although it purports to be a \u201ccommunity group\u201d, one of the chief organiser\u2019s of its activities is Robert Gunning, a leading light in ACT Liberals. The group\u2019s advertising material refers to Labor\u2019s \u201ctidal wave of taxes\u201d. One expert in electoral procedure said the close involvement of Liberal figures meant the group\u2019s ads were electoral material but as such could run into trouble because they failed to include the proper authorisation number. World The EU\u2019s frustration with Westminster erupted into the open as Donald Tusk warned of a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for politicians who promoted Brexit \u201cwithout even a sketch of a plan\u201d, just 24 hours before his crunch meeting with Theresa May in Brussels. The European council president insisted that the EU was not \u201cmaking any new offer\u201d to Britain, and demanded a \u201crealistic suggestion\u201d from the prime minister on how to end the impasse. Global warming could temporarily hit 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for the first time between now and 2023, according to a long-term forecast by the UK\u2019s Met Office. Until now, the hottest year on record was 2016, when the planet warmed 1.11C above pre-industrial levels. Venezuelan troops have barricaded a bridge on the country\u2019s border with Colombia in an apparent attempt to prevent the entry of humanitarian aid requested by opposition leaders trying to force Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power. The aid, sent by the US, is being viewed by the Maduro camp as a prelude to military intervention. The wife of Vladimir Putin\u2019s press spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has accumulated a property empire worth well over $14m, and is designing a riverside palace on an exclusive Moscow estate, with the project being overseen by a Russian tycoon who has previously done business with Donald Trump, the Guardian can reveal. The vast majority of the world\u2019s largest species are being pushed towards extinction, with the killing of the heftiest animals for meat and body parts the leading cause of decline, according to a new study.

But when Australian actors of colour become successful abroad, we don\u2019t seem to want to claim them. Debbie Zhou draws attention to the huge oveseas successes of Australians Chris Pang, James Wan and Geraldine Viswanathan \u2013 and questions why so many of us may not ever have heard of them. Amethyst DeWilde is back for a moving instalment in the Life on the breadline series, in which she writes about the restorative process of finding her voice again, after a decade of poverty stripped her of hope and confidence. \u201cPoverty silenced me,\u201d she writes, but now she has a belief \u201cthat I do contribute, I do matter and also that I do have something to say\u201d. Sport Perth Glory midfielder Neil Kilkenny talks to Guardian Australia about the impact coach Tony Popovic \u2013 and his perfectionist methods \u2013 has had as the club, now sitting atop the A-League, chasing a maiden title. \u201cHe\u2019s come in and demanded the most of us every day, to do things properly every day \u2013 not every second day or every third day \u2013 and if you demand the players to be at their best every day eventually it becomes natural to them; and that\u2019s how you create consistency\u201d Kilkenny says.

He strongly denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Scottish Labour called for the Holyrood inquiry and asked Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP and the first minister, to allow another party to lead it.</p> <p>Her spokesman insisted decisions on convening committees was a matter for parliament.</p> <p>On this occasion, under Holyrood\u2019s procedures, the SNP was due to chair the next committee to be established. Any party in that position is able to relinquish the convenorship if it wants to but on this occasion Sturgeon opted not to do so.</p> <p>The SNP has appointed four ex-ministers to the eight-strong committee \u2013 Linda Fabiani, Angela Constance, Maureen Watt and Alasdair Allan, all of whom served in government while Salmond was first minister.</p> <p>Graeme Dey, the Scottish government\u2019s parliament business minister, told the chamber that it would nominate Fabiani as the committee\u2019s convenor. Since Fabiani is currently a deputy presiding officer of the Scottish parliament, he said that should reassure MSPs that the inquiry would be conducted in a non-partisan way.</p> <p>Dey said the process for setting up the committee and appointing its convenor had been unanimously supported by all five parties. SNP sources said that included the Tories and Labour\u2019s business manager at Holyrood, Neil Findlay.</p> <p>In a brief debate on Wednesday before Holyrood voted by 92 to 19 in favour of establishing the committee, Findlay said the inquiry would also be investigating Sturgeon\u2019s actions and those of her close advisers.</p> <p>\u201cIt is essential for the standing of this parliament that we get this right,\u201d he said. \u201c[Can] this parliament be trusted to do things openly and transparently in the national interest? This is a big test for us all. It is vital that any committee is not compromised before its work begins and there is no perception of inbuilt bias.\u201d</p> <p>Annie Wells, for the Tories, who voted in favour of the committee along with the SNP, Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats, said they still wanted the SNP to voluntarily relinquish control of it.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a clear public interest in ensuring that this committee is both impartial and seen to be impartial,\u201d Wells told Dey. \u201cThere is no getting around it: that will be more difficult in these very particular circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Salmond launched a legal challenge to the government\u2019s processes in the civil courts last year after it emerged Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary of the Scottish government, had completed her investigation and passed a dossier to Police Scotland.</p> <p>In January, she admitted it had unlawfully allowed a senior civil servant who had had previous contact with two women who made allegations against Salmond to lead the internal investigation. That gave it the appearance of bias, Evans conceded.</p> <p>Salmond, who denies all the allegations, was arrested and charged in late January with 14 counts involving two of attempted rape, nine charges of sexual assault, two of indecent assault and one breach of the peace.</p> <p>The Holyrood inquiry is not expected to begin until after the court process is concluded.</p>",

All five Holyrood parties agreed to the inquiry after the Scottish government conceded in court last month it had seriously mishandled an internal investigation into allegations of sexual assault made against Salmond by two women. He strongly denies any wrongdoing. Scottish Labour called for the Holyrood inquiry and asked Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP and the first minister, to allow another party to lead it. Her spokesman insisted decisions on convening committees was a matter for parliament. On this occasion, under Holyrood\u2019s procedures, the SNP was due to chair the next committee to be established. Any party in that position is able to relinquish the convenorship if it wants to but on this occasion Sturgeon opted not to do so. The SNP has appointed four ex-ministers to the eight-strong committee \u2013 Linda Fabiani, Angela Constance, Maureen Watt and Alasdair Allan, all of whom served in government while Salmond was first minister. Graeme Dey, the Scottish government\u2019s parliament business minister, told the chamber that it would nominate Fabiani as the committee\u2019s convenor. Since Fabiani is currently a deputy presiding officer of the Scottish parliament, he said that should reassure MSPs that the inquiry would be conducted in a non-partisan way. Dey said the process for setting up the committee and appointing its convenor had been unanimously supported by all five parties. SNP sources said that included the Tories and Labour\u2019s business manager at Holyrood, Neil Findlay. In a brief debate on Wednesday before Holyrood voted by 92 to 19 in favour of establishing the committee, Findlay said the inquiry would also be investigating Sturgeon\u2019s actions and those of her close advisers. \u201cIt is essential for the standing of this parliament that we get this right,\u201d he said. \u201c[Can] this parliament be trusted to do things openly and transparently in the national interest? This is a big test for us all. It is vital that any committee is not compromised before its work begins and there is no perception of inbuilt bias.\u201d Annie Wells, for the Tories, who voted in favour of the committee along with the SNP, Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats, said they still wanted the SNP to voluntarily relinquish control of it. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear public interest in ensuring that this committee is both impartial and seen to be impartial,\u201d Wells told Dey. \u201cThere is no getting around it: that will be more difficult in these very particular circumstances.\u201d Salmond launched a legal challenge to the government\u2019s processes in the civil courts last year after it emerged Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary of the Scottish government, had completed her investigation and passed a dossier to Police Scotland. In January, she admitted it had unlawfully allowed a senior civil servant who had had previous contact with two women who made allegations against Salmond to lead the internal investigation. That gave it the appearance of bias, Evans conceded. Salmond, who denies all the allegations, was arrested and charged in late January with 14 counts involving two of attempted rape, nine charges of sexual assault, two of indecent assault and one breach of the peace. The Holyrood inquiry is not expected to begin until after the court process is concluded.",

Backbench Labour sources said the bill would probably be proposed before the next meaningful vote and could include strengthened protections for agency workers and a \u201cregression lock\u201d that would ensure workers\u2019 protections never slip below European standards. MPs who have met May over the past few months have made it clear they need guarantees to be made in primary legislation because they do not trust that she will remain in No 10 for much longer. Those who are in negotiations with the government have insisted the bill must be tabled and have had at least one day of second reading within the next few months. The Labour MP John Mann, one of the key figures behind the push for legislation, said: \u201cThere needs to be a bill produced soon.

A Downing Street source suggested it was not in the final stages of drafting the legislation and that May\u2019s agenda for next week was still very much dependent on a number of other factors. Trade unions are also understood to have been pushing for the legislation to include an easing of restrictions on union activity.

And so Unite\u2019s position is very, very closely aligned with the Labour party\u2019s position.\u201d McCluskey said had no plans to meet the prime minister again after meeting her in Downing Street a fortnight ago on a day when she saw several trade union leaders, and no plans to meet with the business secretary, Greg Clark, either. \u201cI\u2019m not negotiating with anybody,\u201d McCluskey said. Fifty Unite members signed a letter to the Guardian on Wednesday calling on their union leader to withdraw from any future talks that have been reported. \u201cAs members of Unite, we are deeply concerned by reports that our general secretary, Len McCluskey, is entering into direct negotiations with Theresa May over the Tory Brexit deal,\u201d stated the letter, which was coordinated by the leftwing pro-EU group Another Europe is Possible. \u201cIt appears that McCluskey is engaging in separate talks with the government in which he is putting forward a position which contradicts both the policy of the Labour party and Unite\u2019s own policy. This is absolutely wrong,\u201d the letter said. \u201cBy voting down the deal, MPs can create the conditions to bring down the government and force a general election, giving us the chance to get a government for the many. Backing the Tory deal, or abstaining on it, means keeping the Tories in power with their agenda of cuts, austerity and privatisation.\u201d A Unite spokesman said the letter was \u201cbased on a misconception\u201d and members should not believe everything they had read. \u201cLen McCluskey is not negotiating a Brexit deal with Theresa May. He has met the prime minister once, as have several other trade union leaders, when he took the opportunity to raise a number of concerns for working people, including the danger of a no-deal Brexit and the evident need for a customs union in order to preserve jobs,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe terms of Brexit can only be determined by MPs, and Unite fully supports Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s efforts to secure the best possible arrangements. Mr McCluskey continues to liaise with government ministers to ensure that jobs in manufacturing and elsewhere are safeguarded and makes no apologies for doing so.\u201d The prime minister met several union leaders since the defeat of her Brexit deal, including McCluskey, as well as the Unison leader, Dave Prentis, and Frances O\u2019Grady, who heads the TUC.",

A politician tired of diplomacy that kept going nowhere \u2013 \u2018What bit of backstop doesn\u2019t the UK get?\u2019 \u2013 and happy for once to speak his mind. \u201cThey\u2019ll give you a terrible time in the British press for that,\u201d whispered a delighted Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach. Tusk merely smiled. \u201cYes, I know. Hahaha.\u201d He no longer cared that much what anyone thought. He had tried to be nice to the Brits but all you got in return was news bulletins with Theresa May in a Spitfire and people comparing the EU\u2019s aims with Hitler. In any case, his question had been largely rhetorical. That special place in hell was only too familiar; it looks pretty much like where we are now.

I was about a third of the way into my new novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/19/the-wall-john-lanchester-review\" title=\"\">The Wall</a>, when I discovered that I was completely obsessed by intergenerational inequality. In particular, by the question of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/generational-inequality\" title=\"\">intergenerational inequality</a> linked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\" title=\"\">climate change</a>. Who knew? Certainly not me.</p> <p>Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with intergenerational inequality. At least, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the version of it that existed in the developed world for much of the 20th century. That kind of inequality was based on the idea that life should be gradually better, from one generation to another \u2013 more secure, more prosperous, healthier, longer. That means that children got a better deal than their parents, but that was fine; indeed, in this version of the social contract, that was the whole point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/17/millennials-pensions-student-loan-debt\">Save for our pensions? We millennials can barely find the money to live | Poppy Noor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This model for a relationship between the generations has broken down. There are numerous reasons for this, and some are side-effects of positive social trends. When the UK state pension was introduced in 1908, it kicked in at the age of 70; but only one in four people lived past that age. In other words, most people died before they were able to collect any state pension at all. Today, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/bulletins/nationallifetablesunitedkingdom/2015to2017\" title=\"\">life expectancy</a> at birth is 82.9 years for women, 79.2 for men. This is, it goes without saying, a hugely positive development, but it plays havoc with the actuarial mathematics. Our state pension system resembles a benign Ponzi scheme, in which people in work are paying for liabilities accrued by the generation older than them who have now retired.

      "bodyText": "One of the strange things that happens when you start work on a novel is that you realise what\u2019s been preoccupying you \u2013 sometimes without you knowing it. I was about a third of the way into my new novel, The Wall, when I discovered that I was completely obsessed by intergenerational inequality. In particular, by the question of intergenerational inequality linked to climate change. Who knew? Certainly not me. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with intergenerational inequality. At least, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the version of it that existed in the developed world for much of the 20th century. That kind of inequality was based on the idea that life should be gradually better, from one generation to another \u2013 more secure, more prosperous, healthier, longer. That means that children got a better deal than their parents, but that was fine; indeed, in this version of the social contract, that was the whole point. This model for a relationship between the generations has broken down. There are numerous reasons for this, and some are side-effects of positive social trends. When the UK state pension was introduced in 1908, it kicked in at the age of 70; but only one in four people lived past that age. In other words, most people died before they were able to collect any state pension at all. Today, life expectancy at birth is 82.9 years for women, 79.2 for men. This is, it goes without saying, a hugely positive development, but it plays havoc with the actuarial mathematics. Our state pension system resembles a benign Ponzi scheme, in which people in work are paying for liabilities accrued by the generation older than them who have now retired. When the retired generation is bigger than the working generation, there are obvious problems with making the sums work. You end up with different versions of the welfare state being experienced by different generations.

The European council president triggered a tsunami of confected outrage from leavers today when he observed, with some justice, that there should be a special place in hell for those who promoted Brexit without a plan.

He should have added that, within that special place, there should be an executive suite of sleepless torment for those politicians who promoted Brexit without ever giving a stuff about Ireland.

Also, \u201cBrahms was a two-penny harlot\u201d, \u201cMozart was a black Irish washerwoman\u201d, and \u201cChopin had dishpan hands\u201d. The provocative slogans are from postcards self-published in the 1970s that were designed to be both funny and a comment on the outsider status of women in the music industry. They are among 300 works going on display from Thursday in the first exhibition of postcard art to be held in a major UK museum. The postcards are a gift to the British Museum from the writer Jeremy Cooper, who started collecting them properly in 2008 after an illness because he wanted to reconnect with art without spending huge sums of money. \u201cI loathed what the art world stood for, all the money and things,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked postcards \u2026 and I had always bought postcards to send. So I started buying postcard art, and the more you look the more you find these wonderful things.\u201d Through dealers and eBay, Cooper has steadily built a vast collection of more than 8,000 works examples, a reflection of the surprising number of artists who have engaged with the medium since the 1960s. They include renowned artists such as Gilbert &amp; George, Susan Hiller, Yoko Ono and Rachel Whiteread. One postcard in the show, from 1993, is a photograph of the YBAs (Young British Artists) Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas cheerfully carrying melons under their arms, a nod to the British saucy seaside postcard tradition. Some of the cards were made as exhibition invitations, such as an anti-Vietnam war green, blag and orange flag card inviting a guest to a Jasper Johns show in 1969.

      "bodyText": "America\u2019s longest-running war is edging closer toward a conceivable end. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Donald Trump acknowledged that talks with the Taliban might not succeed, but that \u201cthe hour has come to at least try for peace\u201d in Afghanistan, noting his country\u2019s casualties. He did not mention the Afghans who have died (24,000 civilians since 2009, and 45,000 members of the security forces in the last five years), let alone the nation\u2019s broader suffering in the world\u2019s deadliest conflict. Around half of Afghanistan\u2019s population was not born when this war began, in 2001. Their elders have lived with conflict for most of the last four decades, since the Soviet invasion. A country so fissured is united in its longing for peace as last year\u2019s brief ceasefire, in which civilians, militants and soldiers celebrated together, showed. A US-Taliban agreement would be one step along that road. Yet Afghans ask at what cost a deal may come, conscious that those likely to pay the most are not negotiating the bill. Only two women are present at the talks between Taliban representatives and Afghan politicians, warlords and other powerbrokers in Moscow. These follow last month\u2019s talks between US and Taliban negotiators in Qatar, which reached a draft framework under which the US would withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that the country would not harbour terrorists. The considerable obstacles that remain include, most obviously, the Taliban\u2019s refusal to speak to the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, and his government. Hope for peace coexists with the fear that the US will leave as carelessly as it boosted intervention in 2017, when civilian deaths surged due to increased air strikes. The Trump administration\u2019s lack of interest in human rights, and the president\u2019s record of contempt for women\u2019s rights, increases those anxieties. Women \u2013 and many men too \u2013 are frightened about the possible terms of an agreement and very aware that they would essentially be unenforceable once US troops were out of the country. They are rightly frightened that it could dismantle the gains they have made, which fall far short of what is needed \u2013 patriarchal values and misogyny are hardly unique to the Taliban \u2013 but are nonetheless real, substantive and precious. The Taliban\u2019s statement in Moscow is clearly meant to dispel the memories of women being beaten and murdered under its brutal theocratic rule, as well as forced into burqas and barred from leaving their homes without a male relative as escort.

Despite Taliban pledges that they allow women\u2019s education, schooling for girls generally stops around puberty in Taliban-controlled areas. Research has suggested that peace agreements are more likely to be reached and implemented when women have a strong role in forging them, including \u2013 but not only \u2013 at the negotiating table. \u201cAny peace that threatens women\u2019s rights, freedoms and gains will not be sustainable,\u201d a group of Afghan women warn in a statement this week.

      "bodyText": "Texas Democrat and rising political star Beto O\u2019Rourke was greeted by climate change protesters in New York on Tuesday at an event where he said he would announce a decision about a 2020 presidential run by the end of the month. Demonstrators blasted the former congressman for breaking a pledge not to accept campaign funds from donors in the fossil fuel industry, and pushed him to throw his weight behind the Green New Deal. \u201cIt\u2019s a very corrosive influence. You can\u2019t be taking money from the people you\u2019re supposed to legislate against and regulate,\u201d said Gustavo Gordillo, 31, a member of the group Democratic Socialists of America, from Manhattan. He joined a group of protesters outside the PlayStation theater, near Times Square in the heart of the city, where O\u2019Rourke was being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey for a taping to be broadcast later in the month on Winfrey\u2019s OWN Network. \u201cWe want to make sure that we can count on him to propose an aggressive, comprehensive plan,\u201d Gordillo said, about action to protect the environment. Organizers said they plan to target other potential Democratic presidential candidates to press them to get behind an aggressive climate plan. But O\u2019Rourke, who narrowly lost an election against the Republican Texas senator Ted Cruz last year but gained a national following in the process, has sparked a backlash among a small but vocal group of progressive, young, grassroots activists who believe he is not liberal enough. O\u2019Rourke was removed from a list of signers of pressure group Oil Change USA\u2019s pledge not to accept fossil fuel money after the news site Sludge reported that he received $430,000 from individuals working in the oil and gas industry. His spokesman has told the Huffington Post he is \u201csupportive of the concept\u201d of a Green New Deal, the economic stimulus program being promoted by progressives to address jointly economic inequality and climate change. \u201cJust like campaigns shouldn\u2019t take tobacco industry money or corporate Pac [political action committee] money, we don\u2019t think that they should take fossil fuel industry money,\u201d said Pete Sikora, of advocacy group New York Communities for Change. \u201cWe want to make sure that candidates are accountable to the people and not to big corporate interests.\u201d In his interview with Winfrey at a taping of her program Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations, O\u2019Rourke gave himself a deadline of the end of February to decide on a presidential run, saying he wanted to help unify the country and make sure it lives up to its promise. \u201cIf I can play some role in helping the country to do that, by God I\u2019m going to do it,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. Winfrey has considered running for the White House herself. She pushed O\u2019Rourke for a deadline and he said: \u201cThe serious answer is really soon. Before the end of the month.\u201d O\u2019Rourke has kept a low profile in recent weeks.But he said on Tuesday: \u201cThere was something that was new and maybe even dangerous or different about the way we ran this campaign.\u201d He recalled a meeting with Barack Obama, where he said Obama did not encourage him to run but they did discuss the possibility, in the context of the previous president\u2019s own candidacy. \u201cHe was very generous in sharing what his thought process was leading up to that decision,\u201d he said. O\u2019Rourke had fans in the crowd, including Olga Espinal from Queens. \u201cI was really excited about him during the campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s compassionate, he\u2019s different. I like his approach to immigration.\u201d",

The empty units in our malls are the result of a structural change in how all of us shop. Poor people lost their shops a generation or more ago.<br><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Tony Breslin</strong><br><em>Bushey, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris notes that we will not be able to return to an era before online retail. We agree \u2013 and shoppers tell us they enjoy the convenience and value of buying online. Where we disagree is the notion that online has to be the enemy of the town centre. Our two organisations have come together in Wolverhampton in an innovative partnership that tells the opposite story.</p> <p>Sixty-four small retailers \u2013 half of which are bricks-and-mortar stores \u2013 are working with us to make the most of selling online. In just three months these businesses increased sales by over 40%, passing \u00a31m in sales. Shoppers increasingly want the value and convenience of online, alongside a physical experience that enables them to try before they buy and to shop local. Local businesses benefit from a shop window to millions of consumers worldwide using online platforms like eBay that don\u2019t undercut sellers.</p> <p>As we are demonstrating in the West Midlands, online plays a key role in the high street fightback.<br><strong>Rob Hattrell</strong><br><em>Vice-president, eBay UK</em><br><strong>Councillor Roger Lawrence</strong><br><em>City of Wolverhampton council leader</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is right to point to the decline of high streets across the UK, with increasing numbers of boarded up shops. It can eat away at any efforts to have a cohesive community when people no longer share the same space. The pub is also part of that, and certainly closures are continuing here too. Licensed premises can provide a centre for public meeting and discussion and, because they stay open at night, stop high streets from becoming deserted after 5pm.</p> <p>It has not all been bad news, though. Legislation in England allowing pubs to be declared assets of community value has allowed campaigners to stop some being turned into flats. Meanwhile, empty shops are being turned into thriving pubs. The decline of a community-focused high street is not inevitable even when big capital walks away.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br><em>Tottenham, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Thank you, John Harris, for your thought-provoking article. Perhaps we should consider that the high street is a passing phase in history, a 20th-century phenomenon? The modern high street evolved in the 19th century from temporary then more permanent markets set up within a living community. The markets evolved into permanent shops and, in doing so, displaced the very lifeblood of the living community. Then we had the adverse effect of cars bringing out-of-town supermarkets and the huge additional cost of parking near the high street. Now we have the internet killing off the remaining high street shops but leaving no living kernel in their place because of housing regulations and excessive rent and parking charges from councils.</p> <p>I believe the 20th-century high street may be essentially dead and what is needed is further evolution so that these empty shops are converted back to living accommodation. We may have fewer shops, but they will again be within walking distance. <br><strong>Andrew Webb</strong><br><em>Burwell, Cambridgeshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is on the money with his analysis of the decline of the high street and the national malaise. But he doesn\u2019t go far enough in the matter of complicity. The people who howl at the hollowing out of their town centres are the same ones who increasingly shop online, shoring up the profits of tax-evading multinationals. The people who bemoan the effects of austerity (which has driven them online to get more for less) are the same ones who have meekly accepted and endured the myths of the austerity narrative ruthlessly exploited by the Tories in the wake of the financial crash. Why no public unrest or the election of a radical leftwing government in 2010, 2015 or 2017 if that wasn\u2019t the case?</p> <p>The people who feel left behind by economic uncertainty are the ones who chose to remedy that by voting for a Brexit which will leave them ever more isolated, abandoned and disenfranchised in the face of global challenges. Unless you critically engage with what is happening to you and how you can best channel the means available to you to alter the outcome \u2013 be that through your purchasing power or your vote \u2013 you can expect more of the same. All of which can only result in relentless, bewildering and disorientating change. <br><strong>Colin Montgomery</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 Our towns could have their souls back with the use of a little imagination and lateral thinking. Shops are closing as retail moves online. Another great change taking place is the huge participation in adult education. In my borough of Richmond upon Thames, the University of the Third Age is offering a vast prospectus of adult education. Why can\u2019t empty shops be rented by the borough authority so that these activities can be pursued in central locations? People have much more leisure and are pursuing arts and crafts. Empty shops could be turned into workplaces and display areas for these sorts of activities. <br><strong>Jim McCluskey</strong><br><em>Twickenham, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 If, by soul, we mean guiding principle, then it is easy to see why town centres have died. All sections of the media preach one gospel \u2013 the lowest price is best. Thus we find people who can afford three or more holidays a year stating that they \u201chave to\u201d buy online and operate other mechanisms to feel morally superior, such as searching for a bargain. It is evident that town centres cannot compete, and that the answer to the problem is simple: \u201cUse it or lose it.\u201d<br><strong>Sylvia Duffy</strong><br><em>Ludlow, Shropshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here to upload it</em></strong></a><strong><em> and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

Dr Tony Breslin Bushey, Hertfordshire \u2022 John Harris notes that we will not be able to return to an era before online retail. We agree \u2013 and shoppers tell us they enjoy the convenience and value of buying online. Where we disagree is the notion that online has to be the enemy of the town centre. Our two organisations have come together in Wolverhampton in an innovative partnership that tells the opposite story. Sixty-four small retailers \u2013 half of which are bricks-and-mortar stores \u2013 are working with us to make the most of selling online. In just three months these businesses increased sales by over 40%, passing \u00a31m in sales. Shoppers increasingly want the value and convenience of online, alongside a physical experience that enables them to try before they buy and to shop local. Local businesses benefit from a shop window to millions of consumers worldwide using online platforms like eBay that don\u2019t undercut sellers. As we are demonstrating in the West Midlands, online plays a key role in the high street fightback. Rob Hattrell Vice-president, eBay UK Councillor Roger Lawrence City of Wolverhampton council leader \u2022 John Harris is right to point to the decline of high streets across the UK, with increasing numbers of boarded up shops. It can eat away at any efforts to have a cohesive community when people no longer share the same space. The pub is also part of that, and certainly closures are continuing here too. Licensed premises can provide a centre for public meeting and discussion and, because they stay open at night, stop high streets from becoming deserted after 5pm. It has not all been bad news, though. Legislation in England allowing pubs to be declared assets of community value has allowed campaigners to stop some being turned into flats. Meanwhile, empty shops are being turned into thriving pubs. The decline of a community-focused high street is not inevitable even when big capital walks away. Keith Flett Tottenham, London \u2022 Thank you, John Harris, for your thought-provoking article. Perhaps we should consider that the high street is a passing phase in history, a 20th-century phenomenon? The modern high street evolved in the 19th century from temporary then more permanent markets set up within a living community. The markets evolved into permanent shops and, in doing so, displaced the very lifeblood of the living community. Then we had the adverse effect of cars bringing out-of-town supermarkets and the huge additional cost of parking near the high street. Now we have the internet killing off the remaining high street shops but leaving no living kernel in their place because of housing regulations and excessive rent and parking charges from councils. I believe the 20th-century high street may be essentially dead and what is needed is further evolution so that these empty shops are converted back to living accommodation. We may have fewer shops, but they will again be within walking distance. Andrew Webb Burwell, Cambridgeshire \u2022 John Harris is on the money with his analysis of the decline of the high street and the national malaise. But he doesn\u2019t go far enough in the matter of complicity. The people who howl at the hollowing out of their town centres are the same ones who increasingly shop online, shoring up the profits of tax-evading multinationals. The people who bemoan the effects of austerity (which has driven them online to get more for less) are the same ones who have meekly accepted and endured the myths of the austerity narrative ruthlessly exploited by the Tories in the wake of the financial crash. Why no public unrest or the election of a radical leftwing government in 2010, 2015 or 2017 if that wasn\u2019t the case? The people who feel left behind by economic uncertainty are the ones who chose to remedy that by voting for a Brexit which will leave them ever more isolated, abandoned and disenfranchised in the face of global challenges. Unless you critically engage with what is happening to you and how you can best channel the means available to you to alter the outcome \u2013 be that through your purchasing power or your vote \u2013 you can expect more of the same. All of which can only result in relentless, bewildering and disorientating change. Colin Montgomery Edinburgh \u2022 Our towns could have their souls back with the use of a little imagination and lateral thinking. Shops are closing as retail moves online. Another great change taking place is the huge participation in adult education. In my borough of Richmond upon Thames, the University of the Third Age is offering a vast prospectus of adult education. Why can\u2019t empty shops be rented by the borough authority so that these activities can be pursued in central locations? People have much more leisure and are pursuing arts and crafts. Empty shops could be turned into workplaces and display areas for these sorts of activities. Jim McCluskey Twickenham, London \u2022 If, by soul, we mean guiding principle, then it is easy to see why town centres have died. All sections of the media preach one gospel \u2013 the lowest price is best. Thus we find people who can afford three or more holidays a year stating that they \u201chave to\u201d buy online and operate other mechanisms to feel morally superior, such as searching for a bargain. It is evident that town centres cannot compete, and that the answer to the problem is simple: \u201cUse it or lose it.\u201d Sylvia Duffy Ludlow, Shropshire \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com \u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters \u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

The outcome of the Brexit process will affect the lives of all of us for decades to come. Workers face the prospect of lost rights, lost jobs and lost prosperity.</p> <p>The Labour party, to which Unite is affiliated, has a clear policy to vote against any deal which does not meet its six tests or which puts the Good Friday agreement in doubt. Unite policy conference established a similar set of red lines in July. It appears that McCluskey is engaging in separate talks with the government in which he is putting forward a position which contradicts both the policy of the Labour party and Unite\u2019s own policy.

      "bodyText": "As members of Unite, we are deeply concerned by reports that our general secretary, Len McCluskey, is entering into direct negotiations with Theresa May over the Tory Brexit deal. The outcome of the Brexit process will affect the lives of all of us for decades to come. Workers face the prospect of lost rights, lost jobs and lost prosperity. The Labour party, to which Unite is affiliated, has a clear policy to vote against any deal which does not meet its six tests or which puts the Good Friday agreement in doubt. Unite policy conference established a similar set of red lines in July. It appears that McCluskey is engaging in separate talks with the government in which he is putting forward a position which contradicts both the policy of the Labour party and Unite\u2019s own policy. This is absolutely wrong. By voting down the deal, MPs can create the conditions to bring down the government and force a general election, giving us the chance to get a government for the many. Backing the Tory deal, or abstaining on it, means keeping the Tories in power with their agenda of cuts, austerity and privatisation. Unite must stand up for the jobs and rights of its members.

      "body": "<p>Ivanka Trump doing the Hoovering is not a sight one sees every day. However, if you happen to be in Washington DC this month, you can watch a lookalike of the first daughter cleaning, in stilettos, for two hours every night at the Flashpoint gallery.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.culturaldc.org/ivanka-vacuuming\" title=\"\">Ivanka Vacuuming</a>, a new performance art piece by Jennifer Rubell, invites visitors to \u201cthrow crumbs on to the carpet, watching as Ivanka elegantly vacuums up the mess, her smile never wavering\u201d.</p> <p>It seems likely a few smiles wavered inside the White House when the Trump family learned about Rubell\u2019s work. On Tuesday morning, Ivanka <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1092803194428801024\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> a link to an article about the performance piece and said: \u201cWomen can choose to knock each other down or build each other up. I choose the latter.\u201d Donald Trump Jr, meanwhile, chose to respond to Ivanka Vacuming with more acerbic language. \u201cSad, but not surprising to watch self professed \u2018feminists\u2019 launching sexist attacks against <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump\" title=\"\">@IvankaTrump</a>,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIn their crazed world, sexism is OK if hurts their political enemies [sic].\u201d</p> <p>While Ivanka may have tried to take the high ground in relation to the artwork, the fact she chose to respond publicly suggests it hit a nerve. Ivanka is far more restrained than her father and brothers when it comes to social media, and does not normally react to every provocation. She could have let the artwork fade from the news cycle; instead she chose to amplify it. Why?</p> <p>While the inner workings of Ivanka\u2019s mind are an eternal mystery, one imagines Rubell\u2019s performance piece may have touched upon a particular sore spot with Ivanka: her carefully cultivated relationship with the art world. Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, are avid art collectors. Admittedly they sometimes forget this: Kushner <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-art-970010#.WSbaY8BOu9E.twitter\" title=\"\">failed to mention</a> their multimillion dollar collection in required financial disclosures, despite Ivanka regularly posting pictures of their haul on Instagram. Lawyers defended this omission by stating that the couple\u2019s art collection is purely \u201cfor decorative purposes\u201d, rather than an investment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/1G0Cn7ikPp/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Ivanka Trump doing the Hoovering is not a sight one sees every day. However, if you happen to be in Washington DC this month, you can watch a lookalike of the first daughter cleaning, in stilettos, for two hours every night at the Flashpoint gallery. Ivanka Vacuuming, a new performance art piece by Jennifer Rubell, invites visitors to \u201cthrow crumbs on to the carpet, watching as Ivanka elegantly vacuums up the mess, her smile never wavering\u201d. It seems likely a few smiles wavered inside the White House when the Trump family learned about Rubell\u2019s work. On Tuesday morning, Ivanka tweeted a link to an article about the performance piece and said: \u201cWomen can choose to knock each other down or build each other up. I choose the latter.\u201d Donald Trump Jr, meanwhile, chose to respond to Ivanka Vacuming with more acerbic language. \u201cSad, but not surprising to watch self professed \u2018feminists\u2019 launching sexist attacks against @IvankaTrump,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIn their crazed world, sexism is OK if hurts their political enemies [sic].\u201d While Ivanka may have tried to take the high ground in relation to the artwork, the fact she chose to respond publicly suggests it hit a nerve. Ivanka is far more restrained than her father and brothers when it comes to social media, and does not normally react to every provocation. She could have let the artwork fade from the news cycle; instead she chose to amplify it. Why? While the inner workings of Ivanka\u2019s mind are an eternal mystery, one imagines Rubell\u2019s performance piece may have touched upon a particular sore spot with Ivanka: her carefully cultivated relationship with the art world. Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, are avid art collectors. Admittedly they sometimes forget this: Kushner failed to mention their multimillion dollar collection in required financial disclosures, despite Ivanka regularly posting pictures of their haul on Instagram. Lawyers defended this omission by stating that the couple\u2019s art collection is purely \u201cfor decorative purposes\u201d, rather than an investment. As well as adorning the Trump-Kushner apartment, the art collection has played a large part in embellishing Ivanka\u2019s personal image. Art dealer Bill Powers, who sold Ivanka a piece by artist Louis Eisner, told Bloomberg in 2016 that Ivanka\u2019s art collection had \u201cbecome a form of branding\u201d and aside from sharing her acquisitions on social media, she is often vocal about art and her preferred artists in interviews.

      "body": "<p>England\u2019s Test players may be feeling a bit miserable after two wretched defeats, despite the waves lapping at their breakfast tables in St Lucia, but what about those not in the Test team? They are spared the agony of a very public humiliation but they must also live with the reality that the team are playing hopelessly and still they cannot get a game.</p> <p>This can be a source of frustration and despair for the conscientious cricketer and they don\u2019t come much more conscientious than Jack Leach. He may be a special case. His opportunities at this level are not simply dependent on form, they are dictated by long, anguished perusals of the pitch by the wise men to establish whether two spinners are required (in fact that was the case in Barbados but they opted to pick Adil Rashid rather than Leach, a decision that was hardly vindicated by what happened in the match and one which is unlikely to be repeated).</p> <p>Leach is conditioned to the topsy-turvy nature of a cricketer\u2019s career. He has already endured setbacks, standard ones like breaking a thumb just before the Pakistan series last summer, unusual ones like having the legality of a seemingly flawless action queried. Then the came the series in Sri Lanka where he took 18 wickets in three matches, a significant contribution to England\u2019s 3-0 victory, which now seems something of a mirage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/05/joe-denly-ashes-spot-england-pride-west-indies\">Joe Denly out to stake Ashes claim by helping England salvage Test pride</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m four Tests into my career and it\u2019s been two extremes,\u201d Leach says. \u201cThat\u2019s been interesting to experience, the highs and lows and how more experienced players go about dealing with that. It\u2019s about dusting yourself down to go again.\u201d</p> <p>Leach has been doing his duty on this tour, though not in jobs that he would wish. The non-players have to scurry out on the field to deliver drinks \u2013 10 times more frequently than in days of old, when your correspondent became adept at offering refreshment to English fielders in sweltering heat on another continent.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s Test players may be feeling a bit miserable after two wretched defeats, despite the waves lapping at their breakfast tables in St Lucia, but what about those not in the Test team? They are spared the agony of a very public humiliation but they must also live with the reality that the team are playing hopelessly and still they cannot get a game. This can be a source of frustration and despair for the conscientious cricketer and they don\u2019t come much more conscientious than Jack Leach. He may be a special case. His opportunities at this level are not simply dependent on form, they are dictated by long, anguished perusals of the pitch by the wise men to establish whether two spinners are required (in fact that was the case in Barbados but they opted to pick Adil Rashid rather than Leach, a decision that was hardly vindicated by what happened in the match and one which is unlikely to be repeated). Leach is conditioned to the topsy-turvy nature of a cricketer\u2019s career. He has already endured setbacks, standard ones like breaking a thumb just before the Pakistan series last summer, unusual ones like having the legality of a seemingly flawless action queried. Then the came the series in Sri Lanka where he took 18 wickets in three matches, a significant contribution to England\u2019s 3-0 victory, which now seems something of a mirage. \u201cI\u2019m four Tests into my career and it\u2019s been two extremes,\u201d Leach says. \u201cThat\u2019s been interesting to experience, the highs and lows and how more experienced players go about dealing with that. It\u2019s about dusting yourself down to go again.\u201d Leach has been doing his duty on this tour, though not in jobs that he would wish. The non-players have to scurry out on the field to deliver drinks \u2013 10 times more frequently than in days of old, when your correspondent became adept at offering refreshment to English fielders in sweltering heat on another continent. Then there is the tricky task of encouraging those actually engaged in the match. It is hard to find the right phrase when offering a drink in the dressing room to a distraught batsman who has just missed a straight one. \u201cBad luck\u201d does not quite cut it nor does \u201cit must have nipped back\u201d. Leach understands the notion of the squad system that Joe Root often talks about, since this is especially relevant to him. \u201cI have found I\u2019ve been down after defeats even though I\u2019m not playing and that\u2019s a real positive thing,\u201d he says. Believe it or not there has been the odd cricketer who revels in a side\u2019s defeat after he has been omitted. \u201cWith my role I have to be patient.

But even many of them rang hollow. He talked about the bravery of American soldiers, yet has worked to weaken the US military by <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-us-general-says-trump-didnt-consult-him-on-syria-pullout/\">undermining</a> the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/rough-going-those-picked-trump-be-my-generals-n945836\">generals</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/us/politics/soldiers-widow-says-trump-struggled-to-remember-sgt-la-david-johnsons-name.html\">disrespecting</a> fallen troops, and removing from the armed forces <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-army-discharge-immigrant-recruits-citizenship-trump-administration-a8434166.html\">immigrants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46963426\">transgender</a> Americans who were willing to do something he, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html\">five deferments</a> including a fake bone spur, refused to do \u2013 fight and die for democracy.</p> \n<p>He honored survivors of the Holocaust and the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue while condemning fascism. But that is uneasily juxtaposed to his support of the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/\">Nazis in Charlottesville</a>, his continued employment of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/05/stephen-miller-trump-adviser/561317/\">Stephen Miller</a> in his regime, and Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/trump-white-nationalism/568393/\">racist pronouncements</a>, which have unleashed a rise in anti-Semitism and <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/FBI-Hate-crimes-in-U-S-CA-surge-in-first-year-13389522.php\">hate crimes</a> in America.</p> \n<p>He talked about how the United States was the greatest nation on earth as the Republicans chanted \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d, yet Trump demanded that the investigations into his foreign connections come to an abrupt halt even while the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17031772/mueller-indictments-grand-jury\">indictments and guilty pleas</a> delivered by the Mueller investigations against Trump campaign officials mount.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>He failed to mention that wage stagnation is so profound that most Americans have the same buying power they had 40 years ago</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>He said he wanted unity, but for the first two years of his rule, when disaster hit, he didn\u2019t respond like the president of the United States. Instead, he would only authorize adequate federal relief to areas like Texas and Florida, that voted for him, and ordered that others, like badly scorched <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/09/trump-threatens-cut-off-fema-aid-california-forest-fires/?utm_term=.d4cd79d17776\">California</a> and hurricane-whipped <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-puerto-rico-received-slower-less-generous-federal-disaster-aid-than-texas-florida/\">Puerto Rico</a>, fend for themselves.</p> \n<p>In fact, for the past two years, his actions have spoken so much louder than his anemic attempt at conciliatory words.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s why Stacey Abrams\u2019s state of the union response resonated. She spoke of an American value system that would not abandon people. Not the homeless. Not the LGBTQ community. Not children and families desperately in search of quality education. Not women, especially black women, who are currently dying at disproportionate rates in childbirth. Not workers who are living paycheck to paycheck.

      "bodyText": "What could he say? After a disastrous 35-day shutdown of the federal government that put America\u2019s national security, air travel, and food supply at risk and jeopardized the financial stability of hundreds of thousands of federal employees and government contractors. What was left to say? And, after yet another indictment of someone close to the Trump campaign for obstructing justice, what on earth was Donald Trump going to say about the State of the Union? Well, he lied. But that\u2019s not unusual. He told of a strong economy, without accurately describing the ticking time bomb he and congressional Republicans set off with a $1.5tn tax cut for the uber wealthy and corporations that blew a hole in the nation\u2019s finances, exploded the deficit, and brought little to none of the promised benefits to middle and working class Americans. He misrepresented his tariff wars that were supposed to be \u201ceasy to win\u201d but which have actually backfired and dried up $12bn of soybean sales, forced Harley Davidson and other companies to either close up shop or move some production out of the US, and helped fuel massive layoffs at GM plants in Ohio and Michigan. He bragged about low unemployment rates and how more people are working than ever before; he just failed to mention that wage stagnation is so profound that most Americans have the same buying power that they had 40 years ago. He hammered on about hordes of immigrants in caravans from Central America threatening to launch an ongoing spree of murder, sex trafficking, and drug running throughout the United States. Trump just conveniently went silent on all of the data about the low crime rate and enormous contribution that immigrants make to American society and the economy. Interestingly, while he insisted that his concern about \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants was to protect America\u2019s workers, his businesses only recently fired a number of undocumented immigrants who had been on his company\u2019s payroll for years. And, he touted his energy policies as if being number one in fossil fuel exports is really something to brag about while the Arctic is melting. In between the lies he had moments. But even many of them rang hollow. He talked about the bravery of American soldiers, yet has worked to weaken the US military by undermining the generals, disrespecting fallen troops, and removing from the armed forces immigrants and transgender Americans who were willing to do something he, with five deferments including a fake bone spur, refused to do \u2013 fight and die for democracy. He honored survivors of the Holocaust and the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue while condemning fascism. But that is uneasily juxtaposed to his support of the Nazis in Charlottesville, his continued employment of Stephen Miller in his regime, and Trump\u2019s racist pronouncements, which have unleashed a rise in anti-Semitism and hate crimes in America. He talked about how the United States was the greatest nation on earth as the Republicans chanted \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d, yet Trump demanded that the investigations into his foreign connections come to an abrupt halt even while the indictments and guilty pleas delivered by the Mueller investigations against Trump campaign officials mount. He said he wanted unity, but for the first two years of his rule, when disaster hit, he didn\u2019t respond like the president of the United States. Instead, he would only authorize adequate federal relief to areas like Texas and Florida, that voted for him, and ordered that others, like badly scorched California and hurricane-whipped Puerto Rico, fend for themselves. In fact, for the past two years, his actions have spoken so much louder than his anemic attempt at conciliatory words. That\u2019s why Stacey Abrams\u2019s state of the union response resonated. She spoke of an American value system that would not abandon people. Not the homeless. Not the LGBTQ community. Not children and families desperately in search of quality education. Not women, especially black women, who are currently dying at disproportionate rates in childbirth. Not workers who are living paycheck to paycheck. And not the ill who are forced to ration life-saving medicine. That value system, Abrams made clear, is tied to public policy and cannot survive without the \u201cbedrock\u201d right to vote, which has been under a full assault since 2013 when the US supreme court, in the Shelby County v Holder decision, gutted the Voting Rights Act. Abrams was the key person to deliver that message because she experienced that reality firsthand. When she ran for governor, she faced an opponent, Brian Kemp, who hung on as secretary of state and controlled Georgia\u2019s electoral process and machinery until he certified his own win as governor. To get there, he had purged 1.4 million registered voters from the rolls including more than 10% in the run-up to the election. After Shelby, hundreds of polling places closed (most in minority and poor communities) and those removals in ten counties were orchestrated by a \u201cconsultant\u201d who had direct ties to him. Kemp, using a program virtually similar to the one the court had ruled as racially discriminatory, embargoed 53,000 voter registration applications (nearly 80% of which were from minorities). He failed to provide guidance to county election officials so there would be uniformity in handling absentee ballots; as a result, the discard rate varied widely from county to county and African Americans\u2019 votes were disproportionately trashed. As secretary of state, he knew that, in part, because of lawsuits from previous elections, more than 1,000 voting machines were unavailable for the midterm. But he sat on millions of dollars in federal funds and did not buy any replacement equipment to handle the predicted heavy turnout for November 2018. Instead, multiple precincts in metropolitan Atlanta, an area with at least 2 million registered voters, and in some counties a majority black population, experienced up to four-hour wait times as an inadequate number of machines were on hand, they malfunctioned, didn\u2019t have power cords, or batteries simply ran down. Given this experience, Abrams explained: \u201cvoter suppression is real\u201d as is its threat to democracy. What isn\u2019t, however, are the tales spread by Trump and others in the Republican party of massive, rampant voter fraud, which none of them have been able to prove or document either in a court of law or through a presidential commission, but these lies, nonetheless, serve as the basis to exclude American citizens \u2013 often minorities, the poor, and young adults \u2013 from the electorate. If Trump truly wants \u201cunity,\u201d if he truly wants America to be great in the 21st century, Abrams ably handed out the prescription. He needs to \u201ctell the truth.\u201d He needs to \u201crespect his duties and the incredible diversity that defines America\u201d. Yet, given how he consistently lied to the American people in the State of the Union address and what he lied about, that\u2019s medicine that he will not take.

      "body": "<p>Dear Mrs May,</p> <p>I write to you at a time of grave national crisis, beholden to no party, a representative of no special interest and in nobody\u2019s pocket. I am, however, a concerned citizen, a mother and an employer and I am hopeful that, in view of the deadlock in our politics just weeks before we are due to leave the European Union on 29 March, you will have the intellectual and moral honesty to consider a commonsense and pragmatic proposal.</p> <p>Let us start off by agreeing that none of us, no matter how we voted in the EU referendum, could ever have imagined we would be in the dreadful position we are today. A position in which, in barely 50 days\u2019 time, you and your government concede that the UK might be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/30/food-prices-to-finance-what-a-no-deal-brexit-could-mean-for-britain\" title=\"\">under martial law</a>, experiencing shortages of foods and essential drugs, a sharp economic downturn leading to job losses, and our national security and public services drastically compromised.</p> <p>I, like many others, accept that you faced an impossible job in trying to turn fantasy promises into practical realities. This has been compounded by the various factions tearing your party apart, with certain individuals ruthlessly pursuing their own ambitions and agendas. Is it therefore not time to level with the people of the United Kingdom? After all, you promised in the speech that you made when you first became prime minister that when you made the big calls, you\u2019d think not of the powerful and the mighty but ordinary people \u2013 such as the young and those starting out in their lives.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/poll-shows-huge-generation-gap-over-attitudes-to-brexit-1-5878721\" title=\"\">A poll</a> that my organisation, <a href=\"http://www.leadnotleave.com/\" title=\"\">Lead Not Leave</a>, has just commissioned shows the depth of concern among young people about a no-deal Brexit. They will have to live with the consequences of decisions that are about to be taken, and which they can see only too clearly will have an adverse impact on them for the rest of their lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All member states are striving for new direction and relevance as a wave of populism sweeps across the continent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I would suggest that, far from addressing the very real concerns of large numbers of voters in the referendum \u2013 the inequalities in our society, the underfunding of public services, trust in politicians, care for our old and sick \u2013 all of the Brexit options now facing us will be a disaster for the whole UK. None of them can be said to make \u201ca success\u201d of Brexit.</p> <p>I do not doubt that you believe you are attempting to carry out the instructions of a majority of voters in the referendum. You no doubt hope your deal will satisfy all sides within your own party and indeed our European partners. But a deal that can somehow square the circle now looks impossible. Surely you must now accept that you can never bring the Conservative party together when you are dealing with a mixture of fantasists, egotists and rightwing ideologues?</p> <p>That is why I urge you to accept that your deal is not the only one available to the UK. I implore you to seek to restart the constructive dialogue that your predecessor, David Cameron, began with Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, which showed real promise in terms of addressing the issues that were, just a few months later, to dominate the referendum debate.</p> <p>It is now time for you to be bold: to not merely accept the ambitions of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35622105\" title=\"\">Tusk package</a>, but to take them forward and to look to urgently address the big issues that are of mutual concern to other EU member states. To leverage the fact the UK is an integral part of the European Union, its second-largest economy; to see that our exit will shake Europe to its core and endanger the European postwar order; to use our significant voice in the EU to robustly push for reforms on issues such as sovereignty, immigration and economic governance.</p> <p>From conversations and meetings I have had on mainland Europe, there is no better time to push for such EU reforms. All member states are striving for new direction and relevance as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/nov/20/revealed-one-in-four-europeans-vote-populist\" title=\"\">wave of populism</a> sweeps across the continent. This approach would allow the British government to deliver the key demands of the electorate in 2016, allow the UK to come out of this long and tortuous process with dignity and to see us leading, rather than leaving, the EU. An outcome that would achieve your stated wish of bringing our country together. </p> <p>With your deal overwhelmingly reviled across the Commons, you must now be honest and accept publicly that to allow a no-deal departure from the EU by default would be the ultimate dereliction of duty. Above all, not to explore all possible options now available to us would amount to an unforgivable betrayal of future generations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/06/no-deal-brexit-rights-of-5-million-uk-and-eu-citizens-under-threat\">No-deal Brexit: rights of 5 million UK and EU citizens 'under threat'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The contradictory positions you and many in your cabinet have taken over almost three years have caused a rollercoaster of expectations that has damaged trust in your party and in politics generally. What, honestly, is your position on the Irish backstop? You cannot now, at this late stage, seriously be talking once again about a technological solution to the issue of the border, a full seven months after the EU rejected the idea as impossible. If it is your strategy \u2013 and that of your supporters in the media \u2013 to blame the EU when the endgame emerges, how do you expect the EU member states to treat us as you look to negotiate any future relationship?</p> <p>Yet, while you have faced criticism from all sides for your deal, no one has been able to offer a viable alternative so far. Not Norway, not the Malthouse proposals \u2013 none of these offer anything that is even fractionally as advantageous as the deal we have right now with the EU. Revisiting the Tusk package is now our last chance to re-assert the UK\u2019s voice as a respected and outward-looking force for good, and for all the people of Europe.</p> <p>Should you be contemplating pulling the vote on 13 February or delaying the meaningful vote until the 11th hour, you would go down in history as the most irresponsible, devil-take-the-hindmost prime minister of modern times.</p> <p>By contrast, to now restart the Tusk negotiations would be a true act of leadership and I urge you to pick up the telephone. It is time once again to be the strong voice of reason at the heart of the EU, and to be a prime minister who puts the best interests of your people first. As Mr Tusk himself said today: \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for people who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.\u201d</p> <p>Best wishes,</p> <p>\u2022 Gina Miller is a co-founder of <a href=\"http://leadnotleave.com/\" title=\"\">Lead Not Leave</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dear Mrs May, I write to you at a time of grave national crisis, beholden to no party, a representative of no special interest and in nobody\u2019s pocket. I am, however, a concerned citizen, a mother and an employer and I am hopeful that, in view of the deadlock in our politics just weeks before we are due to leave the European Union on 29 March, you will have the intellectual and moral honesty to consider a commonsense and pragmatic proposal. Let us start off by agreeing that none of us, no matter how we voted in the EU referendum, could ever have imagined we would be in the dreadful position we are today. A position in which, in barely 50 days\u2019 time, you and your government concede that the UK might be under martial law, experiencing shortages of foods and essential drugs, a sharp economic downturn leading to job losses, and our national security and public services drastically compromised. I, like many others, accept that you faced an impossible job in trying to turn fantasy promises into practical realities. This has been compounded by the various factions tearing your party apart, with certain individuals ruthlessly pursuing their own ambitions and agendas. Is it therefore not time to level with the people of the United Kingdom? After all, you promised in the speech that you made when you first became prime minister that when you made the big calls, you\u2019d think not of the powerful and the mighty but ordinary people \u2013 such as the young and those starting out in their lives. A poll that my organisation, Lead Not Leave, has just commissioned shows the depth of concern among young people about a no-deal Brexit. They will have to live with the consequences of decisions that are about to be taken, and which they can see only too clearly will have an adverse impact on them for the rest of their lives. I would suggest that, far from addressing the very real concerns of large numbers of voters in the referendum \u2013 the inequalities in our society, the underfunding of public services, trust in politicians, care for our old and sick \u2013 all of the Brexit options now facing us will be a disaster for the whole UK. None of them can be said to make \u201ca success\u201d of Brexit. I do not doubt that you believe you are attempting to carry out the instructions of a majority of voters in the referendum. You no doubt hope your deal will satisfy all sides within your own party and indeed our European partners. But a deal that can somehow square the circle now looks impossible. Surely you must now accept that you can never bring the Conservative party together when you are dealing with a mixture of fantasists, egotists and rightwing ideologues? That is why I urge you to accept that your deal is not the only one available to the UK. I implore you to seek to restart the constructive dialogue that your predecessor, David Cameron, began with Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, which showed real promise in terms of addressing the issues that were, just a few months later, to dominate the referendum debate. It is now time for you to be bold: to not merely accept the ambitions of the Tusk package, but to take them forward and to look to urgently address the big issues that are of mutual concern to other EU member states. To leverage the fact the UK is an integral part of the European Union, its second-largest economy; to see that our exit will shake Europe to its core and endanger the European postwar order; to use our significant voice in the EU to robustly push for reforms on issues such as sovereignty, immigration and economic governance. From conversations and meetings I have had on mainland Europe, there is no better time to push for such EU reforms. All member states are striving for new direction and relevance as a wave of populism sweeps across the continent. This approach would allow the British government to deliver the key demands of the electorate in 2016, allow the UK to come out of this long and tortuous process with dignity and to see us leading, rather than leaving, the EU. An outcome that would achieve your stated wish of bringing our country together. With your deal overwhelmingly reviled across the Commons, you must now be honest and accept publicly that to allow a no-deal departure from the EU by default would be the ultimate dereliction of duty. Above all, not to explore all possible options now available to us would amount to an unforgivable betrayal of future generations. The contradictory positions you and many in your cabinet have taken over almost three years have caused a rollercoaster of expectations that has damaged trust in your party and in politics generally. What, honestly, is your position on the Irish backstop? You cannot now, at this late stage, seriously be talking once again about a technological solution to the issue of the border, a full seven months after the EU rejected the idea as impossible. If it is your strategy \u2013 and that of your supporters in the media \u2013 to blame the EU when the endgame emerges, how do you expect the EU member states to treat us as you look to negotiate any future relationship? Yet, while you have faced criticism from all sides for your deal, no one has been able to offer a viable alternative so far. Not Norway, not the Malthouse proposals \u2013 none of these offer anything that is even fractionally as advantageous as the deal we have right now with the EU. Revisiting the Tusk package is now our last chance to re-assert the UK\u2019s voice as a respected and outward-looking force for good, and for all the people of Europe. Should you be contemplating pulling the vote on 13 February or delaying the meaningful vote until the 11th hour, you would go down in history as the most irresponsible, devil-take-the-hindmost prime minister of modern times. By contrast, to now restart the Tusk negotiations would be a true act of leadership and I urge you to pick up the telephone. It is time once again to be the strong voice of reason at the heart of the EU, and to be a prime minister who puts the best interests of your people first. As Mr Tusk himself said today: \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for people who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.\u201d Best wishes, \u2022 Gina Miller is a co-founder of Lead Not Leave.",

      "bodyText": "The European Union\u2019s frustration with the British government has erupted into the open, prompting a vicious war of words across the Channel as Theresa May heads to Brussels to try to salvage her Brexit deal. Unscripted comments from Donald Tusk, president of the European council, warning of a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for those who pushed for Brexit \u201cwithout even a sketch of a plan\u201d set off a furious reaction in London. The comments came just 24 hours before May is due to sit down with Tusk to try and hammer out a way forward. The leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom \u2013 a Brexiter \u2013 described Tusk\u2019s comments as \u201cspiteful\u201d. \u201cI think that what he has said is pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful,\u201d she said. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cIt\u2019s this sort of arrogance that drives antipathy towards the EU. We are a country that upholds the result of democratic votes. Our EU partners need to respect that.\u201d The home secretary, Sajid Javid, tweeted that Tusk\u2019s remarks were \u201cout of order\u201d. Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, condemned Tusk for being \u201cdeliberately provocative [and] very disrespectful\u201d. DUP MP Sammy Wilson described the EU leader as a \u201cdevilish Euro-maniac\u201d. A spokesman for May said: \u201cI think it is a question for Donald Tusk as to whether he considers the use of that kind of language to be helpful. I appreciate that was difficult this morning as he didn\u2019t take any questions.\u201d The row threatens to poison an already tense day of meetings for the prime minister, who is due to hold talks with Tusk, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt. Verhofstadt tweeted of the Brexiters: \u201cWell, I doubt Lucifer would welcome them, as after what they did to Britain, they would even manage to divide hell.\u201d It will be the first time May meets the EU\u2019s most senior officials since her withdrawal agreement was rejected in the House of Commons last month by an historic 230 votes. May is seeking \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to replace the Irish backstop, a time-limit on the customs union it envisages or a unilateral exit mechanism. But following meetings with the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in Brussels, Tusk and Juncker both resolutely rejected any change to the backstop. Tusk told reporters that the EU was not \u201cmaking any new offer\u201d to Britain, and demanded a \u201crealistic\u201d suggestion from May on how to end the impasse. Juncker said that May already knew before arriving in Brussels that the EU would not reopen discussions on the backstop. \u201cThe so-called alternative arrangements can never replace the backstop,\u201d Juncker added. \u201cThere is no way you can have a unilateral jumping out of the backstop because the backstop is needed as a guarantee. A safety net is not a safety net if it can be destroyed by the unilateral action of one party.\u201d A photograph was later circulated of Juncker and Varadkar reading a card from a family in Dublin, thanking the EU for its solidarity. \u201cFor the 1st time ever Ireland is stronger [than] Britain,\u201d the card read. \u201cThat strength comes not from guns \u2026 it comes from your word and that of your colleagues. Britain does not care about peace in Northern Ireland.

Varadkar, who is due to have dinner with May on Friday, said the EU had been flexible throughout: \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s for those who have created the problem to be creative now.\u201d Asked about May\u2019s ambitions for coming to Brussels, Varadkar said: \u201cI do have a concern around this idea of alternative arrangements. \u201cWe need to bear in mind that this majority that perhaps existed or did exist in the House of Commons for alternative arrangements probably only existed because alternative arrangements can mean whatever you want them to mean. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that would have passed if people actually had to get into the detail.\u201d Varadkar was also picked up by microphones telling Tusk that the British will \u201cgive you terrible trouble\u201d, to which the former Polish prime minister laughed and nodded. Sources close to Tusk, who held an \u201copen and frank\u201d telephone call with May last week, said the comments had been \u201cfrom the heart\u201d. May\u2019s visit has been described as \u201cpart of a process\u201d by No 10 and she is expected to arrive in Brussels without having narrowed down which of three proposed approaches she hopes to pursue \u2013 an end-date to the backstop; a unilateral exit clause; or hi-tech alternatives to border checks. \u201cWe are continuing to work on all three,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said on Wednesday. May has promised to bring a reworked withdrawal agreement back for MPs to approve \u201cas soon as possible\u201d; but senior government sources suggested that was unlikely to be next week. Asked whether he agreed with Tusk\u2019s comments about the Brexiters, Juncker had told reporters: \u201cI believe in heaven and I have never seen hell, apart from the time I was doing my job here. It\u2019s a hell.\u201d",

The east London authority filed a high court claim against RBS earlier this week, the Guardian can report. The claim centres on terms of its lender option borrower option loans, known as Lobos, which proved popular with local councils in the early 2000s. One of the main attractions were the Lobos\u2019 teaser interest rates that kept costs low in the short term but later proved expensive as austerity and spending cuts took hold. Lobos have attracted criticism by campaigners and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has called for a government investigation and action to restore any historic losses to the public purse. The east London authority took out about \u00a3578m in Lobos between 2003-10, according to data compiled by the campaign group Debt Resistance UK. About \u00a3150m of those loans were provided by RBS, making it the second largest lender of Lobo loans to Newham aside from Barclays. Newham\u2019s legal team filed a separate legal claim against Barclays over its Lobo loans last year and proceedings are understood to be ongoing. Barclays declined to comment. A spokesman for Newham council confirmed that the claim had been lodged against RBS but declined to comment further given it is a live legal matter. An RBS spokeswoman said: \u201cNo claims have been served on the bank at this time.\u201d While a filing has been made at the high court, it is understood that the bank does not yet have the specifics of the claim. It follows a similar lawsuit launched against Barclays in recent weeks by seven local councils including Greater Manchester and Leeds over the terms of nearly \u00a3573m in Lobo loans taken out between them. Their own high court claim centres on how interest rates on those loans were influenced by the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Barclays is among the lenders that have been fined for Libor rigging since the banking crisis. The loans gave banks the power to raise interest rates at certain points over their lifetime, accounting for the \u201clender option\u201d of the loan agreement. Although borrowers had the option of rejecting those terms, it would trigger a clause forcing them to immediately repay the loan in full. The seven councils say the bank knew customers would rely on Libor rates, which Barclays was accused of lowballing, when deciding whether to enter into contracts. Barclays then has the power to raise interest rates over the lifetime of the Lobo loans as part of the central terms. This week marks six years since RBS was fined a total of \u00a387.5m over Libor manipulation by the City watchdog in 2013. Research for Action, a research cooperative that involves members of Debt Resistance UK, said the anniversary meant the six-year time limit for potential claims linked to Libor manipulation was also coming to a close. The research group claims that 42 local authorities in the UK have suffered losses on about \u00a31.4bn of RBS-issued Lobo loans due to Libor manipulation. The organisation says it has sent letters to the chief executives of all the potentially affected councils to notify them of the deadline.",

Although the experience and process of growing up has in many ways profoundly changed through history, our understanding of children has failed to keep pace. Nothing makes this clearer than the children\u2019s climate strikes. These protests, involving school-age children refusing to attend class to focus the attention of political leaders on the global climate crisis, have spread from Australia to Germany, from Sweden to Belgium; the first strikes in the UK take place on Friday 15 February and in the US later this month.

Why can\u2019t the children protest in their \u201cfree time\u201d, instead of endangering their own education and their future which we, the adults, supposedly have provided for them. The most absurd reaction has emerged from Belgium, where an environment minister, Joke Schauvliege, has been forced to resign after claiming that the Belgian children skipping school were being directed by unnamed foreign powers. Schauvliege suggested that the protests were a \u201cset-up\u201d and she falsely claimed that Belgian intelligence had knowledge that the children\u2019s actions were \u201cmore than spontaneous actions of solidarity\u201d. There was a paternalistic dismissal of the school protests too from the Australian resources minister, Matt Canavan, who said in a radio interview that the action was setting the children up for failure: \u201cWalking off school and protesting, you don\u2019t learn anything from that.\u201d Meanwhile, consider an interview the German news magazine Der Spiegel did with Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish mastermind of the school strikes movement, who travelled 32 hours by train to get to Davos while the \u201cadults\u201d who were supposed to meet to talk about climate change there arrived in 1,500 private jet flights.

As the Australian Human Rights Commission argued the ParentsNext program was \u201cmanifestly inconsistent with Australia\u2019s human rights obligations\u201d and social services and legal groups call for the program to be overhauled or scrapped, departmental figures show thousands of parents are having their payments cut under the new program. More than 16,000 parents received a payment suspension between July and December 2018, representing 21% of the 75,000 participants. The suspension rate for Indigenous parents \u2013 who are targeted for eligibility and make up 19% of participants \u2013 is higher at 27%. The suspensions are considered particularly concerning because all ParentsNext participants have children between six months and five years old and generally have no other source of income. The new data is contained in a joint submission to Senate inquiry into ParentsNext by a coalition of legal groups, which is among those calling for the $263m pre-employment program to be abandoned. The coalition \u2013 made up of the Human Rights Law Centre, SNAICC and the National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services Forum \u2013 argued the program unjustifiably discriminates against women and Indigenous Australians. The money would be better spent on \u201cevidence-based, voluntary and empowering\u201d programs, the submission said. \u201cOur government should be thanking women for the endless hours of breastfeeding and nappy-changing \u2026 not threatening to leave them without money for food for them and their babies,\u201d said Adrianne Walters, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre. The submission was one of many \u2013 including from the National Social Security Rights Network, Good Shepherd Australia and the National Council for Single Mothers and their Children \u2013 that called for a voluntary program without compliance measures. The Australian Human Rights Commission, which echoed that call, said the program was \u201cinconsistent with Australia\u2019s human rights obligations\u201d. The \u201cretrogressive\u201d compliance regime breached the \u201cright to social security\u201d and risked \u201centrenching and exacerbating poverty and inequality\u201d, it said. The commission said the program\u2019s \u201cdirect discrimination\u201d of Indigenous Australians and \u201cindirect discrimination\u201d against women could not be justified, despite the government\u2019s claims it would reduce disadvantage for those groups. The commission was also concerned by reports in Guardian Australia that parents on the program were allegedly pressured into allowing private job service providers to collect their \u201csensitive information\u201d. The government acknowledges the \u201cintensive stream\u201d of the program is aimed at areas with high numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents receiving the parenting payment. Welfare recipients who live in \u201cintensive stream\u201d areas are more likely to be placed on the program because the eligibility criteria is broader. Statistics indicate 95% of participants are women and about 99% are single parents. ParentsNext providers had previously called for the suspensions to be scrapped because they are forcing some parents to visit food banks. Once placed on ParentsNext, participants must complete set weekly \u201cactivities\u201d such as study or parenting classes to keep their payments. Guardian Australia revealed last year that those activities have included playgroup, \u201cstory time\u201d and swimming lessons. Parents who fail to report their income, their attendance at activities, or for not turning up at appointments with their providers receive a temporary payment suspension. These are restored when they \u201cre-engage\u201d with their provider, but participants have reported being unable to report due to problems with the Centrelink app and receiving suspensions for taking their children to kindergarten rather than their pre-approved activity. One ParentsNext participant has served a \u201cfinancial penalty\u201d after they had racked up six \u201cdemerit points\u201d. The points are imposed by ParentsNext providers when parents fail to meet their requirements. Financial penalties can include having their payment docked by 50%, losing a full payment or being cut from Centrelink for four weeks. The Senate inquiry into ParentsNext, which was established by the Greens and Labor, will report at the end of March.",

I grew up around books and cannot remember a time when I couldn\u2019t read. There is a strange subspecies of human for whom reading is like breathing. I am one of them \u2013 it\u2019s just the way I am. I don\u2019t say this to engender any particular response but to offer context to the following.</p> <p>A few years ago I made the costly mistake of lay-bying multifocal glasses which proved to be unwearable because they caused massive headaches. I couldn\u2019t replace them because I couldn\u2019t afford it, so eventually they were put to one side and not worn again. I could not see to read and because I couldn\u2019t read, I couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>Starved of all edification, expansion and escape, I gradually shut down. I stopped reading and then stopped writing and eventually even coherent thought proved too onerous to indulge in. My soul slivered off in pieces as I was sucked into a cultureless vacuum. My essential nature was trammelled by the dearth of words and I began to live a half life devoid of pleasure and interaction.</p> <p>I am only now just beginning to ken the full ramifications of that dark period \u2013 the black road I travelled divorced from the comfort of the written word. Without the influence of literature it became easier and easier to fall into the trap of believing the punitive narrative around those of us on welfare. For example \u201cI must be stupid, lazy and inept or I\u2019d be working\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t handle money\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m worthless\u201d (which very quickly is followed by \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d and then \u2026 suicide ideation.)</p> <p>I think I was at my lowest ebb when I forced myself to my first Anti-Poverty Network South Australia conference. Strong in the belief that I had nothing to contribute I sat back and listened. I discovered I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/life-on-the-breadline\">not alone</a>, that others suffered as I did and heard the stories of those who were doing it tougher than I. I shed a few tears.</p> <p>At the \u201cpay what you can\u201d lunch I began to shyly converse with other luncheon goers. In the lineup for the food, I discussed the origin of my name with someone with a PhD in linguistics, economic policy with a social worker, and ended up sitting next to someone who eventually became a dear friend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/20/life-on-the-breadline-when-you-live-in-poverty-you-are-given-a-secret-gift\">Life on the breadline: when you live in poverty, you are given a secret gift | Amethyst DeWilde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the initial buzz of the conference, it took me some time to get the confidence to go to a meeting. At the first that I attended, we had to shift location and decided to go to a coffee shop. I suggested my fave the Red Lime Shack, hoping for a suspended coffee because it was not a pay week and I was once again impecunious. Pas Forgione, the previous state coordinator of the Anti-Poverty Network, said \u201cI just got paid \u2013 I\u2019ll buy you a coffee\u201d, and as we crossed the road I finally realised what was wrong with the world.</p> <p>Those with far too little, give half.</p> <p>Those with far too much, give little.</p> <p>Pas didn\u2019t really have the money to shout coffee \u2013 as one of the working poor he could have put those funds to a million more important priorities. But he did it happily, just as I would have for him if I had the money to do so. I know of so many welfarers who only have $5 left and will still give you $2.50.

      "bodyText": "Name: Amethyst DeWilde Age: 51 Turning point: Leaving my job in a toxic workplace and being diagnosed with bipolar disorder Lives: Adelaide After housing costs lives on: $331.20 a week \u201cTo blame the poor for subsisting on welfare has no justice unless we are also willing to judge every rich member of society by how productive he or she is. Taken individual by individual, it is likely that there\u2019s more idleness and abuse of government favours among the economically privileged than among the ranks of the disadvantaged.\u201d \u2013 Norman Mailer, author It is difficult to write of poverty, especially one\u2019s own. So much slips through and cannot be caught by words. Meanwhile there\u2019s relentless exhaustion, the constant worry and the enervating effect that judgment from others elicits. So as I try to garner all my resources to focus on writing this article, the perseverating thoughts bleed through. For example, currently there\u2019s not enough food in my fridge to last until payday and obviously if you have been following my story, you know there is no money to replace it. So I think: \u201cIf I mash those rissoles, I could cook them with that Leggo\u2019s pasta sauce, that could be a few meals I could share with Mojo. The chooks will complain \u2013 but they always do anyway ... \u201cI\u2019ve only got one more visit allowed at the Bowden food bank \u2013 can\u2019t use that right now, have to save that for when I\u2019m really desperate \u2026 \u201cBugger! I\u2019ve run out of toilet paper \u2026 I\u2019ll have to track down that \u2018yellow pages\u2019 and shift it to the toilet \u2026 \u201cThank the gods I\u2019ve still got coffee and Coffee-Mate.\u201d I apologise for subjecting you to my thought processes \u2013 I know they are vapid and I\u2019m sure you feel as though you have dropped a few IQ points simply by reading them. How do you think I feel thinking them? It wasn\u2019t always this way for me. I grew up around books and cannot remember a time when I couldn\u2019t read. There is a strange subspecies of human for whom reading is like breathing. I am one of them \u2013 it\u2019s just the way I am. I don\u2019t say this to engender any particular response but to offer context to the following. A few years ago I made the costly mistake of lay-bying multifocal glasses which proved to be unwearable because they caused massive headaches. I couldn\u2019t replace them because I couldn\u2019t afford it, so eventually they were put to one side and not worn again. I could not see to read and because I couldn\u2019t read, I couldn\u2019t breathe. Starved of all edification, expansion and escape, I gradually shut down. I stopped reading and then stopped writing and eventually even coherent thought proved too onerous to indulge in. My soul slivered off in pieces as I was sucked into a cultureless vacuum. My essential nature was trammelled by the dearth of words and I began to live a half life devoid of pleasure and interaction. I am only now just beginning to ken the full ramifications of that dark period \u2013 the black road I travelled divorced from the comfort of the written word. Without the influence of literature it became easier and easier to fall into the trap of believing the punitive narrative around those of us on welfare. For example \u201cI must be stupid, lazy and inept or I\u2019d be working\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t handle money\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m worthless\u201d (which very quickly is followed by \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d and then \u2026 suicide ideation.) I think I was at my lowest ebb when I forced myself to my first Anti-Poverty Network South Australia conference. Strong in the belief that I had nothing to contribute I sat back and listened. I discovered I was not alone, that others suffered as I did and heard the stories of those who were doing it tougher than I. I shed a few tears. At the \u201cpay what you can\u201d lunch I began to shyly converse with other luncheon goers. In the lineup for the food, I discussed the origin of my name with someone with a PhD in linguistics, economic policy with a social worker, and ended up sitting next to someone who eventually became a dear friend. After the initial buzz of the conference, it took me some time to get the confidence to go to a meeting. At the first that I attended, we had to shift location and decided to go to a coffee shop. I suggested my fave the Red Lime Shack, hoping for a suspended coffee because it was not a pay week and I was once again impecunious. Pas Forgione, the previous state coordinator of the Anti-Poverty Network, said \u201cI just got paid \u2013 I\u2019ll buy you a coffee\u201d, and as we crossed the road I finally realised what was wrong with the world. Those with far too little, give half. Those with far too much, give little. Pas didn\u2019t really have the money to shout coffee \u2013 as one of the working poor he could have put those funds to a million more important priorities. But he did it happily, just as I would have for him if I had the money to do so. I know of so many welfarers who only have $5 left and will still give you $2.50. I pondered this as we took our seats and an unsolicited screenshot of our ex prime minister\u2019s charity photo op blazoned through my mind. One hand giving a homeless man $5, the other caressing a colourful wad of bills. I later found out that dear, sweet Malcolm was worth $133m. Just as an aside I thought it may be fun to work out the percentage value of $5 of $133m. I went on a percentage calculator and I couldn\u2019t work it out so it deferred to 0.0% \u2013 I cracked up laughing.

He has published Facebook posts as an administrator from the group\u2019s account, which warn of Labor\u2019s \u201ctidal wave of taxes\u201d and accuse the opposition of wanting to \u201cdrive people to Labor\u2019s union funds\u201d.</p> <p>Records filed with the corporate regulator show the group is owned by Andrew Higginson, who also runs HGH Consulting, a Canberra-based lobbying firm, and two other men. </p> <p>The group appears to have accidentally disclosed Gunning\u2019s role in publishing on Facebook by taking screenshots of the Facebook posts and reproducing them on their website.</p> <p>In doing so, they have displayed the individual Facebook group member who published individual posts from the Defenders of Self Funded Retirees account.</p> <p>Gunning is listed as the person who registered a domain name associated with the group\u2019s contact email address.</p> <p>Gunning\u2019s mobile number is also listed as the general contact number for the group, both in its submission to parliament and on its Facebook page. His name is not listed alongside the contact number, either on Facebook or the submission.</p> <p>When Guardian Australia first called the number, Gunning would not disclose his identity, only saying he was working with the group and was an \u201centhusiastic\u201d supporter.</p> <p>Contact was made again after Gunning\u2019s identity and his involvement in the group became clear. Gunning later issued a statement through the Canberra Liberals saying he was \u201cproud to have been involved in a grassroots organisation that is standing up for hard-working Australians\u201d who had saved for their retirement.</p> <p>\u201cJust like hundreds of thousands of Australians, I have been concerned about Labor\u2019s $45bn tax on retirees since the day it was announced,\u201d Gunning said. \u201cJust like many candidates in every election, I am excited to have the opportunity to stand as a candidate to make sure the voices of my local community are heard.\u201d</p> <p>Guardian Australia is not suggesting Gunning is responsible for all the group\u2019s activities, or that the group does not contain genuine grassroots campaigners.</p> <p>Arthur Smith, a retiree who will be affected by the policy, works alongside the group and speaks out against Labor\u2019s plans. Smith said he had helped hand out brochures alongside Gunning on Bribie Island during the Longman byelection campaign.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s been influential in just sort of making sure it\u2019s kept on going,\u201d he said. \u201cHe seems to know who\u2019s who and he\u2019s got a few contacts around the place.\u201d</p> <p>Smith said he found out Gunning was a Liberal candidate two weeks ago, but was not surprised.</p> <p>The Facebook ads paid for by the Defenders of Self Funded Retirees also fail to give proper authorisation disclosing who is behind them. The University of Queensland professor Graeme Orr, an expert in the regulation of democracy, said the ads were clearly electoral matter and, as paid ads, should contain authorisations.</p> <p>\u201cWhen contained in a paid \u2018advertisement\u2019 it has to be authorised by the proper \u2018notifying entity\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The revelations about the Defenders of Self Funded Retirees come after Labor demanded Wilson be sacked for alleged conflicts of interest and a \u201cmassive breach\u201d of parliamentary conventions.</p> <p>Wilson is the chair of a current inquiry into the Labor policy, but at the same time set up a website allowing people to register to attend public hearings and send submissions opposing the Labor policy. The site carried an authorisation by Wilson in his capacity as the chairman of the standing committee on economics. The website was privately funded by an undisclosed source.</p> <p>New evidence emerged on Wednesday showing the Liberal MP had coordinated with the chairman of Wilson Asset Management, Geoff Wilson, a vocal opponent of the Labor policy, to coincide protest activity with hearings of the committee.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Liberal Senate candidate is helping to operate a self-styled \u201cgrassroots\u201d retiree campaign against Labor\u2019s franking credits policy, which has taken out paid newspaper and Facebook ads, conducted targeted campaigns in Peter Dutton\u2019s electorate, and made submissions to parliament. The Defenders of Self Funded Retirees was set up in mid-2018 and bills itself as a community group \u201ccreated by people incensed by Labor\u2019s attack on people who had saved for the [sic] retirement\u201d. The group has taken out newspaper ads, paid for Facebook ads, built a professional website, and doorknocked, distributed postcards, and letterboxed in marginal seats. It has conducted targeted campaigns in Dutton\u2019s electorate of Dickson and in Longman, ahead of last year\u2019s by-election. The group has also helped funnel people to a controversial website opposing the policy, associated with Tim Wilson, the chair of a parliamentary inquiry into Labor\u2019s planned changes. It also pushes people to a petition against Labor\u2019s policy by Wilson Asset Management, a firm run by Tim Wilson\u2019s distant relative and in which the Liberal MP owns shares. Nowhere does the Defenders of Self Funded Retirees group disclose any link to the Liberal party. In its submission to Wilson\u2019s parliamentary inquiry, it says it was formed by a \u201cgroup of retirees who saw the need to encourage individuals to actively defend themselves and their interests in the face of a growing tide of demonisation\u201d. But Guardian Australia can reveal that Robert Gunning, a current Liberal candidate for the Senate, has helped to organise the group\u2019s activities. He has published Facebook posts as an administrator from the group\u2019s account, which warn of Labor\u2019s \u201ctidal wave of taxes\u201d and accuse the opposition of wanting to \u201cdrive people to Labor\u2019s union funds\u201d. Records filed with the corporate regulator show the group is owned by Andrew Higginson, who also runs HGH Consulting, a Canberra-based lobbying firm, and two other men. The group appears to have accidentally disclosed Gunning\u2019s role in publishing on Facebook by taking screenshots of the Facebook posts and reproducing them on their website. In doing so, they have displayed the individual Facebook group member who published individual posts from the Defenders of Self Funded Retirees account. Gunning is listed as the person who registered a domain name associated with the group\u2019s contact email address. Gunning\u2019s mobile number is also listed as the general contact number for the group, both in its submission to parliament and on its Facebook page. His name is not listed alongside the contact number, either on Facebook or the submission. When Guardian Australia first called the number, Gunning would not disclose his identity, only saying he was working with the group and was an \u201centhusiastic\u201d supporter. Contact was made again after Gunning\u2019s identity and his involvement in the group became clear. Gunning later issued a statement through the Canberra Liberals saying he was \u201cproud to have been involved in a grassroots organisation that is standing up for hard-working Australians\u201d who had saved for their retirement. \u201cJust like hundreds of thousands of Australians, I have been concerned about Labor\u2019s $45bn tax on retirees since the day it was announced,\u201d Gunning said. \u201cJust like many candidates in every election, I am excited to have the opportunity to stand as a candidate to make sure the voices of my local community are heard.\u201d Guardian Australia is not suggesting Gunning is responsible for all the group\u2019s activities, or that the group does not contain genuine grassroots campaigners. Arthur Smith, a retiree who will be affected by the policy, works alongside the group and speaks out against Labor\u2019s plans. Smith said he had helped hand out brochures alongside Gunning on Bribie Island during the Longman byelection campaign. \u201cI think he\u2019s been influential in just sort of making sure it\u2019s kept on going,\u201d he said. \u201cHe seems to know who\u2019s who and he\u2019s got a few contacts around the place.\u201d Smith said he found out Gunning was a Liberal candidate two weeks ago, but was not surprised. The Facebook ads paid for by the Defenders of Self Funded Retirees also fail to give proper authorisation disclosing who is behind them. The University of Queensland professor Graeme Orr, an expert in the regulation of democracy, said the ads were clearly electoral matter and, as paid ads, should contain authorisations. \u201cWhen contained in a paid \u2018advertisement\u2019 it has to be authorised by the proper \u2018notifying entity\u2019,\u201d he said. The revelations about the Defenders of Self Funded Retirees come after Labor demanded Wilson be sacked for alleged conflicts of interest and a \u201cmassive breach\u201d of parliamentary conventions. Wilson is the chair of a current inquiry into the Labor policy, but at the same time set up a website allowing people to register to attend public hearings and send submissions opposing the Labor policy. The site carried an authorisation by Wilson in his capacity as the chairman of the standing committee on economics. The website was privately funded by an undisclosed source. New evidence emerged on Wednesday showing the Liberal MP had coordinated with the chairman of Wilson Asset Management, Geoff Wilson, a vocal opponent of the Labor policy, to coincide protest activity with hearings of the committee.",

      "bodyText": "The conservative Liberal MP Kevin Andrews will be GetUp\u2019s first Victorian target in this year\u2019s federal election. On Wednesday evening the progressive campaign group announced at a members\u2019 meeting at Kensington town hall that it will target the seat of Menzies, which Andrews won with a 10.5% two-party preferred margin but is estimated to be 7.6% after a redistribution. After committing to campaign against the former prime minister Tony Abbott and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, GetUp polled its members in January to ask which other \u201chard-right\u201d MPs should get the boot at the election, expected in May. GetUp\u2019s national director, Paul Oosting, told Guardian Australia that Andrews was the top Victorian MP in the poll and in the top 10 nationally because he played a strong \u201cbehind-the-scenes role\u201d in the conservative wing of the Liberal party. He cited the fact Andrews was a founding member of the pro-coal Monash Forum, advocated a vote against marriage equality, and opined that Andrews was \u201cthe originator of the \u2018gang\u2019 rhetoric aimed at African communities\u201d in Melbourne. Greg Hunt \u201calso rated highly\u201d, which could indicate the health minister\u2019s seat of Flinders is a future target, although Oosting said that would depend whether members volunteered in sufficient numbers to expand its electoral map. Oosting said that GetUp was not aware of any high-profile independents challenging Andrews but had decided to target the \u201cnot traditionally marginal seat\u201d because it was \u201cdifficult but necessary\u201d to remove Andrews. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen at the Victorian election that double-digit swings have already happened recently and that could remain the trend,\u201d he said. The thumping re-election of Daniel Andrews\u2019 government at the November state election convinced Labor that at least six more seats in Victoria are in play in that state at the federal election, although some Liberals think Bill Shorten\u2019s economic agenda could help it hold its blue-ribbon seats. The GetUp campaign adds to the government\u2019s headaches after the announced retirements of three ministers and a crop of moderate ex-Liberals running as independents including the MP Julia Banks, who is attempting to unseat her former colleague Hunt, and Zali Steggall, who is running against Abbott. Asked if GetUp will endorse Steggall and Banks, Oosting replied that GetUp will assess all candidates \u201con their merits\u201d depending on their policies and \u201cwhether they are in contention to win\u201d. The poll \u2013 which only offered Coalition MPs as potential targets \u2013 also included the energy minister, Angus Taylor, the attorney general, Christian Porter, as well as the influential conservative backbenchers George Christensen, Craig Kelly and Michael Sukkar. GetUp has more than 220,000 members in Victoria; Andrews topped the poll in that state with 3,600 votes. GetUp has drawn the ire of the Coalition for its refusal to identify as an \u201cassociated entity\u201d of the opposition Labor and Greens parties particularly after its decision in 2016 to hand out how-to-vote cards directing preferences away from the Liberal and National parties. GetUp will give voters how-to-vote cards, which Oosting said were \u201cas important a part of democracy as the democracy sausage [sizzle]\u201d because they guide voters to candidates who have progressive policies, like combatting climate change.",

So the pictures really pale in comparison to that.\u201d</p> <h2>Mental health problems</h2> <p>In the first three to four years after the 2009 fires, 26% of people in the worst-affected areas showed signs of mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder, severe psychological distress and depression, a <a href=\"https://beyondbushfires.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/2183511/Web_Beyond-Bushfires-Final-Report-2016-copy.pdf\">2016 study</a> found. At the five-year mark, 22% were still dealing with mental health issues.</p> <p>Data from the federal health department shows an increase of prescriptions for anti-depressants for the statistical area that covers Kinglake and other fire-affected towns, slightly higher than national and Victorian figures.</p> <p>Whittlesea-based psychologist David Younger has worked with scores of bushfire survivors over the years and still sees patients grappling with PTSD, depression and anxiety, and other trauma symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cTypically, what happens every summer in the area is some people go into an increased state of high arousal, they become hypervigilant and anxious,\u201d Younger says. This summer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/30/tasmania-fires-scores-of-blazes-rage-as-residents-asked-to-conserve-water\">fires in Tasmania </a>also played on people\u2019s minds, he adds.</p> <p>For children whose family members died and who lost classmates in the blaze, the past decade has been one of emotional turmoil.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve typically seen in adolescents is that the fire event caused significant disruption in their life and in what we would call a normal developmental pathway,\u201d Younger says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7022d5fc97bf6d2a0ddad0c0f385b44b212f4da5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7022d5fc97bf6d2a0ddad0c0f385b44b212f4da5/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Exton and Cheryl Chalmers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers Christine Exton and Cheryl Chalmers read up on Black Saturday bushfire information at the Kinglake Historical society museum in Kinglake West</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Volunteers Christine Exton and Cheryl Chalmers read up on Black Saturday bushfire information at the Kinglake Historical society museum.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThese could be kids who were so affected by what has happened that they were unable to finish school \u2013 they left in year 10 or year 11 and they may not have worked in a substantial employment role since.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHalf the town is on medication, and the other half should be.\u201d That\u2019s bushfire survivor Anne Dixon\u2019s dark-humoured attempt to describe how people from the mountaintop hamlets around Kinglake are coping 10 years on from Black Saturday. The district, north of Melbourne, was the epicentre of the tragedy \u2013 120 lives were lost in the Kilmore-to-Kinglake fire from an overall state toll of 173 on 7 February 2009, with 1,242 homes destroyed. While trees have grown back and houses have been rebuilt, for many life has never been the same. Burnt trees are seen among the regrowth on the ridge surrounding Kinglake. Ahead of the anniversary on Thursday and amid similar dry conditions and a summer heatwave, many from affected Victorian communities are on edge and fragile. Dixon, who lived in Kinglake for 22 years and lost her home in the fire, takes issue with people saying residents should \u201cget over it\u201d. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say that to someone whose entire family died in a car crash,\u201d she says. \u201cYou would be amazed at the number of people who said: \u2018Oh, you must be better off now you\u2019ve got a new house\u2019 . It\u2019s not like you moved from your old house to your new house and take everything with you. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone back to the very beginning and had to start over again,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to buy everything, including a blooming bath plug and veggie peeler.\u201d On Black Saturday, Dixon narrowly escaped in her ute with her hyperventilating cat late in the afternoon. \u201cI thought, shit, I\u2019m the last moron in Kinglake,\u201d she says now. Stranded as the fire front came through, Dixon saw the petrol station go up \u201cin one hell of a big bang\u201d. She sent her daughter Jess a message telling her she loved her and one to family and friends along the lines of: \u201cStuffed up big time, trapped in car with cat, this is my location.\u201d Life after the fires was initially so hectic it took a long time for the full impact of the trauma to be felt. Counselling services needed to be extended. Anne Dixon\u2019s home \u2013 before the fires and after. \u201cIn the aftermath you\u2019re busy, finding somewhere to live, buying clothes, sorting out the insurance, if your car was burnt you\u2019re busy trying to get a new one, you\u2019re busy, busy, busy and then you\u2019re busy rebuilding,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cIt takes a few years to stop being busy and to sit down and \u2026 start to think back on it.\u201d In the first few years of fire recovery, Dixon would type her address into Google Earth every few weeks for a glimpse of her beloved weatherboard cottage before it turned to ashes. Only one photo of her old house was saved \u2013 a picture on a snowy winter\u2019s day \u2013 but Dixon is philosophical about losing her family\u2019s photo albums dating back to the 1860s. \u201cMy cousin, who is the family historian, lost her son at Marysville. So the pictures really pale in comparison to that.\u201d Mental health problems In the first three to four years after the 2009 fires, 26% of people in the worst-affected areas showed signs of mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder, severe psychological distress and depression, a 2016 study found. At the five-year mark, 22% were still dealing with mental health issues. Data from the federal health department shows an increase of prescriptions for anti-depressants for the statistical area that covers Kinglake and other fire-affected towns, slightly higher than national and Victorian figures. Whittlesea-based psychologist David Younger has worked with scores of bushfire survivors over the years and still sees patients grappling with PTSD, depression and anxiety, and other trauma symptoms. \u201cTypically, what happens every summer in the area is some people go into an increased state of high arousal, they become hypervigilant and anxious,\u201d Younger says. This summer\u2019s fires in Tasmania also played on people\u2019s minds, he adds. For children whose family members died and who lost classmates in the blaze, the past decade has been one of emotional turmoil. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve typically seen in adolescents is that the fire event caused significant disruption in their life and in what we would call a normal developmental pathway,\u201d Younger says. Volunteers Christine Exton and Cheryl Chalmers read up on Black Saturday bushfire information at the Kinglake Historical society museum. \u201cThese could be kids who were so affected by what has happened that they were unable to finish school \u2013 they left in year 10 or year 11 and they may not have worked in a substantial employment role since. They\u2019ve come through to me in their 20s wanting to understand what happened and really get their life back on track.\u201d Christine Exton and Cheryl Chalmers are volunteers at the Kinglake West heritage centre, which will hold an exhibition of photographs and artefacts recovered from the 2009 fires. \u201cAll our kids grew up that day,\u201d Exton says. \u201cI had my youngest in the car with me and she was trembling and kept saying \u2018I don\u2019t want to die mum, I don\u2019t want to die\u2019. I had my hand on her leg to reassure her and then it went orange and black and I said \u2018I\u2019ve got to take my hand off your leg and put it on the steering wheel\u2019 and she was like \u2018no, no, no, no, no\u2019. She was only 12 \u2026 just the fear.\u201d Chalmers says she has learnt a lot about strategies to support her three children. \u201cOur son had terrible depression after the fires because he lost his best friend at the age of 10,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate living here, I would move tomorrow if I could.\u201d But for some, moving away only brought more misfortune. After losing his home in the fire, Thomas Borg, now 30, relocated to Laidley in Queensland\u2019s Lockyer Valley, only to have his new house get flooded in 2011. \u201cIt didn\u2019t worry me the second time,\u201d he says. \u201cShit happens.\u201d He has since moved back to Kinglake and had a relationship breakdown. \u201cThe divorce rate is probably at the highest level \u2026 a lot of people have turned to alcohol and drugs \u2026 especially marijuana, to cope,\u201d he says. His mother, Odette Bellamy, lost her home in the blaze, and the properties of two siblings and his father were also burnt out. Clockwise from top: Survivors Odette Bellamy and son Thomas Borg in the backyard of her home in Kinglake West, which was previously destroyed by the 2009 fires; this statue was all that remained after the Black Saturday bushfire tore through Odette Bellamy\u2019s property. Bellamy was at a wedding with her youngest daughter, Zoe, when she heard that the bushfire had destroyed her home at Kinglake West. Zoe had been swimming in a dam that morning with two school friends, who died later in the blaze. Bellamy\u2019s other daughter, Mary Jane, now 28, had driven over to her father\u2019s place to rescue him. \u201cShe told him to get out. He didn\u2019t want to go, he wanted to stay. She made him get out. There were trees falling down,\u201d Bellamy says. \u201cAt the intersection she went the right way \u2013 had she gone the other way she might have died. That really affected her, she had a bit of a breakdown. She couldn\u2019t come down for quite a while, she couldn\u2019t drive for quite a while. But she\u2019s doing really good now.\u201d The only things that survived on Bellamy\u2019s property were a reclining Buddha statue and the letter box. Emotional toll on local police In the weeks following the fires, survivors had a steady stream of funerals to attend and in the years since there have been more. The gruelling task of attending suicide deaths has taken its toll on local police, says Jason Caine, the father of a local leading senior constable who was on duty during the 2009 fires and received an Order of Australia medal for his role. \u201c[Cameron] was always a people person and now he\u2019s got PTSD,\u201d Caine says. \u201cHe was the town clown, he was a jovial person, but he\u2019s not a jovial person now \u2026 he\u2019s just languishing in a chair at home.\u201d Kinglake West CFA volunteers Peter Sharman and Jason Caine wash the trucks as part of the weekly routine during fire season. At the Kinglake West Fire Brigade, captain Frank Allan is supervising volunteers washing firetrucks on a Sunday morning in January. Behind them, rays of sunlight stream on to the yellow uniforms hanging from hooks on the shed wall. Allan was on one truck and his wife, Karen, was on the other on Black Saturday. \u201cWe actually got caught out there and had to stay there because we couldn\u2019t get back in for a couple of hours,\u201d he says. \u201cShe knew that we\u2019d made a call that we were stuck. At one stage we were probably half a [kilometre] apart but our truck radios couldn\u2019t talk to each other.\u201d He says the radio systems are now digital, but have not been tested in thick smoke. Deb and Mark Morrow\u2019s home was burnt out at Kinglake West and their daughter Bronnie and her young family lost their home in nearby Pheasant Creek. Mark is a retired firefighter who used to work for Melbourne Water. A decade ago, he was out on the back of the firetruck for weeks on end. Clockwise from top: Deb Morrow in the regrowth surrounding her home in Kinglake West; a burnt log and wire were all that remained of this power line. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit sensitive about [the fires] \u2026 he saw dead bodies, he\u2019s seen a hell of a lot,\u201d Deb says. After rebuilding their house, the Morrows installed a bore, a buffer area at the back of the property, four fire-fighting pumps and solar batteries, and have a dam that is always full of water. \u201cWe are really self-sufficient,\u201d Deb says. \u201cI\u2019m petrified of fires. I never go away in summer. It\u2019s changed my whole life. I never go on summer vacations. We are here. One of us is here at all times.\u201d It took four years to feel a sense of a new normal. \u201cIt\u2019s like you had a second life,\u201d she says. The Morrows were keen bird breeders and lost their collection of 100 exotic birds. They were initially reluctant to take up the hobby again, but then a friend asked them to adopt a rescued galah. Soon enough, the rebuilt aviaries were home to colourful species including eclectus and blue-winged parrots, quails, finches and rainbow lorikeets. Left to right: The Kinglake West fire bell, which is rung on 7 February in memory of those who died; Deb Morrow holds an image of her home. Deb proudly shows off her vegetable patch \u2013 brimming with corn, pumpkins, tomatoes and a mystery zucchini-like plant. Butterflies and bees dance across sunflowers and Jessie, the five-month-old border collie pup, frolics around. Deb Morrow says: \u201cThe fires couldn\u2019t take my memories. My cup is always half full, never empty.\u201d * The Victorian Department of Human Services has a special guide for people struggling with their feelings around the 10th anniversary of the bushfires.

They also left behind vital clues including a mattress, extension cables, pneumatic hammers and a grinding wheel that has been traced through its serial number to a shop in the Netherlands. The men are believed to have been disturbed by the building\u2019s alarm but escaped while the police waited for employees to open the secure door to the vault. Once inside, the officers were unable to enter the escape tunnel until breathing equipment was brought in. The public prosecutor has confirmed that a 27-year-old man, who was born in Georgia but has Belgian nationality, was arrested on Tuesday and is due to appear before judges on Friday in relation to the burglary of the BNP Paribas Fortis branch on Sunday. Sahil Malik, the lawyer for the suspect, declined to comment apart from saying: \u201cWe will do our story Friday in front of the council chamber.\u201d The thieves are understood to have started out in a nearby flat from where they dug a four-metre (13ft) long tunnel nearly two metres below the surface to connect with a sewage pipe. They then crawled for hundreds of metres in the sewage works before tunnelling again to resurface in the bank. CCTV images appear to show that the raid involved three men, who left the bank with heavily stuffed black bags on their backs. But it appears that they were disturbed by a burglar alarm in the vaults. Only 20 to 30 of more than a thousand safety deposit boxes held by the bank had been emptied by the time police arrived to find bars of gold left on the vault\u2019s floor.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Fears over the health of Germany\u2019s economy are mounting, after it suffered its biggest drop in factory orders since 2012. Orders plunged 7% in December compared to a year ago, as German manufacturers suffered from falling demand from overseas. Germany\u2019s economy ministry warned that there was \u201cmuted momentum at the start of the year\u201d too. Some economists fear that Germany could fall into a technical recession, unless demand picks up soon. In another blow to German industry, the EU has blocked a merger between Siemens and France\u2019s Alstom. Paris is furious, claiming a pan-European rail giant is needed to challenge China. The US trade deficit has narrowed, in what could be seen as a win for Donald Trump. However, the move was mainly due to falling imports, not a surge in exports (which fell slightly). S&amp;P has warned that it could downgrade some British companies in a no-deal Brexit - and possibly even cut the UK\u2019s credit rating. Shares in Ocado have tumbled over 6%, after one of its robotic warehouses was hit by a severe fire yesterday After a largely uneventful day, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed down 4 points at 7,173, a minuscule dip of 0.06%. In Frankfurt, the DAX shed 0.4%. Obviously Germany\u2019s weak factory orders didn\u2019t cheer investors. After yesterday\u2019s surge, it will take better news to get markets excited. UK housebuilders Barrett and Redrow had a good day, though, after reassuring the City with their latest results. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Barratt Developments and Redrow revealed solid first-half numbers today. Barratt\u2019s saw revenue and profit before tax rise by 7.2% and 19.1% respectively. The net cash position increased by 133%, and operating margin improved by 130 basis points to 19.2%. It is impressive that margins improved in an environment of higher wages and material costs. Barratt\u2019s confirmed that forward sales increased by 7.3%, and the full-year outlook remains in line with the board\u2019s expectations. Redrow also put in a solid performance in the first-six months. Pre-tax profit for the six-month period jumped to record levels, and group revenue ticked up by 9%. Legal completions rose by 12%, and the order book ticked up by 11%. Some investors are cautious of the UK property market due to cooling prices and uncertainty surrounding Brexit, but Redrow and Barratt Developments have shown the market the industry is still strong. Over on Wall Street, the Dow has dipped by 40 points in quiet trading to 25,371 points. Two gaming companies are having a bad day. Take-Two Interactive Software has plunged 14% after the maker of Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption 2 posted results which weren\u2019t as strong as analysts hoped. Electronics Arts is also tanking, down 16%, after missing forecasts last night. Some analysts wonder if the phenomenal success of Fortnite is hurting the rest of the industry.... Ratings agency S&amp;P has warned that the UK\u2019s credit rating will come under pressure if it leaves the European Union without a deal next month. In a new report, S&amp;P says it still expects an orderly exit, as this is in the best interests of the UK and the EU. But it warns that the risk of a no-deal Brexit remains high. And it could downgrade some British companies, if a no-deal Brexit leads to \u201cimmediate and material\u201d disruption. S&amp;P Global Ratings credit analyst Paul Watters says: \u201cIn the case of no deal, where short-term disruption proves to be material enough to undermine competitiveness and operational performance, then downgrades could occur, particularly for certain non-financial corporates.\u201d S&amp;P currently gives the UK a \u201cAA\u201d credit rating, which is the third-highest notch, with a negative outlook. S&amp;P says \u201cdownward pressure\u201d could build on this sovereign rating, if a \u201cdisorderly\u201d Brexit appears more apparent, adding: Our current negative outlook on the \u2018AA\u2019 sovereign rating on the U.K. reflects our view of the risk of sustained economic weakness and a deterioration in government finances if merchandise and services exports from the U.K. lose access to key European markets, external financing diminishes, or sterling\u2019s status as a reserve currency comes under pressure. Downward pressure could build on the ratings under a scenario where the likelihood of a \u201cdisorderly\u201d Brexit appears more apparent. We define a \u201cdisorderly\u201d Brexit as one that would either significantly limit U.K. manufacturing and services access to key European markets or subject them to tariffs and nontariff barriers high enough to reduce their ability to compete. S&amp;P says that \u201cthe detrimental effects of no-deal on the banking system\u201d could result in negative rating actions on U.K. banks. It estimate that around 20 companies, mainly based in the UK, could be face a \u201cnegative rating action\u201d such as a downgrade, if Britain crashes out without a deal. It adds: The most exposed sectors are automotive, leisure, retail, real estate, aerospace and defence, and transport infrastructure. In other trade news, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has announced that he will travel to Beijing next week to resume negotiations with China. Mnuchin will be accompanied by United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and other officials. It\u2019s a new attempt to reach a breakthrough before March - the deadline before the US hikes tariffs on Chinese imports. Mnuchin told CNBC that Washington was committed to seeking a deal. \u201cAmbassador Lighthizer and myself and a large team are on our way to Beijing next week. We are committed to continue these talks. We\u2019re putting in an enormous amount of effort to try to hit this deadline and get a deal. So that\u2019s our objective.\u201d Well, quite.... This narrowing of the US trade gap is a win for Donald Trump, argues CNBC: I\u2019m not quite convinced. It would be better if the gap was narrowing thanks to a jump in exports, rather than a shrivelling of imports. But Trump, with his mercantilist view of trade, may disagree. Newsflash: America\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world has narrowed, due to a big drop in imports. The gap between imports and exports narrowed to $49.3bn in November, the Census Bureau reports, down from $55.7bn in October. That\u2019s a smaller deficit than economists had expected. Imports shrank by 2.9%, mainly due to fewer mobile phones and less petroleum being imported (the US has just become a net exporter of oil, following the shale boom). No early fireworks expected on Wall Street today: It\u2019s been a rather underwhelming day in the markets. The FTSE 100 is now flat, while Germany\u2019s DAX has shed 0.5%. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, suspects a sell-off could be looming. Stocks in Asia witnessed another muted session today as many markets in the region remain closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. In Europe, shares got out of the wrong side of the bed thanks to weak earnings from French banking group BNP Paribas and disappointing data from Germany. While Wall Street has the potential to extend gains this afternoon on strong corporate earnings and cautious optimism over US-China trade talks, the medium- to longer-term outlook for equity markets tilts to the downside. Concerns over slowing global growth remains a dominant theme while the unpredictable nature of trade negotiations has certainly left investors on edge. With other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, China\u2019s slowdown, Eurozone growth concerns and political turbulence in Washington seen stimulating risk aversion, the ingredients are in place for a stock market sell-off. It\u2019s worth noting that the recent rally has coincided with a pick-up in the amount of money sloshing around in the markets, as central bankers have pumped up liquidity. Bloomberg has a good take here. The eurozone slowdown comes at a tricky time for the European Central Bank. The ECB only just ended its stimulus programme of buying bonds with newly-created money, and has suggested it could start raising interest rates from their current record lows this summer. Some economists are now wondering if the ECB might be forced to offer more cheap long term loans for banks (through its TLTRO programme) in the next few months. Emerging stock markets have made a good start to 2019; Brazil is up over 10%, Mexico has gained 6.5% and China is 5% higher. That\u2019s due to a pick-up in risk appetite after last autumn\u2019s sell-off. Signs that central bankers are turning more dovish has also boosted shares. But has the rally gone too far? Morgan Stanley suspects a correction is coming.... Overnight, tech giant Apple revealed that its retail boss - Angela Ahrendts - is leaving. Ahrendts was recruited (at no small expense!) from luxury fashion chain Burberry. She played a key role over the last few years as Apple turned itself into a trillion dollar company last year, while earning twice as much as CEO Tim Cook himself. My colleague Alex Hern says it\u2019s a \u201crare loss of talent\u201d for Apple. Ahrendts\u2019 replacement, Deirdre O\u2019Brien, has a more typically Apple history: she joined the company 30 years ago and is already the vice-president of the people department at the company. The Apple retail arm, which covers its online and brick-and-mortar stores, has been a jewel in the crown throughout the period, with Ahrendts a regular fixture at press conferences to share successes such as new flagship locations, popular live events and free tutorials for new buyers. Here\u2019s his full take: Recent German manufacturing data do not paint a pretty picture: Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has now weighed in on this morning\u2019s dire German factory orders. He says the 1.6% month-on-month decline was a \u201cnasty headline\u201d, adding: \u201cAcross sectors, weakness in capital and intermediate goods were the primary drivers, especially on the export side to non-eurozone countries. By contrast, new orders for consumer goods rebounded strongly across the board, pointing to a revival in the auto sector towards the end of the year. \u201cThe year-over-year rate was depressed by base effects from a very strong finish to the year in 2017, but the message remains clear: German manufacturing is suffering.\u201d Europe\u2019s competition authorities have just derailed a massive planned merger between trainmakers Alstom and Siemens, triggering a massive political row. Antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager has ruled that allowing France\u2019s Alstom and Germany\u2019s Siemens to combine would have created a near monopoly in the European train-making market. This, she fears, would have hampered competition and driven prices up, so she\u2019s pulled the emergency cord and brought the deal to a sudden halt. Announcing the decision, Vestager says: \u201cThe Commission prohibited the merger because the companies were not willing to address our serious competition concerns.\u201d Alstrom makes trains for France\u2019s high-speed TGV service, while Siemens ICE-4 ,models are used on Germany\u2019s own high-speed network. The two companies had hoped to create a new European powerhouse that could have competed better on the world stage against rivals such as China\u2019s CRRC. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has alreay blasted the move, claiming it was a serious political and economic mistake, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s going to serve China\u2019s economic and industrial interests.\u201d If so, this won\u2019t make Vestager may new friends in Brussels.... Ocado\u2019s shares have now slumped by 7.5% since it warned that the fire at its Andover distribution centre was worse than first feared. That wipes more than \u00a3500m off the value of the company, leaving it firmly stranded at the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Here\u2019s our news story about the fire, and the disruption it will cause: As these photos show, firefighters are still attending the scene in Hampshire today: German carmaker Daimler has reported that net profits almost halved in the last quarter of 2017, as the diesel crisis hurt demand. Daimler\u2019s earnings were scraped by the cost of developing new, greener, technologies for electric vehicles. The US-China trade war also hurt profitability, as it meant higher tariffs on some cars manufactured at Chinese or American factories. Although revenues rose 7%, net earnings fell 49% to \u20ac1.64bn, in another sign that German companies found 2018 tough going. Associated Press has more details: \u201cFor Daimler, 2018 was a year of strong headwinds,\u201d said CEO Dieter Zetsche, presenting his last annual results before handing off to successor Ola Kallenius at the May 21 shareholder meeting. He said that \u201cwe cannot and will not be satisfied\u201d with lower profit margins. He added that the company was coming up with plans to increase profitability though declined to indicate what steps might be taken. More reaction to today\u2019s German data: Britain\u2019s watchdogs have been showing their teeth this morning. The Advertising Standards Authority\u2019s (ASA) has banned gambling ads that ran in ITV\u2019s I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here app for breaking rules designed to protect children from being encouraged to bet. Here\u2019s our news story about the crackdown on travel sites who use unscrupulous tactics to scare people into making holiday bookings: One common trick, apparently, is to tell you that X customers are also looking at the same hotel - without revealing that they\u2019re actually looking at different days! #scoundrels More bad news from Germany -- growth across its building sector almost fizzled out last month. Data firm Markit says its German construction PMI (which measures activity across the sector) fell to just 50.7, down from 53.3 in December. That\u2019s worryingly close to stagnation (50.0). Markit says construction firms were hit by bad weather in January, which made it harder for builders to crack on. Commercial construction activity fell at the fastest rate in almost six years, while house-building increased at a much slower rate than in December. Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, says the PMI data shows slower growth across a number of key business metrics. Winter storms, snow and ice are probably the main culprits, he adds. The fact that growth in total industry activity slowed down more than new orders, which remained comparatively robust, suggests that it wasn\u2019t necessarily a demand-driven slowdown and that severe bad weather probably did cause some disruption to actual work on the ground during the opening month of the year. European stock markets have opened in the red, after this morning\u2019s woeful German factory orders. In Frankfurt, the DAX index of Germany\u2019s top companies has lost 0.3%, with Daimler down almost 2% and Deutsche Bank down 1.5%. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped by 18 points (0.3% to 7,158, away from last night\u2019s three-month low. Online grocery firm Ocado is leading the fallers, down 5%, after a huge fire swept through its robotic warehouse in Hampshire. Ocado has just told shareholders that the damage is wore than first thought: Unfortunately the fire which started yesterday morning in a corner of the ambient grid was not contained as we believed, and last night expanded. Whilst we are informed by the Fire Brigade that it is now under control, during the night part of the roof collapsed and there has been substantial damage to the majority of the building and its contents. Today\u2019s grim factory orders data come just hours after Deutsche Bank warned that Germany is probably heading for recession. In a new report, Deutsche economists wrote: \u201cThe start of the German economy into 2019 has been a major disappointment so far. \u201cThe development of several key cyclical indicators is telling us that the German economy is drifting towards recession right now.\u201d They could point to a drop in German industrial output late last year, and a smaller-than-expected drop in unemployment in January. German factory orders \u201ctook a nosedive\u201d in December, says economist Carsten Brzeski of ING ruefully, adding: The inventory build-up in recent months, as well as the recent drops in order books, suggest that any rebound of industrial activity in Germany will be slow and sluggish. Germany\u2019s economy ministry doesn\u2019t see much cheer in today\u2019s factory orders, saying: \u201cThe decline in orders in December suggests that the weak phase in industry will continue for now. The latest sentiment indicators also point to muted momentum at the start of the year.\u201d The decline in German factory orders was mainly due to weaker demand for abroad. Orders from outside the eurozone plunged by 5.5% month-on-month in December, while domestic orders dipped by 0.6%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Concerns over the health of the German economy are mounting this morning, after Europe\u2019s largest economy suffered another big fall in manufacturing orders. Germany factory orders plunged by 1.6% in December, new figures released this morning show, due to weak demand from overseas. That\u2019s much worse than the 0.3% rise which economists had expected, and follows a 0.2% decline in November. On an annual basis, orders were a chunky 7% lower than in December 2017. That looks to be the biggest drop since 2012. Such a weak result shows that Germany\u2019s industrial base is struggling in the face of trade tensions, slowing global growth, and Brexit anxiety. Germany\u2019s car industry has also had a bad few months. They\u2019ve struggled to get models tested and onto the road following the introduction of new, tougher, pollution rules. We already know that German GDP shrank by 0.2% in July to September; some economists fear its economy may have kept shrinking, putting the country into recession. More reaction to follow.... Also coming up today European stock markets are tipped to open flat, after a strong rally on Tuesday that saw the FTSE 100 jump by 2% to a new three-month high. Britain\u2019s Competitions and Markets Authority is enforcing a clampdown on some of the biggest online hotel booking sites - calling it \u201ca victory for UK holidaymakers\u201d. More on that shortly. Struggling outsourcing group Interserve has announced a whopping debt-for-equity swap rescue deal. Plus we should get new US trade figures, and the weekly oil inventory stats, which should give another insight into the state of America\u2019s economy The agenda 1.30pm GMT: US trade figure for November 3.30pm GMT: US weekly oil inventory figures",

However, in the FAQs, he outlines that disciplinary boards are entirely appointed by himself, with the exception of two student union sabbatical officers. The power always lay in his hands. What\u2019s more, Peter Dunn, Warwick\u2019s press officer, was <a href=\"https://thetab.com/uk/warwick/2019/02/01/group-chat-victim-reveals-warwick-director-of-press-investigated-the-case-33829\" title=\"\">overseeing the process</a>.

But what about the duty of care to the women who were vilified? One of the women named in the chat group told me \u201ca few of the boys have lawyers\u201d, and that one threatened to sue those who went to the press. It seems the university feared the same. If Warwick has a zero-tolerance policy to sexual violence as it claims, a genuine commitment to this would have been to expel the men, and if legal action proceeded, then surely Croft wouldn\u2019t have minded the expense coming out of his <a href=\"https://theboar.org/2016/02/stuart-croft-new-warwick-vice-chancellor-pay/\" title=\"\">bulbous pay packet</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/07/universities-take-steps-to-combat-culture-of-sexual-violence\">Fearless Edinburgh: students tackle issue of sexual violence head-on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After splashing out <a href=\"https://thetab.com/uk/warwick/2017/02/23/cost-wbs-base-shard-will-cost-11-million-ten-years-20940\" title=\"\">\u00a311m </a> on Warwick Business School\u2019s London base at The Shard, and a \u00a330m redevelopment of its existing building alongside many other multimillion pound projects, it seems that profit margins have higher priority than student wellbeing.

The neoliberal university sells students the notion of belonging, that they will be safe and happy with a wealth of support. But <a href=\"https://theboar.org/2017/02/boars-mental-health-survey-counselling/\" title=\"\">oversubscribed, underfunded services</a> leave students high and dry when they need them most, and management acts as if removing students who pose a genuine risk is something they can\u2019t do anything about, despite plagiarism being an expellable offence.</p> <p>The inference in Croft\u2019s statement announcing the two students would not be returning is that it followed last week\u2019s media storm. It shouldn\u2019t have come to this. These men aren\u2019t returning only due to the collective bravery of the women who spoke out, not because of the university\u2019s actions.</p> <p>I wonder if recent events will be enough for Warwick to realise that appointing a sexual violence adviser barely scratches the surface of a very real, omnipresent threat. Acting in the interests of students, who pay tens of thousands of pounds in fees, shouldn\u2019t be retrospective, it must be proactive. The willingness to readmit students who sent such abhorrent messages and demonstrated no remorse makes Warwick complicit in perpetuating the rape culture alive and well on university campuses across the country, not just their own. I can only hope this will lead to meaningful change at Warwick and won\u2019t be forgotten as just another unsavoury scandal, consigned to the past.</p> <p>\u2022 Eloise Millard is a journalist and film-maker, focusing on poverty and inequality</p>",

However, in the FAQs, he outlines that disciplinary boards are entirely appointed by himself, with the exception of two student union sabbatical officers. The power always lay in his hands. What\u2019s more, Peter Dunn, Warwick\u2019s press officer, was overseeing the process. This feels more like an exercise in damage limitation rather than acting in the interests of the victims. Croft stressed there was a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d legal action would be taken and that Warwick has a \u201cduty of care\u201d to the perpetrators. But what about the duty of care to the women who were vilified? One of the women named in the chat group told me \u201ca few of the boys have lawyers\u201d, and that one threatened to sue those who went to the press. It seems the university feared the same. If Warwick has a zero-tolerance policy to sexual violence as it claims, a genuine commitment to this would have been to expel the men, and if legal action proceeded, then surely Croft wouldn\u2019t have minded the expense coming out of his bulbous pay packet. After splashing out \u00a311m on Warwick Business School\u2019s London base at The Shard, and a \u00a330m redevelopment of its existing building alongside many other multimillion pound projects, it seems that profit margins have higher priority than student wellbeing. Students have been outspoken about the absence of basic facilities, such as a lack of accommodation and insufficient seating in the library. Warwick has always had its sights set on commercial success, as laid out by noted historian EP Thompson in his book Warwick University Ltd, written only a few years after the campus opened. The neoliberal university sells students the notion of belonging, that they will be safe and happy with a wealth of support. But oversubscribed, underfunded services leave students high and dry when they need them most, and management acts as if removing students who pose a genuine risk is something they can\u2019t do anything about, despite plagiarism being an expellable offence. The inference in Croft\u2019s statement announcing the two students would not be returning is that it followed last week\u2019s media storm. It shouldn\u2019t have come to this. These men aren\u2019t returning only due to the collective bravery of the women who spoke out, not because of the university\u2019s actions. I wonder if recent events will be enough for Warwick to realise that appointing a sexual violence adviser barely scratches the surface of a very real, omnipresent threat. Acting in the interests of students, who pay tens of thousands of pounds in fees, shouldn\u2019t be retrospective, it must be proactive. The willingness to readmit students who sent such abhorrent messages and demonstrated no remorse makes Warwick complicit in perpetuating the rape culture alive and well on university campuses across the country, not just their own. I can only hope this will lead to meaningful change at Warwick and won\u2019t be forgotten as just another unsavoury scandal, consigned to the past. \u2022 Eloise Millard is a journalist and film-maker, focusing on poverty and inequality",

      "body": "<p>\u2018So how did you prepare for the role?\u2019 It is one of the softest questions in film reporting, but the world got much more than it bargained for when Liam Neeson admitted to the Independent that, nearly 40 years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/04/liam-neeson-after-a-friend-was-raped-i-wanted-to-kill-a-black-man\">he had planned to avenge a friend who had been raped</a> by going into black-populated areas of the city he was in, armed with a cosh, \u201choping some \u2018black bastard\u2019 would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him.\u201d Luckily nothing came of it, and after a week or so, Neeson said, he thought to himself: \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d His publicists doubtless thought the same.</p> <p>There is so much to process about Neeson\u2019s admission. Should we condemn his racism or applaud his honesty? Would he really have gone through with it? Has he spent so long playing these middle-aged avenger roles that he can no longer distinguish between fact and fiction? And, as a secondary consideration, will Neeson\u2019s career survive this?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/04/liam-neeson-after-a-friend-was-raped-i-wanted-to-kill-a-black-man\">Liam Neeson: after a friend was raped, I wanted to kill a black man</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starting with the racism question. Nobody who goes out wanting to kill a stranger based solely on the colour of their skin can deny they\u2019re racist. Or at least that they <em>were</em> racist. In the initial interview, Neeson said his first questions to the friend who survived the rape were \u201cDid she know who it was?\u201d and \u201cWhat colour were they?\u201d </p> <p>Neeson later clarified <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/05/liam-neeson-says-he-is-not-a-racist-in-wake-of-rape-comments\">in a Good Morning America interview</a> that he had asked more questions, and that he would have had the same reaction whatever the rapist\u2019s ethnicity. \u201cIf she\u2019d said an Irish or a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian, I know it would have had the same effect.\u201d How important is that distinction? Is it more reassuring to know that Neeson was an equal-opportunities entitled bigot?</p> <p>As an actor, Neeson\u2019s attitudes towards race and justice are uncontroversially positive in many aspects. His last high-profile movie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/10/widows-review-steve-mcqueen-viola-davis-london-film-festival\">Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows</a>, began with a quietly radical shot of Neeson in bed with black actor Viola Davis. \u201cHe\u2019s not my slave owner. I\u2019m not a prostitute. It\u2019s not trying to make any social or political statements. We\u2019re simply a couple in love,\u201d as Davis put it. Neeson\u2019s velvety growl and calm gravitas have marked him out for roles requiring nobility, from the Jew-saving Oskar Schindler in Steven Spielberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/schindler-s-list\">Schindler\u2019s List,</a> to goodly Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/may/27/starwars\">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</a> to God-surrogate Aslan the lion in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chronicles-of-narnia\">Narnia movies</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71b6a81cbb9f3a382b96a7e32856d861fe104f2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71b6a81cbb9f3a382b96a7e32856d861fe104f2c/0_209_5730_3439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neeson in Schindler\u2019s List.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neeson in Schindler\u2019s List.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then again, there are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/07/taken\">Taken</a> movies, which often operate on the level of casual xenophobia and violent extra-judicial revenge. In the first Taken, Neeson\u2019s daughter is abducted by Albanian sex traffickers, who attempt to auction her to Arab clients. In its sequel, he takes on the Albanians in lawless Istanbul. Time and again in his late career, Neeson has indulged these uncomplicated action fantasies, in the tradition of Charles Bronson\u2019s Death Wish or Dirty Harry or 24. The movie he was promoting, Cold Pursuit, is another one: he plays a snowplough driver single-handedly picking off the killers of his son.</p> <p>Neeson characterised his real-life revenge impulse as a product of growing up in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and 70s, where violent sectarian revenge was part of many people\u2019s existence. He spoke of having friends who were caught up in the Troubles, who died on hunger strike. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/feb/26/non-stop-liam-neeson-julianne-moore-video-interview\">told the Guardian in 2014</a> that he had experienced a form of racial profiling himself: as an Irishman he was regularly pulled aside on flights to Britain in the 1970s. His later life was also marked by personal tragedy: his wife and mother of his two children, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/dec/13/natasha-richardson-ralph-fiennes-obituary\">Natasha Richardson, died in a skiing accident in 2009, aged 45</a>.</p> <p>Just as Neeson\u2019s character in Taken announces to his enemies that he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/06/taken-3-review-a-very-exhausted-set-of-skills\">\u201ca very particular set of skills\u201d acquired over a very long career</a>, so this combination of public loss, statesmanlike gravitas and rugged action persona has made Neeson a unique public figure \u2013 one who is unafraid to deviate from the interview script and say something shockingly honest.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t have to make those comments.

      "bodyText": "\u2018So how did you prepare for the role?\u2019 It is one of the softest questions in film reporting, but the world got much more than it bargained for when Liam Neeson admitted to the Independent that, nearly 40 years ago, he had planned to avenge a friend who had been raped by going into black-populated areas of the city he was in, armed with a cosh, \u201choping some \u2018black bastard\u2019 would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him.\u201d Luckily nothing came of it, and after a week or so, Neeson said, he thought to himself: \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d His publicists doubtless thought the same. There is so much to process about Neeson\u2019s admission. Should we condemn his racism or applaud his honesty? Would he really have gone through with it? Has he spent so long playing these middle-aged avenger roles that he can no longer distinguish between fact and fiction? And, as a secondary consideration, will Neeson\u2019s career survive this? Starting with the racism question. Nobody who goes out wanting to kill a stranger based solely on the colour of their skin can deny they\u2019re racist. Or at least that they were racist. In the initial interview, Neeson said his first questions to the friend who survived the rape were \u201cDid she know who it was?\u201d and \u201cWhat colour were they?\u201d Neeson later clarified in a Good Morning America interview that he had asked more questions, and that he would have had the same reaction whatever the rapist\u2019s ethnicity. \u201cIf she\u2019d said an Irish or a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian, I know it would have had the same effect.\u201d How important is that distinction? Is it more reassuring to know that Neeson was an equal-opportunities entitled bigot? As an actor, Neeson\u2019s attitudes towards race and justice are uncontroversially positive in many aspects. His last high-profile movie, Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows, began with a quietly radical shot of Neeson in bed with black actor Viola Davis. \u201cHe\u2019s not my slave owner. I\u2019m not a prostitute. It\u2019s not trying to make any social or political statements. We\u2019re simply a couple in love,\u201d as Davis put it. Neeson\u2019s velvety growl and calm gravitas have marked him out for roles requiring nobility, from the Jew-saving Oskar Schindler in Steven Spielberg\u2019s Schindler\u2019s List, to goodly Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace to God-surrogate Aslan the lion in the Narnia movies. Then again, there are the Taken movies, which often operate on the level of casual xenophobia and violent extra-judicial revenge. In the first Taken, Neeson\u2019s daughter is abducted by Albanian sex traffickers, who attempt to auction her to Arab clients. In its sequel, he takes on the Albanians in lawless Istanbul. Time and again in his late career, Neeson has indulged these uncomplicated action fantasies, in the tradition of Charles Bronson\u2019s Death Wish or Dirty Harry or 24. The movie he was promoting, Cold Pursuit, is another one: he plays a snowplough driver single-handedly picking off the killers of his son. Neeson characterised his real-life revenge impulse as a product of growing up in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and 70s, where violent sectarian revenge was part of many people\u2019s existence. He spoke of having friends who were caught up in the Troubles, who died on hunger strike. He told the Guardian in 2014 that he had experienced a form of racial profiling himself: as an Irishman he was regularly pulled aside on flights to Britain in the 1970s. His later life was also marked by personal tragedy: his wife and mother of his two children, Natasha Richardson, died in a skiing accident in 2009, aged 45. Just as Neeson\u2019s character in Taken announces to his enemies that he has \u201ca very particular set of skills\u201d acquired over a very long career, so this combination of public loss, statesmanlike gravitas and rugged action persona has made Neeson a unique public figure \u2013 one who is unafraid to deviate from the interview script and say something shockingly honest. He didn\u2019t have to make those comments. Nobody would have known about this had he not volunteered the information, and his existence would be a lot more comfortable now. He is clearly a person who has examined his conscience. He revealed he also talked to a priest after his abortive revenge mission. Perhaps talking to the press was an extension of the confession process. Or did Neeson make a calculation that his reputation would survive this? In industry terms, there is little doubt that it will. Many middle-aged actors have attempted to emulate Neeson\u2019s latter-day action hero formula but he is the brand original. The movies are barely distinguishable and often preposterous. In The Grey, for example, he battles a wolf with pieces of broken bottle taped to his hands like claws. And they often turn a tidy profit: the three Taken movies alone have generated almost $1bn in worldwide box office. It was only a year ago Neeson was widely criticised for describing investigations of past sexual harassment in Hollywood as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. Neeson\u2019s fans are unlikely to turn against him now, and the industry certainly isn\u2019t. The point Neeson was trying to make with his comments \u2013 which understandably got lost in the mayhem \u2013 is that life is not like the movies. Revenge is not a solution to anything in the real world, and the movies he makes do a better job of providing that cathartic release. On a societal level, we can be pretty certain there are countless people, especially white men, who once thought like Neeson, and countless more who still do now. Particularly in the US, the current climate has created conditions where bigotry can be expressed openly, in the form of torch-carrying marches through Charlottesville, or anonymously, in online hate sites and chatrooms. As well as expressing hateful opinions, it has also become more permissible to act on them. \u201cWe all pretend we\u2019re kind of politically correct,\u201d Neeson told Good Morning America presenter Robin Roberts. \u201cSometimes you just scratch the surface and you discover this racism and bigotry.\u201d Neeson\u2019s crime was to drop the pretence.

(I am treading extra carefully here so as not to give away any spoilers.) But what makes Abducted in Plain Sight so fascinating is that it exemplifies, at times to a gothic extent, a question that comes up again and again in stories about child abuse: how could people have missed what was happening right in front of them?</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230558737_Child_Abuse_and_Neglect_in_the_UK_Today\" title=\"\">2011 study</a> found that the most common perpetrator of sexual violence against children is a man or teenage boy known to the family, and the most common location where abuse happens is in the child\u2019s home. \u201cThere is a culture of disbelief around abuse, and a still lingering idea that it\u2019s only strange men in dirty macs who do it,\u201d says Professor Lorraine Radford of the University of Central Lancashire, who co-authored the study. \u201cBut what we found is the person is often known to the parents, and he groomed them to believe he\u2019s the fun, lovely, family friend or relative.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In sport, the abuser  convinces the family and the child that they\u2019re privileged to be getting special treatment</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Daniel Wilcox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Larry Nassar scandal exemplified this on a horrifyingly large scale. Nassar, the widely revered doctor for the USA gymnastics team, was found guilty last year of being one of the most prolific sexual abusers in sporting history. For decades, he had molested girls and young women during medical appointments, sometimes with their parents in the room; he would just put a blanket over the girl\u2019s legs and chat to the mother while he molested the daughter. The mother of one victim, Chloe Myers, later recalled wondering why Nassar needed to wash his hands afterwards if he had just been feeling Chloe\u2019s leg, and why he hadn\u2019t worn gloves if he had done an internal exam. But, she told herself, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/how-did-larry-nassar-deceive-so-many-for-so-long.html\" title=\"\">\u201cthis was Larry. So it was no surprise that he was trying some kind of alternative treatment\u201d.</a> Kyle Stephens, who Nassar began molesting when she was six, said at his trial that her father refused to believe her when she told him what was happening. When Nassar\u2019s abuse was finally confirmed, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-gymnastics-usa-nassar/victim-of-ex-usa-gymnastics-doctor-says-abuse-led-to-dads-suicide-idUKKBN1F52NP\" title=\"\">her father killed himself</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at abuse in sport, the likelihood is the abuser has convinced the family and the child that they\u2019re privileged to be seeing that coach, and they\u2019re getting special treatment,\u201d says Professor Daniel Wilcox, a forensic clinical psychologist. \u201cI\u2019ve seen abusers operate in plain sight, such as the head of gymnastics at one place who would have the girls bend over and he would \u2018straighten their costumes\u2019, right in front of the parents.\u201d</p> <p>High-profile abuse cases \u2013 such as the Jerry Sandusky scandal in the US in which a college football coach was convicted in 2012 of multiple counts of child abuse, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/16/andy-woodward\" title=\"\">sex abuse in UK football clubs</a> exposed by the Guardian \u2013 prove time and again that families are not the only ones who are blinkered to blatant sex abuse. As one former gymnast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/26/larry-nassar-abuse-gymnasts-scandal-culture\" title=\"\">told me</a> when I wrote about the Nassar case: \u201c[Gymnastics] didn\u2019t want to risk the piles of Olympic medals.\u201d So they turned a blind eye.</p> <p>When the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal finally broke open in 2012, the general feeling was that something like this would, and could, never happen again. Savile had been notoriously blatant about his predilections: \u201cNobody knows whether I am or not [a paedophile],\u201d he said in Louis Theroux\u2019s 2000 profile of him. And yet no one did anything. (Theroux later made another Savile documentary, after he died, about how he, too, had missed the obvious.) When it was finally confirmed after Savile\u2019s death that he had been a prolific sex abuser, the public reaction generally ran along the line of \u201cno surprise there\u201d. But why didn\u2019t any of us speak up when he was alive? It was a different time; never again will people be able to ignore the signs that something is wrong.</p> <p>And yet we do. Michael Jackson\u2019s shady relationships with children were hardly a secret: in 1994 he had paid the Chandler family $23m after the father accused him of abusing his 13-year-old son, Jordy, and multiple allegations from other families soon followed. Jackson was found not guilty in a 2005 criminal trial. His reputation was tarnished, yet he was still hailed as one of the icons of the 20th century when he died. Sure, we knew he was a bit dodgy, but a lot of us still wanted to dance to Wanna Be Startin\u2019 Something. And hey, nothing was ever confirmed, right? (People who knew Berchtold entertained a similar kind of queasy dual mentality: an FBI agent who investigated the original case talks in the documentary about how Berchtold was seen locally as \u201ca pillar of the community\u201d but was also known \u201cto have an infatuation with young girls\u201d.) So, at Sundance last month, when the documentary Leaving Neverland premiered, with its details of how Wade Robson and James Safechuck were abused by Jackson for years, there was a genuine feeling of global shame. Jackson was a child abuser? Many had suspected this for years \u2013 yet, somehow, we had also put it to one side. Numerous cases, which have also blown up in the wake of #MeToo, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/jan/31/r-kelly-michael-jackson-and-bryan-singer-who-knew-everyone\" title=\"\">provoked similar reckonings</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7f36f700fcc6a63619283f7b94d6028b447b3d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7f36f700fcc6a63619283f7b94d6028b447b3d3/193_0_2689_1614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abducted In Plain Sight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jan Broberg today, in a still from Abducted in Plain Sight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Top Knot Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abusers groom their victims and those around them. The truly remarkable thing about Jackson is he managed to groom the whole world by convincing everyone he was merely an innocent weirdo. Sure, this adult man might have young boys sleeping in his bed, but he wasn\u2019t an abuser \u2013 good heavens, no! He was simply a real-life Peter Pan, a Willy Wonka, a Pied Piper. And, amazingly, the public bought that, even as Jackson, looking increasingly creepy, was photographed with an ever-rotating parade of little boys by his side. Starstruck parents were too dazzled by his celebrity to think twice about packing their sons off for sleepovers, and those around him decided he was too lucrative to be stopped. Often powerful alleged sexual predators are only finally exposed when their stars start to wane, or they are dead, and they are no longer worth protecting.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Often the abuser makes them believe they\u2019re complicit, or that something terrible will happen if they speak</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Daniel Wilcox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Celebrity cases are really just macro versions of more common micro stories such as Jan Broberg\u2019s. While Berchtold was not a celebrity, he was, as one of Jan\u2019s sisters puts it, \u201cthe fun dad\u201d, someone their parents liked, and so the kids wanted to please him. Abducted in Plain Sight may be the first Netflix documentary that is not long enough. Instead of being five to 10 hours, as now seems standard on the streaming platform, it comes in at a nippy 90 minutes, and not enough time is spent on the Brobergs\u2019 Mormonism. Robert Broberg recalls at one point: \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure even then what a child molester was.\u201d</p> <p>But it is not only Mormon parents who are deceived in this way, and sometimes it is easier for a parent to think that their child is simply confused rather than acknowledge that they placed them in danger\u2019s way. As one of Jan\u2019s sisters says: \u201cI don\u2019t think my parents wanted [to think about Jan being raped] and this is why they didn\u2019t probe more when they knew something had happened. It\u2019s too painful for them to realise that they allowed this to happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOften children won\u2019t speak up because their abuser has turned their thinking into believing they\u2019re complicit, or something terrible will happen if they speak, which is another complication for families,\u201d says Wilcox. Berchtold certainly did that with Jan. When she \u2013 after years and years of abuse \u2013 finally tells her parents the story Berchtold told her to ensure her silence, her mother marvels: \u201cDoes she really believe this?\u201d Yet her mother had believed a story at least as fantastical as the one Berchtold told her daughter, insistently overlooking behaviour that was clearly not normal.</p> <p>\u201cHe was just a master manipulator,\u201d Jan concludes about her abuser. But he was and he wasn\u2019t. It is true that Berchtold convinced the Brobergs to not trust their instinct. But he \u2013 like so many abusers \u2013 didn\u2019t have to do anything to hide his crimes. He committed them in plain sight.</p>",

Clearly, in cases of child molestation and abduction, the condemnation should be focused on the perpetrator, not the family, and in the specific case of the Brobergs, they were victims, too. (I am treading extra carefully here so as not to give away any spoilers.) But what makes Abducted in Plain Sight so fascinating is that it exemplifies, at times to a gothic extent, a question that comes up again and again in stories about child abuse: how could people have missed what was happening right in front of them? A 2011 study found that the most common perpetrator of sexual violence against children is a man or teenage boy known to the family, and the most common location where abuse happens is in the child\u2019s home. \u201cThere is a culture of disbelief around abuse, and a still lingering idea that it\u2019s only strange men in dirty macs who do it,\u201d says Professor Lorraine Radford of the University of Central Lancashire, who co-authored the study. \u201cBut what we found is the person is often known to the parents, and he groomed them to believe he\u2019s the fun, lovely, family friend or relative.\u201d The Larry Nassar scandal exemplified this on a horrifyingly large scale. Nassar, the widely revered doctor for the USA gymnastics team, was found guilty last year of being one of the most prolific sexual abusers in sporting history. For decades, he had molested girls and young women during medical appointments, sometimes with their parents in the room; he would just put a blanket over the girl\u2019s legs and chat to the mother while he molested the daughter. The mother of one victim, Chloe Myers, later recalled wondering why Nassar needed to wash his hands afterwards if he had just been feeling Chloe\u2019s leg, and why he hadn\u2019t worn gloves if he had done an internal exam. But, she told herself, \u201cthis was Larry. So it was no surprise that he was trying some kind of alternative treatment\u201d. Kyle Stephens, who Nassar began molesting when she was six, said at his trial that her father refused to believe her when she told him what was happening. When Nassar\u2019s abuse was finally confirmed, her father killed himself. \u201cIf you look at abuse in sport, the likelihood is the abuser has convinced the family and the child that they\u2019re privileged to be seeing that coach, and they\u2019re getting special treatment,\u201d says Professor Daniel Wilcox, a forensic clinical psychologist. \u201cI\u2019ve seen abusers operate in plain sight, such as the head of gymnastics at one place who would have the girls bend over and he would \u2018straighten their costumes\u2019, right in front of the parents.\u201d High-profile abuse cases \u2013 such as the Jerry Sandusky scandal in the US in which a college football coach was convicted in 2012 of multiple counts of child abuse, and the sex abuse in UK football clubs exposed by the Guardian \u2013 prove time and again that families are not the only ones who are blinkered to blatant sex abuse. As one former gymnast told me when I wrote about the Nassar case: \u201c[Gymnastics] didn\u2019t want to risk the piles of Olympic medals.\u201d So they turned a blind eye. When the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal finally broke open in 2012, the general feeling was that something like this would, and could, never happen again. Savile had been notoriously blatant about his predilections: \u201cNobody knows whether I am or not [a paedophile],\u201d he said in Louis Theroux\u2019s 2000 profile of him. And yet no one did anything. (Theroux later made another Savile documentary, after he died, about how he, too, had missed the obvious.) When it was finally confirmed after Savile\u2019s death that he had been a prolific sex abuser, the public reaction generally ran along the line of \u201cno surprise there\u201d. But why didn\u2019t any of us speak up when he was alive? It was a different time; never again will people be able to ignore the signs that something is wrong. And yet we do. Michael Jackson\u2019s shady relationships with children were hardly a secret: in 1994 he had paid the Chandler family $23m after the father accused him of abusing his 13-year-old son, Jordy, and multiple allegations from other families soon followed. Jackson was found not guilty in a 2005 criminal trial. His reputation was tarnished, yet he was still hailed as one of the icons of the 20th century when he died. Sure, we knew he was a bit dodgy, but a lot of us still wanted to dance to Wanna Be Startin\u2019 Something. And hey, nothing was ever confirmed, right? (People who knew Berchtold entertained a similar kind of queasy dual mentality: an FBI agent who investigated the original case talks in the documentary about how Berchtold was seen locally as \u201ca pillar of the community\u201d but was also known \u201cto have an infatuation with young girls\u201d.) So, at Sundance last month, when the documentary Leaving Neverland premiered, with its details of how Wade Robson and James Safechuck were abused by Jackson for years, there was a genuine feeling of global shame. Jackson was a child abuser? Many had suspected this for years \u2013 yet, somehow, we had also put it to one side. Numerous cases, which have also blown up in the wake of #MeToo, have provoked similar reckonings. Abusers groom their victims and those around them. The truly remarkable thing about Jackson is he managed to groom the whole world by convincing everyone he was merely an innocent weirdo. Sure, this adult man might have young boys sleeping in his bed, but he wasn\u2019t an abuser \u2013 good heavens, no! He was simply a real-life Peter Pan, a Willy Wonka, a Pied Piper. And, amazingly, the public bought that, even as Jackson, looking increasingly creepy, was photographed with an ever-rotating parade of little boys by his side. Starstruck parents were too dazzled by his celebrity to think twice about packing their sons off for sleepovers, and those around him decided he was too lucrative to be stopped. Often powerful alleged sexual predators are only finally exposed when their stars start to wane, or they are dead, and they are no longer worth protecting. Celebrity cases are really just macro versions of more common micro stories such as Jan Broberg\u2019s. While Berchtold was not a celebrity, he was, as one of Jan\u2019s sisters puts it, \u201cthe fun dad\u201d, someone their parents liked, and so the kids wanted to please him. Abducted in Plain Sight may be the first Netflix documentary that is not long enough. Instead of being five to 10 hours, as now seems standard on the streaming platform, it comes in at a nippy 90 minutes, and not enough time is spent on the Brobergs\u2019 Mormonism. Robert Broberg recalls at one point: \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure even then what a child molester was.\u201d But it is not only Mormon parents who are deceived in this way, and sometimes it is easier for a parent to think that their child is simply confused rather than acknowledge that they placed them in danger\u2019s way. As one of Jan\u2019s sisters says: \u201cI don\u2019t think my parents wanted [to think about Jan being raped] and this is why they didn\u2019t probe more when they knew something had happened. It\u2019s too painful for them to realise that they allowed this to happen.\u201d \u201cOften children won\u2019t speak up because their abuser has turned their thinking into believing they\u2019re complicit, or something terrible will happen if they speak, which is another complication for families,\u201d says Wilcox. Berchtold certainly did that with Jan. When she \u2013 after years and years of abuse \u2013 finally tells her parents the story Berchtold told her to ensure her silence, her mother marvels: \u201cDoes she really believe this?\u201d Yet her mother had believed a story at least as fantastical as the one Berchtold told her daughter, insistently overlooking behaviour that was clearly not normal. \u201cHe was just a master manipulator,\u201d Jan concludes about her abuser. But he was and he wasn\u2019t. It is true that Berchtold convinced the Brobergs to not trust their instinct. But he \u2013 like so many abusers \u2013 didn\u2019t have to do anything to hide his crimes. He committed them in plain sight.",

Surely no one can have been referring to an inability of French sportsmen and women to deliver when it matters? The current French football world champions, who won the most competitive tournament in the world, might disagree they bottled it for a start. It does not apply in French rugby, either. The under-20s won the most recent Junior World Cup and their under-18s won the first Youth Olympics\u2019 Sevens gold medal. The women\u2019s XV side, meanwhile, are the grand slam champions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/06/england-squad-six-nations-france-cokanasiga-shields-cole-moon\">Dan Cole and Ben Moon back at England coalface for heavy duty France game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So where can we find the reasons behind what happened in Paris? Before jumping straight to other over-simplified answers such as a lack of concentration or confidence, it is important to unpick this properly.</p> <p>A lack of control, which became apparent during the second half, was rooted in a lack of consistency in their preparation. I don\u2019t mean the fortnight before. It started to happen in 2004 after the Kolpak ruling that French clubs pounced on and the erosion has been left unattended until recently.</p> <p>The success of the French age group sides has shown that when the FFR has a good level of control over its players they compete with the best consistently. Now, this may sound disingenuous but take away the Irish central contract system and the English elite player squad agreement and you may begin to show some sympathy to the current crop of players and coaches playing for France where the clubs have held sway.</p> <p>It is not just that more than 40% of the Top 14 have been overseas players but that the key positions such as eight, nine, 10 and 12 have been stacked full of highly paid overseas talent. The best of the French have found it hard to break into those positions and the younger players have rarely made the matchday squads.</p> <p>At first the influx of overseas players had no impact on <em>Les Bleus</em> but this could not last. The consequence has been national teams with a lack of experience, skill sets and trusted combinations as well as reduced levels of conditioning.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If anything else is needed to fire up France, the vocal criticism of the team by the French media this week will have done that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At one point every Top 14 team were running their own version of fantasy football and talent ID was done with a chequebook. The structures being built in England around strength and conditioning, sports science and academies were not being replicated in France. Toulon were spending millions on players but their coaches were hatching plans in temporary buildings. Some overseas players such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/01/jonny-wilkinson-french-god-save-the-queen\" title=\"\">Jonny Wilkinson added immense value</a>; some of the others appeared to do just enough to get their retirement plans in order.</p> <p>I know of world-class players who, if they had picked up a man of the match award on the Saturday, wouldn\u2019t rock up until midweek at the club and no one seemed to care. Eventually this affected the national team. Conditioning was lamentable and by the time players got into national camp with very little preparation time \u2013 the staff at the FFR felt they could only paper over the cracks \u2013 the players collectively didn\u2019t have the foundations to cope with the intensity of workload required.</p> <p>Cue Bernard Laporte. His election as the president of the FFR in late 2016 was built around making the leagues French again. The quota of French qualified players is being increased each year and league points will be deducted if teams fail to comply. Stronger relationships are being formed with clubs, and the age group sides have an even greater onus on them.</p> <p>The national centre just south of Paris, Marcoussis, was nicknamed Marcatraz by the players as it felt remote and isolating. They have begun to address that with more fluid cycles of training, the use of GPS to allow players to do training sessions remotely, while having their data tracked, and scrapping the residential all\u2011year programme they had at under-19 age group and putting youngsters back into the clubs where they get more game time at \u201c<em>espoirs</em>\u201d level and build better relationships with the clubs.</p> <p>Marcoussis is a brilliant facility and one they now realise they don\u2019t have to use 24/7 to get the best out of it.

      "bodyText": "In the aftermath of France\u2019s second-half implosion against Wales, there was an explosion of a lazy stereotype with \u201ctypically French\u201d uttered loin et large across TV, radio and social media to explain away the team\u2019s performance. Having spent the past 18 months working in French rugby such pigeonholing sits uncomfortably. Surely no one can have been referring to an inability of French sportsmen and women to deliver when it matters? The current French football world champions, who won the most competitive tournament in the world, might disagree they bottled it for a start. It does not apply in French rugby, either. The under-20s won the most recent Junior World Cup and their under-18s won the first Youth Olympics\u2019 Sevens gold medal. The women\u2019s XV side, meanwhile, are the grand slam champions. So where can we find the reasons behind what happened in Paris? Before jumping straight to other over-simplified answers such as a lack of concentration or confidence, it is important to unpick this properly. A lack of control, which became apparent during the second half, was rooted in a lack of consistency in their preparation. I don\u2019t mean the fortnight before. It started to happen in 2004 after the Kolpak ruling that French clubs pounced on and the erosion has been left unattended until recently. The success of the French age group sides has shown that when the FFR has a good level of control over its players they compete with the best consistently. Now, this may sound disingenuous but take away the Irish central contract system and the English elite player squad agreement and you may begin to show some sympathy to the current crop of players and coaches playing for France where the clubs have held sway. It is not just that more than 40% of the Top 14 have been overseas players but that the key positions such as eight, nine, 10 and 12 have been stacked full of highly paid overseas talent. The best of the French have found it hard to break into those positions and the younger players have rarely made the matchday squads. At first the influx of overseas players had no impact on Les Bleus but this could not last. The consequence has been national teams with a lack of experience, skill sets and trusted combinations as well as reduced levels of conditioning. At one point every Top 14 team were running their own version of fantasy football and talent ID was done with a chequebook. The structures being built in England around strength and conditioning, sports science and academies were not being replicated in France. Toulon were spending millions on players but their coaches were hatching plans in temporary buildings. Some overseas players such as Jonny Wilkinson added immense value; some of the others appeared to do just enough to get their retirement plans in order. I know of world-class players who, if they had picked up a man of the match award on the Saturday, wouldn\u2019t rock up until midweek at the club and no one seemed to care. Eventually this affected the national team. Conditioning was lamentable and by the time players got into national camp with very little preparation time \u2013 the staff at the FFR felt they could only paper over the cracks \u2013 the players collectively didn\u2019t have the foundations to cope with the intensity of workload required. Cue Bernard Laporte. His election as the president of the FFR in late 2016 was built around making the leagues French again. The quota of French qualified players is being increased each year and league points will be deducted if teams fail to comply. Stronger relationships are being formed with clubs, and the age group sides have an even greater onus on them. The national centre just south of Paris, Marcoussis, was nicknamed Marcatraz by the players as it felt remote and isolating. They have begun to address that with more fluid cycles of training, the use of GPS to allow players to do training sessions remotely, while having their data tracked, and scrapping the residential all\u2011year programme they had at under-19 age group and putting youngsters back into the clubs where they get more game time at \u201cespoirs\u201d level and build better relationships with the clubs. Marcoussis is a brilliant facility and one they now realise they don\u2019t have to use 24/7 to get the best out of it. They have learned from their mistakes while creating a better pathway from club to country. France have the players, the resources and the know-how. Soon they will have the results, too. Where the youthful Romain Ntamack and Demba Bamba made their Six Nations debut last weekend, others such as Jordan Joseph, Cameron Woki and Pierre Louis Barrassi will soon follow. And while this Six Nations may come too soon for this French renaissance, they do love playing at Twickenham and if anything it will be a relief to play away at a stadium that has had more than the odd majestic French victory. They could cause more than a few problems if they can get the quick attacking ball they enjoyed in the first half against Wales with Louis Picamoles and Morgan Parra pulling the strings, and if England\u2019s kicking game is not on the money then expect counterattack \u2013 the back three will not be afraid to have a crack. If anything else is needed to fire up France then the criticism by the French media this week will have done that, too. They have a few injury concerns but again \u2013 depending on how radical they want to be \u2013 selection could tilt towards youth and the beginnings of the team of tomorrow could yet be forged this Sunday in TW1.

And that prospect has proved too much for some people. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d one Everton fan said on Sky earlier, when asked if he\u2019d be happy to lose, thus enabling City to nudge ahead of Liverpool on goal difference at the top of the table. \u201cDon\u2019t want Them winning the league.

Actively sabotaging your own short-term happiness in order to make the lives of others more difficult is at the very core of supporting your team.</p> <p>You can\u2019t really blame any Everton supporter taking the counterintuitive route to fandom on Wednesday night. Should they win, they will ROCKET from ninth to eighth, nudging slightly ahead in their noble quest to sneak seventh place, and thus have to begin next season and the Europa League qualifiers at some point in March. Theirs is an existential question, in many ways: their team is essentially pointless, on course to achieve nothing aside from fulfilling their fixtures, so what better way to find meaning than by tripping up the hated rivals?</p> <p>Actually there might be a scenario in which everyone is happy, and could even be more satisfying for the Schadenfreude-seeking Toffee. Recently, when presented with the opportunity to pull clear of City themselves, Liverpool reacted like the teenage Fiver when presented with the vague opportunity to kiss a member of the opposite $ex \u2013 which is to say they panicked at the prospect of grasping the nettle and ultimately departed full of self-loathing. Surely beating City, then allowing Liverpool to sabotage themselves, is ultimately more pleasing than their own indirect scuppering.</p> <p>In the end Everton fans probably don\u2019t need to put themselves in the confusing position of urging their lot to lose, because that will almost certainly happen anyway. Under Marco Silva, who thus far appears to be football\u2019s answer to the emperor parading around nude while various lickspittles proclaim him to be wearing the finest threads, they have in the last few weeks contrived to be beaten by Southampton, Leicester, Wolves and Millwall.

      "bodyText": "Last week, a Guardian Cities article explored the steep decline in shops in Sheffield city centre and asked who was to blame. Reader reaction was swift and impassioned. According to our analysis, in five years Sheffield has lost 17.8% of its stores \u2013 double the average among English and Welsh town centres, and the worst among big cities. So why is the problem particularly acute in the steel city? Readers had many thoughtful comments. Meadowhall, an out-of-town shopping centre which opened in 1990 and offers free parking, has long been cited as a contributing factor to the demise of shops in the heart of the city. Some blame the rise in online shopping, others a lack of vision by the city council. Local retailers, meanwhile, point squarely at high business rates. Of the many thoughtful comments below the piece, here are some of the best \u2013 and some potential solutions. \u2018It was always the independent stuff that made Sheffield city centre an exciting place to visit\u2019 \u2018The answer is in more local, individual, specialist outlets\u2019 \u2018During the 80s it was a colourful, dynamic place\u2019 \u2018The tram to Meadowhall started the death of the city centre\u2019 \u2018The main shopping centre can feel a bit underwhelming\u2019 \u2018People are just changing the way they shop\u2019 jark44 Sheffield City Council - yes they have had massive cuts to deal with but this is significantly exacerbated by poor and authoritarian leadership, a total lack of vision, seeming incompetence and very fraught local LP politics.

Predictions now suggest around a 10% chance of at least one year between 2019 and 2023 temporarily exceeding 1.5C.\u201d</p> <p>Climatologists stressed this did not mean the world had broken the Paris agreement 80 years ahead of schedule because international temperature targets are based on 30-year averages.</p> <p>\u201cExceeding 1.5C in one given year does not mean that the 1.5C goal has been breached and can be redirected towards the bin,\u201d said Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer at the Grantham Institute. \u201cThe noise in the annual temperatures should not distract from the long-term trend.\u201d</p> <p>Although it would be an outlier, scientists said the first appearance in their long-term forecasts of such a \u201ctemporary excursion\u201d was worrying, particularly for regions that are usually hard hit by extreme weather related to El Ni\u00f1o. This includes western Australia, South America, south and west Africa, and the Indian monsoon belt.</p> <p>They also noted that the probability of 1.5C years would steadily increase unless emissions were rapidly scaled back.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a warning that we\u2019re getting close to that level,\u201d Prof Adam Scaife, the head of long-range prediction at the Met Office, told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying there is a current risk of breaching the Paris agreement. What we are saying is that for the first time, we are seeing a chance of a temporary rise of 1.5C due to a combination of global warming and natural climate variation.\u201d</p> <p>The Met Office said previous results had demonstrated the accuracy of such \u201cdecadal reports\u201d, which cover the ground between short-term weather forecasts and long-range climate models.</p> <p>Since 2014, the world has experienced the four hottest years since records began in 1850, but these highs are likely to be exceeded soon. From now until 2023, the Met has 90% confidence that mean annual temperatures will range between 1.03C and 1.57C above pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>The recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">report on warming of 1.5C</a>, highlighted the calamitous difference even a fraction of a degree above could make to coral reefs, Arctic ecosystems and hundreds of millions of lives. Starting now, the report said emissions would have to be cut by 45% by 2030 to have any chance of holding to that level.</p> <p>\u201cBreaching 1.5C of global warming does indeed mean that we failed to limit warming to that \u2018safe\u2019 level, but not that our understanding of a safe level of climate change has suddenly changed and climate change should go unchecked,\u201d said Rogelj, who was was a coordinating lead author on the UN report. \u201cEvery tenth of a degree matters. So if 1.5C of global warming would be exceeded for whatever reason, this would be a call for steeper emissions reductions.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Global warming could temporarily hit 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for the first time between now and 2023, according to a long-term forecast by the Met Office. Meteorologists said there was a 10% chance of a year in which the average temperature rise exceeds 1.5C, which is the lowest of the two Paris agreement targets set for the end of the century. Until now, the hottest year on record was 2016, when the planet warmed 1.11C above pre-industrial levels, but the long-term trend is upward. Man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are adding 0.2C of warming each decade but the incline of temperature charts is jagged due to natural variation: hotter El Ni\u00f1o years zig above the average, while cooler La Nin\u00e3 years zag below. In the five-year forecast released on Wednesday, the Met Office highlights the first possibility of a natural El Ni\u00f1o combining with global warming to exceed the 1.5C mark. Dr Doug Smith, Met Office research fellow, said: \u201cA run of temperatures of 1C or above would increase the risk of a temporary excursion above the threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Predictions now suggest around a 10% chance of at least one year between 2019 and 2023 temporarily exceeding 1.5C.\u201d Climatologists stressed this did not mean the world had broken the Paris agreement 80 years ahead of schedule because international temperature targets are based on 30-year averages. \u201cExceeding 1.5C in one given year does not mean that the 1.5C goal has been breached and can be redirected towards the bin,\u201d said Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer at the Grantham Institute. \u201cThe noise in the annual temperatures should not distract from the long-term trend.\u201d Although it would be an outlier, scientists said the first appearance in their long-term forecasts of such a \u201ctemporary excursion\u201d was worrying, particularly for regions that are usually hard hit by extreme weather related to El Ni\u00f1o. This includes western Australia, South America, south and west Africa, and the Indian monsoon belt. They also noted that the probability of 1.5C years would steadily increase unless emissions were rapidly scaled back. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning that we\u2019re getting close to that level,\u201d Prof Adam Scaife, the head of long-range prediction at the Met Office, told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying there is a current risk of breaching the Paris agreement. What we are saying is that for the first time, we are seeing a chance of a temporary rise of 1.5C due to a combination of global warming and natural climate variation.\u201d The Met Office said previous results had demonstrated the accuracy of such \u201cdecadal reports\u201d, which cover the ground between short-term weather forecasts and long-range climate models. Since 2014, the world has experienced the four hottest years since records began in 1850, but these highs are likely to be exceeded soon. From now until 2023, the Met has 90% confidence that mean annual temperatures will range between 1.03C and 1.57C above pre-industrial levels. The recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on warming of 1.5C, highlighted the calamitous difference even a fraction of a degree above could make to coral reefs, Arctic ecosystems and hundreds of millions of lives. Starting now, the report said emissions would have to be cut by 45% by 2030 to have any chance of holding to that level. \u201cBreaching 1.5C of global warming does indeed mean that we failed to limit warming to that \u2018safe\u2019 level, but not that our understanding of a safe level of climate change has suddenly changed and climate change should go unchecked,\u201d said Rogelj, who was was a coordinating lead author on the UN report. \u201cEvery tenth of a degree matters. So if 1.5C of global warming would be exceeded for whatever reason, this would be a call for steeper emissions reductions.\u201d",

A lack of a resolution would lead to the fourth shutdown of Trump\u2019s presidency.</p> \n<p>Here are key takeaways from his speech:</p> \n<h2><strong>Trump pitches bipartisanship while pushing his own agenda</strong></h2> \n<p>The president opened his address by extending an olive branch to Democrats.</p> \n<p>\u201cMillions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is not the first time the president has tempered his rhetoric; his previous two speeches before a joint session of Congress similarly saw Trump rein in the bombastic tone that has defined his political career.</p> \n<p>But the broad appeals to both sides of the aisle have been fleeting, with little effort by Trump to follow through on bipartisan negotiations. Even as he spoke, the president was adamant that Congress approve funding for a wall along the US-Mexico border \u2013 a nonstarter with Democrats.</p> \n<h2><strong>On immigration, </strong><strong>a dark tone and scare tactics prevail</strong></h2> \n<p>When the subject turned to immigration, the word \u201crestraint\u201d did not seem to feature in Trump\u2019s dictionary.</p> \n<p>Making his case for a border wall, the president pushed unsubstantiated claims linking immigrants to violence and crime.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president has repeatedly turned to the notion that immigrants are primarily seeking entry to the US to commit violent crimes and expand the MS-13 gang, despite studies proving otherwise.</p> \n<p>Trump has used such tactics to justify the need for a border wall and reaffirmed on Tuesday that absent money toward building one, a government funding bill would be unlikely to get his signature.</p> \n<h2><strong>Trump celebrates women in moment rife with irony</strong></h2> \n<p>One of the positive moments of the night came when Trump began extolling the progress made by women in the US workforce, prompting a standing ovation from the entire chamber.</p> \n<p>At least 100 House female lawmakers, who had donned white in a nod to gender equality, stood and cheered as Trump exclaimed: \u201cAll Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president pointed directly at the women in the audience, whose decision to wear \u201csuffragette white\u201d was in part a direct rebuke of his leadership. But Trump appeared to take the irony in jest, acknowledging the record number of women serving in Congress.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4c2bb711-8657-44ef-8887-7f00dbe59319\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6IyW-yxavHg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Women did in fact win big in the 2018 midterms; a historic 126 women were elected to the 116th Congress, stemming from a backlash to the Trump presidency and the outsize role played by women voters at the ballot box.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the reverie on Tuesday was short-lived as Trump later called on Congress to pass a bill that would prohibit late-term abortion. The same women who had moments before basked in the gains mentioned by the president looked on in silence.</p> \n<h2><strong>Trump\u2019s foreign policy doctrine: no more \u2018endless wars\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>The president defended his controversial decision to withdraw US troops from Syria and accelerate an end to the war in Afghanistan.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years,\u201d Trump said, while noting the US had spent more than $7tn in the region.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/06/trump-second-summit-kim-jong-un-north-korea-vietnam-february\">Trump confirms second summit with Kim Jong-un will be in Vietnam within weeks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cAs a candidate for president, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s approach has put him at odds with US military and intelligence leaders, as well as Republicans in Congress.</p> \n<p>Last week, the GOP-led Senate defied the president by advancing a measure that opposed the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and Syria.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump delivered his second State of the Union address on Tuesday, urging unity despite giving a speech that often reflected the country\u2019s bitterly polarized political climate. The president attempted to cast his agenda as bipartisan amid rising tensions over immigration following the longest government shutdown in US history last month. Trump\u2019s remarks came as the White House and Democrats in Congress remain gridlocked over funding for the government, which is due to expire again on 15 February. A lack of a resolution would lead to the fourth shutdown of Trump\u2019s presidency. Here are key takeaways from his speech: Trump pitches bipartisanship while pushing his own agenda The president opened his address by extending an olive branch to Democrats. \u201cMillions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.\u201d This is not the first time the president has tempered his rhetoric; his previous two speeches before a joint session of Congress similarly saw Trump rein in the bombastic tone that has defined his political career. But the broad appeals to both sides of the aisle have been fleeting, with little effort by Trump to follow through on bipartisan negotiations. Even as he spoke, the president was adamant that Congress approve funding for a wall along the US-Mexico border \u2013 a nonstarter with Democrats. On immigration, a dark tone and scare tactics prevail When the subject turned to immigration, the word \u201crestraint\u201d did not seem to feature in Trump\u2019s dictionary. Making his case for a border wall, the president pushed unsubstantiated claims linking immigrants to violence and crime. \u201cAs we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.\u201d The president has repeatedly turned to the notion that immigrants are primarily seeking entry to the US to commit violent crimes and expand the MS-13 gang, despite studies proving otherwise. Trump has used such tactics to justify the need for a border wall and reaffirmed on Tuesday that absent money toward building one, a government funding bill would be unlikely to get his signature. Trump celebrates women in moment rife with irony One of the positive moments of the night came when Trump began extolling the progress made by women in the US workforce, prompting a standing ovation from the entire chamber. At least 100 House female lawmakers, who had donned white in a nod to gender equality, stood and cheered as Trump exclaimed: \u201cAll Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.\u201d The president pointed directly at the women in the audience, whose decision to wear \u201csuffragette white\u201d was in part a direct rebuke of his leadership. But Trump appeared to take the irony in jest, acknowledging the record number of women serving in Congress. Women did in fact win big in the 2018 midterms; a historic 126 women were elected to the 116th Congress, stemming from a backlash to the Trump presidency and the outsize role played by women voters at the ballot box. Indeed, the reverie on Tuesday was short-lived as Trump later called on Congress to pass a bill that would prohibit late-term abortion. The same women who had moments before basked in the gains mentioned by the president looked on in silence. Trump\u2019s foreign policy doctrine: no more \u2018endless wars\u2019 The president defended his controversial decision to withdraw US troops from Syria and accelerate an end to the war in Afghanistan. \u201cOur brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years,\u201d Trump said, while noting the US had spent more than $7tn in the region. \u201cAs a candidate for president, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.\u201d Trump\u2019s approach has put him at odds with US military and intelligence leaders, as well as Republicans in Congress. Last week, the GOP-led Senate defied the president by advancing a measure that opposed the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and Syria. Trump also publicly rebuked his own intelligence chiefs, claiming they were wrong in their assessment that the Islamic State militant group remained a threat.

Claiming the Maduro regime\u2019s \u201csocialist policies\u201d were to blame, Trump once again offered his blessing to Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. But the president swiftly shifted his attention back home, suggesting socialists were on the rise in America in a thinly veiled reference to the economic populism that has increasingly become the Democratic Party\u2019s platform. \u201cHere, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,\u201d Trump said. He added: \u201cTonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d Several Democratic presidential candidates sat stoically in the audience, including Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Kamala Harris of California. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who is weighing a second bid for the Democratic nomination, looked visibly agitated by Trump\u2019s comments. It was perhaps a hint of what is to come in the 2020 election, with several Democratic candidates embracing progressive priorities that include the single-payer healthcare plan Medicare-for-All, debt-free college tuition, and universal paid family leave. Republicans have sought to brand such ideas as \u201csocialist\u201d, despite polling showing the proposals as popular among the American public.",

      "bodyText": "Much taller and more bulbous than I am, Jeff Koons\u2019s Balloon Venus reflects the viewer on every bulge and curve of its magenta-coloured, mirror-polished stainless-steel body. The reflections are meant to make us feel somehow included, though all those twists and eruptions remind me of strangulated hernias or a monstrous yet cutesy haemorrhoid. Making a balloon sculpture from the late paleolithic stone statuette known as the Venus of Willendorf \u2013 an object that could sit comfortably in your hand \u2013 then using a CT scanner to fabricate this vastly enlarged version strikes me as excessive. The original tender stone-age figure, rediscovered in Lower Austria in 1908, sits in a museum in Vienna, while Koons\u2019s Balloon Venus is exhibited in the middle room of his show at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Balloon Venus stands among larger-than-life polychromed stainless-steel ballerinas \u2013 all based on east European porcelain figurines \u2013 whose makers might, just might, have once glimpsed a reproduction of a Degas dancer. Their execution is a marvel. I would call them breathtaking but for the queasiness of their belated rococo frivolity. The eye slithers over their shiny surfaces. I can imagine Hermann G\u00f6ring loving them. Various classical floozies look out from a number of paintings. Their photographically derived forms are overdrawn with blownup graffiti riffing on Courbet\u2019s 1866 L\u2019Origine du monde \u2013 which is to say, scribbled vulvas.

You will have watched the cheery olde-world jousting tournament end in a blaze of dragon fire shortly after the king\u2019s champion was murdered by Gregor Clegane, and you will have thought, \u201cOh, is that canon? Did the Bud Light Bud Knight live in Westeros all along? Was George RR Martin saving his unveiling for A Promise of Spring?

It\u2019s the grand culmination of an epic story the scale of which television has never before seen. Even if HBO\u2019s promotional budget for Game of Thrones only ran to a single classified listing in a small town\u2019s residential newsletter, you\u2019d still know about it. We all would. And yet HBO apparently has money to spare, because it\u2019s lobbing it around at all sorts of dumb stunts. If you watched the Super Bowl this weekend, you will be familiar with the Bud Light commercial that doubled as a horrifying off-brand Game of Thrones series announcement. You will have watched the cheery olde-world jousting tournament end in a blaze of dragon fire shortly after the king\u2019s champion was murdered by Gregor Clegane, and you will have thought, \u201cOh, is that canon? Did the Bud Light Bud Knight live in Westeros all along? Was George RR Martin saving his unveiling for A Promise of Spring?

      "body": "<p>In a world where nothing - not milk, not gender, not even facts \u2013 is quite as it seems, perhaps Heinz tomato ketchup caviar is the logical end game. One of the world\u2019s most high-end foods colliding with the most basic to produce a strange, shape-shifting vision of fluidity in food form. It\u2019s so on trend. And with its breaking down of barriers, its radical invention and its kicking down of the door to a whole new universe of possibilities, it quite possibly offers us a chance to taste the infinite. Either that or it\u2019s just a marketing gimmick from Heinz (it\u2019s celebrating 150 years of its inimitable red sauce). One way or another, I had to find out.</p> <p>Thanks to the Guardian\u2019s deadlines, the only night available for me to sample ketchup caviar was on my birthday. And so instead of eating a favourite meal, I got to eat a favourite meal that featured tomato ketchup in a starring role. That slightly limited the options, it has to be said, especially as I\u2019m not one of those Trumpian monster who eats their fillet steak with lashings of Tommy K (although ketchup caviar is the kind of thing you would expect a Trump establishment to serve \u2026 in fact you can already hear him calling it \u201ca very elegant food\u201d).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/20/why-is-ketchup-so-delicious-science-answers-big-food-questions\">Why is ketchup so delicious? Science answers the big food questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the end I plumped for fish fingers, chips and peas. Spooning the tiny red balls on to my breadcrumbed fish certainly added a jolly interactive element to what was already quite clearly a pre-school meal. The finished plate looked ridiculous, but at the same time you could definitely imagine Heston Blumenthal sticking it on a \u00a3600 tasting menu, serving it with a children\u2019s bedtime story printed on rice paper and watching as diners weep uncontrollably with childhood nostalgia.</p> <p>Of course there are other caviars on the market that don\u2019t contain any caviar (cavi-nahs?). Ikea sells seaweed pearls made largely of kelp, while Holland and Barrett stocks a similarly vegan caviar. Condiment caviars, however, don\u2019t seem to be available elsewhere and if Heinz ketchup caviar is anything to go by, there may be a reason for this: it doesn\u2019t taste very nice.</p> <p>Yes, the balls keep their shape (although maybe a little too well \u2013 making it hard to coat anything in the sauce until it\u2019s in your mouth). But the ketchup caviar is sadly thinner and more acidic than regular Heinz, and tastes more like an own brand sauce rather than the deep, rich delights of proper glass-bottled Heinz. To get the full effect of its globular nature you have to eat it on its own, and who eats ketchup on its own? (Maybe don\u2019t answer that.)</p> <p>It\u2019s a game attempt to reinvent the food landscape. But if you really want to enjoy a truly luxurious meal, then stick to eating fish fingers and chips with some proper tomato ketchup instead.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a world where nothing - not milk, not gender, not even facts \u2013 is quite as it seems, perhaps Heinz tomato ketchup caviar is the logical end game. One of the world\u2019s most high-end foods colliding with the most basic to produce a strange, shape-shifting vision of fluidity in food form. It\u2019s so on trend. And with its breaking down of barriers, its radical invention and its kicking down of the door to a whole new universe of possibilities, it quite possibly offers us a chance to taste the infinite. Either that or it\u2019s just a marketing gimmick from Heinz (it\u2019s celebrating 150 years of its inimitable red sauce). One way or another, I had to find out. Thanks to the Guardian\u2019s deadlines, the only night available for me to sample ketchup caviar was on my birthday. And so instead of eating a favourite meal, I got to eat a favourite meal that featured tomato ketchup in a starring role. That slightly limited the options, it has to be said, especially as I\u2019m not one of those Trumpian monster who eats their fillet steak with lashings of Tommy K (although ketchup caviar is the kind of thing you would expect a Trump establishment to serve \u2026 in fact you can already hear him calling it \u201ca very elegant food\u201d). In the end I plumped for fish fingers, chips and peas. Spooning the tiny red balls on to my breadcrumbed fish certainly added a jolly interactive element to what was already quite clearly a pre-school meal. The finished plate looked ridiculous, but at the same time you could definitely imagine Heston Blumenthal sticking it on a \u00a3600 tasting menu, serving it with a children\u2019s bedtime story printed on rice paper and watching as diners weep uncontrollably with childhood nostalgia. Of course there are other caviars on the market that don\u2019t contain any caviar (cavi-nahs?). Ikea sells seaweed pearls made largely of kelp, while Holland and Barrett stocks a similarly vegan caviar. Condiment caviars, however, don\u2019t seem to be available elsewhere and if Heinz ketchup caviar is anything to go by, there may be a reason for this: it doesn\u2019t taste very nice. Yes, the balls keep their shape (although maybe a little too well \u2013 making it hard to coat anything in the sauce until it\u2019s in your mouth). But the ketchup caviar is sadly thinner and more acidic than regular Heinz, and tastes more like an own brand sauce rather than the deep, rich delights of proper glass-bottled Heinz. To get the full effect of its globular nature you have to eat it on its own, and who eats ketchup on its own? (Maybe don\u2019t answer that.) It\u2019s a game attempt to reinvent the food landscape. But if you really want to enjoy a truly luxurious meal, then stick to eating fish fingers and chips with some proper tomato ketchup instead.",

While habitat loss, pollution and other threats pose a significant menace to large species, also known as megafauna, intentional and unintentional trapping, poaching and slaughter is the single biggest factor in their decline, researchers found. An analysis of 362 megafauna species found that 70% of them are in decline, with 59% classed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Direct killing by humans is the leading cause across all classes of animals, the study states. A range of maladies including intensive agriculture, toxins and invasive competitors are also helping to trigger these declines.

But he is concealing his sexual identity from them.

Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe play the deeply upset Christian parents of 18-year-old Jared (Hedges) and Edgerton himself plays the unspeakable camp director, Victor Sykes. This is a movie without the comedy and lightness that Desiree Akhavan brought to her own recent movie on the subject, The Miseducation of Cameron Post, about a young woman. The contrast may have something to do with gender difference. Just like that film, though, Boy Erased has a similarity to One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, with one character here very much in the role of Native American Chief Bromden. Like Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz\u2019s Cameron and Jack Nicholson\u2019s McMurphy, Jared realises too late that he isn\u2019t there for a fixed term (during which he could conceivably pretend to go along with it) but indefinitely, until the authorities are satisfied that the gay has been prayed away. Jared is an only child adored by his dad, a lay preacher with a car dealership, and his sweet-natured, traditional mom. But he is concealing his sexual identity from them. It emerges in the aftermath of an ugly, violent experience away at college, so Jared gets sent to this sinister and preposterous camp, run by Sykes. His fellow trainees \u2013 the old borstal phrase makes a certain sense \u2013 include the agonised Jon (a rather broad performance from award-winning director Xavier Dolan) and the coolly cynical Gary (played by Australian singing star and YouTuber Troye Sivan, who supplies the soundtrack song Revelation). The story pans out in ways that are more or less predictable, and the traditional twist in the tale about what homophobes are suppressing within themselves is supplied in the closing credits. At all events, it shows how homophobia creates credulous, fearful people vulnerable to the snake-oil con trick of \u201cconversion\u201d.",

Belonging and human connection are not reducible to weeks, months and years.

      "bodyText": "A private Titan Airways jet left Birmingham on Wednesday morning carrying about 35 people, forcibly expelling them from the UK on a flight bound for Jamaica. It is the first such flight since the revelations surrounding the Windrush scandal, and it left hours before the activists known as the Stansted 15 were sentenced for peacefully grounding a charter flight in March 2017. For many in the Caribbean community and migrant rights campaigners, this charter flight is a \u201cslap in the face\u201d, a reminder that lessons from the Windrush scandal have not been learned and that the government\u2019s hostile environment immigration policy endures. However, the charter flight is being seemingly justified on the grounds that the people on the flight have criminal records. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Tuesday: \u201cEvery single person that will be on that flight that is being deported is a foreign national offender, they are all convicted of serious crimes, very serious crimes.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what the home secretary defines as \u201cvery serious\u201d here, as it seems that some people on the flight have been convicted of minor offences. Take Akeem, 23, who is registered blind and suffers from epilepsy following a brain tumour as a child, and who served a four-month sentence for an assault conviction. (Javid used the same term when explaining that he would not assist wrongly deported \u201cWindrush migrants\u201d with criminal records). But whether they committed crimes, serious or not, Javid reminds us that those fighting for migrant rights need to develop arguments that can include those with criminal records. Firstly, it is clear that deportation represents a form of double punishment. Deporting an individual after they have served their sentences abandons all notions of rehabilitative justice. But then perhaps this is precisely the point. After all, the idea of rehabilitation has been under attack for decades and being \u201ctough\u201d on crime often seems to include double and triple punishments, for example the gang members who should expect their families to be evicted if they live in council homes. It is also clear that many of the Jamaican nationals booked on the flight had lived in the UK since they were children, some arriving as long ago as 1977. Many of these men (and it will be mostly men on the flight) have British children themselves. But even those who arrived as adults might have compelling reasons to stay \u2013 would they be fighting their cases, against the odds, while locked up in detention centres, if not? Belonging and human connection are not reducible to weeks, months and years. Some people booked on the flight have ongoing asylum claims and many simply do not know where they will go when they land in Kingston. As compelling as these arguments are, they often end up being drowned out by the clamouring consensus on the need to \u201cget rid of all foreign offenders\u201d. David Lammy\u2019s important review into racism in the criminal justice system, published in 2017, found that black men were represented disproportionately at every stage \u2013 at arrest, in courts, in prisons. There is a wealth of research that has long supported these findings, and yet connections are not being made between racist criminal justice and deportation. Most accounts of the Windrush scandal focused on the contribution and deservingness of long-settled Caribbean migrants. However, there is a connection between one kind of hostile environment and another: between stop and search and aggressive immigration policies; between prisons and detention centres; between mass deportation flights and the banning of drill music. Racism at the border is inseparable from racism within Britain; they license and feed off one another. For black and brown British citizens, that familiar refrain, \u201cGo back to your country\u201d, captures this most clearly. Moreover, for as long as the defence of immigrants relies on proving their contribution, people who deserve support will be excluded. Instead, we need to challenge the broader system of austerity and racist criminal justice that restricts the possibilities for \u201ccontribution\u201d in the first place. After all, \u201ccontribution\u201d doesn\u2019t work for marginalised British citizens either \u2013 for welfare claimants, for those unable to work because of disability and ill health, and for those performing essential and yet unpaid social reproductive and caring roles (mostly women, of course). Moral panics about migration, crime and security work to obscure widening inequalities and deepening insecurities. As ever, it appears that by nurturing nationalist resentments about racialised outsiders \u2013 the \u201ccriminal\u201d, the \u201cmigrant\u201d, the \u201cterrorist\u201d \u2013 the government is able to redirect public anger, and secure consent for the very policies that make life more difficult and uncertain for the vast majority. As the UK recommences these brutal and secretive mass deportation flights, we need to expand our critique of the hostile environment. We need to be brave enough to also condemn reducing human beings to criminals, and to depart from the logic of judging people based on their contribution.

      "body": "<p>Here is a film almost woozy with its own beauty and dignity, a film going transcendently high in the face of a racist world going low. It is a tribute of quiet passion extended to those lives fractured by injustice, and seems to serenely offer up their hard-won heroism to ward off bigotry\u2019s corrosive evil. This is a great-looking, heartfelt and deeply intelligent picture from writer-director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/barry-jenkins\" title=\"\">Barry Jenkins</a>, an Oscar-winner for his previous film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/16/moonlight-review-masculinity-naomie-harris\" title=\"\">Moonlight</a> from 2016. He has adapted the novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin\" title=\"\">James Baldwin</a> about Tish (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/01/kiki-layne-beale-street-black-love-injustice-james-baldwin\" title=\"\">KiKi Layne</a>), a young pregnant black woman in early-70s New York who has to battle for justice when her partner Fonny (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4150847/\" title=\"\">Stephan James</a>), the father of her child, is wrongly charged with rape. Fonny has been stitched up by a vengeful white cop (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4534098/\" title=\"\">Ed Skrein</a>) who was humiliated after a street altercation involving Fonny. His petulant authority was challenged, and he decided from that moment on that he just didn\u2019t like Fonny\u2019s face.</p> <p>It could be said that If Beale Street Could Talk, unquestionably a work of real moral seriousness and artistry, nonetheless falls a bit short of Moonlight. It has a certain literary self-consciousness and it might not have the audacity and pure blaze of passion in that earlier film. There also are stylistic and tonal shifts that don\u2019t quite hang together as cleanly as the tripartite structure of Moonlight. We get sudden jags and stabs of realism, poking holes in the film\u2019s plangent sweetness, which will then quickly heal up, helped by the rich orchestral score from composer <a href=\"https://www.nicholasbritell.com/\" title=\"\">Nicholas Britell</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"044fe89d7e9d116c79743dcd3a554054a4efebb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/044fe89d7e9d116c79743dcd3a554054a4efebb3/0_307_3489_2094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"from left, Teyonah Parris, KiKi Layne and Regina King.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great performances \u2026 from left, Teyonah Parris, KiKi Layne and Regina King.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Annapurna Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But these reservations arguably misread what Jenkins is doing here: it is a storytelling style that approximates the literary past tense, and also the mysterious operation of memory, which retrieves scenes and setpieces out of narrative order. In some ways, the film is itself about memory, and there is something of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/terrence-malick\" title=\"\">Terrence Malick</a> in its rhapsodic form.</p> <p>The love story of Fonny and Tish is something that the audience has to catch up on late, from a present moment of disaster. They were childhood friends, blindsided by the sudden realisation in their teens that they were in love.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/01/kiki-layne-beale-street-black-love-injustice-james-baldwin\">Beale Street star KiKi Layne: 'Black love is so powerful in the face of injustice'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their fathers Joseph (Colman Domingo) and Frank (Michael Beach) are easygoing buddies from way back, delighted in the forthcoming marriage setting a dynastic seal on their friendship. But Fonny\u2019s fiercely religious mother (Aunjanue Ellis) disapproves of her son\u2019s association with Tish and the lovers\u2019 sisters don\u2019t get along. A more reserved figure is Tish\u2019s mother Sharon \u2013 a quietly excellent performance from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/02/regina-king-if-beale-street-could-talk-interview\" title=\"\">Regina King</a> \u2013 who must finesse and negotiate all the diplomatic problems of this crisis.</p> <p>Sharon is at the centre of the film\u2019s most fascinating set piece.

      "bodyText": "Here is a film almost woozy with its own beauty and dignity, a film going transcendently high in the face of a racist world going low. It is a tribute of quiet passion extended to those lives fractured by injustice, and seems to serenely offer up their hard-won heroism to ward off bigotry\u2019s corrosive evil. This is a great-looking, heartfelt and deeply intelligent picture from writer-director Barry Jenkins, an Oscar-winner for his previous film Moonlight from 2016. He has adapted the novel by James Baldwin about Tish (KiKi Layne), a young pregnant black woman in early-70s New York who has to battle for justice when her partner Fonny (Stephan James), the father of her child, is wrongly charged with rape. Fonny has been stitched up by a vengeful white cop (Ed Skrein) who was humiliated after a street altercation involving Fonny. His petulant authority was challenged, and he decided from that moment on that he just didn\u2019t like Fonny\u2019s face. It could be said that If Beale Street Could Talk, unquestionably a work of real moral seriousness and artistry, nonetheless falls a bit short of Moonlight. It has a certain literary self-consciousness and it might not have the audacity and pure blaze of passion in that earlier film. There also are stylistic and tonal shifts that don\u2019t quite hang together as cleanly as the tripartite structure of Moonlight. We get sudden jags and stabs of realism, poking holes in the film\u2019s plangent sweetness, which will then quickly heal up, helped by the rich orchestral score from composer Nicholas Britell. But these reservations arguably misread what Jenkins is doing here: it is a storytelling style that approximates the literary past tense, and also the mysterious operation of memory, which retrieves scenes and setpieces out of narrative order. In some ways, the film is itself about memory, and there is something of Terrence Malick in its rhapsodic form. The love story of Fonny and Tish is something that the audience has to catch up on late, from a present moment of disaster. They were childhood friends, blindsided by the sudden realisation in their teens that they were in love. Their fathers Joseph (Colman Domingo) and Frank (Michael Beach) are easygoing buddies from way back, delighted in the forthcoming marriage setting a dynastic seal on their friendship. But Fonny\u2019s fiercely religious mother (Aunjanue Ellis) disapproves of her son\u2019s association with Tish and the lovers\u2019 sisters don\u2019t get along. A more reserved figure is Tish\u2019s mother Sharon \u2013 a quietly excellent performance from Regina King \u2013 who must finesse and negotiate all the diplomatic problems of this crisis. Sharon is at the centre of the film\u2019s most fascinating set piece. When Victoria Rogers (Emily Rios), the woman who was raped and then coerced by the police into identifying Fonny, leaves the city, thus causing a chaotic delay in the legal process, it is Sharon who must travel to Puerto Rico to track her down and speak to her. The scene emerges almost like something from a spy story or a thriller, with Sharon arriving in disguise. It is a very mysterious encounter, a sudden insight into the life of another woman subject to racism and cruelty, a woman who appears and recedes into invisibility like a mirage. There are other wonderful set pieces. Tish has a job selling scent at a department store and is vulnerable to all sorts of creepy male customers who use a sample-smell request as an excuse to get up close and personal: black men ask her to spritz their hand; white men will take her perfumed hand and smell it (for slightly too long) in a creepy parody of gallantry. It is a vivid, sensual snapshot of arrogance. The most powerful sequence comes with Fonny\u2019s friend Daniel (a great performance from Brian Tyree Henry) who arrives in Fonny\u2019s apartment \u2013 and talks. He is to reveal something important and inauspicious about what he\u2019s been doing for the past few years, but somehow this isn\u2019t exactly what makes this scene so gripping. It is just the spectacle of these two men talking about themselves.

      "bodyText": "The business secretary has indicated the he and other ministers would feel unable to remain in a government that recommended a no-deal Brexit should Theresa May fail to get her revised agreement through parliament. Greg Clark told MPs on the business select committee that \u201che had always strongly expressed the view\u201d that the UK needed to leave the European Union with a Brexit deal agreed. The minister \u2013 one of the strongest voices in cabinet against leaving without a deal \u2013 was repeatedly pressed by the committee chair, Rachel Reeves, as to what would happen if the prime minister could not get a revised Brexit deal through the Commons as the 29 March deadline loomed. At the culmination of a string of questions, Reeves asked Clark: \u201cWould you still be a government minister in a government that took us out of the EU without a deal?\u201d Clark said that if leaving without a deal \u201cwere ever the policy of the government as a matter of policy\u201d then \u201cI think there would be many people on all sides of the house that would regard that as unacceptable\u201d. The minister said repeatedly that parliament needed \u201cto grasp the nettle and agree a deal\u201d and that May \u201cneeded to propose a deal that can command the support of the whole house,\u201d before conceding: \u201cThat is very difficult.\u201d MPs on the committee also questioned Clark on his failure to tell them that he had been negotiating a package of financial support to Nissan worth up \u00a380m in October 2016, contingent on the company building a new model X-Trail in Sunderland. At the time Clark failed to say a state aid package was being negotiated and kept detail of reassurances to keep Nissan on board before Brexit secret, even telling the BBC at the time: \u201cI don\u2019t have a chequebook.\u201d Anna Turley, a Labour backbencher, demanded to know why Clark had kept the details of the state aid from the committee; the minister declined to apologise, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have an ability to write a cheque.\u201d Turley said: \u201cBut you did write a cheque,\u201d and pressed the minister as to why he was not prepared to tell MPs the taxpayer support that was on offer to Nissan.

Their confidence was incredible.</p> <p>The cover shot I did for Definitely Maybe, their 1994 debut album, ended up being completely different from how they envisaged it. Noel had seen <a href=\"http://www.jpgr.co.uk/pcs7016_b.jpg\">a shot of the Beatles in Japan</a> where they\u2019re all sitting around this coffee table. His idea was that the band would be photographed around the dining table at [guitarist] Bonehead\u2019s house in West Didsbury, Manchester. I was disappointed: \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere exotic?\u201d</p> <p>I went to have a recce and thought: \u201cWhat are they going to be doing at the table? Playing cards?

I\u2019d not long ago been to the Egyptology section of the Manchester Museum and it came to me to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/19/liam-gallagher-brits-noel-german-police-pulled-teeth-pliers\">Liam</a> lying on the floor in a kind of transcendental state with his eyes closed, like he\u2019s not of this world. Is he alive, is he dead? I thought it\u2019d be pretty surreal and also solve the problem of filling that space. I was nervous about mentioning it to Liam. Asking the lead singer to lie on the floor: a lot of bands wouldn\u2019t have gone for that. But Liam was up for it straight away.</p> <p>The shoot was littered with Red Stripe cans, but there was no way I was having them in the shot, because it would just look like product placement. They wanted some reference to alcohol in there, though, so I said: \u201cLet\u2019s get some wine.\u201d It\u2019s actually Ribena in the glass, though. The urban myth is that it\u2019s because they couldn\u2019t afford wine, but that\u2019s complete rubbish.

Now, I will go back to the country and cultivate.\u201d Cultivate what? I ask, not for the first time. Keita does not answer, not for the first time. He closes his eyes and falls silent. When he does speak, it is bursts of a few words and short, stilted answers.</p> <p>I am in a modest hotel suite in the north of Paris with one of the greatest musical talents the African continent has ever produced. Keita, known as the \u201cgolden voice of Africa\u201d, has enjoyed a career spanning more than half a century. Now nearly 70 years old, he is known not just for his extraordinarily powerful and passionate voice, but for the genetic condition he has called albinism that has made him, he says, \u201cwhite of skin and black of blood\u201d. He has sung for Nelson Mandela, and in aid of Ethiopia.

Now, I will go back to the country and cultivate.\u201d Cultivate what? I ask, not for the first time. Keita does not answer, not for the first time. He closes his eyes and falls silent. When he does speak, it is bursts of a few words and short, stilted answers. I am in a modest hotel suite in the north of Paris with one of the greatest musical talents the African continent has ever produced. Keita, known as the \u201cgolden voice of Africa\u201d, has enjoyed a career spanning more than half a century. Now nearly 70 years old, he is known not just for his extraordinarily powerful and passionate voice, but for the genetic condition he has called albinism that has made him, he says, \u201cwhite of skin and black of blood\u201d. He has sung for Nelson Mandela, and in aid of Ethiopia. He continues to sing to highlight the desperate plight of those with albinism across Africa, giving his time and talent to raise funds. Keita is eating breakfast, a plate of fried chicken and onions, chunks of crispy baguette and milky tea. His answers are brief and so softly-spoken it\u2019s a struggle to catch the occasional word in between the food and the clatter of cutlery. More than once, he stops eating, looks pained, and rubs both his hands vigorously over his face. He is in Paris to promote his 14th album Un Autre Blanc (Another White), the title a reference to his struggles as a singer-songwriter with albinism.

      "bodyText": "Labour has urged the government to either delay Brexit, embrace a customs union or let MPs decide a way forward, during a prime minister\u2019s questions fronted by stand-ins for Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. With May holding talks in Northern Ireland, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy prime minister, appeared in her place. Standing in for Corbyn was Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary. Thornberry used all her questions to probe Lidington on what she said should be a \u201csensible, grownup discussion\u201d about the next steps forward on Brexit. Their exchanges were notably more polite than the usual barbs exchanged by the prime minister and Labour leader. Thornberry was nonetheless scathing about May\u2019s hopes of securing sufficient changes to the Irish backstop to assure her backbenchers during talks in Brussels later this week, saying she was running out of time. \u201cI hope he will understand the concern all of us have, not just in this house, but across the country, that we have a government treading water in the Niagara River while the current is taking us over the falls,\u201d she said. Thornberry began with a joke about Lidington\u2019s role: \u201cAs the newspapers always call him, he is \u2018effectively the deputy prime minister\u2019, surely the only occasion these days when the words \u2018prime minister\u2019 and \u2018effective\u2019 are used in the same sentence.\u201d After questioning Lidington about when MPs would next get a meaningful vote on any Brexit plan, Thornberry said it appeared this would happen only if and when May secured concessions on the backstop from the EU. She said: \u201cDoes the prime minister seriously think that she will get anything different than the responses we have heard from the EU over recent days? Because none of them have given any encouragement that they are willing to reopen the withdrawal agreement unless the prime minister is willing to reconsider the red lines on which the agreement is based.\u201d The only \u201csensible, cautious thing to do at this late stage\u201d was to seek an extension to article 50 to delay Brexit, she argued. Lidington rejected the idea, saying it \u201cwould simply defer the need for this house, including the opposition frontbench, to face up to some difficult decisions\u201d. Ideas such as using technology to prevent border checks would never work, argued Thornberry. She said: \u201cThe technological solution is a non-starter; a permanent backstop will never be acceptable to the ERG [European Research Group] or the DUP; and the only solution that will actually work is a full customs union. \u201cIt is the answer that is staring the government in the face. If they backed it, it would command a majority in this house. It would avoid the mayhem and the chaos of no deal, and it would protect the jobs at Nissan, Airbus and elsewhere which are currently at grave risk. So can the minister explain why the minister is so dead against it?\u201d A customs union on its own would not be enough, Lidington responded, saying it would not cover areas such as common regulatory standards for goods or the movement of food and livestock. Thornberry praised Lidington as the minister who understood Europe \u201cbetter than any of his cabinet colleagues\u201d, but said not even he had been able to properly explain the government\u2019s plans. \u201cThe truth is there are no answers,\u201d she said. \u201cPlan A has been resoundingly rejected by parliament. Plan B was ruled out by the EU months ago, and the government is in danger of sleepwalking the country towards leaving with no plan and no deal at all. \u201cSo with just over 50 days to go, can I give the minister a final opportunity to tell us whether there is a better plan than this, or for goodness sake will he let parliament take charge instead?\u201d Lidington said the answer lay in part with Labour. \u201cIf they are worried about no deal they have to vote for a deal, and every time they vote against a deal the risk of no deal becomes greater,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is time for the opposition frontbench, for once, to put the national interest first, do the right thing and vote for a deal.\u201d",

He also claimed to write a screenplay as he went along, while filming, except in rare cases.</p> <p>\u201cA script is a verbal attack on a visual world. Potentially a film has a universe of visuals to deal with. Once you tame it and restrain it within a script that means you have a hundred pages of dialogue. It is heavily cut off in terms of visuals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cfd70385bda678642c0bf3d1a7b73c133e64e89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cfd70385bda678642c0bf3d1a7b73c133e64e89/20_331_5189_3113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Du\u0161an Makavejev in New York in 1985. \u2018Narrative structure is prison; it is tradition; it is a lie; it is a formula that is imposed,\u2019 he once declared.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Du\u0161an Makavejev in New York in 1985. \u2018Narrative structure is prison; it is tradition; it is a lie; it is a formula that is imposed,\u2019 he once declared.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Morris/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Belgrade, Serbia, Du\u0161an was the son of Sergije Makavejev and his wife, Jelka (nee Bojkic). After graduating in psychology from Belgrade University, he began to make 35mm experimental shorts and documentaries, among them The Seal (1955), a satire on bureaucracy \u2013 a dead man recalls all the seals that he came across in his earthly existence. Other titles in the same satirical vein were Don\u2019t Believe in Monuments and Damned Holiday (both 1958), What is a Workers\u2019 Council? (1959), Educational Fairy-Tale (1961) and Miss Beauty (1962).</p> <p>His first feature, Man Is Not a Bird (1965), shot in a bleak industrial town in Slovenia, tells of a visiting engineer who has an affair with a young and carefree hairdresser (<a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/serbian-film-icon-milena-dravic-dies-after-lengthy-illness/29542799.html\" title=\"\">Milena Dravi\u0107</a>). With its guiltless eroticism, vertiginous images from hand-held cameras and irreverent attitude to authority, the film came as a revelation from eastern Europe.</p> <p>Its light side is balanced by its portrayal of the noisy, dirty, dehumanising work done by industrial workers. The provocative ending cross-cuts between a performance of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony as a special event for local dignitaries at a factory, and the lovemaking of the heroine, finding her own Ode to Joy.</p> <p>In The Switchboard Operator (aka Love Affair, 1967), a young independent switchboard operator (Eva Ras) sets up house with an Arab rat-catcher who becomes jealous and accidentally kills her after she is seduced by a postman. Using hand-held cameras in the streets, newsreels, asides, and ironic juxtapositions between traditional and modern Yugoslavia, Makavejev invested his second feature with vitality and an anarchic spirit.</p> <p>Influenced by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sergey-Eisenstein\" title=\"\">Sergei Eisenstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Luc-Godard\" title=\"\">Jean-Luc Godard</a>, Makavejev built an elaborate amalgam of documentary-like examinations of rat extermination, stock footage and digressions about how a strudel is made.</p> <p>Makavejev\u2019s first features placed him as the leading figure in <a href=\"https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/9128/yugoslavias-black-wave-cinema-from-socialist-realism-to-sexual-revolution\" title=\"\">the Yugoslavian Black Wave Movement</a> of the 1960s and early 70s. The group, which included \u017dika Pavlovi\u0107, Sa\u0161a Petrovi\u0107 and <a href=\"https://www.zilnikzelimir.net/biography\" title=\"\">\u017delimir \u017dilnik</a>, favoured dark humour and a non-traditional style.</p> <p>An anomaly in Makavejev\u2019s oeuvre was Innocence Unprotected (1968), a documentary about a never released 1941 film of the same name. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0017982/\" title=\"\">Dragoljub Aleksi\u0107</a>, a circus strongman and the writer-star-director of Innocence Unprotected, and other survivors of the original cast, reminisce about the making of the film and its confiscation by the occupying Nazis.</p> <p>Although the extracts shown from the film prove it to have been a pretty awful melodrama, Makavejev is never snide about it. In fact, his title refers not to the orphan girl rescued by the hero in the original film, but to the brave and innocent people who made the film, to whom he pays amusing and affectionate homage.</p> <p>If Makavejev had been unpopular with the authorities for his earlier films, WR: Mysteries of the Organism (1971) \u2013 a documentary and fictional examination of the theories of the sexologist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wilhelm-Reich\" title=\"\">Wilhelm Reich</a> \u2013 made him persona non grata.

      "bodyText": "Du\u0161an Makavejev, who has died aged 86, was one of the most important film-makers to come from the former Yugoslavia. However, he met with official disapproval at home and several of his films were not shown commercially in his own country, despite the relative liberalism of communism under Josip Tito. This was not surprising, because Makavejev was an independent and anarchic spirit, most of whose films studied the interrelationship of sexual life and socioeconomic structures, while experimenting with narrative forms that challenge traditional notions of film-making. In his film essays, he was fond of using collage methods, often juxtaposing a series of images in a humorous and dramatic manner. \u201cNarrative structure is prison; it is tradition; it is a lie; it is a formula that is imposed,\u201d Makavejev once declared. He also claimed to write a screenplay as he went along, while filming, except in rare cases. \u201cA script is a verbal attack on a visual world. Potentially a film has a universe of visuals to deal with. Once you tame it and restrain it within a script that means you have a hundred pages of dialogue. It is heavily cut off in terms of visuals.\u201d Born in Belgrade, Serbia, Du\u0161an was the son of Sergije Makavejev and his wife, Jelka (nee Bojkic). After graduating in psychology from Belgrade University, he began to make 35mm experimental shorts and documentaries, among them The Seal (1955), a satire on bureaucracy \u2013 a dead man recalls all the seals that he came across in his earthly existence. Other titles in the same satirical vein were Don\u2019t Believe in Monuments and Damned Holiday (both 1958), What is a Workers\u2019 Council? (1959), Educational Fairy-Tale (1961) and Miss Beauty (1962). His first feature, Man Is Not a Bird (1965), shot in a bleak industrial town in Slovenia, tells of a visiting engineer who has an affair with a young and carefree hairdresser (Milena Dravi\u0107). With its guiltless eroticism, vertiginous images from hand-held cameras and irreverent attitude to authority, the film came as a revelation from eastern Europe. Its light side is balanced by its portrayal of the noisy, dirty, dehumanising work done by industrial workers. The provocative ending cross-cuts between a performance of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony as a special event for local dignitaries at a factory, and the lovemaking of the heroine, finding her own Ode to Joy. In The Switchboard Operator (aka Love Affair, 1967), a young independent switchboard operator (Eva Ras) sets up house with an Arab rat-catcher who becomes jealous and accidentally kills her after she is seduced by a postman. Using hand-held cameras in the streets, newsreels, asides, and ironic juxtapositions between traditional and modern Yugoslavia, Makavejev invested his second feature with vitality and an anarchic spirit. Influenced by Sergei Eisenstein and Jean-Luc Godard, Makavejev built an elaborate amalgam of documentary-like examinations of rat extermination, stock footage and digressions about how a strudel is made. Makavejev\u2019s first features placed him as the leading figure in the Yugoslavian Black Wave Movement of the 1960s and early 70s. The group, which included \u017dika Pavlovi\u0107, Sa\u0161a Petrovi\u0107 and \u017delimir \u017dilnik, favoured dark humour and a non-traditional style. An anomaly in Makavejev\u2019s oeuvre was Innocence Unprotected (1968), a documentary about a never released 1941 film of the same name. Dragoljub Aleksi\u0107, a circus strongman and the writer-star-director of Innocence Unprotected, and other survivors of the original cast, reminisce about the making of the film and its confiscation by the occupying Nazis. Although the extracts shown from the film prove it to have been a pretty awful melodrama, Makavejev is never snide about it. In fact, his title refers not to the orphan girl rescued by the hero in the original film, but to the brave and innocent people who made the film, to whom he pays amusing and affectionate homage. If Makavejev had been unpopular with the authorities for his earlier films, WR: Mysteries of the Organism (1971) \u2013 a documentary and fictional examination of the theories of the sexologist Wilhelm Reich \u2013 made him persona non grata. This shocking, amusing and exasperating film, the title of which can be easily misread, caused offence wherever it was shown and made a lot of money, though not in Yugoslavia, where it was never released. After that Makavejev was forced to make films in the west. Sweet Movie (1974), which was shot in the Netherlands, Canada and France, in five different languages, is in two parts. In the first, a Miss World winner (Carole Laure) is wedded to and violated by Mr Kapital. After other humiliations, she ends up at a therapy commune, where the members engage in infantile regressions related to bodily functions. The second part follows a ship, with a gigantic image of Karl Marx on its prow, sailing under the command of Anna Planeta, who seduces and murders young men and boys, before they are resurrected. Challenging and provocative, Sweet Movie is one of the most potent statements of sexual and political liberation in the cinema. Yet it was also one of the most scandalous and banned of works. \u201cAfter Sweet Movie, I was wiped out,\u201d explained Makavejev. \u201cI kept my passport from Yugoslavia, but I was not allowed to work there \u2026 I had a Hollywood agent, and had all sorts of invitations, and everybody talked to me. But for seven years I did not make a film. No one in the west would let me do my next film the same way I did my previous five successful ones.

I said that if I have a script first you cannot get this kind of film.\u201d Makavejev, who had taken up a teaching post at Harvard, eventually was able to make Montenegro (1981), which, despite its title, was set and shot in Sweden. In his unbridled fashion, Makavejev continued to explore the sexuality of politics and the politics of sexuality in this tale of how a bored, middle-class married woman (Susan Anspach) in Sweden frees her libido with some Serbian immigrant workers. Makavejev\u2019s political and sexual themes were less overt in his next film, The Coca-Cola Kid (1985), an offbeat comedy about corporate ideals, made in Australia. Eric Roberts, in the title role, is sent there to find out why nobody drinks Coca-Cola in a certain area, only to end up questioning his whole existence. Set in a small European country, where various factions fumble over a revolution, Manifesto (1988), based on a Zola short story, re-explored Makavejev\u2019s abiding subject matter, in a humorous, bawdy way. Gorilla Bathes at Noon (1993), another allegory, deals with a red army officer in Berlin in 1989-90, coming to terms with a changing world, into which the director cut scenes from the 1945 Soviet battle film The Fall of Berlin. BBC television co-produced A Hole in the Soul (1994), a 52-minute tragicomic autobiographical film, which followed Makavejev on a trip around Belgrade, revealing a great deal about the man and the often-misunderstood artist. In 1964 Makavejev married Bojana Marijan, who worked as assistant director and producer on several of her husband\u2019s films, and she survives him. \u2022 Du\u0161an Makavejev, film director, born 13 October 1932; died 25 January 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 13 February 2019. The Gorilla Bathes at Noon is not set in 1945, but in 1989-90. The film that comes from 1945 is the battle documentary The Fall of Berlin.",

Decades ago, he said, a friend of his had confided that she had been raped. Neeson asked if she knew the man who had raped her, and when she said no, he asked the man\u2019s race. She told him that the attacker had been black. Neeson said that after this, he was intent on murdering a black man. He said he walked the streets carrying \u201ca cosh\u201d \u2013 British slang for a bludgeon \u2013 going into black neighborhoods and hoping to find himself in a fight, so that he would have an excuse to beat a black man to death.

      "bodyText": "In an interview with the UK\u2019s Independent newspaper, the action star Liam Neeson, who was on a press junket to promote his new action movie, Cold Pursuit, admitted to wanting racist revenge. Decades ago, he said, a friend of his had confided that she had been raped. Neeson asked if she knew the man who had raped her, and when she said no, he asked the man\u2019s race. She told him that the attacker had been black. Neeson said that after this, he was intent on murdering a black man. He said he walked the streets carrying \u201ca cosh\u201d \u2013 British slang for a bludgeon \u2013 going into black neighborhoods and hoping to find himself in a fight, so that he would have an excuse to beat a black man to death. All of this came from a feeling of defensiveness toward his friend, he said. Thus, he would murder a black man on her behalf. The comment sparked controversy and anger; black people rightly pointed out that this attitude seeks to impose collective punishment, putting their communities in grave and pointless danger. Many were angry at Neeson for not condemning his own past racism, instead saying that the episode had taught him a lesson about the danger and futility of revenge. In response, Neeson went on Good Morning America. \u201cI am not a racist,\u201d he said, and added, unhelpfully, that he had overcome his urges by \u201cpower walking\u201d. While he was there, he also promoted his new movie. Neeson\u2019s story describes an element of racism that begins in white imaginations, but can have dangerous impacts on black lives: the fantasy of violence. In Neeson\u2019s mind, all black men were of a piece with one another, an undifferentiated group that was uniformly menacing and collectively responsible for what happened to his friend. This is the same fantasy of a black threat that was in the mind of George Zimmerman when he stalked and then killed the teenage Trayvon Martin, for example; its persistence in the minds of white people puts black people in a state of constant risk, always in danger of provoking this violent paranoia by their mere presence. After Martin\u2019s murder in 2013, then president Barack Obama gave a statement speaking about his own experiences of provoking white people\u2019s racist fear, and of enduring the danger and humiliation that comes with being the object of it. \u201cThere are very few African-American men who haven\u2019t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars,\u201d he said. \u201cThat happens to me, at least before I was a senator.\u201d He was talking about people who think like Neeson did, white people who indulge the fiction that proximity to black people means vulnerability to violence \u2013 and that their own violence in response to that imagined threat is justified. It must be stated plainly: this kind of thinking kills people. Black people die because white people feel uncomfortable. That Neeson was intent on indulging this racist revenge act in response to his friend\u2019s rape forces us to confront another, more fraught theme: the fact that in many instances, when white men enact racist violence on black men, they imagine \u2013 or pretend \u2013 that they are committing this violence on white women\u2019s behalf.

From Iraq to Darfur, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and now Yemen, accounting for mortality in conflict has become an evidential battlefield. The issue was dramatised again this week by the clumsy and one-sided intervention of Graham Jones, the Labour chair of the Commons committees on arms export controls (CAEC), who unintentionally underlined the difficulty of estimating mortality in conflict \u2013 in this case, civilian deaths from Saudi-coalition airstrikes. Accusing international NGOs of dishonesty in their reporting, Jones promptly demonstrated his own agenda by seeking to paint Iran, backer of the rebel Houthis, as the principal aggressor. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful how NGOs and loony leftwing organisations have refused to back the UN\u2019s unanimous position,\u201d said Jones, provoking fury from aid groups. \u201cWe desperately need peace in Yemen, not fantasy answers made in safe European homes.\u201d And while Jones has complacently suggested that he feels far more comfortable with lower casualty tallies provided by \u201cgenerals and the Ministry of Defence,\u201d it is significant that, across the Atlantic, the Pentagon was sufficiently concerned about the issue to launch a major exercise aimed at understanding why its own accounting of civilian deaths is so much lower than that of respected watch groups.

As of late last year, those estimates ranged from about 10,000 dead to almost six times that number. Few believe the lower estimate, while for its part Save the Children has claimed that 85,000 children under the age of five alone \u201cmay\u201d have died from starvation during three years of conflict. So who is getting it wrong? The reality, as anyone who has studied the figures for malnutrition and mortality in Yemen, is that \u2013 like Iraq \u2013 the numbers offered for public consumption encompass a vast spread of estimates. If Jones has a point, it is that historically some NGOs have undoubtedly been guilty of a process of misery inflation.

      "bodyText": "The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has broken with the consensus among Europe\u2019s major powers by saying it is wrong to recognise Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the interim president of Venezuela, saying she did not wish to \u201cstrike a pose\u201d, but to help Venezuela by doing something realistic and practical to secure fresh elections. She was answering questions at the end of a major speech in which she promised a hallmark of a Labour-run Foreign Office would be a consistent preparedness to criticise human rights abuses by British allies including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt. She also used the speech to criticise the leadership of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela, saying indirectly that he called himself socialist but had betrayed every socialist value. But she sided with a minority of EU countries, notably Italy, in rejecting Guaid\u00f3\u2019s call to be recognised as the interim president of Venezuela. Britain, France, Spain and Germany have all recognised Guaid\u00f3. Thornberry said: \u201cI do not think you can make demands without knowing what you are going to do next. It\u2019s about not striking a pose, but doing things that are realistic and practical.\u201d She added: \u201cRegional voices are very important and I think we should be led by them more than we are, rather than unilaterally, or almost unilaterally, deciding this must happen by this time. I think there should be dialogue facilitated by regional powers. I think it is a question of approaching this with a little more humility.\u201d She said more time needed to be allowed for the country to try to resolve the situation. \u201cWe need to give them time, and that offer has been made internally and externally. We need to ensure that happens \u2013 that is the best way to proceed, rather to suddenly say: \u2018That\u2019s it, we had enough. We recognise X. We do not recognise Y any more.\u2019 It\u2019s not the way to treat another country, even a country in as desperate a situation as Venezuela.\u201d During an interview in Venezuela\u2019s legislative palace in Caracas on Tuesday, Juan Andr\u00e9s Mej\u00eda, a close Guaid\u00f3 ally from the Voluntad Popular party, said he was troubled there were those in Britain who \u201cstill don\u2019t understand the struggle here in Venezuela, especially some people in the Labour party [including] Jeremy Corbyn and others\u201d. Mej\u00eda said: \u201cThis is not an ideological struggle in Venezuela. This is not left against right ... In the opposition you have parties from across the political spectrum. Our basic demand here is elections. We are not trying to set up a government that will stay there forever and control all of the branches of power. \u201cWe are only trying to have freedom for elections \u2013 and that is not what happened here last year. I would ask Corbyn what would happen if his party and himself were banned from running, if millions of voters were forbidden from voting because they were living abroad \u2026 Would he or anyone else in the UK accept those rules? Probably not.\u201d Thornberry said she favoured targeted international sanctions in principle, but did not say if she specifically supported them in the case of Venezuela. The bulk of her speech suggested a Labour Foreign Office would retilt the policy balance towards values, rather than interests, promising consistent support for human rights, while at the same time engaging frankly with regimes with which Labour disagreed. She said recent years \u201chad seen a perceptible shift to make the promotion of trade, business links and the financial bottom line not just the top priority of Foreign Office staff based here and overseas, but one allowed to override all others, most notably the protection of human rights\u201d. She accused Theresa May of \u201can instinctive panicked reaction to Brexit, which says this is not the time to lose friends elsewhere, no matter who those friends are or whether they behave as friends should\u201d. She added: \u201cHow else do we explain the craven indulgence of the human rights abuses committed by President Sisi in Egypt or President Erdo\u011fan in Turkey, and the frankly shameful blind eye being turned to the crimes of Crown Prince Bin Salman? \u201cFor too long, and this was as true of the past Labour government as it is true of this Conservative one, there has been a grave tendency to patronise and punish those nations with whom our trade links and strategic alliances are less important \u2013 because their human rights abuses are safe to criticise and their breaches of international law are easy to support UN resolutions against \u2013 while the stronger countries have had their own abuses and crimes ignored and indulged.\u201d She accused the Foreign Office of losing its sense of purpose and becoming afflicted by short-term thinking, muddied goals, shrunken budgets and \u201ca dangerous indulgence of authoritarian regimes\u201d. At the same time she said Labour in office could not afford to live in a parallel universe, saying: \u201cWe must deal with the world as it is now, not as we wish it could be, and be ready to do whatever we can, and deal with whoever it takes, to achieve our goals.\u201d Offering what she agreed might be seen as Robin Cook\u2019s ethical foreign policy laced with realism, she conceded critics would say if her stance \u201cmeans dealing with the likes of Iran or Russia on one side, or Saudi Arabia or Turkey on the other \u2013 that we will, right from the outset, be compromising the values that we claim will guide Labour\u2019s foreign policy\u201d.

If we are true to our values, and the objectives that flow from those values, we must accept that, in the world as it is now, that will inevitably mean negotiating and working with people with whom we don\u2019t agree.\u201d In specific proposals Thornberry said she supported the Blair government\u2019s intervention in Kosovo without explicit UN backing, defended limited arms sales to Israel and promised an end to arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in the war in Yemen.

      "body": "<p>The shale gas firm Cuadrilla has said commercial fracking cannot go ahead in the UK unless rules on minor earthquakes are relaxed, after admitting it had only been able to frack a tiny section of its gas well near Blackpool because of seismicity regulations.</p> <p>The company became the first to frack in the UK for years when it started operations last October at its Preston New Road site but was repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/fracking-blackpool-tremor-cuadrilla\">forced to pause work for causing tremors</a> that breached a 0.5-magnitude limit.</p> <p>In a statement on Wednesday, the company revealed that less than 5% of the well had been fracked, or only two of the 41 so-called fracking stages along the well.</p> <p>The rules had \u201cseverely constrained\u201d the volume of sand that could be injected along with chemicals and water to fracture the shale rock and release the gas within. It used less than 14% of the sand, which helps to keep the fractures open, than it had intended to.</p> <p>Francis Egan, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to inject as much sand into the shale rock as we planned and it\u2019s true that without enough sand we can\u2019t flow the gas back in commercial quantities.\u201d</p> <p>However, the firm said fracking had confirmed a \u201crich reservoir\u201d of gas, flowing at a peak of 200,000 cubic feet a day. From that data, the company has estimated a flow of 3-8m cubic feet a day if it was able to frack the entire length of the well.</p> <p>Cuadrilla called on the government and its regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), to carry out a review of the earthquake rules, known as the \u201ctraffic light system\u201d. Ineos, a rival fracking firm run by the UK\u2019s richest person, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, earlier this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/04/ineos-chairman-jim-ratcliffe-criticises-government-fracking-policies\">demanded a review of the limits</a>, saying they had \u201cno sound basis in science\u201d and were unworkable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cuadrilla said any decisions on further fracking of the well, and a second well that it has drilled but not yet fracked, would be subject to the outcome of any such review.</p> <p>Geologists advising the OGA, including Dr Brian Baptie of the British Geological Survey, have said the limits could be safely lifted to as high as 1.5-magnitude.</p> <p>But the energy minister, Claire Perry, has repeatedly said she has no plans for a review and it would be a \u201cfoolish politician\u201d who relaxed the regulations.

      "bodyText": "The shale gas firm Cuadrilla has said commercial fracking cannot go ahead in the UK unless rules on minor earthquakes are relaxed, after admitting it had only been able to frack a tiny section of its gas well near Blackpool because of seismicity regulations. The company became the first to frack in the UK for years when it started operations last October at its Preston New Road site but was repeatedly forced to pause work for causing tremors that breached a 0.5-magnitude limit. In a statement on Wednesday, the company revealed that less than 5% of the well had been fracked, or only two of the 41 so-called fracking stages along the well. The rules had \u201cseverely constrained\u201d the volume of sand that could be injected along with chemicals and water to fracture the shale rock and release the gas within. It used less than 14% of the sand, which helps to keep the fractures open, than it had intended to. Francis Egan, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to inject as much sand into the shale rock as we planned and it\u2019s true that without enough sand we can\u2019t flow the gas back in commercial quantities.\u201d However, the firm said fracking had confirmed a \u201crich reservoir\u201d of gas, flowing at a peak of 200,000 cubic feet a day. From that data, the company has estimated a flow of 3-8m cubic feet a day if it was able to frack the entire length of the well. Cuadrilla called on the government and its regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), to carry out a review of the earthquake rules, known as the \u201ctraffic light system\u201d. Ineos, a rival fracking firm run by the UK\u2019s richest person, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, earlier this week demanded a review of the limits, saying they had \u201cno sound basis in science\u201d and were unworkable. Cuadrilla said any decisions on further fracking of the well, and a second well that it has drilled but not yet fracked, would be subject to the outcome of any such review. Geologists advising the OGA, including Dr Brian Baptie of the British Geological Survey, have said the limits could be safely lifted to as high as 1.5-magnitude. But the energy minister, Claire Perry, has repeatedly said she has no plans for a review and it would be a \u201cfoolish politician\u201d who relaxed the regulations. The Guardian revealed last year that she had told a Tory MP the rules could be loosened as the industry develops, but she subsequently rowed back on the idea. Egan said: \u201cCuadrilla and its investors remain committed to this opportunity \u2026 All we ask now is that we are treated fairly, with comparable seismic and ground vibration levels to similar industries in Lancashire and elsewhere in the UK.\u201d Environmentalists said if fracking firms could not proceed under the current rules, they should not go ahead in the UK. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cCuadrilla have practically admitted they can\u2019t make fracking work under the safety rules they\u2019ve been boasting about for years. If they can\u2019t, then they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The first chunk of the Sidmouth fatberg, a monstrous mass of congealed oils, grease, wet wipes and other nasties lurking under the seafront of the Devon resort, has been brought to the surface at the start of an eight-week cleanup operation. A hunk of the 64-metre long object was hauled up into the light in a yellow plastic bucket. A wet wipe \u2013 a key component of fatbergs \u2013 poked out of one side of the grey-white mess, a cotton bud from another. Charlie Ewart, a sewer worker, said he and his colleagues could not wait to get rid of the fatberg, which has been gathering unnoticed beneath the Esplanade, a few metres from the sea, for years. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to getting it out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite eerie down there in the sewer and and you have to keep an eye out for rats. But it\u2019s a challenge. Somebody\u2019s got to do it.\u201d The smell \u2013 a heady combination of rotting meat mixed with the odour of an unclean toilet \u2013 does not bother Ewart and his mates. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been in the industry for a while you don\u2019t smell it. You get immune.\u201d Sidmouth\u2019s fatberg, the size of six double-decker buses, has provoked interest around the world. Visitors have arrived in the town to examine the spot and try to pick up a whiff. South West Water opened a pop-up shop to explain what is happening and warn people of the dangers of dropping things they shouldn\u2019t down the toilet and sink. Hundreds of people visited and took part in games and competitions. One resident was inspired to write a poem about it. But now the task of getting rid of the fatberg has begun. Experts are winched down a small manhole into the sewer, which was built in Victorian or regency times. They have to be careful of the water levels. Work was hampered on Wednesday after rain showers meant that they were suddenly faced with 2.5 metres of water. The gases are also a problem. The methane levels are high and oxygen low and Ewart and his colleagues wear full breathing apparatus and carry gas detectors to make sure they are not in danger. Detectors are also in place on the surface and alarms will beep if gas is detected above ground. Ewart and the team hack at the fatberg with small shovels and a mattock \u2013 a lighter version of a pickaxe. Special lorries fitted with high-pressure, sewer-jetting equipment will help get the fatberg moving and suck it out. South West Water\u2019s director of wastewater, Andrew Roantree, said the discovery of the fatberg \u2013 which was found about four metres below the surface \u2013 had been greeted with a mixture of interest, concern and horror in the town. He also revealed that since December the beast \u2013 which is how some think of it \u2013 had shifted. \u201cThe guys were quite surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has moved. Something has happened \u2013 it could have got bigger or the flow in the sewer may have shuffled it a bit.\u201d Happily, there has been little or no odour and the cleanliness of the bathing water has not been affected. Scientists from the University of Exeter will take samples of the fatberg to analyse exactly what it is made of. Roantree said he was keen to find out how much plastic \u2013 a component of the wet wipe \u2013 was in it. South West Water has used the Sidmouth fatberg as an educational tool. The wet wipes tend to create a matrix that other elements get caught up in, gradually creating a hard mass. Roantree said the company spent about \u00a35m a year on clearing 8,500 blockages of all shapes and sizes from across its region.

In December 2012, it was <a href=\"https://navalny.com/p/4462/\">offered for sale at $15.6m</a>.</p> <p>But documents seen by the Guardian show Navka purchased the entire plot in October 2014 for 300m roubles ($7.1m) \u2013 an $8.5m discount. The price included two pieces of land costing $3.5m. Navka furnished the house in 2013-15, consulting her husband on everything from gym equipment to choice of eco-sauna. Items ordered from a Cyprus boutique cost more than \u20ac500,000.</p> <p>The property\u2019s seller is listed as Timur Khaldarov, a little-known figure who ran a <a href=\"http://en.artscienceandsport.com/\">charitable sporting and arts foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://profile.ru/arkhiv/item/54510-items_24754\">according to Russian media</a>.</p> <p>The foundation\u2019s founder is Alisher Usmanov, one of Russia\u2019s most powerful and politically influential oligarchs. Usmanov was until recently a major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/07/arsenal-stan-kroenke-offer-buy-club-outright\">shareholder in Arsenal </a>football club and in 2018 the UK\u2019s eighth richest man.</p> <p>Khaldarov said he was independently wealthy. He works for <a href=\"http://www.metalloinvest.com/en/\">Metalloinvest</a>, Usmanov\u2019s mining company. He said he met Navka before her second marriage to Peskov, when his daughter wanted to try figure skating. He said he could not remember the name of the acquaintance who introduced them.</p> <p>The house was \u201ctoo small\u201d for his family, and so he sold it to Navka in a falling market, he said. \u201cThere was no special discount. I was paid the market value. Why consider it a gift?\u201d he added. Usmanov, his boss, was not aware of the deal and did not influence it, he told <a href=\"https://tvrain.ru/\">Moscow TV channel Rain</a>.</p> <p>Navka said she bought the property at the market rate, at a time when real estate prices \u201cbegan to plummet\u201d. She was unaware of the 2012 price. \u201cI have been working for a long time. I earn money and pay taxes on it. Everything else is my personal matter,\u201d she said in an email.</p> <p>Neither she nor her husband had a \u201cbusiness relationship\u201d with any of Russia\u2019s \u201cmajor entrepreneurs\u201d, she added.</p> <p>Usmanov confirmed he \u201cworked closely\u201d with Khaldarov but said he had no interest in the Tretya Okhota house or knowledge of transactions. There were \u201cwell-known fluctuations\u201d in the Moscow property market at the time, he said.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://dossier.center/\">Dossier</a>, Peskov and Navka made plans for an even grander mansion on an exclusive plot in the Moscow region belonging to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/russian-billionaire-aras-agalarov-company-trump-tower-meeting\">tycoon and developer Aras Agalarov</a>.</p> <p>In March 2018, Agalarov personally approved the building proposal, on a site called <a href=\"https://www.agalarovestate.com/realty/rechnaja27\">Rechnaya #27</a>, documents show. The plot is situated inside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/10/russia.international\">a gated housing estate for Russia\u2019s ultra-wealthy</a>, on the bank of a river, and featuring a golf course and private beach.</p> <p>Documents show in 2017 the couple hired a firm of American architects, <a href=\"http://www.zampolin.com/\">Zampolin &amp; Associates</a>, based in Westwood, New Jersey, to draw up a new mini-palace known as the Yanavka Residence.</p> <p>The firm\u2019s founder, Bob Zampolin, flew to Moscow to discuss the designs with Navka. His proposal features 2,400 metres of living space, a separate entrance for staff, a pool, spa, hot tub, sauna, great room and library.</p> <p>The project was active in mid-2018. Its current status is unclear. Last week, there was no sign of building work. Asked if the plan was going ahead, Navka replied: \u201cThis does not concern you.\u201d She said her relationship with Zampolin was personal and \u201cwasn\u2019t connected with plans to acquire property anywhere\u201d.</p> <p>Navka\u2019s <a href=\"https://7days.ru/stars/privatelife/tatyana-navka-ya-gotova-podderzhat-svoikh-detey-v-lyuboy-situatsii/8.htm\">latest photoshoot for a Russian magazine</a> took place at the Agalarov Estate hotel.</p> <p>The revelations are likely to provoke fresh questions over Peskov\u2019s wealth and any potential benefits he and his wife have gained from his close relationship with Putin.</p> <p>Dossier is funded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mikhail-khodorkovsky\">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a>, an exiled critic of Putin. Its revelations will fuel questions about Navka\u2019s finances.</p> <p>Since winning Olympic gold, Navka has enjoyed lucrative TV and advertising deals, including for a brand of yoghurt. She has had a primetime ice dancing show on Russia\u2019s state-run pro-Kremlin Channel One.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a0e0277e6c61210b3ee46870edd114abc133b8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a0e0277e6c61210b3ee46870edd114abc133b8b/0_0_1450_967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside view of Tatiana Navka\u2019s property in the village Tretya Okhota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tatiana Navka\u2019s property in Tretya Okhota is built on some of the most expensive real estate in Russia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She appears to have bought her Rubylovka property using a 300m-rouble private loan \u2013 the entire purchase price. Asked about the loan, Navka repeated: \u201cThis does not concern you.\u201d</p> <p>Before the sale in February 2014, Navka opened three Swiss bank accounts, documents show. The accounts were with the Zurich branch of the <a href=\"https://www.bil.com/en/private-banking/Pages/Hub.aspx\">Banque Internationale \u00e0 Luxembourg</a> and in dollars, euros and roubles.</p> <p>She also set up an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven. The company, Carina Global Assets, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/kremlin-reaction-putin-dmitry-peskov-panama-papers-putinphobia\">named in the Panama Papers leak</a>.</p> <p>At that time Navka denied having any offshore companies or accounts: \u201cI don\u2019t know who could have done it. I would like myself to understand what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Navka also has a portfolio of other high-end properties. They include an elite flat in Moscow\u2019s central Yakimanka district, worth $4m, and <a href=\"https://www.domzamkad.ru/articles/gde-zhivet-tatyana-navka.html\">given to her by the state as a reward</a> for her sporting success. It is being extensively revamped.</p> <p>She also has a $2m flat in the Moscow suburb of Polyanka. In 2015, she acquired a property under a lease of 49 years from the Moscow city government.</p> <p>The pavilion in a Soviet-era park known as VDNkH was to be developed into an ice rink and sporting arena. The project was never implemented, Navka said. She also owns a small flat in the Crimean resort of Yalta.</p> <p>The couple both have children from previous relationships, and a daughter born in August 2014. They have had family holidays in the Maldives, Dubai, and the French ski resort of Courchevel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b778c1ce774897e0992830f0f169b2be60222cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b778c1ce774897e0992830f0f169b2be60222cf/1209_0_2062_2578/800.jpg\" alt=\"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has expressed concerns over the couple\u2019s spending.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their spending has come under persistent questioning from Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader. In 2015, he accused Peskov of \u201cillegal enrichment\u201d after he and Navka reportedly <a href=\"https://navalny.com/p/4401/\">honeymooned on the world\u2019s most expensive yacht.</a></p> <p>Peskov was spotted at his wedding ceremony in Sochi <a href=\"https://navalny.com/p/4378/\">wearing a $625,000 watch</a>. Peskov said the watch was a present from his bride. He also received an inheritance, he said.</p> <p>Navalny has urged the Kremlin to examine the apparent discrepancy between Peskov\u2019s official income and his ostentatious spending, so far without success. One theory is that Navka has on occasions benefited from her husband\u2019s links to Russian oligarchs who are supportive of Putin.</p> <p>Navalny has <a href=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qrwlk7_GF9g?hl=en&amp;cc_lang_pref=en&amp;cc_load_policy=1\">previously alleged</a> that Usmanov used a charitable foundation to gift Dmitry Medvedev, Russia\u2019s prime minister, an $85m mega-villa in greater Moscow. Usmanov <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/24/i-spit-on-you-again-alisher-usmanov-video-alexei-navalny\">vehemently denies this</a>. A Moscow court <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-navalny-idUKKBN18R26R\">found in Usmanov\u2019s favour.</a></p> <p>Khaldarov said Navka had rented his former home for a year and a half before she bought it, paying all appropriate taxes. Khaldarov was a deputy director of Usmanov\u2019s <a href=\"https://usm-group.com/philanthropy\">Art, Science and Sport charity foundation</a>. </p> <p>Peskov has been a confidant of Putin for 20 years and is regarded as one of the most powerful people in Russia. He was involved in discussions over a property deal in Moscow, held with Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who has admitted he lied about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.</p> <p>Cohen told Congress the plan fizzled out in January 2016. He now says discussions went on for another six months and included a possible trip by Trump to Moscow.</p> <p>Cohen emailed Peskov asking for help \u2013 and held a 20-minute phone call with one of his assistants. Peskov <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/trump-tower-moscow-the-secret-files-cohen-sater-putin\">later invited Cohen to the St Petersburg economic forum</a>, and offered to facilitate high-level meetings with Putin and Medvedev.</p> <p>Peskov and Agalarov appear in the dossier compiled by the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele. It alleges the Kremlin holds compromising material on Trump, some of it allegedly collected during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/18/trump-in-moscow-what-happened-at-miss-universe-in-2013\">Trump\u2019s 2013 visit to Moscow for the Miss Universe contest</a>, which Agalarov hosted. Agalarov paid Trump about $14m in fees for putting on the show. Trump owned the rights.</p> <p>The dossier says Peskov was in charge of <em>kompromat</em> on Trump and Hillary Clinton, as part of Moscow\u2019s wider effort to influence the 2016 US presidential election in Trump\u2019s favour. The special counsel Robert Mueller is examining alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>",

The project is being overseen by a Russian tycoon who has previously done business with Donald Trump, documents show. The disclosures are likely to raise fresh questions about Peskov\u2019s wealth and how he and his wife, Tatiana Navka, seem able to afford a super-affluent lifestyle. Russian opposition leaders have repeatedly criticised Peskov\u2019s lifestyle since his celebrity wedding in 2015 to Navka, a champion ice dancer who won gold for Russia in the 2006 Winter Olympics. A Russian citizen, she lived and trained for more than a decade in the US. Though wealthy in her own right, research led by the investigative unit Dossier Center, together with the Guardian, suggests the couple\u2019s assets and spending are greater than has been reported. In October 2014, Navka bought a state-of-the-art property in Rublyovka, the forested area west of Moscow that is home to Putin, Russia\u2019s president, and many from the country\u2019s ruling elite. The house in the village of Tretya Okhota is built on some of the most expensive real estate in Russia. In December 2012, it was offered for sale at $15.6m.

Navka furnished the house in 2013-15, consulting her husband on everything from gym equipment to choice of eco-sauna. Items ordered from a Cyprus boutique cost more than \u20ac500,000. The property\u2019s seller is listed as Timur Khaldarov, a little-known figure who ran a charitable sporting and arts foundation, according to Russian media. The foundation\u2019s founder is Alisher Usmanov, one of Russia\u2019s most powerful and politically influential oligarchs. Usmanov was until recently a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and in 2018 the UK\u2019s eighth richest man. Khaldarov said he was independently wealthy. He works for Metalloinvest, Usmanov\u2019s mining company. He said he met Navka before her second marriage to Peskov, when his daughter wanted to try figure skating. He said he could not remember the name of the acquaintance who introduced them. The house was \u201ctoo small\u201d for his family, and so he sold it to Navka in a falling market, he said. \u201cThere was no special discount. I was paid the market value. Why consider it a gift?\u201d he added. Usmanov, his boss, was not aware of the deal and did not influence it, he told Moscow TV channel Rain. Navka said she bought the property at the market rate, at a time when real estate prices \u201cbegan to plummet\u201d. She was unaware of the 2012 price. \u201cI have been working for a long time. I earn money and pay taxes on it. Everything else is my personal matter,\u201d she said in an email. Neither she nor her husband had a \u201cbusiness relationship\u201d with any of Russia\u2019s \u201cmajor entrepreneurs\u201d, she added. Usmanov confirmed he \u201cworked closely\u201d with Khaldarov but said he had no interest in the Tretya Okhota house or knowledge of transactions. There were \u201cwell-known fluctuations\u201d in the Moscow property market at the time, he said. According to Dossier, Peskov and Navka made plans for an even grander mansion on an exclusive plot in the Moscow region belonging to the tycoon and developer Aras Agalarov. In March 2018, Agalarov personally approved the building proposal, on a site called Rechnaya #27, documents show. The plot is situated inside a gated housing estate for Russia\u2019s ultra-wealthy, on the bank of a river, and featuring a golf course and private beach. Documents show in 2017 the couple hired a firm of American architects, Zampolin &amp; Associates, based in Westwood, New Jersey, to draw up a new mini-palace known as the Yanavka Residence. The firm\u2019s founder, Bob Zampolin, flew to Moscow to discuss the designs with Navka. His proposal features 2,400 metres of living space, a separate entrance for staff, a pool, spa, hot tub, sauna, great room and library. The project was active in mid-2018. Its current status is unclear. Last week, there was no sign of building work. Asked if the plan was going ahead, Navka replied: \u201cThis does not concern you.\u201d She said her relationship with Zampolin was personal and \u201cwasn\u2019t connected with plans to acquire property anywhere\u201d. Navka\u2019s latest photoshoot for a Russian magazine took place at the Agalarov Estate hotel. The revelations are likely to provoke fresh questions over Peskov\u2019s wealth and any potential benefits he and his wife have gained from his close relationship with Putin. Dossier is funded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an exiled critic of Putin. Its revelations will fuel questions about Navka\u2019s finances. Since winning Olympic gold, Navka has enjoyed lucrative TV and advertising deals, including for a brand of yoghurt. She has had a primetime ice dancing show on Russia\u2019s state-run pro-Kremlin Channel One. She appears to have bought her Rubylovka property using a 300m-rouble private loan \u2013 the entire purchase price. Asked about the loan, Navka repeated: \u201cThis does not concern you.\u201d Before the sale in February 2014, Navka opened three Swiss bank accounts, documents show. The accounts were with the Zurich branch of the Banque Internationale \u00e0 Luxembourg and in dollars, euros and roubles. She also set up an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven. The company, Carina Global Assets, was named in the Panama Papers leak. At that time Navka denied having any offshore companies or accounts: \u201cI don\u2019t know who could have done it. I would like myself to understand what happened.\u201d Navka also has a portfolio of other high-end properties. They include an elite flat in Moscow\u2019s central Yakimanka district, worth $4m, and given to her by the state as a reward for her sporting success. It is being extensively revamped. She also has a $2m flat in the Moscow suburb of Polyanka. In 2015, she acquired a property under a lease of 49 years from the Moscow city government. The pavilion in a Soviet-era park known as VDNkH was to be developed into an ice rink and sporting arena. The project was never implemented, Navka said. She also owns a small flat in the Crimean resort of Yalta. The couple both have children from previous relationships, and a daughter born in August 2014. They have had family holidays in the Maldives, Dubai, and the French ski resort of Courchevel. Their spending has come under persistent questioning from Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader. In 2015, he accused Peskov of \u201cillegal enrichment\u201d after he and Navka reportedly honeymooned on the world\u2019s most expensive yacht. Peskov was spotted at his wedding ceremony in Sochi wearing a $625,000 watch. Peskov said the watch was a present from his bride. He also received an inheritance, he said. Navalny has urged the Kremlin to examine the apparent discrepancy between Peskov\u2019s official income and his ostentatious spending, so far without success. One theory is that Navka has on occasions benefited from her husband\u2019s links to Russian oligarchs who are supportive of Putin. Navalny has previously alleged that Usmanov used a charitable foundation to gift Dmitry Medvedev, Russia\u2019s prime minister, an $85m mega-villa in greater Moscow. Usmanov vehemently denies this. A Moscow court found in Usmanov\u2019s favour. Khaldarov said Navka had rented his former home for a year and a half before she bought it, paying all appropriate taxes. Khaldarov was a deputy director of Usmanov\u2019s Art, Science and Sport charity foundation. Peskov has been a confidant of Putin for 20 years and is regarded as one of the most powerful people in Russia. He was involved in discussions over a property deal in Moscow, held with Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who has admitted he lied about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen told Congress the plan fizzled out in January 2016. He now says discussions went on for another six months and included a possible trip by Trump to Moscow. Cohen emailed Peskov asking for help \u2013 and held a 20-minute phone call with one of his assistants. Peskov later invited Cohen to the St Petersburg economic forum, and offered to facilitate high-level meetings with Putin and Medvedev. Peskov and Agalarov appear in the dossier compiled by the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele. It alleges the Kremlin holds compromising material on Trump, some of it allegedly collected during Trump\u2019s 2013 visit to Moscow for the Miss Universe contest, which Agalarov hosted. Agalarov paid Trump about $14m in fees for putting on the show. Trump owned the rights. The dossier says Peskov was in charge of kompromat on Trump and Hillary Clinton, as part of Moscow\u2019s wider effort to influence the 2016 US presidential election in Trump\u2019s favour. The special counsel Robert Mueller is examining alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.",

I was also in Mexico last season and loved every moment. \u201cNow I\u2019m with you guys. This team beat my team as well, it wasn\u2019t a great day when it happened being an Arsenal fan, because I wasn\u2019t linked with you then, but now it is all about thinking positive and looking forward to this new chapter.\u201d The Ostersund technical director, David Webb, and the manager, Ian Burchnall, who replaced Graham Potter when he joined Swansea last year, are looking forward to working with the former England Under-21 international. \u201cRavel wants to get acquainted with the team and then we\u2019ll see how it goes. He has not signed yet but we hope we can get him to our club,\u201d Webb said. \u201cWe believe that a man should not be judged for what has been. We are an open club and everyone is welcome to us. We have experience of players with similar problems and have good experience of taking care of them.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Last week, towards the end of her first month in office, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted a five-page Instagram story on her skin routine and it split the internet.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the use of retinol that sent critics into a spin. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s double cleanse/toner/moisturise/sunscreen/vitamin C/do-not-sleep-in-your-makeup, six-step regime is not exactly anomalous for a 29-year-old woman with an income. Nor is it a surprise that a woman working in the public eye washes. After all, we live in a world in which communication is visual and where a woman in lipstick in a political space will still turn heads. (AOC should know: in June, during the New York primary campaign, she tweeted the shade of her Stila lipstick and there were similar repercussions.)</p> <p>What seemed to pique her detractors\u2019 rage was that in spite of a record number of women serving in Congress, and in spite of AOC being a woman who took a man\u2019s seat, the politician had dared to admit a base level of vanity. And she wore sunscreen. In contrast, last week, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">New York Times</a> finally rumbled Donald Trump for allegedly wearing fake tan and \u201ca little powder which the president applies himself before television appearances\u201d and no one batted an eyelid.</p> <p>But what the congresswoman\u2019s post shows is how in the past two years the concept of skincare has changed beyond all recognition. Where once we were told to cleanse, tone and moisturise (and later discouraged from over-exfoliating), the kind of multi-step Korean-influenced beauty routine that Ocasio-Cortez subscribes to has taken on near-religious power. In fact, AOC\u2019s \u201cface layering\u201d regime looks positively spartan in comparison to the laborious regime of about 10 different steps adopted by some women in South Korea and Japan. The industry exploded globally a couple of years ago, but it has already moved from novelty to backlash (last January, <a href=\"https://theoutline.com/post/3151/the-skincare-con-glossier-drunk-elephant-biologique-recherche-p50?zd=1&amp;zi=jvzvdutj\" title=\"\">the Outline described it as \u201ca con\u201d</a>, while in October women in South Korea destroyed their makeup as part of a movement called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/26/escape-the-corset-south-korean-women-rebel-against-strict-beauty-standards\">escape the corset</a>\u201d). AOC\u2019s endorsement simply shows it has gone mainstream, appearing as a regular topic in the New Yorker and Atlantic, well outside of the beauty blog bubble.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"762bd4e8e4643bd0224944ec74906b04278c01e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/762bd4e8e4643bd0224944ec74906b04278c01e3/0_0_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sheet mask: \u2018good for immediacy ...\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sheet mask: \u2018good for immediacy ...\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Along the way it has also normalised some pretty weird vernacular, from snail slime and donkey masks to \u201cmules\u201d (people who are paid to bring things back from abroad) and \u201cdupes\u201d (products that mimic expensive products for half the price). And then there\u2019s the money. Newish companies that specialise in multi-step products such as The Ordinary and Drunk Elephant have successfully rebranded \u201canti-ageing\u201d products as \u201cmillennial\u201d ones, and in turn, sent revenues hurtling towards the billions. According to Kotra, the South Korean government agency for trade promotion, $4,536,943 (\u00a33.47m) worth of K-beauty products were legally exported to the US in 2018, up almost a million on the previous year. Who knows how much comes through more nefarious channels. Multi-step beauty is not simply an arm of the industry, it is its own economy.</p> <p>For many of us, the idea of AOC double cleansing is both fascinating and reassuring. Fascinating because in dark political times, there are few better balms than reading about the routine of a politician, and reassuring because it proves that AOC is one of us. Lisa Niven-Phillips, the beauty editor of Vogue.co.uk, saw her endorsement as pivotal to her success as a politician: \u201cThe thing with AOC is that she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s too trivial to talk about, which is honest \u2013 and promotes the idea that people can be multifaceted. I love the transparency; that\u2019s how she got millennials on board, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Niven-Phillips came across the regime in Seoul six years ago and has since upped her skincare count to six steps. Like AOC, she double cleanses (a thick one to take off makeup, less thick to actually wash) uses a vitamin C serum, a hydrating serum, a little moisturiser and, twice a week, an exfoliant. If going to a party, she uses a sheet mask: \u201cThey\u2019re good for immediacy, rather than any long-term benefits,\u201d she adds. And, for anyone asking, the whole thing takes five minutes, and means she wears less makeup as a result. \u201cThat was always the idea \u2013 to improve your skin first so you didn\u2019t need to then cover it in makeup.\u201d</p> <p>Anita Bhagwandas, the former beauty editor of Stylist, agrees.

I don\u2019t know why there is so much fuss and mystery surrounding it.\u201d The whole thing takes less than 10 minutes, and she, too, wears less makeup as a result. \u201cThe natural skin look on Instagram has definitely replaced the contouring one.\u201d</p> <p>My own routine is based largely around curiosity and eBay samples of products I\u2019ve read about.

I have a bunch of vitamin C serums (good for brightening, I\u2019m told) and until I dropped it down the sinkhole, a tiny 5ml pot of Sunday Riley glycolic acid.

      "bodyText": "Last week, towards the end of her first month in office, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted a five-page Instagram story on her skin routine and it split the internet. It wasn\u2019t the use of retinol that sent critics into a spin. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s double cleanse/toner/moisturise/sunscreen/vitamin C/do-not-sleep-in-your-makeup, six-step regime is not exactly anomalous for a 29-year-old woman with an income. Nor is it a surprise that a woman working in the public eye washes. After all, we live in a world in which communication is visual and where a woman in lipstick in a political space will still turn heads. (AOC should know: in June, during the New York primary campaign, she tweeted the shade of her Stila lipstick and there were similar repercussions.) What seemed to pique her detractors\u2019 rage was that in spite of a record number of women serving in Congress, and in spite of AOC being a woman who took a man\u2019s seat, the politician had dared to admit a base level of vanity. And she wore sunscreen. In contrast, last week, the New York Times finally rumbled Donald Trump for allegedly wearing fake tan and \u201ca little powder which the president applies himself before television appearances\u201d and no one batted an eyelid. But what the congresswoman\u2019s post shows is how in the past two years the concept of skincare has changed beyond all recognition. Where once we were told to cleanse, tone and moisturise (and later discouraged from over-exfoliating), the kind of multi-step Korean-influenced beauty routine that Ocasio-Cortez subscribes to has taken on near-religious power. In fact, AOC\u2019s \u201cface layering\u201d regime looks positively spartan in comparison to the laborious regime of about 10 different steps adopted by some women in South Korea and Japan. The industry exploded globally a couple of years ago, but it has already moved from novelty to backlash (last January, the Outline described it as \u201ca con\u201d, while in October women in South Korea destroyed their makeup as part of a movement called \u201cescape the corset\u201d). AOC\u2019s endorsement simply shows it has gone mainstream, appearing as a regular topic in the New Yorker and Atlantic, well outside of the beauty blog bubble. Along the way it has also normalised some pretty weird vernacular, from snail slime and donkey masks to \u201cmules\u201d (people who are paid to bring things back from abroad) and \u201cdupes\u201d (products that mimic expensive products for half the price). And then there\u2019s the money. Newish companies that specialise in multi-step products such as The Ordinary and Drunk Elephant have successfully rebranded \u201canti-ageing\u201d products as \u201cmillennial\u201d ones, and in turn, sent revenues hurtling towards the billions. According to Kotra, the South Korean government agency for trade promotion, $4,536,943 (\u00a33.47m) worth of K-beauty products were legally exported to the US in 2018, up almost a million on the previous year. Who knows how much comes through more nefarious channels. Multi-step beauty is not simply an arm of the industry, it is its own economy. For many of us, the idea of AOC double cleansing is both fascinating and reassuring. Fascinating because in dark political times, there are few better balms than reading about the routine of a politician, and reassuring because it proves that AOC is one of us. Lisa Niven-Phillips, the beauty editor of Vogue.co.uk, saw her endorsement as pivotal to her success as a politician: \u201cThe thing with AOC is that she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s too trivial to talk about, which is honest \u2013 and promotes the idea that people can be multifaceted. I love the transparency; that\u2019s how she got millennials on board, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Niven-Phillips came across the regime in Seoul six years ago and has since upped her skincare count to six steps. Like AOC, she double cleanses (a thick one to take off makeup, less thick to actually wash) uses a vitamin C serum, a hydrating serum, a little moisturiser and, twice a week, an exfoliant. If going to a party, she uses a sheet mask: \u201cThey\u2019re good for immediacy, rather than any long-term benefits,\u201d she adds. And, for anyone asking, the whole thing takes five minutes, and means she wears less makeup as a result. \u201cThat was always the idea \u2013 to improve your skin first so you didn\u2019t need to then cover it in makeup.\u201d Anita Bhagwandas, the former beauty editor of Stylist, agrees. She has seven or eight steps \u2013 including the double cleanse \u2013 and more in the winter. \u201cI always thought the multi-step regime was a myth,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it seems perfectly normal. I don\u2019t know why there is so much fuss and mystery surrounding it.\u201d The whole thing takes less than 10 minutes, and she, too, wears less makeup as a result. \u201cThe natural skin look on Instagram has definitely replaced the contouring one.\u201d My own routine is based largely around curiosity and eBay samples of products I\u2019ve read about. In the past few weeks I have tried double cleansing (micellar water to remove dirt, something foamy to wash) and slathering Sunday Riley\u2019s teal-coloured Luna oil on my face.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. President denounces \u2018ridiculous partisan investigations\u2019 Donald Trump began his second State of the Union address on Tuesday by calling on both parties in Congress to \u201cembrace the boundless potential of cooperation\u201d. But the rest of his speech did little to encourage unity as he threatened the economy would be harmed by \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d \u2013 an apparent reference to the Mueller inquiry \u2013 and restated his commitment to building a wall on what he called the \u201clawless\u201d US-Mexico border: the very issue that caused the recent government shutdown and saw the State of the Union delayed by a week. North Korea. Trump confirmed he would meet Kim Jong-un for a second summit in Vietnam at the end of February, also suggesting that, without his presidency, the US would now \u201cbe in a major war with North Korea\u201d. Key takeaways. Sabrina Siddiqui identifies five key points in Trump\u2019s speech, from his foreign policy pledge to avoid \u201cendless wars\u201d, to a preview of his 2020 campaign strategy. Women in white lead opposition to Trump\u2019s agenda Trump earned a rare standing ovation from the whole chamber when he noted the progress of women in the US workforce \u2013 including those in Congress, at least 100 of whom had worn \u201csuffragette white\u201d partly as a rebuke to his leadership. Meanwhile, it was Stacey Abrams \u2013 the recent loser of Georgia\u2019s close and controversial gubernatorial race \u2013 who delivered the Democratic response to Trump\u2019s speech, saying \u201cimmigrants, not walls\u201d, make the country stronger. Trump the unifier? Richard Wolffe argues that the president has, in fact, succeeded in bringing Washington together over the past 12 months \u2013 in horror. Brazilian dam workers warned of disaster before deadly collapse More than 140 people are dead and almost 200 still missing after the collapse of a dam in January at a mining facility near Brumadinho in Brazil\u2019s Minas Gerais state. Three mine workers told the Guardian they warned of a disaster after the dam suffered a leak last July, which they say compromised its safety. It was the second fatal dam collapse in under four years at a facility owned by the Brazilian mining multinational Vale, whose spokeswoman said in an email that \u201cthere was no leak in the dam\u201d at Brumadinho. Mining waste. Some 600 people were in the mine\u2019s canteen and administrative area when the dam collapsed on 25 January, releasing 11.7m cubic metres of waste mud and ore. LGBTQ domestic abuse victims unprotected in North Carolina The attorney general of North Carolina, Josh Stein, has told the Guardian it is time to fix his state\u2019s statute regarding domestic violence, which currently applies only to people whose abusers are \u201cpersons of the opposite sex\u201d. That makes the tar heel state the last in the US to take a domestic violence victim\u2019s sexual orientation into account when considering whether they can access a protective order, as Alexandra Villareal reports. Southern comfort. South Carolina and Louisiana both extended their domestic violence protections to LGBTQ people in 2017. Crib sheet Elizabeth Warren has apologised \u201cfor furthering confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship\u201d after the Washington Post reported that she listed her race as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d on her registration for the Texas state bar in 1986. A red carpet event for the New York premiere of Liam Neeson\u2019s film Cold Pursuit was cancelled on Tuesday after the actor\u2019s admission that he once sought to kill a black man after a friend told him she had been raped by a black attacker. A 21-year-old woman has died from smoke inhalation in Nepal after being forced to sleep in a windowless shed because she was menstruating. She is the fourth person known to have died already in 2019 as a result of the illegal practice, known as chhaupadi. Environmental campaigners have offered Pope Francis a $1m donation to the charity of his choice if he accepts their challenge to go vegan for Lent. Listen to Today in Focus: rescued from Syria after Isis fell Mahmud and Ayyub Ferreira were abducted by their father in 2014 and spirited to Syria to live under the Islamic State. Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith and the Guardian\u2019s Joshua Surtees explain how they helped reunite the boys with their mother. Must-reads The inside story of Friends Twenty-five years after its TV debut, Friends is a mega-hit for a second time as the world\u2019s most-streamed show. Sirin Kale hears the behind-the-scenes history from its supporting cast and crew, while young Guardian readers explain why it still strikes a chord. Parkland\u2019s drama students start over A year after the shootings at Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, HBO is airing a new documentary that follows the school\u2019s drama students as they rehearse for their annual children\u2019s musical in the shadow of the tragedy. Adrian Horton reports. Forget standing desks and get moving Doctor James Levine, a leading expert on sedentary behaviour, sparked the trend for standing desks. But now he says most people missed the point: \u201cIt\u2019s not the furniture that makes the difference\u201d to health, he tells Christopher Keyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the behaviour.\u201d How globalised music created a new kind of star The rise of acts such as the Korean boyband BTS and the Puerto Rican singer Ozuna means English is no longer pop\u2019s lingua franca. The likes of Katy Perry and Justin Timberlake are being replaced by global stars oblivious to genre boundaries, writes Caroline Sullivan. Opinion Washington and Moscow have mutually withdrawn from the nuclear weapons treaty that kept Europe safe for 30 years, a move that demonstrates Trump\u2019s disdain for the EU. Yet the response in Westminster has been muted by Brexit, says Rafael Behr. A global monument to the triumph of diplomatic rationality over militaristic paranoia is being pulled down. Sport Bryce Harper and Manny Machado are two of the best hitters in the MLB, yet both men remain without a team just a week before Spring Training. That\u2019s because no team is prepared to pay for them, says Hunter Felt, despite the league pulling in $10bn a year. MLS and the Scottish Premiership are both unable to compete financially with the big European leagues, which is why they have developed an unexpectedly close transatlantic relationship, writes Graham Ruthven.

The last eight years have demoralised the Polish United Workers\u2019 Party to the point where even the reactionaries lack passionate intensity. If there is no Yeltsin, there is no Ligachev either. The centrist rhetoric of Party reform - General Jaruzeslki\u2019s denunciation of \u2018bureaucracy and arrogance,\u2019 Mr Orzechowski\u2019s appeal not to be content with \u2018cosmetic and superficial corrections\u2019 - has the ring of irresolution.

But he illustrated the true dialectic of shared failure when, after his talks last week with the influential Interior Minister General Kiszczak, he concluded that \u2018we are doomed to agreement\u2019. He agreed too with Premier Rakowski, a prime mover behind the new dialogue: \u2018We are in the same country and thus in the same camp.\u2019 For Mr Walesa, the decision to close down the Lenin Shipyard has also closed definitively the route of industrial action. \u2018We shall never solve our problems with strikes,\u2019 he said last week, speaking directly to his internal opposition - the Solidarity Working Group, which warns against a political game with the authorities.

And Solidarity has gained the government\u2019s reluctant agreement to peg wages to 80 per cent of the inflation rate. Put another way, it has agreed to a 20 per cent drop in its potential membership\u2019s standard of living.</p> <p>The government side only agreed to the indexation \u2018for social, not economic reasons\u2019 says Mr Bielecki, indicating that much harsher austerity measures are needed. Indeed, in the corridors of power in the party central committee building; apparatchiks argue with Thatcherite zeal about the urgency of transforming popular attitudes in favour of neo-monetarist policies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Alfred Miodowicz, the maverik in the round table pack who was responsible for the high-drama farce on Wednesday night, pursues what Solidarity insists is a tactic aimed at subverting the entire historic agreement. As head of the OPZZ, the official union movement, he insists his members will not bear the brunt of \u2018free market\u2019 policies.</p> <p>On the orthodox left of the ruling party, Mr Miodowicz can marshal support among the hardliners seeing their power monopoly eroded.</p> <p>Despite Solidarity\u2019s and the government\u2019s opposition, there are a lot of vested interests which would not be saddened by Mr Miodowicz\u2019s success. But the conflicts of interest and profound differences notwithstanding, both Solidarity and the reformist wing of the party say the desperation of the situation demands that the new social contract succeeds. Failure would mean \u2018chaos and civil war,\u2019 say Mr Walesa and Mr Bielecki. The round table accords are only a start, both sides agree.</p> <p>It would be a supreme irony if the first real chance to get rid of the generally discredited system, albeit gradually, was to founder on the rocks of popular unrest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ff0bcccc239a3a753ad3ae428e20dbcdae8d430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ff0bcccc239a3a753ad3ae428e20dbcdae8d430/0_0_1636_2048/799.jpg\" alt=\"Past and present Polish politicians gather at the Presidential Palace on 6 February 1999 to mark the 10th anniversary of the round table talks. \" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Past and present Polish politicians gather at the Presidential Palace on 6 February 1999 to mark the 10th anniversary of the round table talks. <br><br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Czarek Soko\u0142owski/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Polish reform package passed by parliament</h2> <p>8 April 1989<br>Ian Traynor<br>The Polish parliament yesterday passed a sweeping package of reform legislation that cleared the way for the reinstatement of Solidarity, the free trade union banned seven years ago.</p> <p>The laws, following on from Wednesday\u2019s round-table agreements between the government and opposition on the country\u2019s future, were passed overwhelmingly by the Sejm, or Parliament.</p> <p>Presenting the Bill on Trade Union Reform, Deputy Jozes Barecki said Poland faced \u2018a great problem of shaping a civil society and a socialist parliamentary democracy.\u2019</p> <p>In the voting, 339 were in favour and 43 abstained.

Mr Janusz Onyszkiewicz, the Solidarity spokesman, yesterday voiced \u2018cautious optimism\u2019 over the talks. They are expected to last about six weeks. Editorial: A Polish gavotte 7 February 1989 The spirit of jawnosc has tentatively broken out in Poland, where the round table talks between the government and the Solidarity opposition finally started yesterday. It is more than a lame translation of glasnost. While repudiation of the Brezhnev doctrine was a prerequisite for east European reform, Poland\u2019s loosening up is a product of Polish efforts to break free from its own noose.

Solidarity signs reform pact 6 April 1989 Ian Traynor Poland\u2019s government and opposition last night overcame last-minute hurdles to sign a blueprint for far-reaching political and economic reforms. The new social contract, drawn up after two months of bargaining at the celebrated round table, clears the way for Solidarity\u2019s re-entry to Polish life and curbs the power of the Communist Party that has ruled unchallenged for 40 years. After having led two months of negotiations, the Interior Minister, General Czeslaw Kiszczak, and Mr Lech Walesa, Solidarity\u2019s leader, put pen to paper amid the glare of television lights at the massive round table in a 17th-century Warsaw palace, once home to the Radziwill aristocrats. While Mr Walesa warned of the threat of civil war if the talks had failed, Gen Kiszczak said that there were neither winners or losers on either side. \u2018The Polish nation is the victor.\u2019 The agreement signalled Poland\u2019s first lesson in democracy, he said. \u2018There can be no further stalling on reform. Poles do not have the time, and cannot wait. Mr Walesa echoed the government talk of a new stage in democracy, but added that there was a long way to go. Under the accord, Solidarity will be once more made legal after being outlawed seven years ago after martial law was imposed. \u2018We came to the round table from prison under the truncheons of the Zomo riot police,\u2019 Mr Walesa said in a speech televised live to the country. The agreements also provide for changes to parliament, and elections which will see the opposition competing, to an initially limited extent, with the Communist Party. In addition to the Sejm, the lower house, a new 100-seat Senate or upper house is being set up, with an executive presidency. More than one third of Sejm seats are reserved for the opposition in elections scheduled for early June, and there are to be no allocated places in elections for the Senate. The powers of the Senate and the French-style presidency were still in dispute till late in the negotiations. Late last night, the fine print of the agreements remained unavailable, but Communist sources indicated that Solidarity had won concessions on curbing the president\u2019s powers and building in a requirement for a two-thirds Sejm vote to overrule Senate objections to legislation. The president can declare martial law, but only in the event of an \u2018external threat,\u2019 and also a state of emergency, which can be vetoed by parliament after three months, the sources said. In return for these innovations, the government has gained Solidarity\u2019s commitment to reforms in a bid to halt the economic crisis. A testing triumph: Polish gains and gambles 7 April 1989 Ian Traynor It was just under 200 years ago that Poland\u2019s reformists claimed their greatest triumph. The constitution of May 3, 1791 amounted to the climax of 20 years of reformist progress. Another triumph this week is being greeted as a similar milesotne. Solidarity comes in from the cold and the country braces itself for the freest elections in 40 years, even the ruling and threatened Communist Party is evoking the parallel. \u2018This is a historic day for Poland because after the constitution of May 3, the round table agreement is the first national consensus of all the forces,\u2019 says Mr Jozef Czyrek, veteran Politburo member. \u2018Polish political theatre,\u2019 he adds, pointing to the scenes on the TV screen in the corner of his office as the conclusion to eight weeks of round table talks is broadcast live to the nation. Theatre, indeed. The festive atmosphere threatened to turn to farce as political and procedural wrangling over the order of speakers interrupted the meeting for three hours. It was proof, if any was needed, that despite the sweeping reform package, profound differences and mistrust between the parties to the talks remains. The Communists admit that such mistrust is inevitable, while appearing desperate for a consensus with Solidarity in order to reverse the slide towards economic collapse. \u2018We know that the other side does not truly trust us and has a right not to,\u2019 says Mr Jerzy Bielecki, the deputy editor of the Party Daily, Trybunu Ludu. The talking is set to continue in an attempt to resolve the remaining disagreements. But Solidarity can justifiably claim a famous victory, though it is careful not to rub home the point too hard for fear of triggering a reaction. It has gained all its main points on the political front - legal functioning of independent unions, free elections to a new upper house, and curbs on the powers of General Jaruzelski if he is elected to the new executive presidencey. Glasnost and the new liberalisation are making their presence felt here. Radical student literature is freely touted on the streets. The once boycotted film director, Andrzej Waja, has just been appointed artistic director of the state-run Powszechny Theatre, currently staging plays by Vaclav Havel, the Czech dissident recently jailed in Prague. Solidarity will soon be publishing its own newspaper and gaining access to the state-run media. But in return for the glasnost and political perestroika, it has agreed to behave itself as the government\u2019s economic reform programme begins to bite. Herein lies its dilemma. As a trade union its primary function is to represent its workers\u2019 interests, but everyone agrees those interests have to suffer if there is to be any longer-term recovery. Solidarity intellectuals appear to realise this, but the big question as the union embarks on a new recruitment drive as a legal entity is whether a long-suffering public is prepared to suffer much longer. It was difficult to get hold of a loaf of bread in Warsaw this week. Bread rolls, by contrast, were available. The trouble is that because of the way prices are set, the cooperative bakers of the capital can make a profit on rolls, but not on loaves. Such an economic anomoly is merely the tip of an iceberg of problems in an economy marred by massive foreign debt, almost 100 per cent inflation, woeful industrial performance, food and consumer goods shortages, and a huge alternative black economy. Lech Walesa said yesterday that the reborn Solidarity hopes to attract some 5-7 million members - not quite the 10 million of 1981. And Solidarity has gained the government\u2019s reluctant agreement to peg wages to 80 per cent of the inflation rate. Put another way, it has agreed to a 20 per cent drop in its potential membership\u2019s standard of living. The government side only agreed to the indexation \u2018for social, not economic reasons\u2019 says Mr Bielecki, indicating that much harsher austerity measures are needed. Indeed, in the corridors of power in the party central committee building; apparatchiks argue with Thatcherite zeal about the urgency of transforming popular attitudes in favour of neo-monetarist policies. Meanwhile, Alfred Miodowicz, the maverik in the round table pack who was responsible for the high-drama farce on Wednesday night, pursues what Solidarity insists is a tactic aimed at subverting the entire historic agreement. As head of the OPZZ, the official union movement, he insists his members will not bear the brunt of \u2018free market\u2019 policies. On the orthodox left of the ruling party, Mr Miodowicz can marshal support among the hardliners seeing their power monopoly eroded. Despite Solidarity\u2019s and the government\u2019s opposition, there are a lot of vested interests which would not be saddened by Mr Miodowicz\u2019s success. But the conflicts of interest and profound differences notwithstanding, both Solidarity and the reformist wing of the party say the desperation of the situation demands that the new social contract succeeds. Failure would mean \u2018chaos and civil war,\u2019 say Mr Walesa and Mr Bielecki. The round table accords are only a start, both sides agree. It would be a supreme irony if the first real chance to get rid of the generally discredited system, albeit gradually, was to founder on the rocks of popular unrest. Polish reform package passed by parliament 8 April 1989 Ian Traynor The Polish parliament yesterday passed a sweeping package of reform legislation that cleared the way for the reinstatement of Solidarity, the free trade union banned seven years ago. The laws, following on from Wednesday\u2019s round-table agreements between the government and opposition on the country\u2019s future, were passed overwhelmingly by the Sejm, or Parliament. Presenting the Bill on Trade Union Reform, Deputy Jozes Barecki said Poland faced \u2018a great problem of shaping a civil society and a socialist parliamentary democracy.\u2019 In the voting, 339 were in favour and 43 abstained. With the new legislation on the statute book, it now only remains for Solidarity to register itself with the authorities. This is expected to follow next week. The Sejm also endorsed changes to the constitution in advance of elections in June. Polish society wanted the organs of state modelled in such a way as to \u2018secure pluralism and differences that reflect a true image of the nation\u2019, said Mr Tadeusz Szelachowski, delivering the report on the constitutional changes. The Communist Party\u2019s leading economic reformer, meanwhile, yesterday suggested a joint campaign with the opposition to gain western funds to head off a deepening economic crisis. Mr Wladyslaw Baka, a party politburo member, said the government and Solidarity could work together in an attempt to have western credit restrictions lifted. Referring to the remarks by Mr Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader, that he would beg for western help, Mr Baka said: \u2018Perhaps Mr Walesa has started a campaign. We are very satisfied with this. Perhaps we can overcome the credit blockade if we work together.\u2019 Mr Baka stressed that Poland was not seeking special terms or treatment from the major western financial bodies. \u2018We just want normal treatment.\u2019 Poland was spending Dollars 2 billion a year to service its Dollars 39 billion foreign debt against an export-earning capacity of Dollars 8 billion, he added. While encouraged by the positive responses in the west to Wednesday\u2019s round-table agreement, Mr Baka called for action to back up the words. \u2018Now we expect some rain to fall from these sympathetic clouds.\u2019 Solidarity sources, meanwhile, accused Communist Party hardliners of seeking to undermine the round-table accords by fomenting farmers\u2019 strikes in the east of the country. Mr Jacek Szymanderski, of Rural Solidarity, the free union representing private farmers which is also about to be relegalised, said half the private farmers in parts of eastern Poland had been on strike for a fortnight. They were refusing to sell meat and milk to the state because of high production costs and low prices.",

In the first chapter, Khan explores <em>mezze</em>, the vivid, often plant-based dishes associated with the Galilee; it includes three recipes for hummus, a rich shakshuka, various flatbreads, and a salad that teams salty halloumi with orange, dates and pomegranate seeds. From the West Bank, Khan showcases gutsy stews, breads, and meat dishes influenced by both Bedouin and Jordanian cooking; the main courses chapter includes a recipe for <em>mussakhan</em>, a concoction of roast chicken seasoned with sumac and served with caramelized onions over <em>taboon </em>flatbread, one of the national dishes of Palestine. The food of Gaza, which Khan couldn\u2019t visit due to the blockade that cuts it off from the rest of Palestine, is meanwhile bright with fresh dill, green chilies and garlic, all of which find happy expression in a spicy shrimp and tomato stew recipe.</p> <p>But for all of its vibrancy, Gazan food is also in danger of extinction: the blockade, as Khan writes, has plunged the region into food poverty and is eradicating its once-thriving fishing industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f23fdfabe63e942062a81b52f9ade2b463a23b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f23fdfabe63e942062a81b52f9ade2b463a23b1/0_0_2500_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yasmin Khan at Taheni, a Mediterranean restaurant in Park Slope, Brooklyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yasmin Khan at Taheni, a Mediterranean restaurant in Park Slope, Brooklyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heather Sten/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing about Gazan cooking was just one of the challenges specific to writing about food in a place of conflict; it is impossible to talk about Palestinian cuisine, Khan learned, without acknowledging the effects of the Israeli occupation. As one woman angrily told her: \u201cWe are not clowns in a circus for you to come and watch and make research notes about and then make your name from writing down our suffering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was just really hard,\u201d Khan, 37, says of figuring out how to strike a balance between depicting Palestinian food and the realities informing it. \u201cI had this idea of, OK, I\u2019m going to go write a cookbook and describe the situation, but it had been five years since I\u2019d been and had forgotten the intensity and the trauma.\u201d</p> <p>After her first research trip in 2016, Khan came back \u201ccompletely unsure if I could do the book\u201d, she admits with the thoughtful candor that characterizes her writing. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I could accurately represent the really painful situations I\u2019d witnessed. Writing a cookbook felt so trite.\u201d</p> <p>But not long into the almost year-and-a-half-long process of researching and writing Zaitoun, Khan realized that she could use the book as a window into what she had seen. \u201cI felt it was quite important to include these challenging voices,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very important to me to have Palestinians in their own voices sharing how their lives are, but it was challenging.\u201d</p> <p>Khan covered similarly daunting territory with her first cookbook, The Saffron Tales. Published in 2016, it is a vibrant compilation of recipes and stories from another widely misunderstood place: Iran, the country where Khan\u2019s mother grew up and many of her relatives still live. \u201cI came to realize after the success of The Saffron Tales<em> </em>that there was a powerful role that food could play in exploring countries in the Middle East,\u201d Khan says. \u201cAnd I also think I stepped into more what I think is now my mission of challenging stereotypes of the Middle East.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a mission that Khan has on some level been preparing for her entire life. Born in London, she was just three months old when her mother, who was working on her PhD in nutrition, took her to Iran to conduct field research. Then the Iran-Iraq war happened, and the borders closed. She and her mother stayed in Iran for a few years, before reuniting with her father in the UK.

In 1998, when Rawia Bishara opened Tanoreen, her Middle Eastern restaurant in Brooklyn, \u201cthere was this overwhelming idea that all Palestinians are terrorists and they carry the guns\u201d, says Bishara, who immigrated to the US from Nazareth in 1974. When she told her early customers she was from Palestine, many of them thought she was from Pakistan. \u201cEvery time I said \u2018Palestine\u2019, they said, \u2018Pakistan\u2019,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>But now, Bishara adds, \u201cthey realize we are a whole culture; we don\u2019t come from 1948 [the year the state of Israel was created].

The pair will host a dinner showcasing the book\u2019s recipes during the Bay Area leg of Khan\u2019s upcoming book tour.</p> <p>\u201cI think talking about the conflict is not a bad thing,\u201d Assil says of Khan\u2019s decision to juxtapose it with beautiful photos of delicious food. \u201cWhen you talk about the conflict you talk about the resilience of people. I\u2019m speaking as a Palestinian now \u2013 when we talk about any subject related to our culture or upbringing, for better or worse the war and all these things are so normalized.\u201d</p> <p>Khan, she adds, \u201cis going in there and keeping people\u2019s memories fresh and alive, and talking about the origin and evolution of the food is part of that. We don\u2019t have to shy away from politics. As a reader, you\u2019re partaking in that by buying the book and cooking that food.\u201d</p> <p>Khan herself has been pleasantly surprised by the book\u2019s reception in the UK, just as she was by The Saffron Tale\u2019s. \u201cA few people have written saying they\u2019ve been moved to tears by the book, which I think is unusual for a cookbook,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d</p> <p>Last September, Khan posted photos to Instagram from another place shaped by conflict: a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. When asked if her visit had anything to do with an upcoming project, she demurs. \u201cI can\u2019t really talk about my next book publicly yet, but you can take from that what you want,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think going forward I\u2019m really committed to continuing to do what I can to use the power of story and cookery to shine a light on places of conflict.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c09cb8c276879b9e46a7132cbea8c7c9ab257cc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c09cb8c276879b9e46a7132cbea8c7c9ab257cc4/0_0_2600_3497/743.jpg\" alt=\"Seared halloumi with orange, dates and pomegranate.\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seared halloumi with orange, dates and pomegranate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: W.

      "bodyText": "Most cookbooks begin with the promise of transporting the reader to a happy place. Yasmin Khan\u2019s new cookbook, Zaitoun: Recipes From the Palestinian Kitchen, begins by transporting the reader to the Tel Aviv airport interrogation rooms where Khan, a Briton of Iranian-Pakistani heritage, was questioned for several hours after flying into Israel. \u201cI just decided I needed to tell the truth,\u201d Khan says about her cookbook\u2019s introduction. \u201cI thought it was important for me to start the book with that because we do live in context; while Israeli food is booming, this other side isn\u2019t represented.\u201d Zaitoun, which was published yesterday in the US, is the newest of a recent crop of Palestinian cookbooks attempting to remedy that, including the London-based Palestinian chef Joudie Kalla\u2019s 2016 Palestine on a Plate and The Palestinian Table, a 2017 volume from Reem Kassis, a Philadelphia-based Palestinian cookbook author. It reads as much as the story of the Palestinian people as their food, interweaving the anecdotes of home cooks and professional chefs with more than 80 recipes. The book\u2019s chapters are organized by course, interspersed with stories about Palestinian culture. In the first chapter, Khan explores mezze, the vivid, often plant-based dishes associated with the Galilee; it includes three recipes for hummus, a rich shakshuka, various flatbreads, and a salad that teams salty halloumi with orange, dates and pomegranate seeds. From the West Bank, Khan showcases gutsy stews, breads, and meat dishes influenced by both Bedouin and Jordanian cooking; the main courses chapter includes a recipe for mussakhan, a concoction of roast chicken seasoned with sumac and served with caramelized onions over taboon flatbread, one of the national dishes of Palestine. The food of Gaza, which Khan couldn\u2019t visit due to the blockade that cuts it off from the rest of Palestine, is meanwhile bright with fresh dill, green chilies and garlic, all of which find happy expression in a spicy shrimp and tomato stew recipe. But for all of its vibrancy, Gazan food is also in danger of extinction: the blockade, as Khan writes, has plunged the region into food poverty and is eradicating its once-thriving fishing industry. Writing about Gazan cooking was just one of the challenges specific to writing about food in a place of conflict; it is impossible to talk about Palestinian cuisine, Khan learned, without acknowledging the effects of the Israeli occupation. As one woman angrily told her: \u201cWe are not clowns in a circus for you to come and watch and make research notes about and then make your name from writing down our suffering.\u201d \u201cIt was just really hard,\u201d Khan, 37, says of figuring out how to strike a balance between depicting Palestinian food and the realities informing it. \u201cI had this idea of, OK, I\u2019m going to go write a cookbook and describe the situation, but it had been five years since I\u2019d been and had forgotten the intensity and the trauma.\u201d After her first research trip in 2016, Khan came back \u201ccompletely unsure if I could do the book\u201d, she admits with the thoughtful candor that characterizes her writing. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I could accurately represent the really painful situations I\u2019d witnessed. Writing a cookbook felt so trite.\u201d But not long into the almost year-and-a-half-long process of researching and writing Zaitoun, Khan realized that she could use the book as a window into what she had seen. \u201cI felt it was quite important to include these challenging voices,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very important to me to have Palestinians in their own voices sharing how their lives are, but it was challenging.\u201d Khan covered similarly daunting territory with her first cookbook, The Saffron Tales. Published in 2016, it is a vibrant compilation of recipes and stories from another widely misunderstood place: Iran, the country where Khan\u2019s mother grew up and many of her relatives still live. \u201cI came to realize after the success of The Saffron Tales that there was a powerful role that food could play in exploring countries in the Middle East,\u201d Khan says. \u201cAnd I also think I stepped into more what I think is now my mission of challenging stereotypes of the Middle East.\u201d It\u2019s a mission that Khan has on some level been preparing for her entire life. Born in London, she was just three months old when her mother, who was working on her PhD in nutrition, took her to Iran to conduct field research. Then the Iran-Iraq war happened, and the borders closed. She and her mother stayed in Iran for a few years, before reuniting with her father in the UK. The family settled in Birmingham when Khan was six. At various points during the eight-year war, Khan returned to Iran with her mother despite the tumult there. \u201cIt was a very intense time, but we kept going back,\u201d she says. She had close family members who were jailed or executed, and remembers sneaking snacks to her imprisoned uncle on Nowruz and then milking cows on her grandparents\u2019 rice farm. \u201cA psychologist probably wouldn\u2019t take much to realize that my childhood, and seeing the backdrop of Iran and the horrors unfolding there led me to do a law degree with a view to being a human rights lawyer,\u201d Khan says with a laugh. She became a human rights campaigner for a decade, eventually succumbing to career fatigue in 2013. As she pondered what to do next, she got the idea to write what would become The Saffron Tales, funding her first research trip to Iran through a successful Kickstarter campaign. \u201cThere was a huge gap in the market for Iranian cookbooks,\u201d she says. \u201cBut more than that, there were no nuanced depictions of Iran other than what you\u2019d see in the news.\u201d As The Saffron Tales earned critical acclaim, Khan quickly came upon the idea for her follow-up. During her last few years in the non-profit sector, she had traveled throughout Israel and the West Bank as part of her NGO work on Israeli-Palestinian relations \u2013 \u201cIt probably caused my burnout,\u201d she says wryly. But the food and flavors were familiar to her, and Khan saw an opportunity to explore another place that, like Iran, \u201cis often narrowly seen through a political prism\u201d. Khan\u2019s heritage and human rights work have earned her the respect of a number of Palestinian chefs, many of whom have had to endure their share of stereotypes, even as they have watched attitudes towards Palestinians begin to shift over the years. In 1998, when Rawia Bishara opened Tanoreen, her Middle Eastern restaurant in Brooklyn, \u201cthere was this overwhelming idea that all Palestinians are terrorists and they carry the guns\u201d, says Bishara, who immigrated to the US from Nazareth in 1974.

But now, Bishara adds, \u201cthey realize we are a whole culture; we don\u2019t come from 1948 [the year the state of Israel was created].

      "body": "<p>When Jama Nurkalieva and a small group of colleagues conducted a site survey of a disused Soviet-era panoramic cinema in Almaty, the former capital of Kazakhstan, they had no idea what lay behind the internal plasterboard wall that faces out towards the street \u2013 until someone spotted a narrow gap.</p> <p>As the caretaker shined a light into the darkness behind, the group caught a glimpse of a man\u2019s head. Out came the toolbox and the rest of the artwork was slowly revealed: a Soviet-era <em>sgraffito</em> by the graphic artist <a href=\"http://www.gmirk.kz/en/sobytiya/286-lang-ru-personalnaya-vystavka-evgeniya-sidorkina-1930-1982-k-85-letiyu-lang-lang-kz-evgenij-sidorkinni-1930-1982-tu-anyna-85-zhyl-toluyna-arnal-an-k-rmesi-lang-lang-en-evgeniy-sidorkin-s-85th-anniversary-solo-exhibition-lang\">Eugeny Sidorkin</a> that had been lost and forgotten for decades.</p> <p>From the Italian <em>graffiare</em>, to scratch, sgraffito is a technique that involves placing one layer of plaster or cement over another, and then scratching through the superficial layer to reveal contours or patterns beneath.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zwz7BeD1_I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Zwz7BeD1_I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>How the hidden Sidorkin sgraffito was discovered.</figcaption> </figure>   <ul> <li><p>Discovery of the hidden Sidorkin sgraffito</p></li> </ul> <p>Built to a standardised design in 1964, the cinema was one of the largest in the USSR. It was fronted entirely by large panels of glass that offered an unobstructed view of the sgraffito to passersby.</p> <p>Now the former cinema is being repurposed as the Tselinny Centre of Contemporary Culture. The discovery of a work by Sidorkin \u2013 honoured as People\u2019s Artist of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic before his death in 1982 \u2013 is particularly exciting, says centre director Nurkalieva. The sgraffito is being brought back to its former glory by restoration experts, along with the architect Asif Khan and Sidorkin\u2019s son Vadim, an artist.</p> <p>The sgraffito was not the only Soviet-era art uncovered in Almaty last year.

      "bodyText": "When Jama Nurkalieva and a small group of colleagues conducted a site survey of a disused Soviet-era panoramic cinema in Almaty, the former capital of Kazakhstan, they had no idea what lay behind the internal plasterboard wall that faces out towards the street \u2013 until someone spotted a narrow gap. As the caretaker shined a light into the darkness behind, the group caught a glimpse of a man\u2019s head. Out came the toolbox and the rest of the artwork was slowly revealed: a Soviet-era sgraffito by the graphic artist Eugeny Sidorkin that had been lost and forgotten for decades. From the Italian graffiare, to scratch, sgraffito is a technique that involves placing one layer of plaster or cement over another, and then scratching through the superficial layer to reveal contours or patterns beneath. Discovery of the hidden Sidorkin sgraffito Built to a standardised design in 1964, the cinema was one of the largest in the USSR. It was fronted entirely by large panels of glass that offered an unobstructed view of the sgraffito to passersby. Now the former cinema is being repurposed as the Tselinny Centre of Contemporary Culture. The discovery of a work by Sidorkin \u2013 honoured as People\u2019s Artist of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic before his death in 1982 \u2013 is particularly exciting, says centre director Nurkalieva. The sgraffito is being brought back to its former glory by restoration experts, along with the architect Asif Khan and Sidorkin\u2019s son Vadim, an artist. The sgraffito was not the only Soviet-era art uncovered in Almaty last year. Dennis Keen, founder of the Monumental Almaty website, uncovered a 1984 mosaic of Lenin at the Kazakhstan Academy of Science in September. The work, by Vladimir Tverdokhlebov and a team of artists, had been boarded up for more than 20 years. \u201cThere is a major interest in Soviet imagery and especially Lenin,\u201d says Keen, but the mosaic will be hidden from public gaze by a curtain on account of its political sensitivity.

Keegan\u2019s tirade is still viewed millions of times over as a meme to signify a meltdown. But Eric Cantona\u2019s solitary goals in 1-0 wins for Manchester United just as accurately explain why the momentum in the title race so thrillingly switched from Tyneside to Manchester. On 20 January 1996 Peter Beardsley lashed home a volley to secure a 2-1 win over Bolton and take Newcastle 12 points clear of United. A day later Cantona, who had recently returned from his nine-month ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/23/eric-cantona-manchester-united-crystal-palace-kung-fu-kick\">for impersonating Bruce Lee</a>, lashed the ball past West Ham\u2019s Ludek Miklosko to kickstart United\u2019s chase. Solitary goals by Cantona won five games during the season; by the beginning of April previously swashbuckling Newcastle were ragged and rattled after Cantona did the 1-0 trick three times in little over a month, including an incredibly damaging result at St James\u2019s Park on 4 March that closed the gap to one point.</p> \n<p>The race now resembled the T-1000 chasing the Anthill mob. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/25/premier-league-best-match-liverpool-newcastle-april-1996\">That</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/25/premier-league-best-match-liverpool-newcastle-april-1996\"> 4-3 defeat at Anfield</a> left Newcastle psychologically jiggered and five days later they lost at champions Blackburn, who had been rubbish for most of the season. And even though United suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/15/sport.comment2\">a grey shirt-inspired wobble</a> in a 3-1 defeat at Southampton, Cantona\u2019s economical brilliance ensured Newcastle were shot by the time Keegan started yelping into the microphone at Elland Road. The \u201cEntertainers\u201d finished the season unable to entertain, drawing their final two games 1-1 while ruthlessly efficient United walloped Nottingham Forest 5-0 and Middlesbrough 3-0. Cantona did his 1-0 act once more to good effect, securing the Double against Liverpool at Wembley.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0fa24413-9ffe-4ea0-ae65-02e8028819bd\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>1 Man Utd P&nbsp;</b>38<b>&nbsp;W&nbsp;</b>25<b>&nbsp;D </b>7<b>&nbsp;L </b>6<b>&nbsp;GD&nbsp;</b>+38&nbsp;<b>Pts&nbsp;</b>82<br><b>2 Newcastle&nbsp;</b><b>P</b>&nbsp;38&nbsp;<b>W</b>&nbsp;24&nbsp;<b>D</b>&nbsp;6&nbsp;<b>L</b>&nbsp;8&nbsp;<b>GD</b>&nbsp;+29&nbsp;<b>Pts</b>&nbsp;78&nbsp;<br><b>3 Liverpool&nbsp;</b><b>P&nbsp;</b>38<b>&nbsp;W&nbsp;</b>20<b>&nbsp;D&nbsp;</b>11<b>&nbsp;L&nbsp;</b>7 <b>GD&nbsp;</b>+36<b>&nbsp;Pts</b>&nbsp;71</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1fe8878fa2ac51a28f44bf2c5fdc7565a1a87df\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1fe8878fa2ac51a28f44bf2c5fdc7565a1a87df/0_59_1823_1093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Cantona fires home to secure a 1-0 win over Newcastle as Manchester United hauled the league-leaders in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric Cantona fires home to secure a 1-0 win over Newcastle as Manchester United hauled the league-leaders in.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5) Serie A (1987-88)</h2> \n<p>Napoli\u2019s extraordinary meltdown to hand the title they won the previous season to Milan is still the source of much debate.

We didn\u2019t have many fixtures left and we were five points ahead [in an era of two points for a win]. Then on 17 April we lost 3-1 against Juventus in Turin. We didn\u2019t win a single match after that: week after week it was the same, each result worse than the last \u2026 We picked up just one point in five games. We lost a championship that we couldn\u2019t lose and that\u2019s when people started talking crap \u2026 [Ottavio] Bianchi, the wanker, had started experimenting and had left Giordano out.

But Frode Johnsen popped up for the champions to give them a 3-1 lead \u2013 and the virtual title again \u2013 in the 70th minute before Valerenga\u2019s Erik Hagen and Daniel Fredheim Holm scored in the 81st and 83rd minutes. They led 3-0. The bunting was being readied in Oslo \u2026 until Johnsen struck in the 89th minute to level the goal difference at +18. Crucially, though, Rosenborg had scored 12 more than the pretenders to their throne. The game ended in Trondheim but Rosenberg\u2019s players could not yet toast another success \u2013 they had to huddle around a pitch-side screen to watch events in Oslo, where there were six minutes to play. They stared, mouths agape, as Valerenga\u2019s Morten Berre went clean through, but the winger fluffed his lines and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QojsexWCUPU&amp;t=15m40s\">sidefooted the ball straight at Stab\u00e6k keeper Jon Knudsen</a>.

They did not lose again in La Liga before the second cl\u00e1sico 18 games later. And they did not lose there either, the king of the stepover, Ronaldo, stepping around Victor Vald\u00e9s to seal a 2-1 victory. Four wins later Mourinho\u2019s side were crowned champions on a record 100 points, having scored a record 121 goals, 71 of which came in their last 23 games. 4) Premier League (1995-96) Alan Hansen\u2019s \u201cyou won\u2019t win anything with kids\u201d line and Kevin Keegan\u2019s \u201cI will love it if we beat them!\u201d rant are two enduring memories from this pulsating season. Keegan\u2019s tirade is still viewed millions of times over as a meme to signify a meltdown. But Eric Cantona\u2019s solitary goals in 1-0 wins for Manchester United just as accurately explain why the momentum in the title race so thrillingly switched from Tyneside to Manchester. On 20 January 1996 Peter Beardsley lashed home a volley to secure a 2-1 win over Bolton and take Newcastle 12 points clear of United. A day later Cantona, who had recently returned from his nine-month ban for impersonating Bruce Lee, lashed the ball past West Ham\u2019s Ludek Miklosko to kickstart United\u2019s chase. Solitary goals by Cantona won five games during the season; by the beginning of April previously swashbuckling Newcastle were ragged and rattled after Cantona did the 1-0 trick three times in little over a month, including an incredibly damaging result at St James\u2019s Park on 4 March that closed the gap to one point. The race now resembled the T-1000 chasing the Anthill mob. That 4-3 defeat at Anfield left Newcastle psychologically jiggered and five days later they lost at champions Blackburn, who had been rubbish for most of the season. And even though United suffered a grey shirt-inspired wobble in a 3-1 defeat at Southampton, Cantona\u2019s economical brilliance ensured Newcastle were shot by the time Keegan started yelping into the microphone at Elland Road. The \u201cEntertainers\u201d finished the season unable to entertain, drawing their final two games 1-1 while ruthlessly efficient United walloped Nottingham Forest 5-0 and Middlesbrough 3-0. Cantona did his 1-0 act once more to good effect, securing the Double against Liverpool at Wembley. 5) Serie A (1987-88) Napoli\u2019s extraordinary meltdown to hand the title they won the previous season to Milan is still the source of much debate. Did dark forces have a hand in it? Diego Maradona\u2019s having none of it and sums it up succinctly \u2013 and entertainingly \u2013 in his autobiography: It was said that Napoli sold out. That we\u2019d given the title away under pressure from the bookies. I will never understand why we fell the way we did at the end \u2026 we got 87% of the points on offer in the first 19 fixtures, an historical record. We didn\u2019t have many fixtures left and we were five points ahead [in an era of two points for a win]. Then on 17 April we lost 3-1 against Juventus in Turin. We didn\u2019t win a single match after that: week after week it was the same, each result worse than the last \u2026 We picked up just one point in five games. We lost a championship that we couldn\u2019t lose and that\u2019s when people started talking crap \u2026 [Ottavio] Bianchi, the wanker, had started experimenting and had left Giordano out. Everything went to shit. 6) Norway\u2019s Eliteserien (2004) Michael Thomas at Anfield in 1989; Andy Cole\u2019s miss at West Ham in 1995; Bayern-Schalke and those four minutes in May 2001; Ag\u00fceroooooooooo for Manchester City in 2012; all wonderful examples of last-day drama but here\u2019s a frantic finish you might not know about. Fifteen years ago, in Norway, fingernails were chewed in their thousands. Rosenborg had won the title 12 seasons in a row but Valerenga had got themselves back in the race with a 4-1 away win against the champions and kept pace until the final day. With both teams on 45 points and +15 goal difference, Rosenborg faced Lyn and Valerenga played Stab\u00e6k, both winnable home matches. A game of nerve-shredding title-tennis ensued as Valerenga led 1-0 before Rosenborg scored twice and then conceded. But Frode Johnsen popped up for the champions to give them a 3-1 lead \u2013 and the virtual title again \u2013 in the 70th minute before Valerenga\u2019s Erik Hagen and Daniel Fredheim Holm scored in the 81st and 83rd minutes. They led 3-0. The bunting was being readied in Oslo \u2026 until Johnsen struck in the 89th minute to level the goal difference at +18. Crucially, though, Rosenborg had scored 12 more than the pretenders to their throne. The game ended in Trondheim but Rosenberg\u2019s players could not yet toast another success \u2013 they had to huddle around a pitch-side screen to watch events in Oslo, where there were six minutes to play. They stared, mouths agape, as Valerenga\u2019s Morten Berre went clean through, but the winger fluffed his lines and sidefooted the ball straight at Stab\u00e6k keeper Jon Knudsen. Cue bedlam at Rosenberg, who were champions again.",

The article, published in April 2017, reported on Burgon\u2019s decision to record a track with the Leeds band Dream Tr\u00f6ll.

In reality, the judge concluded that Dream Tr\u00f6ll had simply tweeted a parody image of a classic Black Sabbath album cover and were not endorsing the Nazi paramilitary organisation. Burgon, a lifelong heavy metal fan who would be placed in charge of the legal system if Labour came to power, took the unusual decision to bring the libel case against the Sun and its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn. Burgon used the libel lawyers Carter-Ruck; the newspaper, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, is now facing substantial legal costs. The MP for Leeds East, who was in court to hear the judgment, has promised to spend the \u00a330,000 supporting an apprenticeship in Leeds; the newspaper has said it will appeal against the verdict.

Outside working hours, every pause seems almost reflexively to trigger a jolt of anxious guilt or shame that something \u2013 a laundry cycle, a tax return, a status update \u2013 remains undone.</p> <p>The effect of this permanent busyness is to leave us feeling that inactive states have no meaning or validity in themselves; that they exist only to be filled in with some content. Inactivity increasingly exists for us as the negative of our \u201creal\u201d lives of activity and purpose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/08/not-working-why-we-have-to-stop-by-josh-cohen-review\">Not Working: Why We Have to Stop by Josh Cohen \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In my book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/not-working-630124.html\">Not Working</a>, I try to counter this conception of human life by exploring various dimensions of inactivity. I don\u2019t idealise non-work, which can signify depression and indifference as much as creativity, but I do argue that it\u2019s an essential dimension of every human life, such that its loss impoverishes us imaginatively and emotionally.</p> <p>It\u2019s surely no surprise that much of the inspiration for the book came from reading. I\u2019m referring not only to the rich and varied literature on the subject, but equally to the act of reading itself. As anyone who makes a living from it will tell you, reading can be hard work. But turning away from the immediate demands of the \u201creal\u201d world to immerse oneself in a world made on the page \u2013 be it the speculative world of the philosopher or physicist, the reconstructed past of the historian, or the imaginary realms of the novelist or poet \u2013 is itself a refusal of the demand for useful productivity. It requires us to slow down, wait, be curious, avoid the headlong rush into practical action.</p> <p>Here, then, are the books I\u2019ve found most helpful in exploring inactivity, idleness and aimlessness in all their wonderfully various forms.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.openbookpublishers.com/reader/216#page/1/mode/2up\">Rameau\u2019s Nephew by Denis Diderot </a><br></strong>A kind of delirious inversion of a Platonic dialogue; replacing Socrates the lover of wisdom guiding his awed pupil towards the Good with Rameau the unconscionable and entitled slob instructing the half-amused, half-disgusted Diderot in the ways of gluttony and freeloading. Diderot, editor of the epic <em>Encyclop\u00e9die</em>, was himself a paragon of almost unfeasible intellectual productivity and a passionate advocate for human reason. Yet one of his most brilliant and seductive creations is this shamelessly unreasonable waster and his compelling argument for making very little effort in life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d2eb9bd46f0abf6864638479a986322f15c2547\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d2eb9bd46f0abf6864638479a986322f15c2547/122_0_1369_2048/668.jpg\" alt=\"Alexei Agapov as Oblomov in the stage adaptation of the novel at the Moscow Arts Academy.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexei Agapov as Oblomov in the Moscow Arts Academy\u2019s stage adaptation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UIG/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/oblomov-2.html\">Oblomov by Ivan Goncharov</a><br></strong>A pampered only child raised on an idyllic country estate, Oblomov is stuck with his aged, cantankerous manservant in a dusty St Petersburg apartment, unable to summon the will to get out of bed and face the ominous financial demands and administrative tasks proliferating around him. The rousing pep talks of his tireless, go-getting friend Stolz briefly propel him into life, but in the end Oblomov \u2013 whiny, self-pitying yet strangely lovable \u2013 can never resist the inexorable pull of inertia. No less than Lenin lamented the chronic malaise of \u201cOblomovitis\u201d affecting the Russian people. Good for them, I say.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307579/the-portable-thoreau-by-henry-david-thoreau/9780143106500/\">The Portable Thoreau by Henry David Thoreau</a><br></strong>This handy volume includes some of the best writings of the great American naturalist, essayist and political agitator. Walden, his record of a year-long experiment in living self-sufficiently, dares to imagine a life unencumbered by economic necessity and social obligation. Here and in great essays such as Walking and Life Without Principle, Thoreau enjoins us to the freedom of living aimlessly, guided by the lights of our own desires rather than the world\u2019s life-denying imperative of \u201cincessant business\u201d. The real pleasure is to be found in Thoreau\u2019s beautiful prose and singular voice \u2013 wry, often exasperated and just a little imperious.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/beyond-the-pleasure-principle.html\">Beyond the Pleasure Principle by Sigmund Freud</a><br></strong>This remains Freud\u2019s most controversial work, a bold and often startling foray into speculative biology and the outer edges of the human psyche. Its central idea of a \u201cdeath drive\u201d continues to trouble its critics, as well as inspire artists, writers and philosophers. The death drive is not primarily, as is sometimes claimed, an innate destructiveness, but a resistance to the growth and expansion inherent to life. The scandalous suggestion is that behind the impulse to do, make and expand is an older and ultimately more powerful urge to lassitude and stasis. Which makes sense to me.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/332/33263/the-decay-of-lying--and-other-essays/9780141192659.html\">The Decay of Lying and Other Essays by Oscar Wilde</a><br>\u201c</strong>To do nothing at all is the most difficult thing in the world.\u201d The red thread running through this anthology of some of Wilde\u2019s finest essays is his provocative disdain for action. In a surprising echo of Freud, he argues that it is always \u201cignorant of its direction\u201d.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re living in a culture governed by a permanent compulsion towards frenetic activity or fevered distraction. Outside working hours, every pause seems almost reflexively to trigger a jolt of anxious guilt or shame that something \u2013 a laundry cycle, a tax return, a status update \u2013 remains undone. The effect of this permanent busyness is to leave us feeling that inactive states have no meaning or validity in themselves; that they exist only to be filled in with some content. Inactivity increasingly exists for us as the negative of our \u201creal\u201d lives of activity and purpose. In my book Not Working, I try to counter this conception of human life by exploring various dimensions of inactivity. I don\u2019t idealise non-work, which can signify depression and indifference as much as creativity, but I do argue that it\u2019s an essential dimension of every human life, such that its loss impoverishes us imaginatively and emotionally. It\u2019s surely no surprise that much of the inspiration for the book came from reading. I\u2019m referring not only to the rich and varied literature on the subject, but equally to the act of reading itself. As anyone who makes a living from it will tell you, reading can be hard work. But turning away from the immediate demands of the \u201creal\u201d world to immerse oneself in a world made on the page \u2013 be it the speculative world of the philosopher or physicist, the reconstructed past of the historian, or the imaginary realms of the novelist or poet \u2013 is itself a refusal of the demand for useful productivity. It requires us to slow down, wait, be curious, avoid the headlong rush into practical action. Here, then, are the books I\u2019ve found most helpful in exploring inactivity, idleness and aimlessness in all their wonderfully various forms. 1. Rameau\u2019s Nephew by Denis Diderot A kind of delirious inversion of a Platonic dialogue; replacing Socrates the lover of wisdom guiding his awed pupil towards the Good with Rameau the unconscionable and entitled slob instructing the half-amused, half-disgusted Diderot in the ways of gluttony and freeloading. Diderot, editor of the epic Encyclop\u00e9die, was himself a paragon of almost unfeasible intellectual productivity and a passionate advocate for human reason. Yet one of his most brilliant and seductive creations is this shamelessly unreasonable waster and his compelling argument for making very little effort in life. 2. Oblomov by Ivan Goncharov A pampered only child raised on an idyllic country estate, Oblomov is stuck with his aged, cantankerous manservant in a dusty St Petersburg apartment, unable to summon the will to get out of bed and face the ominous financial demands and administrative tasks proliferating around him. The rousing pep talks of his tireless, go-getting friend Stolz briefly propel him into life, but in the end Oblomov \u2013 whiny, self-pitying yet strangely lovable \u2013 can never resist the inexorable pull of inertia. No less than Lenin lamented the chronic malaise of \u201cOblomovitis\u201d affecting the Russian people. Good for them, I say. 3. The Portable Thoreau by Henry David Thoreau This handy volume includes some of the best writings of the great American naturalist, essayist and political agitator. Walden, his record of a year-long experiment in living self-sufficiently, dares to imagine a life unencumbered by economic necessity and social obligation. Here and in great essays such as Walking and Life Without Principle, Thoreau enjoins us to the freedom of living aimlessly, guided by the lights of our own desires rather than the world\u2019s life-denying imperative of \u201cincessant business\u201d. The real pleasure is to be found in Thoreau\u2019s beautiful prose and singular voice \u2013 wry, often exasperated and just a little imperious. 4. Beyond the Pleasure Principle by Sigmund Freud This remains Freud\u2019s most controversial work, a bold and often startling foray into speculative biology and the outer edges of the human psyche. Its central idea of a \u201cdeath drive\u201d continues to trouble its critics, as well as inspire artists, writers and philosophers. The death drive is not primarily, as is sometimes claimed, an innate destructiveness, but a resistance to the growth and expansion inherent to life. The scandalous suggestion is that behind the impulse to do, make and expand is an older and ultimately more powerful urge to lassitude and stasis. Which makes sense to me. 5. The Decay of Lying and Other Essays by Oscar Wilde \u201cTo do nothing at all is the most difficult thing in the world.\u201d The red thread running through this anthology of some of Wilde\u2019s finest essays is his provocative disdain for action. In a surprising echo of Freud, he argues that it is always \u201cignorant of its direction\u201d. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing when we act and so are liable to make a mess of things despite our best intentions (Wilde is a brilliant companion for the Brexit age.) In The Soul of Man Under Socialism, he imagines us liberated by machines from the shackles of labour to realise our full creative possibilities. Unrealistic? Of course, but then the famous 1968 slogan, \u201cBe realistic: demand the impossible!\u201d could have been coined by Wilde, master of paradox. 6. The Space of Literature by Maurice Blanchot The best place to start with this enigmatic, forbidding but endlessly fascinating French philosopher and critic. Ostensibly a collection of essays on major modern writers, it\u2019s really a sustained reflection on art as a kind of reserve of pure idleness. A prolific writer himself, Blanchot doesn\u2019t deny that making art is hard work; but it\u2019s work that doesn\u2019t intervene in the concrete world of historical action. In other words, art can do anything in its own world \u2013 bend and break time, space, physical reality \u2013 because it doesn\u2019t really do anything in reality. 7. A Short History of Decay by EM Cioran A brilliant collection of aphorisms from the lyric philosopher of existential misery. For all his uncompromising pessimism and disgust, hope sneaks into his writing surreptitiously, through the wry humanity of his voice. Cioran takes a hammer to religious and political belief systems in the name of more than mere nihilism; his primary concern is to protect a place for \u201cdoubt and sloth\u201d\u2019, for the \u201cidlers and aesthetes\u201d who \u201cpropose nothing\u201d. It\u2019s the spirit of the idler, after all, that stands between us and the terrible ravages of fanaticism. 8. A Man Asleep by Georges Perec Perec\u2019s early novella is a deeply unsettling portrait of a young man\u2019s wish to sleep his life away. From the beginning, its narrator sinks inexorably into anonymity and indifference, becoming \u201ca man of leisure, a sleepwalker, a mollusc\u201d, concentrating all his efforts in the achievement of a state of immobility and silence. Perhaps that makes it sound dull and depressing; but the disconcerting enigma of this book is how thrilling it is. 9. Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace Really? With a word count to rival War and Peace, not to mention a similar level of narrative convolution, this doorstopper may not be the first novel you associate with inactivity. But its proliferation of characters and stories all converge on the same motif: our culture\u2019s drive to (in the words of the polemicist Neil Postman) \u201camuse us to death\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Darren Weir, whose three racing stables in Australia house more than 600 horses, has been banned from the sport for four years following the discovery of electric-shock devices known as \u201cjiggers\u201d at two of his yards in police raids late last month. Weir is one of Australia\u2019s most successful trainers with more than 30 Group One wins and played a leading role in one of the sport\u2019s biggest stories in recent years when Michelle Payne became the first female rider to win the Melbourne Cup aboard Weir\u2019s 100-1 chance, Prince Of Penzance. His training career now lies in ruins, however, following the discovery of four \u201cjiggers\u201d on his property during raids by the sporting integrity unit of Victoria Police on 29 January. The illegal devices are used in the mental conditioning of horses, usually in conjunction with a whip, to ensure that they stay on at the end of a race. If a horse receives a shock shortly after a stroke of the whip during training, it will then expect the pain of a shock when the whip is used in a race and quicken in response. Weir did not contest the charges against him at a hearing before Judge John Bowman, the chairman of Racing Victoria\u2019s Disciplinary Board, and was banned both for the possession of four \u201cjiggers\u201d which were found in his bedroom, and for behaviour prejudicial to the image of racing. Before handing down the four-year ban, Bowman detailed Weir\u2019s rise from Australia\u2019s \u201cbush\u201d racing circuit to the pinnacle of the sport. \u201cIt is sad it has come to this,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cYou are a 48-year-old man who has completed a rags-to-riches rise in the racing world.

Like Weir, Mahmood al-Zarooni was charged and banned from racing \u2013 for eight years \u2013 in a matter of days after he was found to have been conducting a systematic steroid-doping programme at his Moulton Paddocks stable just outside Newmarket.

Every horse in his care that progressed from the lower reaches to Group-race success offered an incentive to owners in other stables to try their luck with Weir, arguably without probing too deeply into his methods. Horses trained by Weir have also gone on to enjoy successful careers as stallions, raising the possibility that his actions will continue to corrupt the sport via the breeding sheds long after his ban has concluded.",

The average 12-year-old has never known genre boundaries and is likely to be listening to everyone from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/cardi-b\">Cardi B</a> to BTS to platinum-selling American singer Becky G, who has only returned to singing in English after three years of exclusively Spanish releases. Against that, the once omnipresent 1.0 acts represent a mindset that feels outmoded. A bit hubristic and mainly white, that mentality is battling the fluidity of the new guard. Led by rappers and global acts, the 2.0 cohort are oblivious to genre rules: they pop up on each other\u2019s records, singing in Spanish or Korean or French, and they speak directly to fans via social media.

I\u2019ve seen it for myself: in 2018, I reviewed London shows by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/29/j-balvin-review-brixton-academy\">Balvin</a>, pop-reggaeton golden boy Maluma, Monsta X and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/10/bts-review-o2-arena-london-kpop\">BTS</a>. The venues heaved with excited young Londoners, who sang along, lofted flags and generally did their nut over being in the same room as their heroes \u2013 all of which is par for the course at pop shows. What was different was that almost none of the songs were in English, and most of the fans couldn\u2019t understand the lyrics. And here was the thing: that was absolutely fine, posing no barrier to loving the music. If anything captured this remarkable new order, it was my friend\u2019s BTS-stanning 14-year-old daughter, who spent the show singing every song. After discovering the group via social media a couple of years earlier, she decided to learn Korean and had now mastered enough to understand the songs. Having a grasp of the language is also useful for following K-pop bands on social media, where fresh content is uploaded hourly, much of it solely in Korean.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"98b6c54a17fd8a34a335109e8583c8de082c1454\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98b6c54a17fd8a34a335109e8583c8de082c1454/963_0_922_1152/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Bunny.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J-Lo collaborator \u2026 Bad Bunny.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The more switched-on 1.0 stars have been clambering over each other to collaborate with the 2.0s: Bieber shoehorned his way on to the Despacito remix (though the Luis Fonsi-Daddy Yankee original is vastly more popular on YouTube, with 6bn streams compared to the Bieber version\u2019s 600m). Perry got trap superstars Migos aboard her current album and Lopez collaborated with Bad Bunny on her 2018 single Te Guste. And you can bet that Madonna\u2019s new album, due this year, will acknowledge 2.0.</p> <p>Spare a thought for the old guard. How could traditional pop superstars not feel they were singularly special when they\u2019ve spent their careers being treated like emperors? Each new album or tour was the subject of a campaign planned a year in advance, and no promotional gesture was too grandiose. Jackson, to name one glorious example, set out on his 1996 HIStory tour with a nine-metre statue of himself. On the first date, in Prague, it was displayed on a plinth formerly occupied by the Stalin monument.</p> <p>Compare that to Drake, arguably the Jacko of today in terms of stature and influence: his 2016 single One Dance arrived without an official video and still spent 10 weeks at the top of the US chart, and 15 weeks at No 1 in the UK. Meanwhile, ever since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>\u2019s surprise 2013 LP, rap and R&amp;B artists have turned the album-release playbook on its head by putting out albums whenever they decide it\u2019s time, even if it means doing so with no warning other than a few judicious leaks.

Swift\u2019s 2018 tour was the second highest grossing in the US last year, taking $315m. First place went to her friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran\">Ed Sheeran</a>, on $429m. It\u2019s worth noting that Sheeran is unusual in having staked places in both the 1.0 and 2.0 camps. His traditional songcraft marks him as old school, but long-term alliances with rappers and Afrobeat stars such as Fuse ODG suggest that he could survive any 1.0 clearout.</p> <p>But the live industry might as well be another galaxy: included in 2018\u2019s 10 top grossers are country singer Kenny Chesney, the Rolling Stones and a Journey-Def Leppard double-header, none of whom stream particularly well or pretend to be any cooler than they are. A flourishing gig market is one of the only reliable holdovers from the golden past. Artists have taken advantage of this market by bundling a copy of their new album with every ticket \u2013 not as an inducement to buy tickets, which will be snapped up regardless, but to help their new album achieve a better chart position.</p> <p>So which of the \u201cmassive stars of yesteryear\u201d will stick it out? Most likely, it will be the adaptable ones \u2013 artists who don\u2019t just piggyback on to prevailing styles but have an affinity with them. Sheeran is probably safe, as is Grande, whose move toward trap and R&amp;B has been seamless and convincing. The sense that the 1.0 era is over is solidified by the lack of superstars-in-waiting. Bebe Rexha, Shawn Mendes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/12/camila-cabello-i-got-to-create-myself-again-i-didnt-have-to-be-this-shy-girl\">Camila Cabello</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dua-lipa\">Dua Lipa</a>, as fine as their efforts might be, aren\u2019t cut from the same lordly cloth as their forebears. The cultural environment in which they find themselves militates against pop gods \u2013 just imagine if Michael Jackson had turned up with that statue now.</p>",

They were the unassailable pantechnicons around whom the idea of pop stardom revolved, establishing the template for Mariah Carey, Timberlake, Spears and Jennifer Lopez \u2013 right up to today\u2019s Perry, Swift, Bieber and Lady Gaga. The latter might be the final Pop 1.0 star to have owned the zeitgeist while at her peak, and it says much about her prescience today that she has dissociated from the aloof figure she cut in her imperial phase. The music was vocally driven, melody prevailing over beats, verses almost always leading to choruses. It could be pensive or euphoric; it might toy with exotica or exhibit social awareness; it was open to advances in technology (Carey\u2019s wholly traditional-sounding All I Want for Christmas Is You, for instance, was made entirely with computers \u2013 sleigh bells and all).

His traditional songcraft marks him as old school, but long-term alliances with rappers and Afrobeat stars such as Fuse ODG suggest that he could survive any 1.0 clearout. But the live industry might as well be another galaxy: included in 2018\u2019s 10 top grossers are country singer Kenny Chesney, the Rolling Stones and a Journey-Def Leppard double-header, none of whom stream particularly well or pretend to be any cooler than they are. A flourishing gig market is one of the only reliable holdovers from the golden past. Artists have taken advantage of this market by bundling a copy of their new album with every ticket \u2013 not as an inducement to buy tickets, which will be snapped up regardless, but to help their new album achieve a better chart position. So which of the \u201cmassive stars of yesteryear\u201d will stick it out? Most likely, it will be the adaptable ones \u2013 artists who don\u2019t just piggyback on to prevailing styles but have an affinity with them. Sheeran is probably safe, as is Grande, whose move toward trap and R&amp;B has been seamless and convincing. The sense that the 1.0 era is over is solidified by the lack of superstars-in-waiting. Bebe Rexha, Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello and Dua Lipa, as fine as their efforts might be, aren\u2019t cut from the same lordly cloth as their forebears. The cultural environment in which they find themselves militates against pop gods \u2013 just imagine if Michael Jackson had turned up with that statue now.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s only a week until pitchers and catchers start reporting for Spring Training and yet two of baseball\u2019s biggest stars remain without teams. Bryce Harper, who has played his entire career with the Washington Nationals, and Manny Machado, who last played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, are both 26-year-old elite hitters at the peak of their careers \u2013 and yet they are still struggling to find employment. How exactly did this happen and what could it mean for the league going forward?</p> <p><strong>Are Harper and Machado really worth long-term contracts?</strong></p> <p>Yes. At times, Harper has competed with the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 Mike Trout as the best player in the game. He was the National League Rookie of the Year in 2012 and led the league in home runs in 2015, when he also won the National League MVP at the age of 23, the youngest ever to win the award unanimously. He\u2019s a six-time All-Star and capped off his Washington career by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/17/bryce-harper-home-run-derby-kyle-schwarber-mlb-baseball\">winning the Home Run Derby</a> at Nationals Park last year. Machado, while not quite the player that Harper is, is a four-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner, a lifetime .282 hitter who has already hit 175 home runs in the major leagues.</p> <p><strong>Are there any reasons teams are hesitant to sign either of them?</strong></p> <p>Well, Machado has a reputation among fans as a dirty player. He\u2019s been a part of several bench-clearing brawls, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/dodgers-vs-brewers-benches-clear-after-manny-machado-steps-on-jesus-aguilars-foot-at-first-base/\">most notably in last year\u2019s playoffs</a> after a hard slide into the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 Jesus Aguilar. Previously, when he was with the Baltimore Orioles, he got into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/08/manny-machado-yordano-ventura-brawl-orioles-royals\">a physical altercation</a> with Kansas City Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura which led to a four-game suspension.</p> <p>Harper too has had his moments of hotheadedness, including being part of a fight with pitcher Hunter Strickland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/29/bryce-harper-hunter-strickland-nationals-giants-brawl\">in the 2017 National League Division Series</a>. That year, he also spent some time on the DL with a bone bruise, which theoretically could be a flag for some teams, although he\u2019s been pretty durable for a MLB player. It doesn\u2019t feel like either of those factors should affect his desirability, particularly given his undoubted talent.</p> <p><strong>So why hasn\u2019t anybody signed them?</strong></p> <p>No one wants to spend money. No, seriously, that\u2019s the reason. Major League Baseball remains a ridiculously lucrative enterprise: the league <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/report-mlb-sets-new-record-for-revenues-at-103-billion-in-2018/ar-BBRWuAj\">brought took in $10.3bn last year</a>, and most teams remain well in the black. Famously, MLB doesn\u2019t have a salary cap, merely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_luxury_tax\">a luxury tax</a>, so freeing up money for big name free-agents shouldn\u2019t be a problem. As far as the luxury tax goes, only the World Series champion Boston Red Sox and the Nationals themselves <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/only-red-sox-nationals-owe-luxury-tax-in-2018-as-mlb-teams-combine-for-smallest-bill-in-15-years/\">went over the $197m threshold</a> last year, and not re-signing Harper should take care of clearing that hurdle for the Nationals this year.</p> <p>As super-agent Scott Boras has rightfully observed, there are a number of clubs that look like they\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/mlb/reds/2018/11/08/scott-boras-non-competitive-teams-cancer-baseball-matt-harvey-reds-mlb/1926113002/\">not even attempting to field competitive teams</a> (we\u2019re looking at you Miami Marlins). The rest of them have mostly been spending their offseason filling out their rosters by signing <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2019/1/8/18173625/free-agency-slow-signing-pace-manny-machado-bryce-harper\">players on bargain contracts</a>. As the Ringer\u2019s Michael Baumann <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2019/2/5/18212150/bryce-harper-manny-machado-new-york-yankees-los-angeles-dodgers-no-spending\">points out</a>, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for major market teams to sell fans the idea that \u201cpayroll flexibility\u201d is preventing them from offering big contracts to free agents, particularly for the likes of a Harper.</p> <p><strong>Are there any other quality players in the same boat besides Harper and Machado?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-free-agent-tracker-latest-hot-stove-signings-ranking-50-best-players-available-for-2019/\">Sure</a>. Starting pitchers Dallas Keuchel (last with the Houston Astros) and Gio Gonzalez (last with the Brewers), closer Craig Kimbrel (last with the Boston Red Sox), third baseman Mike Moustakas (last with the Brewers), infielder Marwin Gonzalez (last with the Astros), outfielder Adam Jones (last with the Orioles), among many others, all currently remain unsigned.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a weird coincidence that every team stopped spending money at once \u2026</strong></p> <p>Isn\u2019t it though? It\u2019s hard not to invoke Occam\u2019s Razor here and assume that there\u2019s some sort of informal agreement going on between clubs to keep wages low. The longer this offseason has gone on, the more analysts have begun to bring up the possibility of collusion. The idea has even come out of the lips of current and former players. Yankees legend Alex Rodriguez has brought up the topic, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/alex-rodriguez-suggests-mlb-free-agency-collusion-2019-1\">saying</a>, \u201csalaries have stayed flat for almost 20 years \u2026 It\u2019s just interesting what\u2019s happening, and the owners are doing a terrific job working closely together, obviously, and keeping these salaries down.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Is there collusion?</strong></p> <p>Well, as Marc Normandin pointed out recently<a href=\"https://deadspin.com/mlbs-luxury-tax-became-a-salary-cap-because-of-decades-1832200596?rev=1548962540508\"> for Deadspin</a>, it\u2019s not exactly unheard of when you look at the history of the league. In any case, even if there is, as our president likes to repeatedly insist, \u201cNO COLLUSION\u201d going on here, there\u2019s certainly the appearance of it and that\u2019s not good for the league.</p> <p><strong>Where do Machado and Harper eventually end up?</strong></p> <p>At this point, your guess is as good as anybody\u2019s. The Philadelphia Phillies, among others, are <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/phillies/source-phillies-plan-meet-bryce-harper-even-they-await-manny-machados-decision\">reportedly in discussions</a> with Harper. The New York Post\u2019s Joel Sherman <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/28/manny-machados-last-resort-why-a-one-year-deal-can-make-sense/\">recently speculated</a> that Machado may accept a one-year deal and hope that next year\u2019s offseason isn\u2019t as bleak for free agents. It\u2019s not inconceivable that Machado and Harper will remain unsigned by the time Spring Training games start and if that happens, we\u2019re pretty much in unknown territory.</p> <p><strong>What does this mean for the MLB\u2019s future?</strong></p> <p>When reports came out that catcher Yasmani Grandal <a href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/01/10/yasmani-grandal-milwaukee-brewers-free-agency?utm_campaign=si-mlb&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;xid=socialflow_twitter_si\">signed a one-year/$18.25m deal</a> with the Brewers, Baseball Twitter erupted with dark jokes about how everyone was going to spend the inevitable players\u2019 strike. Here was one of the best catchers in baseball forced to sign a deal that had him immediately auditioning for his next contract. Even the players who have signed free-agent deals this offseason have signed contracts far below those available to equivalent free-agents just a few years ago.</p> <p>As Normandin has detailed, the luxury tax now works as a de facto salary cap: MLB is continuing to see rising profits and players are starting to get paid less. If these trends continue, the Major League Baseball Players Association is going to have to push back. It\u2019s doubtful that owners are going to give in to demands, especially since they are well-aware that players get the brunt of the blame whenever there\u2019s a players\u2019 strike or owners\u2019 lockout. The current Collective Bargaining Agreement <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2019/1/14/18181665/mlb-mlbpa-player-power-labor-strike-machado-harper-murray\">expires in 2021</a> and as that date nears we could be facing a lost season <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/with-baseballs-hot-stove-turned-off-again-concerns-about-a-work-stoppage-grow/\">for the first time </a>since the 1994-95 strike. So, enjoy baseball while you can, fans.</p>",

Bryce Harper, who has played his entire career with the Washington Nationals, and Manny Machado, who last played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, are both 26-year-old elite hitters at the peak of their careers \u2013 and yet they are still struggling to find employment. How exactly did this happen and what could it mean for the league going forward? Are Harper and Machado really worth long-term contracts? Yes. At times, Harper has competed with the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 Mike Trout as the best player in the game. He was the National League Rookie of the Year in 2012 and led the league in home runs in 2015, when he also won the National League MVP at the age of 23, the youngest ever to win the award unanimously. He\u2019s a six-time All-Star and capped off his Washington career by winning the Home Run Derby at Nationals Park last year. Machado, while not quite the player that Harper is, is a four-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner, a lifetime .282 hitter who has already hit 175 home runs in the major leagues. Are there any reasons teams are hesitant to sign either of them? Well, Machado has a reputation among fans as a dirty player. He\u2019s been a part of several bench-clearing brawls, most notably in last year\u2019s playoffs after a hard slide into the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 Jesus Aguilar. Previously, when he was with the Baltimore Orioles, he got into a physical altercation with Kansas City Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura which led to a four-game suspension. Harper too has had his moments of hotheadedness, including being part of a fight with pitcher Hunter Strickland in the 2017 National League Division Series. That year, he also spent some time on the DL with a bone bruise, which theoretically could be a flag for some teams, although he\u2019s been pretty durable for a MLB player. It doesn\u2019t feel like either of those factors should affect his desirability, particularly given his undoubted talent. So why hasn\u2019t anybody signed them? No one wants to spend money. No, seriously, that\u2019s the reason. Major League Baseball remains a ridiculously lucrative enterprise: the league brought took in $10.3bn last year, and most teams remain well in the black. Famously, MLB doesn\u2019t have a salary cap, merely a luxury tax, so freeing up money for big name free-agents shouldn\u2019t be a problem. As far as the luxury tax goes, only the World Series champion Boston Red Sox and the Nationals themselves went over the $197m threshold last year, and not re-signing Harper should take care of clearing that hurdle for the Nationals this year. As super-agent Scott Boras has rightfully observed, there are a number of clubs that look like they\u2019re not even attempting to field competitive teams (we\u2019re looking at you Miami Marlins). The rest of them have mostly been spending their offseason filling out their rosters by signing players on bargain contracts. As the Ringer\u2019s Michael Baumann points out, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for major market teams to sell fans the idea that \u201cpayroll flexibility\u201d is preventing them from offering big contracts to free agents, particularly for the likes of a Harper. Are there any other quality players in the same boat besides Harper and Machado? Sure. Starting pitchers Dallas Keuchel (last with the Houston Astros) and Gio Gonzalez (last with the Brewers), closer Craig Kimbrel (last with the Boston Red Sox), third baseman Mike Moustakas (last with the Brewers), infielder Marwin Gonzalez (last with the Astros), outfielder Adam Jones (last with the Orioles), among many others, all currently remain unsigned. It\u2019s a weird coincidence that every team stopped spending money at once \u2026 Isn\u2019t it though? It\u2019s hard not to invoke Occam\u2019s Razor here and assume that there\u2019s some sort of informal agreement going on between clubs to keep wages low. The longer this offseason has gone on, the more analysts have begun to bring up the possibility of collusion. The idea has even come out of the lips of current and former players. Yankees legend Alex Rodriguez has brought up the topic, saying, \u201csalaries have stayed flat for almost 20 years \u2026 It\u2019s just interesting what\u2019s happening, and the owners are doing a terrific job working closely together, obviously, and keeping these salaries down.\u201d Is there collusion? Well, as Marc Normandin pointed out recently for Deadspin, it\u2019s not exactly unheard of when you look at the history of the league. In any case, even if there is, as our president likes to repeatedly insist, \u201cNO COLLUSION\u201d going on here, there\u2019s certainly the appearance of it and that\u2019s not good for the league. Where do Machado and Harper eventually end up? At this point, your guess is as good as anybody\u2019s. The Philadelphia Phillies, among others, are reportedly in discussions with Harper. The New York Post\u2019s Joel Sherman recently speculated that Machado may accept a one-year deal and hope that next year\u2019s offseason isn\u2019t as bleak for free agents. It\u2019s not inconceivable that Machado and Harper will remain unsigned by the time Spring Training games start and if that happens, we\u2019re pretty much in unknown territory. What does this mean for the MLB\u2019s future? When reports came out that catcher Yasmani Grandal signed a one-year/$18.25m deal with the Brewers, Baseball Twitter erupted with dark jokes about how everyone was going to spend the inevitable players\u2019 strike. Here was one of the best catchers in baseball forced to sign a deal that had him immediately auditioning for his next contract. Even the players who have signed free-agent deals this offseason have signed contracts far below those available to equivalent free-agents just a few years ago. As Normandin has detailed, the luxury tax now works as a de facto salary cap: MLB is continuing to see rising profits and players are starting to get paid less. If these trends continue, the Major League Baseball Players Association is going to have to push back. It\u2019s doubtful that owners are going to give in to demands, especially since they are well-aware that players get the brunt of the blame whenever there\u2019s a players\u2019 strike or owners\u2019 lockout. The current Collective Bargaining Agreement expires in 2021 and as that date nears we could be facing a lost season for the first time since the 1994-95 strike. So, enjoy baseball while you can, fans.",

      "bodyText": "The good news for Aston Villa is that they can still take points off the eight teams above them but, with 16 games to go, time is running out if the club have designs of avoiding a fourth consecutive season in the Championship. One win from seven matches has left a faltering Villa off the pace, chugging behind in the race to reach the play-offs. For too long, all season in truth, what would be the most expensively assembled squad in the division but for Stoke City have flattered to deceive, a reality that cost Steve Bruce his job and led to the arrival of Dean Smith, who grew up in Great Barr, four miles from Villa Park. On the horizon, a crucial period of three potential season-defining games in nine days beckons, starting with Sheffield United at home on Friday. A glance at how Villa compare with their rivals speaks volumes about what has been a distinctly curious season so far: only the bottom club, Ipswich, and Rotherham have conceded more goals than the 46 they have shipped, yet only the leaders, Norwich, and fifth-placed Middlesbrough have lost fewer league matches than Villa\u2019s seven. Villa have drawn a league joint-high of 13 games, the latest a stalemate at Reading last Saturday. They are four points shy of sixth-placed Bristol City but each of the teams occupying the play-off spots \u2013 except Chris Wilder\u2019s Sheffield United in third \u2013 have a game in hand. For an ambling Villa, it feels like a case of now or never. \u201cThe focus is totally on trying to get hold of a couple of teams above us and getting into that top six as quick as possible,\u201d said Tommy Elphick, the defender who has impressed since being recalled from a loan spell at Hull last month. \u201cWe sat down and had a chat as a group before the Reading game, after the transfer window had closed, to say: \u2018This is us now.\u2019 Regardless of what situation you are in at the club, whether you have six months left on your contract or three years, we all realise that if we\u2019re winning games and looking towards the top six then it is better for everyone. \u201cTogether you can move mountains when you get a group that\u2019s all pulling in the same direction. \u201cHopefully there\u2019s a good run around the corner from us. If you can string five, six, seven wins on the bounce, looking at a team like Hull where they have come the bottom three to putting themselves in contention after going on a run like that, that\u2019s what we need to be doing. We are well placed to put a run like that together.

Its leader, Bill Shorten, has signalled twice this week that the ALP might support the government\u2019s proposal on medical transfers, rather than the crossbench bill. Shorten said the government was lining up a U-turn to avoid a defeat in parliament, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to be a purist. If they get to an acceptable outcome I\u2019m not going to judge their motivation\u201d. \u201cLabor said that we want to make sure that independent medical advice is taken more seriously. We will have a look at what the government\u2019s proposing. \u201cThe way they normally communicate with me is either through the media or angry threatening letters. But despite that I will not be deterred. We will see if it works, we\u2019ll then have a look at it, but at this stage we\u2019re still supporting the Phelps amendments.\u201d The crossbench proposal will only succeed it Labor supports it. Phelps told Guardian Australia the government was \u201cshowing signs of desperation and exasperation because it\u2019s trying to find a way to avoid a vote\u201d on the medical transfer bill. \u201cThe best way to avoid losing a vote is to vote with it, but the government is so resistant to compassionate treatment of asylum seekers it can\u2019t see the wood for the trees,\u201d she said. Phelps said the government could have backed her bill which she said was supported by the parliament, the Australian community, lawyers and doctors who want to break the deadlock, but had \u201cchosen to politicise\u201d medical transfers with its demands Labor and the crossbench abandon the bill. \u201cAny dilution of this bill will make it a lot less effective.\u201d Her bill allowed only for temporary transfer of people for medical care, not for residency or the right to settle, because that is \u201cnot the policy of either major party\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Australian people will take kindly to government playing politics with people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a medical solution to a medical problem with strong support.\u201d",

During the speech, Trump\u2019s comments swerved from dark proclamations about the \u201clawless state of our southern border\u201d and the \u201cbloodthirsty monsters\u201d who fight for Isis, to sweeter moments, such as praising the optimism of a 10-year-old girl who fought brain cancer, and veterans who helped liberate Europe from Nazism during the second world war. Trump commanded one of the biggest stages in American politics on Tuesday night but, unlike last year\u2019s address, Capitol Hill was something of a hostile environment. Pelosi \u2013 a formidable adversary who has thwarted his border wall at every turn \u2013 sat mostly stone-faced, occasionally scanning the text of his speech. She was joined on the dais by Vice-President Mike Pence, who dutifully applauded the president at each opportunity. Seated in front of Trump was a record number of female House members, most Democrats and some dressed in white, in homage to the suffragist movement. In the gallery above were two former employees of Trump\u2019s New Jersey golf club, both immigrant women who have gone public about its hiring practices, and the sexual assault survivor who confronted the Republican senator Jeff Flake in an elevator during the fraught confirmation of the conservative supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh. In a moment of levity, Democratic congresswomen erupted in cheers and applause when Trump said the thriving economy had increased female employment. Trump smiled: \u201cDon\u2019t sit yet. You\u2019re going to like this.\u201d \u201cExactly one century after the Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote,\u201d he said, \u201cwe also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.\u201d This time the chamber rose to its feet and Democrats and Republicans joined in a bipartisan \u201cU-S-A\u201d chant. Many of the women were elected as part of a backlash to Trump\u2019s presidency. Members also sang happy birthday to Judah Samet, a Holocaust survivor who also survived an attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh that left 11 people dead last year and on Tuesday turned 81. Among the guests seated with the first lady, Melania Trump, were family members of a couple killed in Nevada last month, allegedly by someone who was in the country illegally, and Joshua Trump, a boy who was bullied at school because he shares a last name with the president \u2013 though he is no relation. The public gallery also included, at Democrats\u2019 invitation, undocumented immigrants and temporary residents threatened by the Trump administration\u2019s policies, climate scientists, labor leaders, gun violence victims and federal workers who went without pay for 35 days during the government shutdown and who are worried about a repeat. During his speech, Trump made the case for his \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policies, calling it a \u201cmoral duty\u201d to address what he has claimed to be a \u201ccrisis of illegal immigration\u201d at the US-Mexico border. \u201cNo issue better illustrates the divide between America\u2019s working class and America\u2019s political class than illegal immigration,\u201d he said, in defense of his demand for a wall. \u201cWealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.\u201d He also touted his stewardship of a strong economy after what he called \u201cdecades of calamitous trade policies\u201d and committed to rebuilding America\u2019s \u201ccrumbling infrastructure\u201d. And he voiced support for popular initiatives, pledging new funding to \u201cdefeat AIDS in America and beyond\u201d and to fight childhood cancer. The address was treated as the start of his presidential re-election campaign as several Democrats running to unseat him in 2020 sat in the audience. Among those who have declared were Democratic senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren. In a strike at Democrats\u2019 liberalizing policy agenda, Trump decried \u201cnew calls to adopt socialism in our country\u201d as he blamed \u201csocialist policies\u201d for the economic collapse in Venezuela. The line elicited a chorus of boos from Republicans. \u201cAmerica was founded on liberty and independence,\u201d Trump said, \u201cnot government coercion, domination, and control.\u201d Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist from Vermont who is also weighing a presidential bid, appeared bemused by the line. On foreign policy, an area where Trump faces an increasingly adversarial Republican Senate, the president defended his decision to withdraw US troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Just hours prior, the Senate approved a resolution opposing the plan. He vowed to work with the nation\u2019s allies to \u201cdestroy the remnants of Isis\u201d and said his administration \u201daccelerated\u201d negotiations to reach a political agreement in Afghanistan. \u201cGreat nations do not fight endless wars,\u201d he said. Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the race for governor in Georgia in an election marred by accusations of voter suppression, became the first African American woman to deliver the Democratic rebuttal to the president\u2019s address. Speaking from Atlanta, Abrams called voting rights the \u201cnext battle for our democracy\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Voter suppression is real,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cFrom making it harder to register and stay on the rolls to moving and closing polling places to rejecting lawful ballots, we can no longer ignore these threats to democracy.\u201d David Smith in Washington contributed to this report",

The Liberal MP is a distant relative of the fund manager, and a shareholder in his business. According to the parliamentary register of interests, on 10 May 2017 the Liberal MP updated his register to list shareholding in Wilson Asset Management through Wilson-Bolger Superannuation Pty Ltd. Geoff Wilson is a vocal critic of Labor\u2019s policy, unveiled last March, to scrap the cash refunds for excess imputation credits claimed by retirees and self-managed superannuation funds. Tim Wilson has already sparked controversy by creating a campaign website allowing people to register to attend public hearings. That site is privately funded, and contains an authorisation by Wilson in his capacity as the chairman of standing committee on economics. The website signs people up to not only attending the public hearings, but for a petition against \u201cthe retirement tax\u201d and allows them to be contacted about \u201cfuture activities to stop the retirement tax\u201d. Wilson has declined to answer direct questions from Guardian Australia about whether Geoff Wilson has funded the campaign website. Guardian Australia asked Wilson whether Advance Australia, a conservative lobby group also opposed to Labor\u2019s policy, had funded the website, and the Liberal MP gave a direct answer \u2013 no. But he has not denied the fund manager\u2019s involvement in funding the campaign website after being given several opportunities to do so. The Liberal MP told Guardian Australia he had chosen to rule out Advance Australia funding the website because \u201cthe implication offends me\u201d. The conservative lobby group has been critical of Wilson on occasions. Asked if Geoff Wilson or his business had funded the site, and asked about his relationship to Geoff, Tim Wilson replied: \u201cGeoff and Tim do share a mutual love for the mighty Melbourne Demons. \u201cDespite that bond, they only first met at a conference in March 2018 where they established that Tim\u2019s father\u2019s father\u2019s father is Geoff\u2019s father\u2019s father. \u201cThe site was developed by Tim Wilson in consultation with stakeholders to maximise its efficacy.

I have always thought so \u2013 and that time and place is if you are Richey Edwards in the Manic Street Preachers circa 1993. Outside of that context, leopard print is intimidating. It is a statement of the kind most men get self-conscious about. Yes, it looks great on Keith Richards, but it also looks faintly ridiculous when you are mooching around the tea point at the Guardian. There were, inevitably, some funny looks when I wore it for a day at work. But was that the print? Or because I was wearing a blousey number with half my chest on show in the middle of winter?

It was powerful, because it forced everyone in the overwhelmingly teenage audience (yes, I felt old) to stop their mosh-pitting and Snapchatting and reflect upon the normalisation of violence and imprisonment that young men like them must overcome to become successful entertainers. I first interviewed Skengdo and AM in November 2017. I found them to be articulate and driven to escape their increasingly gentrified yet impoverished pocket of Brixton, south London. But a lot has changed since then. Like other acts, such as Unknown T, Loski and LD, they have become domestic stars while the moral panic about drill music has crystallised into an unprecedented authoritarian clampdown. Last month the pair were given a suspended prison sentence for performing their song Attempted 1.0, after footage of their Koko show was uploaded to YouTube. They had breached the terms of their \u201cgang injunction\u201d which also restricts them from entering the SE11 postcode, or making various provocations in their lyrics.

Not long after, the controversial west London group 1011 were banned from making music without police permission. But the case of Skengdo and AM \u2014 much like Sajid Javid\u2019s introduction of knife crime prevention orders last week, which could lead to children as young as 12 being imprisoned for being suspected of carrying a knife \u2014 has taken us into unchartered civil territory. As a letter signed this week by human rights organisations, lawyers, academics and musicians argues, criminalising artists in this way is both unjust and ineffective. It is unjust because it denies the basic freedoms of those who are attempting to creatively, if distastefully, expose their experiences of subsistent life in the bleakest urban pockets of British society.

The men, aged 19 and 27, were arrested after presenting themselves at a central London hospital. Both men were taken to separate central London police stations for questioning. Police said they were called to reports of an incident in Battersea shortly before 8pm on Tuesday and found a 19-year-old man with stab wounds. Despite the efforts of paramedics from the London ambulance service, he died about half an hour later. He has yet to be formally identified and a crime scene remained in place. The murder investigation came only hours after detectives appealed for information from witnesses to two more stabbings elsewhere in the city. Earlier on Tuesday afternoon, police had issued an appeal for information about knife attacks on two more teenagers, who were wounded in the Feltham area of south-west London on Sunday. Officers believe those attacks were linked, though no link to the Battersea incident has been suggested. Officers said they were called by the London ambulance service shortly before 2pm on Sunday.

He starts to cry \u2013 a wheedling, disgruntled moan \u2013 so I take one hand off the buggy to stroke his face. In that moment he squirms, the buggy tilts and I get a flash, for a microsecond, of the drop, the concrete, the depth and the danger. For lack of a lift, a ramp or an assistant I could have lost the centre of my world.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/30/malaysia-goodson-new-york-subway-death-fall-condition\">Malaysia Goodson</a>, a mother from Stamford, Connecticut, is believed to have fallen to her death while trying to get down a flight of stairs at the Seventh Avenue station in New York City while carrying her one-year-old daughter in a buggy. Goodson was found lying unconscious at the bottom of the stairs beside a tipped-up stroller. Her daughter, miraculously, was unharmed, but is now motherless. The authorities later said that it appeared her death was related to a pre-existing medical condition, however it has prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/30/new-york-transit-accessibility-mother-death-fall\">demands to improve accessibility</a> on the subway. The incident caused the mayor, Bill de Blasio, to state on Twitter: \u201cThe subway system is not accessible for everyone, and that\u2019s an environment the [Metropolitan Transport Authority] should not allow.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1090328774837600256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"hidden\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is a heartbreaking tragedy that never should have happened.

You must be able to keep a child safe but also within touching reach; you must carry luggage, sit to feed, avoid high levels of air pollution, regulate a healthy temperature, be able to change a nappy and go to the toilet yourself, and eventually guard against a mobile-but-unstable child who insists on walking. While slings and rucksack carriers may make navigating public transport easier, they are not always suitable for parents with disabilities, nor the solution to something as nuanced as finding a suitable place to feed your child. I can\u2019t be the only person who has sat on a concrete bollard, in the rain, beside two lanes of traffic, with my shirt open, my buggy wedged against a set of fragrant railings, wondering if there might be a better way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab5eccd9586be5a75245ae5d6249a56c05c6cfca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab5eccd9586be5a75245ae5d6249a56c05c6cfca/0_165_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steep stairs, such as these at a subway station in Manhattan, are a nightmare for those with mobility issues or with a pram or pushchair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steep stairs, such as these at a subway station in Manhattan, are a nightmare for those with mobility issues or with a pram or pushchair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Greenberg/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, it is easy, as a parent, to start to view any transport network \u2013 whether it\u2019s in London or S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 as simply impossible when travelling with children. Steps, footbridges, broken lifts, narrow trains, gaps between train and platform; all are a nightmare for those with mobility issues or in wheelchairs, and a significant obstacle for anyone with a pram, buggy or pushchair.</p> <p>A few cities are taking steps to make the urban landscape more accessible to parents, from the <a href=\"http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/\">Universal Design</a> principles innate to Singapore\u2019s Building Construction Authority to TfL\u2019s Baby On Board badges. In <a href=\"https://www.wmata.com/service/accessibility/\">Washington, DC</a> all 91 Metro stations are fully accessible, with gap reducers between train and platform and priority seating in each carriage.</p> <p>So why are just 117 out of New York\u2019s 472 subway stations fully accessible? Why does the Paris Metro have <a href=\"https://www.ratp.fr/accessibilite/accessibilite-des-reseaux#1-attached-to-anchor\">just one accessible, barrier-free line</a>? While it could be argued that including these features at the time of construction (much of the subway in Washington, DC was built in the 1970s) is easier than retrofitting them into Victorian engineering, for parents it can often seem that the problem is not one of practicality, but of priority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b1168ec116cb7a888a097029c353c605ab13fa12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1168ec116cb7a888a097029c353c605ab13fa12/0_61_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Washington DC Metro, built in the 1970s with greater accessibility in mind than many of its Victorian counterparts, such as the London underground.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Washington DC Metro, built in the 1970s with greater accessibility in mind than many of its Victorian counterparts, such as the London underground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Geographic Image Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In particular, urban design often seems to set wheelchair users in competition for space against parents or other people with disabilities. Having a single space for both wheelchair and buggy users immediately sets up a necessary but unpleasant hierarchy of need. Too often, I see bus drivers simply fail to let wheelchair users on a crowded bus, despite the fact that, by law, they must take priority over those with buggies or pushchairs.</p> <p>In Berlin, most buses have a designated space for three buggies, or a wheelchair and two buggies. But the solution could, perhaps, be as simple as providing more pull-down seats, providing space for disabled, non-disabled and pushchair users alike. Luggage racks could help stop children having to vie for space with suitcases and shopping trolleys. <a href=\"http://www.japan-accessible.com/transport/metro/tokyo.htm\">In Tokyo</a>, many trains have specific carriages with space for prams and wheelchairs, with their position marked on the platform so passengers can more easily wait in the right spot. I have been pleased to notice the overhead signs on many London underground stations indicating where the wheelchair and buggy sections will be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"327a3ee95799c74793e868009eaa7f33555e6d8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/327a3ee95799c74793e868009eaa7f33555e6d8f/0_229_5904_3542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pushchair and wheelchair boarding sign at UK railway station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pushchair and wheelchair boarding sign at UK railway station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Underhill/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Better training could help for drivers and other transport staff, who often seem to feel as though the onus is on parents to take up less space. The NHS advice is for all babies to lie flat in a buggy or pram until they are able to sit up unaided (approximately around six months) with preference for a carry cot \u2013 or bassinet \u2013 on wheels for the first few months. It is therefore not quite so easy for parents to choose a fold-up or space-saving option.</p> <p>Because public attitudes to small children are almost universally positive, we can too easily slip into believing that parents can \u201cget by\u201d thanks to the assistance of strangers. Sadly, the bystander effect \u2013 the psychological state that tells onlookers that someone else will help, so you don\u2019t need to \u2013 is as visible at the top of station steps or by an unlowered kerb as anywhere else in the city environment. In order to break it, we can look to better signage and design. For instance, upholstering your priority seats in a different fabric to make them visually conspicuous, as they have done with bright yellow seat covers in the Bay Area Rapid Transport trains around San Francisco, or colour-coding lifts for disabled and buggy users. Once you introduce ramps, lifts, lowered buses, in the ways recognised by the European Commission Access City Award in cities like Lyon, Chester, Milan and Viborg, you no longer place the onus on the public to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. Moreover, we can do more to inform parents of the insurance and liability responsibility that often falls to staff: for instance, a Transport for London employee may ask you to take your child out of a buggy before carrying it up the stairs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"057314bb817200015b2583b5a166069bdcc84610\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/057314bb817200015b2583b5a166069bdcc84610/0_0_917_550/500.jpg\" alt=\"Highly visible priority seating on a Bay Area Rapid Transport train, San Francisco.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Highly visible priority seating on a Bay Area Rapid Transport train, San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicia Kieselhorst/BART</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are other child safety issues on public transport. A 2017 WHO report said that <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2017/03/polluted-environments-kill-1-7-million-children-each-year-un-health-agency-reports/\">570,000 children under the age of five died every year from illnesses that could be linked to pollution</a>. Air pollution, while a problem for all city dwellers, is particularly dangerous at traffic highpoints like bus stops, road junctions, traffic lights: places where parents with buggies are impelled to wait. I had never asked so many idling cars to switch off their engines as I have since having a child in a buggy at exhaust-pipe height. Low emission zones, congestion charges, bicycle subsidies and disincentives for parents to drive to schools and offices could all improve air quality without great change to public infrastructure.</p> <p>A city accessible for parents, along with wheelchair users and disabled people, is simply a city that is better to live in for everyone. I was lucky, that day on the footbridge. I managed to grab my second handle in time. I managed to thunk my way down to the platform despite the sweat on my palms and the racing in my chest. I managed to get away with it that time. But it could very easily have gone the other way. Malaysia Goodson was not an exception, but must be a warning to us all.</p> <h2>Best and worst city transport</h2> <h2>Berlin</h2> <p><a href=\"https://wheelchairtravel.org/berlin/public-transportation/\">Wheelchairtravel.org</a> describes Berlin as having \u201cone of the most wheelchair-friendly public transportation systems in the world\u201d including accessible trams, buses and trains. The two major metro rail systems, U-Bahn and S-Bahn, are accessible at the majority of stations, while the Berliner Verkehrsbetrieb (<a href=\"https://fahrinfo.bvg.de/barrierefrei/bin/query.bin/en?ld=0.1&amp;l=vs_bf&amp;\">BVG) site</a> allows users to plan a wheelchair friendly route through the city, including barrier-free routes. Although Berlin\u2019s famous cobbled streets can prove a challenge for anyone navigating the city with a pushchair, the city is largely flat and covered by a network of accessible buses. The German government has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/01/greens-among-critics-as-pre-school-berliners-get-free-childcare\">abolished kindergarten fees</a> in Berlin making it one of Europe\u2019s most attractive cities for young families.</p> <h2>Breda, The Netherlands</h2> <p>Despite being a medieval city, the winner of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=88&amp;eventsId=1375&amp;furtherEvents=yes\">2019 European Commission Access City Award</a> has wheelchair access in over 800 shops and businesses. Most of the sport centres, museums and theatres are also wheelchair accessible under the banner campaign of \u201cBreda For Everyone\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5555659696df8312ffd8c53d8aba5b628e99ff66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5555659696df8312ffd8c53d8aba5b628e99ff66/0_337_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cycle, pushchair and wheelchair carriage on Copenhagen\u2019 S-Train.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cycle, pushchair and wheelchair carriage on Copenhagen\u2019 S-Train.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Realimage/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Seattle</h2> <p>In a bid to make the windy, hilly city more accessible for wheelchair and buggy users, Seattle\u2019s <a href=\"https://accessmap.io/about\">AccessMap</a> allows users to plot routes according to customised settings including avoiding steep inclines and raised kerbs.</p> <h2>Copenhagen</h2> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/traveltrade/copenhagen/disabled/copenhagen-disabled\">VisitCopenhagen</a> all metro stations are equipped with lifts, while the S-train has an adjustable ramp that the driver can lower to allow wheelchairs or buggies to board. Most of the city parks have paved walkways and breastfeeding is common in public areas.</p> <h2>New York</h2> <p>Just 117 out of 472 New York subway stations are fully accessible, and only a quarter have lifts, making it almost impossible to navigate without a high degree of local knowledge. However, a law was passed on 1 January requiring all new and renovated buildings with public toilets to include changing tables, including in men\u2019s toilets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/14/what-disability-accessible-city-look-like\">What would a truly disabled-accessible city look like?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Paris</h2> <p>Although most of the Parisian bus network has wheelchair access, the Metro has <a href=\"https://www.ratp.fr/accessibilite/accessibilite-des-reseaux#1-attached-to-anchor\">just one accessible, barrier-free line (number 14) </a>and at many stations parents will have to ask Metro staff to open ticket gates as there is no wider buggy or wheelchair gate and for assistance getting on and off of the trains. Like so many cities, Paris also suffers from narrow pavements, cobbled streets and steep inclines, some of which include steps.</p> <p><em>What are your experiences of city transport?

Sadly, the bystander effect \u2013 the psychological state that tells onlookers that someone else will help, so you don\u2019t need to \u2013 is as visible at the top of station steps or by an unlowered kerb as anywhere else in the city environment. In order to break it, we can look to better signage and design. For instance, upholstering your priority seats in a different fabric to make them visually conspicuous, as they have done with bright yellow seat covers in the Bay Area Rapid Transport trains around San Francisco, or colour-coding lifts for disabled and buggy users. Once you introduce ramps, lifts, lowered buses, in the ways recognised by the European Commission Access City Award in cities like Lyon, Chester, Milan and Viborg, you no longer place the onus on the public to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. Moreover, we can do more to inform parents of the insurance and liability responsibility that often falls to staff: for instance, a Transport for London employee may ask you to take your child out of a buggy before carrying it up the stairs. There are other child safety issues on public transport. A 2017 WHO report said that 570,000 children under the age of five died every year from illnesses that could be linked to pollution. Air pollution, while a problem for all city dwellers, is particularly dangerous at traffic highpoints like bus stops, road junctions, traffic lights: places where parents with buggies are impelled to wait. I had never asked so many idling cars to switch off their engines as I have since having a child in a buggy at exhaust-pipe height. Low emission zones, congestion charges, bicycle subsidies and disincentives for parents to drive to schools and offices could all improve air quality without great change to public infrastructure. A city accessible for parents, along with wheelchair users and disabled people, is simply a city that is better to live in for everyone. I was lucky, that day on the footbridge. I managed to grab my second handle in time. I managed to thunk my way down to the platform despite the sweat on my palms and the racing in my chest. I managed to get away with it that time. But it could very easily have gone the other way. Malaysia Goodson was not an exception, but must be a warning to us all. Best and worst city transport Berlin Wheelchairtravel.org describes Berlin as having \u201cone of the most wheelchair-friendly public transportation systems in the world\u201d including accessible trams, buses and trains. The two major metro rail systems, U-Bahn and S-Bahn, are accessible at the majority of stations, while the Berliner Verkehrsbetrieb (BVG) site allows users to plan a wheelchair friendly route through the city, including barrier-free routes. Although Berlin\u2019s famous cobbled streets can prove a challenge for anyone navigating the city with a pushchair, the city is largely flat and covered by a network of accessible buses. The German government has also abolished kindergarten fees in Berlin making it one of Europe\u2019s most attractive cities for young families. Breda, The Netherlands Despite being a medieval city, the winner of the 2019 European Commission Access City Award has wheelchair access in over 800 shops and businesses. Most of the sport centres, museums and theatres are also wheelchair accessible under the banner campaign of \u201cBreda For Everyone\u201d. Seattle In a bid to make the windy, hilly city more accessible for wheelchair and buggy users, Seattle\u2019s AccessMap allows users to plot routes according to customised settings including avoiding steep inclines and raised kerbs. Copenhagen According to VisitCopenhagen all metro stations are equipped with lifts, while the S-train has an adjustable ramp that the driver can lower to allow wheelchairs or buggies to board. Most of the city parks have paved walkways and breastfeeding is common in public areas. New York Just 117 out of 472 New York subway stations are fully accessible, and only a quarter have lifts, making it almost impossible to navigate without a high degree of local knowledge. However, a law was passed on 1 January requiring all new and renovated buildings with public toilets to include changing tables, including in men\u2019s toilets. Paris Although most of the Parisian bus network has wheelchair access, the Metro has just one accessible, barrier-free line (number 14) and at many stations parents will have to ask Metro staff to open ticket gates as there is no wider buggy or wheelchair gate and for assistance getting on and off of the trains. Like so many cities, Paris also suffers from narrow pavements, cobbled streets and steep inclines, some of which include steps. What are your experiences of city transport?

      "body": "<p>Not long after she was told that she would never be able to have children, Lorna Gibb travelled to Doha, to begin teaching at Qatar University. She had spent time in the Middle East, researching a biography of Lady Hester Stanhope (she has also written a novel, and a biography of Rebecca West). Gibb had some idea, she thought, of what to expect. But she was not prepared for the degree to which a woman only made sense in that culture if she could give birth. Gibb describes the strategies she developed to explain, to deflect; finally she meets Halima, seemingly the mother of one of her students, but, in fact, only a first wife: when she was unable to conceive, her husband married again, and all four family members lived together. Halima points at the dusty ground. \u201cI am like that,\u201d she says with breath-stopping bluntness, \u201cthe barren place where nothing grows. Ayesha is like the palm trees \u2026 See how the green parakeets congregate and sing and nest in her branches.\u201d</p> <p>This is a book so much more powerful for Gibb having searched the world for childless voices. It tells the author\u2019s own story, too, as one voice among many: her far from unusual history of undiagnosed endometriosis. \u201cSome women just have bad periods,\u201d as one doctor put it. These \u201cperiods\u201d were in reality various organs bleeding in turn, causing so much internal damage that she occasionally collapsed from the pain. Gibb\u2019s account is restrained, coloured with love and gratitude \u2013 for the husband who stands by her through her illness (she knows how many millions of men do not); for the fact that early menopause means \u201cI have not had endometriosis for 10 years now and I know how fortunate that makes me\u201d. But at the same time it takes years to come to terms with childlessness: \u201cThere is no sleep so deep I will not find you there,\u201d she writes, drawing on Beckett\u2019s <em>Footfalls</em>. \u201cMy unborn child, the one who will never be, finds me even in sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Gibb picks her way through studies and documentaries, and sends out searching emails, looking for those who arrived at childlessness because their bodies, like her own, refused. She looks for those who were refused \u2013 those whose genital mutilation renders them infertile, for instance. Those who never met a partner or met one too late. Those who have had children removed (Indigenous Australians have argued that the current rates of removal into care are far higher even than those of the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/stolen-generations\" title=\"\">stolen generation</a>). Women who have suffered enforced sterilisation \u2013 for instance, the 17-year-old in Canada (where the Alberta Eugenics Board kept detailed records) who was sterilised in 1946 because she was \u201cbossy and bad-tempered in her own home\u201d. There are people who had one child who then died, a state for which no English term exists. \u201cIt\u2019s as though,\u201d says Sally Holland, whose only son Luke died when he was 14, \u201cit\u2019s so terrible they couldn\u2019t even give it a name.\u201d And of course, those who choose: 14% of women in the US; the rapidly growing numbers opting out in countries such as Italy and Japan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a5a8186c85b698b3d310bdeabed55b1aa8c86030\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5a8186c85b698b3d310bdeabed55b1aa8c86030/362_329_4897_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lorna Gibb makes the case for empathy, imagination and respect.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lorna Gibb makes the case for empathy, imagination and respect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Doak/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Ghana childless women can be called witches, or are believed to have been cursed by witches; they can be sent to \u201cwitch camps\u201d, where they are safe but exiled. Everywhere, childless women are abused (often after the first year of marriage, when the issue \u2013 always the woman\u2019s \u2013 starts to become clear).

      "bodyText": "Not long after she was told that she would never be able to have children, Lorna Gibb travelled to Doha, to begin teaching at Qatar University. She had spent time in the Middle East, researching a biography of Lady Hester Stanhope (she has also written a novel, and a biography of Rebecca West). Gibb had some idea, she thought, of what to expect. But she was not prepared for the degree to which a woman only made sense in that culture if she could give birth. Gibb describes the strategies she developed to explain, to deflect; finally she meets Halima, seemingly the mother of one of her students, but, in fact, only a first wife: when she was unable to conceive, her husband married again, and all four family members lived together. Halima points at the dusty ground. \u201cI am like that,\u201d she says with breath-stopping bluntness, \u201cthe barren place where nothing grows. Ayesha is like the palm trees \u2026 See how the green parakeets congregate and sing and nest in her branches.\u201d This is a book so much more powerful for Gibb having searched the world for childless voices. It tells the author\u2019s own story, too, as one voice among many: her far from unusual history of undiagnosed endometriosis. \u201cSome women just have bad periods,\u201d as one doctor put it. These \u201cperiods\u201d were in reality various organs bleeding in turn, causing so much internal damage that she occasionally collapsed from the pain. Gibb\u2019s account is restrained, coloured with love and gratitude \u2013 for the husband who stands by her through her illness (she knows how many millions of men do not); for the fact that early menopause means \u201cI have not had endometriosis for 10 years now and I know how fortunate that makes me\u201d. But at the same time it takes years to come to terms with childlessness: \u201cThere is no sleep so deep I will not find you there,\u201d she writes, drawing on Beckett\u2019s Footfalls. \u201cMy unborn child, the one who will never be, finds me even in sleep.\u201d Gibb picks her way through studies and documentaries, and sends out searching emails, looking for those who arrived at childlessness because their bodies, like her own, refused. She looks for those who were refused \u2013 those whose genital mutilation renders them infertile, for instance. Those who never met a partner or met one too late. Those who have had children removed (Indigenous Australians have argued that the current rates of removal into care are far higher even than those of the first stolen generation). Women who have suffered enforced sterilisation \u2013 for instance, the 17-year-old in Canada (where the Alberta Eugenics Board kept detailed records) who was sterilised in 1946 because she was \u201cbossy and bad-tempered in her own home\u201d. There are people who had one child who then died, a state for which no English term exists. \u201cIt\u2019s as though,\u201d says Sally Holland, whose only son Luke died when he was 14, \u201cit\u2019s so terrible they couldn\u2019t even give it a name.\u201d And of course, those who choose: 14% of women in the US; the rapidly growing numbers opting out in countries such as Italy and Japan. In Ghana childless women can be called witches, or are believed to have been cursed by witches; they can be sent to \u201cwitch camps\u201d, where they are safe but exiled. Everywhere, childless women are abused (often after the first year of marriage, when the issue \u2013 always the woman\u2019s \u2013 starts to become clear). Over and over again, they blame themselves; shockingly often they choose not to continue living. During the Sri Lankan war the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam fielded combat units of suicide bombers of both sexes; the women, called Black Tigresses, were often childless because, as one peace campaigner puts it, \u201cacting as a human bomb is an understood and accepted offering for a woman who will never be a mother\u201d. In the west, Gibb argues, the punishments include working pay (fathers in Britain earn a fifth more than childless men); longer hours, blatantly inequitable taxation and political discourse that ennobles \u201chard\u2011working families\u201d. Gibb directs a rare outburst of fury at the TV journalist Victoria Derbyshire, who prefaced an interview about the three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi, who was found drowned on a Turkish beach, with the words: \u201cIf you\u2019re a parent, you might find this upsetting.\u201d What was the assumption, that if you had no child you were somehow \u201cless caring, less kind, and consequently of less value\u201d?

      "bodyText": "Theresa May fired a warning shot at Brexit supporters on Tuesday, insisting there was \u201cno suggestion\u201d Britain would leave the EU without an insurance provision to protect against a hard border in Northern Ireland. At a speech in Belfast, May would only accept that technology could \u201cplay a part\u201d in any alternative arrangements and that she would not countenance anything that would disrupt the lives of border communities. Brexit supporters immediately expressed their alarm at some of May\u2019s language, which they fear could be read as a step back from previous assurances. \u201cShe knows what she promised us,\u201d one ERG source said. \u201cEven if she didn\u2019t mean what she said, we do.\u201d The comments came as May prepared to meet EU leaders in Brussels for the first time since the historic defeat of her Brexit deal, where she is expected to formally request the reopening of the withdrawal agreement in order to address concerns about the backstop. The prime minister will travel to the Belgian capital on Thursday, meeting the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU parliament president Antonio Tajani, and the European council president. Donald Tusk. Both Tusk and Juncker have been adamant that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. Number 10 sources suggested they did not expect a warm reception, but that it would signal the start of a new diplomatic process, involving proposals on the backstop worked on by MPs and ministers. Earlier on Tuesday, May told her cabinet she would not countenance any delay to the UK\u2019s exit on 29 March, a message to ministers such as Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid who have suggested at least some delay might now be inevitable. Ministers who are more pessimistic about the prospects of the UK leaving on time with a deal held their tongues in the meeting after May\u2019s warning. \u201cShe was pretty clear she had no time for anyone calling for it to be extended,\u201d one cabinet source said. However, senior government sources increasingly believe the impasse may not be resolved until March, given no full EU council summit is due until late that month. That may ultimately become an excuse, some believe, for the prime minister to delay the UK\u2019s exit in order to finalise any compromise. In cabinet, ministers including Amber Rudd and Michael Gove are understood to have underlined how they did not believe the UK public had fully comprehended the severe damage no deal would do. May did not set out explicitly to her cabinet the changes she would seek when she meets EU leaders. However, speaking in Belfast, May said she knew there were anxieties in Northern Ireland about replacing the backstop arrangement and said there would always be an insurance option to prevent a hard border contained within the withdrawal agreement. \u201cI\u2019m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure that in the future there is provision for this \u2013 it has been called an insurance policy, the backstop \u2013 that ensures that if the future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, there will be arrangements in place to ensure that we deliver no hard border.\u201d Earlier in her speech, May also sounded a note of caution about the alternative arrangements that some MPs have been working on to replace the backstop. She said a seamless border was \u201cthe cornerstone around which the community in Northern Ireland has come together to deliver peace and prosperity\u201d. \u201cI will not do anything to put that at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cSo while I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.\u201d Tory MPs from a number of different Brexit factions are working on a proposal for alternative technological arrangements to the backstop, known as the Malthouse compromise after the housing minister, Kit Malthouse, who brought the groups together. Members of the European Research Group, which is made up of Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers, agreed to back a compromise amendment last week on changes to the backstop after assurances from May that it would mean reopening the withdrawal agreement. Downing Street would not say if work by the Brexit secretary Steve Barclay, who is working with Conservative backbenchers on the Malthouse compromise, would conclude by the end of Wednesday. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is also drawing up a proposal on legally binding limits to the backstop. At her speech in Belfast, May said she would never allow a hard border to be erected on the island of Ireland. \u201cNorthern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish government or the European Union to prevent a return to borders of the past,\u201d she said at a speech in Belfast. \u201cThe UK government will not let that happen.

The latest study by the Consortium for Research into Deaf Education (CRIDE) and the National Deaf Children\u2019s Society found that the number of facilities for deaf children in schools had fallen from 260 to 240 in the past two years, a drop of 8%. The research found that the number of specialist teachers working in such units had fallen by 10% in the past two years and 21% since 2014.

The National Deaf Children\u2019s Society said that deaf pupils who lose their unit or specialist teacher miss out on crucial one-to-one support at school, while teachers and teaching assistants were left without advice and training on teaching deaf children.

The charity warned that the cuts could lead deaf pupils to fall even further behind at school and reduce parental choice as to how their children were educated. They raised concerns that, in many areas, schools and local authorities were failing to inform parents of the existence of specialist units, which then allowed them to close them due to low pupil numbers.

The minimum five-week wait for a first benefit payment left nearly half of claimants it advised unable to pay household bills, or forced them to go without essentials such as food or heating, it said, while 54% had to borrow cash from family and friends to stay afloat. \u201cHalf the people we help with universal credit are still struggling to keep a roof over their heads while they wait for their first payment,\u201d said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice.

      "bodyText": "A flickering candle and 19 rose petals \u2013 one for every year he lived \u2013 adorn a shrine in what used to be the home of Alixon Pisani. \u201cWe love you,\u201d reads a note beside a black and white photograph of the recently killed teen. It was 10pm on the night of 22 January when friends arrived outside with the news that Pisani was dead; gunned down as he demonstrated against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s teetering regime in Catia, a traditionally working-class area of western Caracas. \u201cHe was still just a boy,\u201d said the woman who raised him, his aunt, Nivea Pisani. \u201cThey are murderers \u2026 demons,\u201d she said of her nephew\u2019s killers. \u201cHe just went out to protest because we are going hungry. How many more will die if we carry on like this?\u201d Pisani, an unemployed 45-year-old, is still waiting for an official explanation about who shot her nephew and why. His death certificate states he died from a firearm injury but offers no hint of the weapon used \u2013 or the motive. But she believes his killers were from Faes, a shadowy and fearsome special forces unit activists suspect Maduro has tasked with pacifying the city\u2019s impoverished redbrick barrios in a bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of Chavismo. \u201cThe poor areas are where most people live \u2013 and since we don\u2019t support them any more I guess they want to kill us all,\u201d said Pisani, who says witnesses told her Faes agents arrived at the protest shortly before her nephew was shot in the arm and chest. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez first took office in January 1999 \u2013 just a few months before Alixon Pisani was born \u2013 vowing to blaze a Boilvarian trail for Venezuela\u2019s long-forgotten poor. In his first post-election speech, the comandante promised he would not rest while there were still children in the streets and families going hungry. \u201cToday a new battle starts for the salvation of Venezuela,\u201d Ch\u00e1vez said. In the early years of Chavismo, its leader won global accolades and a cult following for his crusade to help Venezuela\u2019s poor. Social projects known as misiones brought healthcare and education to millions of disenfranchised citizens. \u201c[Ch\u00e1vez] showed us there is a different and a better way of doing things: it\u2019s called socialism, it\u2019s called social justice,\u201d Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in 2013. But two decades after Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s rise to power, Venezuela is on its knees, and many who were once loyalists have lost faith in his successor. And, increasingly, they are taking to the streets to demand change. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had protests here in Catia \u2013 this is new,\u201d said Pisani, attributing the shift to the country\u2019s economic and social collapse under Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir. \u201cBefore, I\u2019d open my fridge and see ham, cheese, eggs, meat, chicken.

Faes \u2013 the special action force \u2013 has earned notoriety since the uprising against Maduro began last month.

Donald Trump has attacked \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d into Russia\u2019s election meddling and announced a meeting with Kim Jong-un later this month as he delivered a lengthy State of the Union address overnight. \u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,\u201d he declared, hitting on a theme that clashed with his appeals for unity. Addressing a joint chamber of Congress, Trump reasserted his vow to build a wall on the southern US border with Mexico \u2013 though stopped short of threatening to invoke \u201cnational emergency\u201d powers. He covered a range of topics, from new funding to end the HIV epidemic to rebuilding America\u2019s \u201ccrumbling infrastructure\u201d and supporting the people of Venezuela \u2013 here are the five key takeaways. Trump had spirited exchanges with Democratic women of the House who all dressed in suffragette white, as he hailed advances in women\u2019s representation in employment and in Congress, which they stood and applauded. In response to Trump\u2019s address, Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the race for governor in Georgia in an election marred by accusations of voter suppression, called voting rights the \u201cnext battle for our democracy \u2026 The foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections, where voters pick their leaders \u2013 not where politicians pick their voters.\u201d If you would like to read more from the western side of the pond, you can sign up to the US morning briefing. * * * \u2018Insurance policy\u2019 \u2013 Hard Brexiters\u2019 feathers are ruffled after Theresa May declared in Northern Ireland there was \u201cno suggestion\u201d of Britain leaving the EU without provisions to prevent a hard border. It sounded quite like a backstop. \u201cShe knows what she promised us,\u201d said one source from the Tory leaver faction ERG. \u201cEven if she didn\u2019t mean what she said, we do.\u201d The PM is due to travel to Brussels on Thursday to proffer \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop that have been worked on by MPs and ministers. The respected NIESR economic thinktank has predicted Britain can avoid slumping into a hard-Brexit recession if the government and the EU follow through on their contingency plans. But NIESR says every Brexit outcome will still be worse for the economy than remaining in the EU. Rightwing thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) has been censured for producing a policy document that advocates a hard Brexit \u2013 as a charity it is banned from campaigning on political issues unrelated to its stated purpose of furthering education. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; A fire at Ocado\u2019s robotic warehouse in Hampshire continued to burn this morning after more than 24 hours.

      "body": "<p>The story of my life is, in some ways, the story of Europe. My father emigrated from Egypt to France in 1986, one month before I was born. My French mother fulfilled her dreams of becoming an English teacher after having grown up in the Calais region looking at the cliffs of Dover. Together they worked hard to give their children a bright future in a free, borderless, united Europe. I grew up with this dream, which has partly become a reality. But I\u2019m not sure my own children will get to enjoy the privileges of belonging to the EU in the same way \u2013 if at all.</p> <p>So I decided to go on a <a href=\"http://www.schamseu.fr/\" title=\"\">debating tour</a> of France, to better understand what makes us still believe in the strengths of the EU, as well as the fears some people have. I quit my job in Brussels at the European parliament to travel to small towns and villages in 30 of France\u2019s <em>d\u00e9partements</em> and take part in discussions with local people about Europe, immigration, Brexit and Frexit. I\u2019ve now held more than 60 such debates, ahead of the EU-wide elections due in May. Here are some of the lessons I\u2019d like to share, and which must surely hold true elsewhere in Europe too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Recent polls show only 50% of the French are against Frexit, while 27% have no opinion on the matter and 23% support it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>First, we must listen to one another. Immigration and identity are real topics, but they mask other economic and social grievances that concrete policies can and must address. People want change, and understandably so, but the risk is that they\u2019ll seek it regardless of who\u2019s promised it. I deliberately held four debates in places where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/apr/23/french-presidential-election-results-2017-latest\" title=\"\">53% of voters</a> had cast a ballot for Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election.</p> <p>I once found myself listening to an angry man telling me how \u201cAfrican and Arab immigrants can\u2019t integrate\u201d.All the while, I thought of my Arab, Muslim, immigrant father who wakes up every day before I do, works six days a week saving children\u2019s lives as a doctor, his accent an endearing reminder of Egypt. I sat there and listened to the man\u2019s concerns and then respectfully confronted his arguments with facts such as there is no connection between race and crime. But the truth is, I was lucky enough that he\u2019d shared his views in the first place. This at least allowed for a genuine exchange of ideas, and it made him feel listened to.</p> <p>Bridging the gap between EU institutions and citizens requires better work at a grassroots level. I know from working in the European parliament, at the heart of Europe\u2019s democracy, how worried most people are about the rise of xenophobia and Euroscepticism, and how hesitant they are about addressing this head-on. But travelling to reach out to voters can contribute to shifting their mindsets. Shunning that effort and keeping to the \u201cBrussels bubble\u201d is a huge mistake because it allows the far right to monopolise public discourse, or set its terms.</p> <p>After David Cameron called for a referendum on EU membership, the Scottish MEP for whom I then worked, <a href=\"https://www.alynsmith.eu/\" title=\"\">Alyn Smith</a>, switched from his parliamentary work to travel across Scotland, listening and speaking to people from all backgrounds in dozens of events about the benefits of belonging to the EU. There has to be more of this kind of outreach across the continent.</p> <p>Another lesson is that Brexit is not as unique a phenomenon in Europe as many would like to think. France\u2019s economy, level of education and population are strikingly similar to the UK\u2019s. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-polls-far-right-marine-le-pen-ahead-macron-rise-europe-en-marche-eu-elections-a8616776.html\" title=\"\">Recent polls show</a> only 50% of the French are against Frexit, while 27% have no opinion on the matter and 23% support it. Despite France being a founding member of the EU and the host country of its parliament in Strasbourg, most people I met on my tour of the country seemed utterly unaware that voters elect the European parliament through direct suffrage, and that its role in crafting EU laws is more decisive than the commission\u2019s. In fact, what\u2019s struck me most over the course of these debates in France\u2019s heartlands is just how few people understand the workings and immense benefits of EU membership.</p> <p>The European parliament has direct, tangible effects on our lives. It can weigh on financial markets, on climate change, on the tech giants. It is relevant in so many positive ways \u2013 not a hotbed of bureaucrats. Discussing its role with people in local communities can shift perceptions. During a debate in the region of Savoie, in the French Alps, one lady told me she had no interest whatsoever in the EU elections. I mentioned Europe\u2019s role in defending minority and women rights, and it meant a lot to me that she left the meeting saying she\u2019d cast a vote for her \u201cchildren\u2019s future\u201d. Likewise, in discussions with supporters of the <em>gilets jaunes</em> movement, I saw how making the case for citizens\u2019 empowerment could actually convince people to vote in the EU elections, not just stand in the cold at roundabouts complaining about \u201celites\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/30/steve-bannon-trump-us-election-europe-far-right\">Europe shouldn\u2019t fear Steve Bannon. It should fear the hype that surrounds him | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the heart of the European project is an endeavour to build a better future for us all. If Islamophobia is on the rise, we should fight it with just as much energy as we do antisemitism, and vice versa. Indifference is a recipe for collective failure. If you\u2019re a citizen of an EU country, get involved. Call your MEP, write a petition, support a citizens\u2019 initiative, join a party or an NGO you believe in. Engage with your community, especially in the face of hardship. After the November 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/bataclan-witnesses-recount-horror-paris-attacks\" title=\"\">terrorist attacks</a> in Paris, I organised a gathering around a group of Syrian refugee musicians who\u2019d arrived in Europe on rafts. Together we founded <a href=\"http://www.schamseu.fr/newsweek-concert-syrians-got-talent/\" title=\"\">Syrians Got Talent</a>, who have since given 19 concerts across Europe. We were disparaged by <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2016/03/31/syrians-got-talent-brussels-solidarity-concert-to-protest-demonisation-of-migrants/\" title=\"\">Breitbart News</a>, the far-right website set up by Donald Trump\u2019s then presidential campaign strategist, Steve Bannon. We just went on, building trust between locals and refugees.</p> <p>The fight for a united and strong EU is a worthwhile one. Debating with people in small localities throughout France has reminded me \u2013 and hopefully others \u2013 that the power of the European project lies in its citizens, in transcending national borders so that we can live together. Now is the time to stand up to the anti-EU push Bannon has launched. This May, for the first time in its history, the European parliament risks becoming a fulcrum for the far right. The significance of this should not be underestimated.</p> <p>\u2022 Schams El Ghoneimi is a French-Egyptian pro-EU activist based in Paris; he has worked for the European parliament and founded Syrians Got Talent, a Syrian refugee musical group</p>",

I\u2019ve now held more than 60 such debates, ahead of the EU-wide elections due in May. Here are some of the lessons I\u2019d like to share, and which must surely hold true elsewhere in Europe too. First, we must listen to one another. Immigration and identity are real topics, but they mask other economic and social grievances that concrete policies can and must address. People want change, and understandably so, but the risk is that they\u2019ll seek it regardless of who\u2019s promised it. I deliberately held four debates in places where 53% of voters had cast a ballot for Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election. I once found myself listening to an angry man telling me how \u201cAfrican and Arab immigrants can\u2019t integrate\u201d.All the while, I thought of my Arab, Muslim, immigrant father who wakes up every day before I do, works six days a week saving children\u2019s lives as a doctor, his accent an endearing reminder of Egypt. I sat there and listened to the man\u2019s concerns and then respectfully confronted his arguments with facts such as there is no connection between race and crime. But the truth is, I was lucky enough that he\u2019d shared his views in the first place. This at least allowed for a genuine exchange of ideas, and it made him feel listened to. Bridging the gap between EU institutions and citizens requires better work at a grassroots level. I know from working in the European parliament, at the heart of Europe\u2019s democracy, how worried most people are about the rise of xenophobia and Euroscepticism, and how hesitant they are about addressing this head-on. But travelling to reach out to voters can contribute to shifting their mindsets. Shunning that effort and keeping to the \u201cBrussels bubble\u201d is a huge mistake because it allows the far right to monopolise public discourse, or set its terms. After David Cameron called for a referendum on EU membership, the Scottish MEP for whom I then worked, Alyn Smith, switched from his parliamentary work to travel across Scotland, listening and speaking to people from all backgrounds in dozens of events about the benefits of belonging to the EU. There has to be more of this kind of outreach across the continent. Another lesson is that Brexit is not as unique a phenomenon in Europe as many would like to think. France\u2019s economy, level of education and population are strikingly similar to the UK\u2019s. Recent polls show only 50% of the French are against Frexit, while 27% have no opinion on the matter and 23% support it. Despite France being a founding member of the EU and the host country of its parliament in Strasbourg, most people I met on my tour of the country seemed utterly unaware that voters elect the European parliament through direct suffrage, and that its role in crafting EU laws is more decisive than the commission\u2019s. In fact, what\u2019s struck me most over the course of these debates in France\u2019s heartlands is just how few people understand the workings and immense benefits of EU membership. The European parliament has direct, tangible effects on our lives. It can weigh on financial markets, on climate change, on the tech giants. It is relevant in so many positive ways \u2013 not a hotbed of bureaucrats. Discussing its role with people in local communities can shift perceptions. During a debate in the region of Savoie, in the French Alps, one lady told me she had no interest whatsoever in the EU elections. I mentioned Europe\u2019s role in defending minority and women rights, and it meant a lot to me that she left the meeting saying she\u2019d cast a vote for her \u201cchildren\u2019s future\u201d. Likewise, in discussions with supporters of the gilets jaunes movement, I saw how making the case for citizens\u2019 empowerment could actually convince people to vote in the EU elections, not just stand in the cold at roundabouts complaining about \u201celites\u201d. At the heart of the European project is an endeavour to build a better future for us all. If Islamophobia is on the rise, we should fight it with just as much energy as we do antisemitism, and vice versa. Indifference is a recipe for collective failure. If you\u2019re a citizen of an EU country, get involved. Call your MEP, write a petition, support a citizens\u2019 initiative, join a party or an NGO you believe in. Engage with your community, especially in the face of hardship. After the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, I organised a gathering around a group of Syrian refugee musicians who\u2019d arrived in Europe on rafts. Together we founded Syrians Got Talent, who have since given 19 concerts across Europe. We were disparaged by Breitbart News, the far-right website set up by Donald Trump\u2019s then presidential campaign strategist, Steve Bannon. We just went on, building trust between locals and refugees. The fight for a united and strong EU is a worthwhile one. Debating with people in small localities throughout France has reminded me \u2013 and hopefully others \u2013 that the power of the European project lies in its citizens, in transcending national borders so that we can live together. Now is the time to stand up to the anti-EU push Bannon has launched. This May, for the first time in its history, the European parliament risks becoming a fulcrum for the far right. The significance of this should not be underestimated. \u2022 Schams El Ghoneimi is a French-Egyptian pro-EU activist based in Paris; he has worked for the European parliament and founded Syrians Got Talent, a Syrian refugee musical group",

      "body": "<p>On Oslo\u2019s Victoria Terrasse there\u2019s a white door marked 108. Behind it was once an office in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but before that, late in the 19th century, these rooms were occupied by a figure who has done more for Norway\u2019s reputation abroad than all of its foreign ministers put together.</p> <p>This was the apartment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ibsen\">Henrik Ibsen</a>, generally regarded as the second-greatest playwright ever, and the second most-performed dramatist in the world. In both these criteria he is bested only by Shakespeare.</p> <p>Ibsen\u2019s living quarters have now become a significant venue in his thriving theatrical afterlife. For a week in January, two of Norway\u2019s leading classical actors \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175758/\">K\u00e5re Conradi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/piatjelta/?hl=en\">Pia Tjelta</a> \u2013 were rehearsing here with a cast of Norwegian and UK-based actors for a bilingual production of Ibsen\u2019s 1888 play <a href=\"https://www.the-print-room.org/theatre/spring-2019/the-lady-from-the-sea/\">The Lady from the Sea</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.the-print-room.org/theatre/spring-2019/the-lady-from-the-sea/\">premieres this week in London</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4ba12b04b339febd327abd12e08970f744067a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4ba12b04b339febd327abd12e08970f744067a8/0_443_7488_4493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henrik\u2019s house \u2026 rehearsals for Lady from the Sea in Ibsen\u2019s Victoria Terrasse flat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henrik\u2019s house \u2026 rehearsals for Lady from the Sea in Ibsen\u2019s Victoria Terrasse flat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Antero Hein</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This cross-country staging is produced by the <a href=\"http://www.ibsen.co/\">Norwegian Ibsen Company</a>, founded by Conradi. The actor got government permission to rehearse The Lady from the Sea in the dramatist\u2019s old flat, and hopes in the future to stage productions in its rooms, and a courtyard below. The company also hopes to tour Ibsen around the world, much like the Royal Shakespeare Company, with this London run a declaration of intent.</p> <p>\u201cIbsen is Norwegian by birth but in spirit international,\u201d says Conradi, showing me around the rooms. What was once the Ibsens\u2019 kitchen is now a government broom cupboard.</p> <p>The dramatist lived above Victoria Terrasse from 1891-95, a period that represents much of his creative life in Norway. Ibsen had left his homeland in 1864, disgusted by its politics and cultural conservatism. He exiled himself for 27 years to Italy and Germany, during which his dim view of Norwegian taste seemed to be confirmed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/20/richard-eyre-spirit-ibsen-ghosts\">Ghosts</a>, which dared to use inherited venereal disease as a metaphor for the damage families inflict, was rubbished on publication. His plays appeared in book form first and were not performed in Oslo until years later.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he finally came home, it was to this flat,\u201d says Conradi. His reception from Norwegians, he adds, was \u201cso ecstatic that he wrote a poem that includes the line, \u2018Perhaps I should have come sooner.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f62ad901af7e23cf86d1e2c650d42c798f912753\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f62ad901af7e23cf86d1e2c650d42c798f912753/83_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viking epic \u2026 K\u00e5re Conradi, left, in Norsemen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viking epic \u2026 K\u00e5re Conradi, left, in Norsemen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Oslo, Conradi has the level of fame and admiration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/18/ralph-fiennes-interview-great-expectations\">Ralph Fiennes</a> might have in Britain.

Even the most theatre-experienced, Adrian Rawlins, has recently spent most of his time on screen, including playing Harry Potter\u2019s father, James.</p> <p>The Lady from the Sea dramatises the marriage between Dr Wangel, a widowed GP, and Ellida, reluctant stepmother to Hilde and Bolette, daughters from his first marriage. In this production the Wangels \u2013 played by Rawlins, Windsor and Bye \u2013 are expats from England, drawn to the north-west coast of Norway by the doctor\u2019s relationship with Ellida, the part taken by Tjelta.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"54efbc32a85def2c324336c35a44fca190994c0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54efbc32a85def2c324336c35a44fca190994c0c/0_780_5304_7172/740.jpg\" alt=\"Family strife \u2026 Adrian Rawlins and Pia Tjelta get in character.\" width=\"740\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Family strife \u2026 Adrian Rawlins and Pia Tjelta get in character.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antero Hein</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ashley plays Lyngstrand, a local artist. Conradi is Arnholm, Bolette\u2019s former tutor, who visits the troubled family, with R\u00f8ger as the Stranger, a sailor and fugitive from justice, who may have been Ellida\u2019s lover. The play is about the carnage caused by partings. Ellida is haunted by a lost child, a lost lover and her stepdaughters\u2019 lost mother, and is forced to decide between two versions of her life.</p> <p>In this dual-language production, the Wangels mainly speak English to each other, while Ellida talks Norwegian to Arnholm. In London, the Norwegian will be subtitled on the rear wall. For realism, the anglophone members of the Wangel family have to be able to speak the native language to locals, and to Ellida. Because the Stranger appears only late in the play, R\u00f8ger has been using rehearsal breaks to tutor the visitors.</p> <p>\u201cThey record me, and then go away to practise,\u201d he says. \u201cI show them how you form your mouth to get the Norwegian sounds, which are different.\u201d The letter O, which has four differently accented versions in Norwegian, is generally longer and rounder than the English equivalent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When he lived in Italy, Ibsen would complain that the Mediterranean was not a 'real sea'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In return, because the Stranger is said have spent a lot of time sailing transatlantic routes, Bye, who has an American mother, has been teaching R\u00f8ger US vowels. Rawlins and Tjelta have also worked on the way in which bilingual partners switch languages. \u201cMixed-nationality couples,\u201d says Tjelta, \u201cwill change in the middle of a sentence, or suddenly use single words from the other language.\u201d</p> <p>One of the Oslo rehearsal days ends early, so that the cast and production team can take a late-afternoon ferry around four nearby islands. This is not recreation but research: true to its title, the work had a water birth.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/aug/07/guardianobituaries.books\">Michael Meyer</a>, the influential English translator and biographer, explains in a preface to his version of The Lady from the Sea that when living in Italy Ibsen used to complain that the Mediterranean was not a \u201creal sea\u201d, pining for Norwegian harbours, lakes and fjords. In 1885, two decades into his exile, he came home for a brief holiday, seeking the sort of Norwegian water he remembered from a childhood in seaside Skien.</p> <p>The writer travelled to Molde, a town on Norway\u2019s north-west coast (whose football club has just lent its manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/21/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-manchester-united-job-caretaker-permanent\">Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r</a>, to Manchester United). Ibsen reportedly spent much of his time in Molde staring lovingly at fjords and out at the crashing Atlantic waves. Locals told him stories of a woman persuaded by a charismatic sailor to leave her husband, and of a husband, presumed drowned, who returned years later to find his wife remarried. From those anecdotes \u2013 and the surroundings \u2013 the playwright seems to have begun to conceive a drama about people confined and defined by the sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d031f746001c531b9e20739aa49679b30dbcdcf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d031f746001c531b9e20739aa49679b30dbcdcf3/0_0_5120_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pining \u2026 Ibsen was inspired by the fjords around Molde.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stirring sight \u2026 Ibsen was inspired by the fjords around Molde.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years later, during another seaside break in the Danish resort of S\u00e6by, on the Jutland coast, the 59-year-old Ibsen developed one of the crushes on much younger women that marked his later years. He formed an intense friendship with Engelke Wulff, a 19-year-old, whose dreams of escaping the small town for large achievements elsewhere seem clearly to have helped him develop Hilde and Bolette Wangel, the yearning teenage sisters in The Lady from the Sea.</p> <p>Another source was Agnete og Havmanden, an 18th-century Danish folk-ballad about a wife who is seduced by a merman, with whom she has a sub-aquatic family, and forced to choose between her wet and dry lives.</p> <p>I had hoped that one of the Norwegian members of the company might sing me Agnete\u2019s song on the ferry, but none knew it. As we stand on the deck to watch the spectacular russet sunset, mummifying my face with a scarf to protect against the freezing sea fret, I remember that Tennessee Williams, whose plays were set in the American south, once told a London cast that his work made sense only if the cast and audience understood the effect on the characters of the searing daily heat. When an English actress asked Williams why the women were so \u201clanguid\u201d, he explained that, in that climate, it could sometimes be a struggle to breathe or move.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we were in the north now, this is as light as it would get all the day</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Contrastingly, it struck me on the ferry deck that the plays of Ibsen are clarified by an understanding of how dark and cold it is in Norway most of the time, and especially in the north of the country, where The Lady from the Sea takes place.</p> <p>Gesturing at the Oslo dusk, R\u00f8ger tells me: \u201cIf we were in the north now, this is as light as it would ever get during the day. You can see a little light from the sun but you can\u2019t see the sun.\u201d</p> <p>Back on land, we walk through Oslo, past the National Theatre. Above its door are carved in stone the names of the first three dramatists staged there during the gala opening week in 1899: <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1903/bjornson/biographical/\">Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ludvig-Holberg-Friherre-Holberg\">Ludvig Holberg</a> and Ibsen.

      "bodyText": "On Oslo\u2019s Victoria Terrasse there\u2019s a white door marked 108. Behind it was once an office in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but before that, late in the 19th century, these rooms were occupied by a figure who has done more for Norway\u2019s reputation abroad than all of its foreign ministers put together. This was the apartment of Henrik Ibsen, generally regarded as the second-greatest playwright ever, and the second most-performed dramatist in the world. In both these criteria he is bested only by Shakespeare. Ibsen\u2019s living quarters have now become a significant venue in his thriving theatrical afterlife. For a week in January, two of Norway\u2019s leading classical actors \u2013 K\u00e5re Conradi and Pia Tjelta \u2013 were rehearsing here with a cast of Norwegian and UK-based actors for a bilingual production of Ibsen\u2019s 1888 play The Lady from the Sea, which premieres this week in London. This cross-country staging is produced by the Norwegian Ibsen Company, founded by Conradi. The actor got government permission to rehearse The Lady from the Sea in the dramatist\u2019s old flat, and hopes in the future to stage productions in its rooms, and a courtyard below. The company also hopes to tour Ibsen around the world, much like the Royal Shakespeare Company, with this London run a declaration of intent. \u201cIbsen is Norwegian by birth but in spirit international,\u201d says Conradi, showing me around the rooms. What was once the Ibsens\u2019 kitchen is now a government broom cupboard. The dramatist lived above Victoria Terrasse from 1891-95, a period that represents much of his creative life in Norway. Ibsen had left his homeland in 1864, disgusted by its politics and cultural conservatism. He exiled himself for 27 years to Italy and Germany, during which his dim view of Norwegian taste seemed to be confirmed when Ghosts, which dared to use inherited venereal disease as a metaphor for the damage families inflict, was rubbished on publication. His plays appeared in book form first and were not performed in Oslo until years later. \u201cWhen he finally came home, it was to this flat,\u201d says Conradi. His reception from Norwegians, he adds, was \u201cso ecstatic that he wrote a poem that includes the line, \u2018Perhaps I should have come sooner.\u2019\u201d In Oslo, Conradi has the level of fame and admiration Ralph Fiennes might have in Britain. Conradi also gets stopped and selfied by tourists, since he starred in the Netflix Viking drama Norsemen, and played Jens Smit, a Dutch PR visionary, in W1A. At the the read-through in Ibsen\u2019s old living rooms, Conradi, Tjelta and another Norwegian actor, \u00d8ystein R\u00f8ger, sit alongside four British performers. The Norwegian director, Marit Moum Aune, has boldly cast young performers with minimal stage experience. Molly Windsor won a Bafta for Three Girls, about the Rotherham grooming scandal; Edward Ashley is soon to appear with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in The King; and Marina Bye has featured in movies including Breathe. Even the most theatre-experienced, Adrian Rawlins, has recently spent most of his time on screen, including playing Harry Potter\u2019s father, James. The Lady from the Sea dramatises the marriage between Dr Wangel, a widowed GP, and Ellida, reluctant stepmother to Hilde and Bolette, daughters from his first marriage. In this production the Wangels \u2013 played by Rawlins, Windsor and Bye \u2013 are expats from England, drawn to the north-west coast of Norway by the doctor\u2019s relationship with Ellida, the part taken by Tjelta. Ashley plays Lyngstrand, a local artist. Conradi is Arnholm, Bolette\u2019s former tutor, who visits the troubled family, with R\u00f8ger as the Stranger, a sailor and fugitive from justice, who may have been Ellida\u2019s lover. The play is about the carnage caused by partings. Ellida is haunted by a lost child, a lost lover and her stepdaughters\u2019 lost mother, and is forced to decide between two versions of her life. In this dual-language production, the Wangels mainly speak English to each other, while Ellida talks Norwegian to Arnholm. In London, the Norwegian will be subtitled on the rear wall. For realism, the anglophone members of the Wangel family have to be able to speak the native language to locals, and to Ellida. Because the Stranger appears only late in the play, R\u00f8ger has been using rehearsal breaks to tutor the visitors. \u201cThey record me, and then go away to practise,\u201d he says. \u201cI show them how you form your mouth to get the Norwegian sounds, which are different.\u201d The letter O, which has four differently accented versions in Norwegian, is generally longer and rounder than the English equivalent. In return, because the Stranger is said have spent a lot of time sailing transatlantic routes, Bye, who has an American mother, has been teaching R\u00f8ger US vowels. Rawlins and Tjelta have also worked on the way in which bilingual partners switch languages. \u201cMixed-nationality couples,\u201d says Tjelta, \u201cwill change in the middle of a sentence, or suddenly use single words from the other language.\u201d One of the Oslo rehearsal days ends early, so that the cast and production team can take a late-afternoon ferry around four nearby islands. This is not recreation but research: true to its title, the work had a water birth. Michael Meyer, the influential English translator and biographer, explains in a preface to his version of The Lady from the Sea that when living in Italy Ibsen used to complain that the Mediterranean was not a \u201creal sea\u201d, pining for Norwegian harbours, lakes and fjords. In 1885, two decades into his exile, he came home for a brief holiday, seeking the sort of Norwegian water he remembered from a childhood in seaside Skien. The writer travelled to Molde, a town on Norway\u2019s north-west coast (whose football club has just lent its manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, to Manchester United). Ibsen reportedly spent much of his time in Molde staring lovingly at fjords and out at the crashing Atlantic waves. Locals told him stories of a woman persuaded by a charismatic sailor to leave her husband, and of a husband, presumed drowned, who returned years later to find his wife remarried. From those anecdotes \u2013 and the surroundings \u2013 the playwright seems to have begun to conceive a drama about people confined and defined by the sea. Two years later, during another seaside break in the Danish resort of S\u00e6by, on the Jutland coast, the 59-year-old Ibsen developed one of the crushes on much younger women that marked his later years. He formed an intense friendship with Engelke Wulff, a 19-year-old, whose dreams of escaping the small town for large achievements elsewhere seem clearly to have helped him develop Hilde and Bolette Wangel, the yearning teenage sisters in The Lady from the Sea. Another source was Agnete og Havmanden, an 18th-century Danish folk-ballad about a wife who is seduced by a merman, with whom she has a sub-aquatic family, and forced to choose between her wet and dry lives. I had hoped that one of the Norwegian members of the company might sing me Agnete\u2019s song on the ferry, but none knew it. As we stand on the deck to watch the spectacular russet sunset, mummifying my face with a scarf to protect against the freezing sea fret, I remember that Tennessee Williams, whose plays were set in the American south, once told a London cast that his work made sense only if the cast and audience understood the effect on the characters of the searing daily heat. When an English actress asked Williams why the women were so \u201clanguid\u201d, he explained that, in that climate, it could sometimes be a struggle to breathe or move. Contrastingly, it struck me on the ferry deck that the plays of Ibsen are clarified by an understanding of how dark and cold it is in Norway most of the time, and especially in the north of the country, where The Lady from the Sea takes place. Gesturing at the Oslo dusk, R\u00f8ger tells me: \u201cIf we were in the north now, this is as light as it would ever get during the day. You can see a little light from the sun but you can\u2019t see the sun.\u201d Back on land, we walk through Oslo, past the National Theatre. Above its door are carved in stone the names of the first three dramatists staged there during the gala opening week in 1899: Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson, Ludvig Holberg and Ibsen. Although they were seen at the time as a theatrical holy trinity, two of them are rarely performed in Norway now, while the play that represented Ibsen at the premiere \u2013 An Enemy of the People \u2013 seems, in its depiction of an expert clashing with populist opinion, to become ever more politically topical. And revived in this London production 130 years after its opening night in Denmark, The Lady from the Sea still feels timely in its presentation of women\u2019s choices. \u201cSomeone once asked me, \u2018So you\u2019re an Ibsen expert?\u2019\u201d says Aune, who has directed most of the major plays, and is about to revive her ballet of Ibsen\u2019s Hedda Gabler in Oslo. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m Ibsen-experienced.\u2019 I don\u2019t think you can ever become an expert on him.

      "body": "<p>In May 1994, a then-unknown actor called Jennifer Aniston ran into a studio set made up to look like a Manhattan coffee house, and flopped on to a sofa. She wore a white wedding dress, her hair was wet from the rain, and she had just run out on her wedding. Around her, a group of relatively unknown actors \u2013 Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox \u2013 gawped. And so began the first episode of a sitcom about six friends, written by New York City playwrights David Crane and Marta Kauffman.</p> \n<p>Twenty-five years on, Friends is still one of the most successful television shows of all time. After it arrived on Netflix on New Year\u2019s Day 2018, it became the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45095819\" title=\"\">most-streamed show</a> on the internet. And, despite the fact that the final episode was broadcast in May 2004, long before the vast majority of them were born, it is the favourite TV programme of the UK\u2019s five- to 16-year-olds.</p> \n<p>The show\u2019s stars are now exceedingly famous and obscenely rich. By the final series, they were each being paid $1m an episode, making Aniston, Cox and Kudrow the highest-paid female TV actors of all time.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/06/spoiler-alert-ross-and-rachel-date-teens-on-why-they-love-friends\">'Spoiler alert: Ross and Rachel date!' \u2013 teens on why they love Friends</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But before Friends became a cultural phenomenon, before the \u201cWhich friend are you?\u201d quizzes, the layered haircuts and the cries of: \u201cWe were on a break!\u201d \u2013 and before the show became a trusted companion on hungover days spent in bed \u2013 Friends was just another television pilot being tested for NBC executives in the hope of being picked up.</p> \n<p><em>May 4, 1994: the Friends pilot is filmed on the Warner Bros lot in Burbank, California.

Ross has just separated from his wife, Carol, who has gone off with another woman. And Rachel has just stood up her fiance, Barry, at the altar and is in need of a place to stay.

But when you look at the pilot, with Rachel dumping me at the altar and coming in to meet everybody, that moment was the impetus for the show.</p> \n<p><strong>Christina Pickles (Judy Geller, Ross\u2019s and Monica\u2019s mother):</strong> I knew Jennifer Aniston would be a huge success from the moment I saw her in rehearsals. But I didn\u2019t know that the show would be. I\u2019ve done so many pilots I thought were good that didn\u2019t work, and so many that I thought were bad that did work. I just knew I was witnessing a really special actor at work.</p> \n<p><strong>Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber):</strong> Back in the day, there used to be something called pilot season. Everyone wanted to test their pilots to see how audiences reacted to them. Actors would fly in from Chicago or New York and live in LA for the three months of pilot season, and audition every day, just hoping to get into one of those shows that would get picked up and made into a series. I got the script for Friends in the middle of the season. The second I read it, I called my agent and said: \u201cWe have to make this happen.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2239d61a186d3f25353102175a81f060bb61261f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2239d61a186d3f25353102175a81f060bb61261f/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vincent Ventresca as Fun Bobby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vincent Ventresca as Fun Bobby.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby, Monica\u2019s on-off boyfriend in seasons one and two):</strong> I was so young and full of myself, and I\u2019d just done a pilot for Fox\u2019s new medical show. I thought I was the coolest person in the world. I was at home, and my agent said: \u201cHey, do you want to go and audition for this new show?\u201d It was a really small part, so, of course, I\u2019m whining like a little actor. But something inside me told me, just do it. So I went in and cried in front of Marta Kauffman, and she was like: \u201cGreat!\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Directing the pilot is </em><em>James </em><em>Burrows, co-creator of </em><em>Cheers.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Elliott Gould (Jack Geller, Ross and Monica\u2019s father):</strong> I wanted to work for Jim. I\u2019d heard a lot about him: that he knew what he was doing, and he was smart. And he understood what was funny. At one point, I actually called casting because there were some people who said: \u201cNo, no, no. Friends is not enough money for you.\u201d But I wanted to work and meet new people.</p> \n<p><strong>Christina Pickles (Judy Geller):</strong> Burrows was instrumental in creating the atmosphere of Friends. He took the six leads to Vegas before they started working, and they all had a good time together. That was probably very helpful in cementing a sweetness about them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"236b493360e265a21307684333c6334a47bc2643\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/236b493360e265a21307684333c6334a47bc2643/0_104_2946_1768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elliott Gould as Jack Geller.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elliott Gould as Jack Geller.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>Casting for Friends takes months, and executive producers Kauffman and </em><em>Crane, and fellow producer Kevin S Bright, see hundreds of hopefuls</em><em>.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber):</strong> I was brought in to audition for Ross and Chandler.

When he was a kid, he used to come into the Formosa bar on Santa Monica, which was a famous Hollywood hangout. I was a patron, and we\u2019d chat.

Every time he did something, he would look for approval to the director, the producers or the writers if they were around. There would be a look of: \u201cAm I doing this right?\u201d He ended up being amazing. He was so perfect as Joey. He slowly built that character into a wonderful, real person.</p> \n<p><strong>Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger):</strong> Those kids were just ready to pop; they were all good enough to have their own shows.

By the end of the 1994-1995 </em><em>season, Friends is the eighth most-watched show on air.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles):</strong> I went home, and the show didn\u2019t air for months, so I forgot about it. And then it came out, and it was a hit.</p> \n<p><strong>Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger):</strong> They weren\u2019t stars when it all started. They were becoming very popular, and probably working on their contracts, but it wasn\u2019t like you were walking into a room full of superstars. That came a bit later.</p> \n<p><strong>Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby):</strong> I taped the first season, and there was a comic warming up the studio audience, and the energy was good. By the time we filmed the second year, it was like a circus. I remember metal detectors. The studio was packed with people. That was around the time that the Rolling Stone cover came out with all six of them \u2013 May 1995.</p> \n<p><strong>Cosimo Fusco (Paolo):</strong> In season two, there was a change in everything. You\u2019d notice it in the cars they would drive, or they\u2019d talk about buying this or that. There was wealth coming in.</p> \n<p><strong>Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick):</strong> Because I was part of the early days, they weren\u2019t so private around me. But other guest stars would complain about how they didn\u2019t have access to this or that area. They had to clamp down on security and be much tighter about who went up into the dressing rooms, and that kind of thing.</p> \n<p><strong>Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles):</strong> The third or fourth time I came on set, they were No 1. [Episode 11 of the second season of Friends, The One With the Lesbian Wedding aired on 11 January 1996, and was the top-rated episode on US television with 31.6 million viewers.] Matt LeBlanc had just bought a house, and they were ecstatic. I\u2019m not a big social person, and it was hard to crack that group. They talked to each other. Every time the camera took a break or something, the actors and producers would huddle. I\u2019d become an outsider. There was a feeling of seeing these actors go from nowhere to being on top of the world over a period of three or four years.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e365302a0a562338cf5b97a63100a9aa6f8a83e3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e365302a0a562338cf5b97a63100a9aa6f8a83e3/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Sibbett (left) in The One With the Lesbian Wedding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Sibbett (right) in The One With the Lesbian Wedding.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Cosimo Fusco (Paolo):</strong> You know, someone\u2019s life changes when they get a big paycheck. The money starts rolling in, and you\u2019re obliged to spend it. They would be recognised and followed, and there would be paparazzi. It wasn\u2019t easy for them to just have a coffee at the corner any more. But as people? They didn\u2019t change. Not with me.</p> \n<p><strong>Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby):</strong> The first season, they had a show that was doing pretty well on the air, and it looked like they were going to do more, but they weren\u2019t the Beatles. And then they came back the second year, and they <em>were</em> the Beatles.</p> \n<p><em>By season three, the cast have made the </em><em>decision to negotiate their contracts as a group, even though this means some members will take a pay cut. They continue negotiating as a group for the show\u2019s entire run.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger):</strong> As a group, they decided it was time to get more of a share of the profits. It was quite a risk. They were putting it all on the line.</p> \n<p><strong>Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green, Rachel\u2019s mother)</strong>: It\u2019s unusual to do contracts together, and I think they set a standard for a lot of other shows to follow. When the network is negotiating against you, one at a time, things can become adversarial. But they all realised, to their benefit, that it took every single one of them to make the show that good.</p> \n<p><strong>Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick):</strong> I was on the lot this one time. I\u2019d just had lunch. And I came around the corner, and I see Jen, Lisa and Courteney. It had just rained, which is a rarity in LA, right? And they\u2019re splashing in this puddle outside the sound stage. I was so struck by it because there was no one else around, and they were just falling around laughing with one another. That was the lightning in the bottle because they captured that joy of being friends, and that playfulness, and it was magic. The love this group had for one other was extraordinary.</p> \n<p><strong>Christina Pickles (</strong><strong>Judy Geller):</strong> They were a united group. They would watch each other\u2019s work. If someone had a scene they weren\u2019t in, the others would watch it and laugh. It\u2019s very unusual to be so supportive of each other on set.</p> \n<p><strong>Paget Brewster (Kathy, Joey and then Chandler\u2019s girlfriend in season four):</strong> They would make fun of each other. If someone made a joke and it didn\u2019t work, they\u2019d all turn on the person and be like: \u201cYou blew it, Lisa!\u201d They would bust each other\u2019s balls. And they started adding this thing into the script that they did to each other in real life: one of them would be talking, and they\u2019d all pretend to fall asleep.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"beb16ec32c378a95eed7b976af08a7e514feb0bd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/beb16ec32c378a95eed7b976af08a7e514feb0bd/0_343_2082_1249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paget Brewster as Kathy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paget Brewster as Kathy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby):</strong> You\u2019d do a pass of a scene. If the audience didn\u2019t laugh, we\u2019d huddle together and Matthew Perry would say: \u201cWhat if we tried this?\u201d And Matt LeBlanc would say: \u201cYeah!\u201d And we\u2019d break again and do the scene. It was like being at a football game.</p> \n<p><strong>Paget Brewster (Kathy):</strong> Matthew Perry always had to have the last bit. If it was the end of the scene, he would consistently pitch something. They\u2019d make fun of him for literally always wanting to have the last laugh.</p> \n<p><strong>Christina Pickles (</strong><strong>Judy Geller):</strong> Everything begins and ends with the writing. David and Marta didn\u2019t write every show \u2013 they hired a lot of good writers \u2013 but they had the final say, and they had impeccable taste.</p> \n<p><strong>Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens, Ross\u2019s girlfriend in season six. She was one of his students, and Bruce Willis played her father):</strong> We\u2019re in the cabin in one episode, and Ross and I are making out on the couch. He says: \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about your dad.\u201d The writers stopped and said: \u201cAfter he says that, why don\u2019t you say: \u2018Whatever works for you?\u2019\u201d We added the joke in at the last minute, and it was so funny. They could just come up with stuff like that on the spot.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95cbe8e2155731f11d91103d834e7d6b29c3aaa1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95cbe8e2155731f11d91103d834e7d6b29c3aaa1/0_97_1785_1071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandra Holden as Elizabeth Stevens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandra Holden as Elizabeth Stevens.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Christina Pickles (</strong><strong>Judy Geller):</strong> David and Marta would come down from the office to watch the run-throughs, which was terrifying. They\u2019d sit in a row of chairs, with the writers and NBC executives. And you could see they were thinking, and they\u2019d give comments and then go back upstairs and change it all. David and Marta were the giant stars of the writing team.</p> \n<p><strong>Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick):</strong> There was one joke we kept changing. We couldn\u2019t get it right. It was the episode where Susan and I are celebrating our anniversary, and Ross comes over at an inopportune moment, and I had to telegraph to him that it isn\u2019t a good time. So I removed a little pube from my tongue. That was the only time I pitched something that was really outrageous, and it actually got on air.</p> \n<p><em>With Friends\u2019 increased </em><em>popularity comes intense media scrutiny</em><em>. But on set it\u2019s business as usual.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler, Joey and then Ross\u2019s girlfriend):</strong> I remember walking into Monica\u2019s apartment, and looking out of the window to see if I could see Ugly Naked Guy, but of course it\u2019s just a hallway back there.</p> \n<p><strong>Paget Brewster (Kathy):</strong> I was terrified of those guys. I hid in my room because they were so famous. It was the biggest show in the country.</p> \n<p><strong>Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler):</strong> It was a very intimidating set to walk into. I think the cast had had some pretty notable experiences with guest actors coming in and struggling because of the pressure of having to be funny on the Friends set.</p> \n<p><strong>Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green):</strong> It\u2019s not always easy to walk into a show that has already been established and where everyone has their characters, and they\u2019re a tight-knit family. Sometimes, it\u2019s not roomy enough for a new person to come in. But they made it very roomy.</p> \n<p><strong>Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens):</strong> I got called in to do a \u201cchemistry read\u201d with David Schwimmer. It was terrifying because the producers told me to come in looking \u201cas hot as possible\u201d. I didn\u2019t know what to do with that information. It sent me into a tailspin. I stayed up all night trying to figure out what to wear \u2026 Now that I\u2019m older, I wouldn\u2019t be happy getting that message.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>My 12-year-old niece asked me for a T-shirt with \u201cCentral Perk\u201d on it.

I was doing something else back in the US, and there was a cliffhanger. And I very foolishly gave the cliffhanger away. Some of the producers were really angry at me.</p> \n<p><strong>Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick):</strong> It was important to us, and the producers, that we showed a couple that was in love. But certain affiliates wouldn\u2019t air the episode with our [Carol and Susan\u2019s] wedding. They completely blocked it out.</p> \n<p><em>By the time Friends wraps its final season in 2004, the lead actors have become some of the highest-paid TV stars of all time, earning $1m an episode.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber):</strong> My wife, she cringes a little bit because if I had ended up getting the part of Ross, I\u2019d have made tens of millions of dollars. But I never think about that.</p> \n<p><strong>Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby):</strong> Every time I get a cheque [for residuals, from reruns of the show] I think to myself: \u201cWow, they [the main cast members] must be really rich.\u201d I get about $2,000 a year in residuals, and I only did two episodes.</p> \n<p><strong>Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick):</strong> I\u2019m quite content. Obviously, I didn\u2019t get paid the million-dollar paycheck, but I\u2019ve had the best of Friends. I was able to raise my children and I got offered some really sweet projects.</p> \n<p><strong>Cosimo Fusco (Paolo):</strong> I have a little bit of regret; I feel like I could have capitalised more on the success of the show. I was having a divorce, and was distracted by my personal life. I didn\u2019t get a publicist, which I should have done.</p> \n<p><strong>Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger):</strong> People have a tendency to pigeonhole you a little bit, but it\u2019s always good to have something that people can recognise you from.</p> \n<p><strong>Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby):</strong> I got offers right away \u2026 It did kind of throw me, ego-wise. I started thinking I was really cool, and nothing was good enough for me. I always admired how gracefully they [the main cast members] handled it. Because I only had a little taste of it and I could barely handle it. Friends did help my career. But I don\u2019t think I let it help my career as much as it could have done.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d523129bb85dda62b5d06a6260e4886b27fb8c94\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d523129bb85dda62b5d06a6260e4886b27fb8c94/0_77_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Schwimmer as Ross with Aisha Tyler as Charlie Wheeler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Schwimmer as Ross with Aisha Tyler as Charlie Wheeler.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>In the two and a half decades since Friends first aired, the show has been continually rerun. In recent years, critics have re-evaluated the show\u2019s legacy, identifying problematic storylines and criticising Friends for its lack of diversity.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Aisha Tyer (Dr Charlie Wheeler):</strong> People of colour were always aware of it [the lack of diversity]. Even at the time, people were constantly pointing out that Friends wasn\u2019t as diverse as the Manhattan of the real world.</p> \n<p><strong>Cosimo Fusco (Paolo):</strong> Today, one of the six would have to be black, of course.</p> \n<p><strong>Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler):</strong> My character wasn\u2019t written on the page to be a woman of colour, and I auditioned against a lot of other women of different ethnic backgrounds, so I like to think they picked me because I was the right person for the role. But I knew it was something new for the show, and it was really important because, the fact of the matter was, it was a show set in Manhattan that was almost entirely Caucasian. It was an unrealistic representation of what the real world looked like.</p> \n<p><strong>Cosimo Fusco (Paolo):</strong> There was one scene where I was getting a massage, and I had to be this greasy guy who was touching Phoebe\u2019s ass. I had a problem with how it portrayed me, as if guys from Italy are like that. What they wanted me to do was quite disrespectful. But I remember we were able to find a compromise, so I felt comfortable.</p> \n<p><strong>Paget Brewster (Kathy):</strong> It\u2019s so bizarre to compare the show at that time to what\u2019s happening now on social media. No one can do anything right, ever. That\u2019s basically where we are. Everything is people being questioned or attacked. Yeah, if you look at the world today, and you look at Friends, you go: \u201cOh, wow, there were gay jokes and they don\u2019t have friends of colour.\u201d But that\u2019s what it was then.</p> \n<p><em>In 2018, Netflix acquired the rights to Friends in a </em><em>$100m deal</em><em>. Thanks to </em><em>streaming, the show has become known to a new, younger audience.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby):</strong> As an actor, you want to be a part of something: your work will be here when you\u2019re gone. And you get an insight into that when a show that is 25 years old gets reissued on Netflix, and a whole new audience discovers it.</p> \n<p><strong>Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens):</strong> My 12-year-old niece just asked me for a T-shirt with \u201cCentral Perk\u201d on it. That\u2019s so bizarre to me. She wasn\u2019t even alive when I worked on the show.</p> \n<p><strong>Christina Pickles (</strong><strong>Judy Geller):</strong> Kids come up to me and recite the script.</p> \n<p><strong>Paget Brewster (Kathy):</strong> People in their 20s recognise my voice. They turn around in supermarkets and say: \u201cYou\u2019re Kathy!\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber):</strong> \u201cDude, what was it like? You got to kiss Jennifer Aniston!\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Elliott Gould (Jack Geller):</strong> I met Taylor Swift, and she said: \u201cI know you! I\u2019m a Friends freak! You\u2019re Mr Geller.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Cosimo Fusco (Paolo):</strong> I can work in the most exquisite film, but the minute people find out I was Paolo, they\u2019re like: \u201cOh my God!\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Now, 25 years since the show first aired, Friends is the most-streamed show in the UK, and perhaps even the most beloved TV show of all time.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Paget Brewster (Kathy):</strong> A show like Friends was one in a million. Normally a pilot doesn\u2019t go, or it goes and you shoot three episodes, or you make a year and it\u2019s gone.</p> \n<p><strong>Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler):</strong> There have been other shows that have advanced that concept of friends as chosen family, but Friends was just a perfect encapsulation of that idea.</p> \n<p><strong>Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green):</strong> They\u2019re independent, their parents aren\u2019t telling them what to do, they\u2019re making their own decisions, they\u2019re making their own mistakes \u2013 and they\u2019re succeeding at it! That\u2019s aspirational for young people to see.</p> \n<p><strong>Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens):</strong> Television was a very different thing back then. I don\u2019t know if there will ever be another show as successful as Friends. I feel like there\u2019s too much content out there now, and too much variety.</p> \n<p><strong>Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby):</strong> I was so young. I was 27. I don\u2019t remember feeling young then, but now it\u2019s like looking back in time. But I love looking back at it. It\u2019s a good memory, and it\u2019s a reminder that time is passing. Not a lot of people get to look at where they were half their lifetime ago.</p> \n<p><strong>Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens):</strong> It feels like a different life. When I watch Friends now, I think: \u201cWas I really there? Did that really happen? Was I really part of this thing that\u2019s become such a huge influence all these years later?\u201d It\u2019s kind of surreal.</p> \n<p><strong>Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green):</strong> Everything you do is part of the tapestry of your career, and your life. Every little thread gets pulled in some way. And the Sandra Green thread is certainly a colour in my tapestry that people remember and have some affection for, as do I.</p> \n<p><strong>Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby):</strong> When someone comes up to you and says: \u201cHey, you were good on Friends,\u201d it connects you with them in a way. You were part of a thing that meant something to them, and that means something to me. It makes you feel like: \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t really waste your life.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Elliott Gould (Jack Geller):</strong> I saw Matt LeBlanc at the studio recently, and we embraced. Without being pretentious, we\u2019re all a part of each other.</p> \n<p><strong>Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby):</strong> Things don\u2019t change as much as you think they do. What\u2019s important to us: friendship, family, community and laughing at silly situations. That\u2019s what Friends is all about. And that\u2019s timeless.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In May 1994, a then-unknown actor called Jennifer Aniston ran into a studio set made up to look like a Manhattan coffee house, and flopped on to a sofa. She wore a white wedding dress, her hair was wet from the rain, and she had just run out on her wedding. Around her, a group of relatively unknown actors \u2013 Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox \u2013 gawped. And so began the first episode of a sitcom about six friends, written by New York City playwrights David Crane and Marta Kauffman. Twenty-five years on, Friends is still one of the most successful television shows of all time. After it arrived on Netflix on New Year\u2019s Day 2018, it became the most-streamed show on the internet. And, despite the fact that the final episode was broadcast in May 2004, long before the vast majority of them were born, it is the favourite TV programme of the UK\u2019s five- to 16-year-olds. The show\u2019s stars are now exceedingly famous and obscenely rich. By the final series, they were each being paid $1m an episode, making Aniston, Cox and Kudrow the highest-paid female TV actors of all time. But before Friends became a cultural phenomenon, before the \u201cWhich friend are you?\u201d quizzes, the layered haircuts and the cries of: \u201cWe were on a break!\u201d \u2013 and before the show became a trusted companion on hungover days spent in bed \u2013 Friends was just another television pilot being tested for NBC executives in the hope of being picked up. May 4, 1994: the Friends pilot is filmed on the Warner Bros lot in Burbank, California. In it, five friends \u2013 Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Joey Tribbiani and Monica\u2019s brother, Ross \u2013 are hanging out at their favourite coffee house when Rachel Green runs in. Ross has just separated from his wife, Carol, who has gone off with another woman. And Rachel has just stood up her fiance, Barry, at the altar and is in need of a place to stay. By the end of the episode, Rachel has moved in with Monica and started working at the coffee house. Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber, Rachel\u2019s orthodontist ex-fiance): It sounds a little egomaniacal to say that I\u2019m the reason the show exists. But when you look at the pilot, with Rachel dumping me at the altar and coming in to meet everybody, that moment was the impetus for the show. Christina Pickles (Judy Geller, Ross\u2019s and Monica\u2019s mother): I knew Jennifer Aniston would be a huge success from the moment I saw her in rehearsals. But I didn\u2019t know that the show would be. I\u2019ve done so many pilots I thought were good that didn\u2019t work, and so many that I thought were bad that did work. I just knew I was witnessing a really special actor at work. Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): Back in the day, there used to be something called pilot season. Everyone wanted to test their pilots to see how audiences reacted to them. Actors would fly in from Chicago or New York and live in LA for the three months of pilot season, and audition every day, just hoping to get into one of those shows that would get picked up and made into a series. I got the script for Friends in the middle of the season. The second I read it, I called my agent and said: \u201cWe have to make this happen.\u201d Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby, Monica\u2019s on-off boyfriend in seasons one and two): I was so young and full of myself, and I\u2019d just done a pilot for Fox\u2019s new medical show. I thought I was the coolest person in the world. I was at home, and my agent said: \u201cHey, do you want to go and audition for this new show?\u201d It was a really small part, so, of course, I\u2019m whining like a little actor. But something inside me told me, just do it. So I went in and cried in front of Marta Kauffman, and she was like: \u201cGreat!\u201d Directing the pilot is James Burrows, co-creator of Cheers. Elliott Gould (Jack Geller, Ross and Monica\u2019s father): I wanted to work for Jim. I\u2019d heard a lot about him: that he knew what he was doing, and he was smart. And he understood what was funny. At one point, I actually called casting because there were some people who said: \u201cNo, no, no. Friends is not enough money for you.\u201d But I wanted to work and meet new people. Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Burrows was instrumental in creating the atmosphere of Friends. He took the six leads to Vegas before they started working, and they all had a good time together. That was probably very helpful in cementing a sweetness about them. Casting for Friends takes months, and executive producers Kauffman and Crane, and fellow producer Kevin S Bright, see hundreds of hopefuls. Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): I was brought in to audition for Ross and Chandler. I went back multiple times, and then they realised Ross was the role for me. I got down to the very end, and was testing for the show. At the last minute, they said: \u201cWe\u2019re bringing in one more guy to read.\u201d That guy turned out to be David Schwimmer. Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick, Ross\u2019s ex-wife and mother of his son, Ben. She replaced the original actor, Anita Barone, who left the show after the first episode because the part wasn\u2019t big enough): I got a phone call from my agent, saying they wanted to offer me one of the lead roles. I said to my agent: \u201cThat\u2019s great, but you told them I was pregnant, right?\u201d My agent said: \u201cGod, no! We\u2019re not going to tell them that.\u201d I insisted. Because I knew this show was going to go [and get picked up by the network], for sure. Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger, the building superintendent): I knew Matt Perry socially a bit, years before. When he was a kid, he used to come into the Formosa bar on Santa Monica, which was a famous Hollywood hangout. I was a patron, and we\u2019d chat. He was a really precocious kid \u2013 but very interesting. He\u2019d done lots of pilots already, and was on the cusp of becoming a star. Cosimo Fusco (Paolo, Rachel\u2019s Italian boyfriend in season one): They were all very normal. All of them had a great human side. They were very humble \u2013 and really trained. They\u2019d spent years trying to get the right jobs. Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): At the beginning of Friends, Matt LeBlanc was anxious. Every time he did something, he would look for approval to the director, the producers or the writers if they were around. There would be a look of: \u201cAm I doing this right?\u201d He ended up being amazing. He was so perfect as Joey. He slowly built that character into a wonderful, real person. Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): Those kids were just ready to pop; they were all good enough to have their own shows. And the casting people somehow put them together at the time, and they were all just ready to have something wonderful happen \u2013 and it did. After the pilot is taped, NBC orders a further 12 episodes. Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): When I taped my first episode, no one had seen it on TV yet. While we were filming, they announced the show had been commissioned for 12 episodes. Jennifer Aniston basically cried in my lap because nothing like that had ever happened to her before. Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles, Monica and Rachel\u2019s irritable downstairs neighbour): I was there before it all started. I got there early and was watching rehearsals, and the show hadn\u2019t been on the air yet, but I remember thinking: \u201cThese young actors are really talented.\u201d Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): There was this excitement. There was no ego on set. People had a sense of how good the project was. Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): My son was born on 10 September 1994. The next day, my agent called and said: \u201cFriends has come back around again; they\u2019ve let go of Anita Barone and would like you to take over the part tomorrow.\u201d I said: \u201cWow, I\u2019m kind of sore! I don\u2019t think so.\u201d But my agent said: \u201cJane, this is a huge offer. They\u2019ve said they\u2019ll go easy on you, and you can bring your nanny.\u201d I said: \u201cI don\u2019t have a nanny! I\u2019ve got my mom.\u201d \u201cSo bring your mom!\u201d So I sat down and nursed my son, and watched the pilot episode. And the moment I saw David Schwimmer do the longest take ever, I was hooked. I knew I had to work with him. Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I was starstruck by David Schwimmer. Of course, the girls were incredible and you sort of fell in love with them. But David was the one I desperately wanted to like me; and he was the one most not interested in meeting anyone. Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): Towards the end of the first season, I started getting people saying: \u201cOh, you\u2019re that jerk on Friends.\u201d That\u2019s when I thought: \u201cThis thing is definitely starting to take off.\u201d Friends airs on 22 September 1994. The initial critical response is lukewarm, but viewers like the show, and ratings are solid. By the end of the 1994-1995 season, Friends is the eighth most-watched show on air. Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles): I went home, and the show didn\u2019t air for months, so I forgot about it. And then it came out, and it was a hit. Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): They weren\u2019t stars when it all started. They were becoming very popular, and probably working on their contracts, but it wasn\u2019t like you were walking into a room full of superstars. That came a bit later. Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I taped the first season, and there was a comic warming up the studio audience, and the energy was good. By the time we filmed the second year, it was like a circus. I remember metal detectors. The studio was packed with people. That was around the time that the Rolling Stone cover came out with all six of them \u2013 May 1995. Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): In season two, there was a change in everything. You\u2019d notice it in the cars they would drive, or they\u2019d talk about buying this or that. There was wealth coming in. Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): Because I was part of the early days, they weren\u2019t so private around me. But other guest stars would complain about how they didn\u2019t have access to this or that area. They had to clamp down on security and be much tighter about who went up into the dressing rooms, and that kind of thing. Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles): The third or fourth time I came on set, they were No 1. [Episode 11 of the second season of Friends, The One With the Lesbian Wedding aired on 11 January 1996, and was the top-rated episode on US television with 31.6 million viewers.] Matt LeBlanc had just bought a house, and they were ecstatic. I\u2019m not a big social person, and it was hard to crack that group. They talked to each other. Every time the camera took a break or something, the actors and producers would huddle. I\u2019d become an outsider. There was a feeling of seeing these actors go from nowhere to being on top of the world over a period of three or four years. Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): You know, someone\u2019s life changes when they get a big paycheck. The money starts rolling in, and you\u2019re obliged to spend it. They would be recognised and followed, and there would be paparazzi. It wasn\u2019t easy for them to just have a coffee at the corner any more. But as people? They didn\u2019t change. Not with me. Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): The first season, they had a show that was doing pretty well on the air, and it looked like they were going to do more, but they weren\u2019t the Beatles. And then they came back the second year, and they were the Beatles. By season three, the cast have made the decision to negotiate their contracts as a group, even though this means some members will take a pay cut. They continue negotiating as a group for the show\u2019s entire run. Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): As a group, they decided it was time to get more of a share of the profits. It was quite a risk. They were putting it all on the line. Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green, Rachel\u2019s mother): It\u2019s unusual to do contracts together, and I think they set a standard for a lot of other shows to follow. When the network is negotiating against you, one at a time, things can become adversarial. But they all realised, to their benefit, that it took every single one of them to make the show that good. Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): I was on the lot this one time. I\u2019d just had lunch. And I came around the corner, and I see Jen, Lisa and Courteney. It had just rained, which is a rarity in LA, right? And they\u2019re splashing in this puddle outside the sound stage. I was so struck by it because there was no one else around, and they were just falling around laughing with one another. That was the lightning in the bottle because they captured that joy of being friends, and that playfulness, and it was magic. The love this group had for one other was extraordinary. Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): They were a united group. They would watch each other\u2019s work. If someone had a scene they weren\u2019t in, the others would watch it and laugh. It\u2019s very unusual to be so supportive of each other on set. Paget Brewster (Kathy, Joey and then Chandler\u2019s girlfriend in season four): They would make fun of each other. If someone made a joke and it didn\u2019t work, they\u2019d all turn on the person and be like: \u201cYou blew it, Lisa!\u201d They would bust each other\u2019s balls. And they started adding this thing into the script that they did to each other in real life: one of them would be talking, and they\u2019d all pretend to fall asleep. Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): You\u2019d do a pass of a scene. If the audience didn\u2019t laugh, we\u2019d huddle together and Matthew Perry would say: \u201cWhat if we tried this?\u201d And Matt LeBlanc would say: \u201cYeah!\u201d And we\u2019d break again and do the scene. It was like being at a football game. Paget Brewster (Kathy): Matthew Perry always had to have the last bit. If it was the end of the scene, he would consistently pitch something. They\u2019d make fun of him for literally always wanting to have the last laugh. Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Everything begins and ends with the writing. David and Marta didn\u2019t write every show \u2013 they hired a lot of good writers \u2013 but they had the final say, and they had impeccable taste. Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens, Ross\u2019s girlfriend in season six. She was one of his students, and Bruce Willis played her father): We\u2019re in the cabin in one episode, and Ross and I are making out on the couch. He says: \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about your dad.\u201d The writers stopped and said: \u201cAfter he says that, why don\u2019t you say: \u2018Whatever works for you?\u2019\u201d We added the joke in at the last minute, and it was so funny. They could just come up with stuff like that on the spot. Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): David and Marta would come down from the office to watch the run-throughs, which was terrifying. They\u2019d sit in a row of chairs, with the writers and NBC executives. And you could see they were thinking, and they\u2019d give comments and then go back upstairs and change it all. David and Marta were the giant stars of the writing team. Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): There was one joke we kept changing. We couldn\u2019t get it right. It was the episode where Susan and I are celebrating our anniversary, and Ross comes over at an inopportune moment, and I had to telegraph to him that it isn\u2019t a good time. So I removed a little pube from my tongue. That was the only time I pitched something that was really outrageous, and it actually got on air. With Friends\u2019 increased popularity comes intense media scrutiny. But on set it\u2019s business as usual. Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler, Joey and then Ross\u2019s girlfriend): I remember walking into Monica\u2019s apartment, and looking out of the window to see if I could see Ugly Naked Guy, but of course it\u2019s just a hallway back there. Paget Brewster (Kathy): I was terrified of those guys. I hid in my room because they were so famous. It was the biggest show in the country. Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): It was a very intimidating set to walk into. I think the cast had had some pretty notable experiences with guest actors coming in and struggling because of the pressure of having to be funny on the Friends set. Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): It\u2019s not always easy to walk into a show that has already been established and where everyone has their characters, and they\u2019re a tight-knit family. Sometimes, it\u2019s not roomy enough for a new person to come in. But they made it very roomy. Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): I got called in to do a \u201cchemistry read\u201d with David Schwimmer. It was terrifying because the producers told me to come in looking \u201cas hot as possible\u201d. I didn\u2019t know what to do with that information. It sent me into a tailspin. I stayed up all night trying to figure out what to wear \u2026 Now that I\u2019m older, I wouldn\u2019t be happy getting that message. Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): We did the scenes for the episode in London, with the wedding [between Ross and Emily in season four]. I was doing something else back in the US, and there was a cliffhanger. And I very foolishly gave the cliffhanger away. Some of the producers were really angry at me. Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): It was important to us, and the producers, that we showed a couple that was in love. But certain affiliates wouldn\u2019t air the episode with our [Carol and Susan\u2019s] wedding. They completely blocked it out. By the time Friends wraps its final season in 2004, the lead actors have become some of the highest-paid TV stars of all time, earning $1m an episode. Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber): My wife, she cringes a little bit because if I had ended up getting the part of Ross, I\u2019d have made tens of millions of dollars. But I never think about that. Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): Every time I get a cheque [for residuals, from reruns of the show] I think to myself: \u201cWow, they [the main cast members] must be really rich.\u201d I get about $2,000 a year in residuals, and I only did two episodes. Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): I\u2019m quite content. Obviously, I didn\u2019t get paid the million-dollar paycheck, but I\u2019ve had the best of Friends. I was able to raise my children and I got offered some really sweet projects. Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): I have a little bit of regret; I feel like I could have capitalised more on the success of the show. I was having a divorce, and was distracted by my personal life. I didn\u2019t get a publicist, which I should have done. Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): People have a tendency to pigeonhole you a little bit, but it\u2019s always good to have something that people can recognise you from. Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I got offers right away \u2026 It did kind of throw me, ego-wise. I started thinking I was really cool, and nothing was good enough for me. I always admired how gracefully they [the main cast members] handled it. Because I only had a little taste of it and I could barely handle it. Friends did help my career. But I don\u2019t think I let it help my career as much as it could have done. In the two and a half decades since Friends first aired, the show has been continually rerun. In recent years, critics have re-evaluated the show\u2019s legacy, identifying problematic storylines and criticising Friends for its lack of diversity. Aisha Tyer (Dr Charlie Wheeler): People of colour were always aware of it [the lack of diversity]. Even at the time, people were constantly pointing out that Friends wasn\u2019t as diverse as the Manhattan of the real world. Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): Today, one of the six would have to be black, of course. Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): My character wasn\u2019t written on the page to be a woman of colour, and I auditioned against a lot of other women of different ethnic backgrounds, so I like to think they picked me because I was the right person for the role. But I knew it was something new for the show, and it was really important because, the fact of the matter was, it was a show set in Manhattan that was almost entirely Caucasian. It was an unrealistic representation of what the real world looked like. Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): There was one scene where I was getting a massage, and I had to be this greasy guy who was touching Phoebe\u2019s ass. I had a problem with how it portrayed me, as if guys from Italy are like that. What they wanted me to do was quite disrespectful. But I remember we were able to find a compromise, so I felt comfortable. Paget Brewster (Kathy): It\u2019s so bizarre to compare the show at that time to what\u2019s happening now on social media. No one can do anything right, ever. That\u2019s basically where we are. Everything is people being questioned or attacked. Yeah, if you look at the world today, and you look at Friends, you go: \u201cOh, wow, there were gay jokes and they don\u2019t have friends of colour.\u201d But that\u2019s what it was then. In 2018, Netflix acquired the rights to Friends in a $100m deal. Thanks to streaming, the show has become known to a new, younger audience. Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): As an actor, you want to be a part of something: your work will be here when you\u2019re gone. And you get an insight into that when a show that is 25 years old gets reissued on Netflix, and a whole new audience discovers it. Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): My 12-year-old niece just asked me for a T-shirt with \u201cCentral Perk\u201d on it. That\u2019s so bizarre to me. She wasn\u2019t even alive when I worked on the show. Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Kids come up to me and recite the script. Paget Brewster (Kathy): People in their 20s recognise my voice. They turn around in supermarkets and say: \u201cYou\u2019re Kathy!\u201d Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber): \u201cDude, what was it like? You got to kiss Jennifer Aniston!\u201d Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): I met Taylor Swift, and she said: \u201cI know you! I\u2019m a Friends freak! You\u2019re Mr Geller.\u201d Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): I can work in the most exquisite film, but the minute people find out I was Paolo, they\u2019re like: \u201cOh my God!\u201d Now, 25 years since the show first aired, Friends is the most-streamed show in the UK, and perhaps even the most beloved TV show of all time. Paget Brewster (Kathy): A show like Friends was one in a million. Normally a pilot doesn\u2019t go, or it goes and you shoot three episodes, or you make a year and it\u2019s gone. Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): There have been other shows that have advanced that concept of friends as chosen family, but Friends was just a perfect encapsulation of that idea. Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): They\u2019re independent, their parents aren\u2019t telling them what to do, they\u2019re making their own decisions, they\u2019re making their own mistakes \u2013 and they\u2019re succeeding at it! That\u2019s aspirational for young people to see. Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): Television was a very different thing back then. I don\u2019t know if there will ever be another show as successful as Friends. I feel like there\u2019s too much content out there now, and too much variety. Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I was so young. I was 27. I don\u2019t remember feeling young then, but now it\u2019s like looking back in time. But I love looking back at it. It\u2019s a good memory, and it\u2019s a reminder that time is passing. Not a lot of people get to look at where they were half their lifetime ago. Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): It feels like a different life. When I watch Friends now, I think: \u201cWas I really there? Did that really happen? Was I really part of this thing that\u2019s become such a huge influence all these years later?\u201d It\u2019s kind of surreal. Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): Everything you do is part of the tapestry of your career, and your life. Every little thread gets pulled in some way. And the Sandra Green thread is certainly a colour in my tapestry that people remember and have some affection for, as do I. Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): When someone comes up to you and says: \u201cHey, you were good on Friends,\u201d it connects you with them in a way. You were part of a thing that meant something to them, and that means something to me. It makes you feel like: \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t really waste your life.\u201d Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): I saw Matt LeBlanc at the studio recently, and we embraced. Without being pretentious, we\u2019re all a part of each other. Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): Things don\u2019t change as much as you think they do. What\u2019s important to us: friendship, family, community and laughing at silly situations. That\u2019s what Friends is all about. And that\u2019s timeless.",

      "body": "<p>For a bit of perspective on turbulent times it helps to remember Able Archer. In November 1983, Nato simulated a confrontation with the Soviet Union. The rehearsal was so plausible that the Russians doubted it was a drill, and began a counter-mobilisation. Luckily, level heads prevailed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/02/nato-war-game-nuclear-disaster\" title=\"\">Able Archer</a> was the name of the operation that nearly turned the cold war hot by accident.</p> <p>Europe might feel a bit unstable these days, but at least it is not a hair-trigger away from nuclear Armageddon. One reason is the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. That deal, signed by Washington and Moscow in 1987, banned missiles with a range of 310 to 3,420 miles. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/01/inf-donald-trump-confirms-us-withdrawal-nuclear-treaty\" title=\"\">Donald Trump withdrew</a> the United States from the INF, blaming Russian violations.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/02/russia-follows-us-in-suspending-nuclear-deal\" title=\"\"> Vladimir Putin reciprocated</a> over the weekend, promising to accelerate development of prohibited weapons. Unless Moscow and Washington unexpectedly rediscover the spirit of detente, the INF treaty is finished. A global monument to the triumph of diplomatic rationality over militaristic paranoia is being pulled down.</p> <p>The response in Britain has been oddly muted. Politics is mostly taken up by Brexit, but the issues are linked. An earthquake under the foundations of European defence should jolt needles even on parochial Westminster seismographs. There was a debate in the Commons on Monday, but it was not a premier league parliamentary fixture. Attendance was sparse. Neither Labour nor the Tories fielded a cabinet-level minister. No one seriously disputed that Russia has violated the INF and no one pretended the UK could influence Trump\u2019s response.</p> <p>That exposes a double discomfort. First, there is no strategy to stop Putin sabotaging the institutional basis for Britain\u2019s national security. Second, Trump is happy for that apparatus to crumble. It is hard enough to manage the behaviour of a nuclear-armed, rogue Kremlin without having also to accommodate roguish caprice in the White House.</p> <p>Trump framed the INF treaty withdrawal as a response to Russian misdemeanour, but the true relationship with Moscow is more complex. The US security establishment, while horrified at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/16/robert-mueller-russians-charged-election\" title=\"\">evidence of meddling</a> in the 2016 presidential election, doesn\u2019t see Russia as an equal. It views Putin as a vindictive troll, lashing out through frustration at his country\u2019s decline. Trump himself shows the kind of twisting incoherence towards the Kremlin that you might expect to see in a client who doesn\u2019t like to admit the service he has procured.</p> <p>The US president shares with his Russian counterpart contempt for the idea that big countries can be bound by law to yield to small ones. That is why Trump despises the EU. It is also the instinct that makes him wary of Nato. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/25/trump-rebukes-nato-leaders-for-not-paying-defence-bills\" title=\"\">routinely berates Europeans</a> for failing to meet their financial obligations to the alliance and has hinted that he may one day abandon it. He sees any treaty that pre-dates his accession to the Oval Office as a scam that allows foreigners to drain American greatness.</p> <p>Trump is unmoved by the cultural and historical component of Atlanticism \u2013 the idea of cousinship and shared values \u2013 between the American republic and the old continent from which its founders set sail. He cares about power only in the here and now. On that scale, Europe is a nuisance in trade and a military weakling. It is also far less important than China, whose ascendancy, most analysts agree, is the real reason the US itched to ditch the INF treaty. What was the point in arms controls that bound Washington but not Beijing? In that sense Trump has added petulant swagger to an older trend in US foreign policy. Barack Obama had a Pacific-facing view of America\u2019s place in the world. Resentment of Europeans as military freeloaders has been growing in Washington since the end of the cold war.The fall of the iron curtain generated an economic \u201cpeace dividend\u201d for the newly unified continent. To Pentagon eyes, that was all splurged on civilian goodies but with the expectation that US marines could still be hailed in an emergency.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s reluctance to become a heavyweight military power \u2013 a legacy of atonement for past atrocity \u2013 leaves the UK and France as Europe\u2019s chief defenders (and holders of its nuclear capability).

      "bodyText": "For a bit of perspective on turbulent times it helps to remember Able Archer. In November 1983, Nato simulated a confrontation with the Soviet Union. The rehearsal was so plausible that the Russians doubted it was a drill, and began a counter-mobilisation. Luckily, level heads prevailed. Able Archer was the name of the operation that nearly turned the cold war hot by accident. Europe might feel a bit unstable these days, but at least it is not a hair-trigger away from nuclear Armageddon. One reason is the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. That deal, signed by Washington and Moscow in 1987, banned missiles with a range of 310 to 3,420 miles. Last week, Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the INF, blaming Russian violations. Vladimir Putin reciprocated over the weekend, promising to accelerate development of prohibited weapons. Unless Moscow and Washington unexpectedly rediscover the spirit of detente, the INF treaty is finished. A global monument to the triumph of diplomatic rationality over militaristic paranoia is being pulled down. The response in Britain has been oddly muted. Politics is mostly taken up by Brexit, but the issues are linked. An earthquake under the foundations of European defence should jolt needles even on parochial Westminster seismographs. There was a debate in the Commons on Monday, but it was not a premier league parliamentary fixture. Attendance was sparse. Neither Labour nor the Tories fielded a cabinet-level minister. No one seriously disputed that Russia has violated the INF and no one pretended the UK could influence Trump\u2019s response. That exposes a double discomfort. First, there is no strategy to stop Putin sabotaging the institutional basis for Britain\u2019s national security. Second, Trump is happy for that apparatus to crumble. It is hard enough to manage the behaviour of a nuclear-armed, rogue Kremlin without having also to accommodate roguish caprice in the White House. Trump framed the INF treaty withdrawal as a response to Russian misdemeanour, but the true relationship with Moscow is more complex. The US security establishment, while horrified at evidence of meddling in the 2016 presidential election, doesn\u2019t see Russia as an equal. It views Putin as a vindictive troll, lashing out through frustration at his country\u2019s decline. Trump himself shows the kind of twisting incoherence towards the Kremlin that you might expect to see in a client who doesn\u2019t like to admit the service he has procured. The US president shares with his Russian counterpart contempt for the idea that big countries can be bound by law to yield to small ones. That is why Trump despises the EU. It is also the instinct that makes him wary of Nato. He routinely berates Europeans for failing to meet their financial obligations to the alliance and has hinted that he may one day abandon it. He sees any treaty that pre-dates his accession to the Oval Office as a scam that allows foreigners to drain American greatness. Trump is unmoved by the cultural and historical component of Atlanticism \u2013 the idea of cousinship and shared values \u2013 between the American republic and the old continent from which its founders set sail. He cares about power only in the here and now. On that scale, Europe is a nuisance in trade and a military weakling. It is also far less important than China, whose ascendancy, most analysts agree, is the real reason the US itched to ditch the INF treaty. What was the point in arms controls that bound Washington but not Beijing? In that sense Trump has added petulant swagger to an older trend in US foreign policy. Barack Obama had a Pacific-facing view of America\u2019s place in the world. Resentment of Europeans as military freeloaders has been growing in Washington since the end of the cold war.The fall of the iron curtain generated an economic \u201cpeace dividend\u201d for the newly unified continent. To Pentagon eyes, that was all splurged on civilian goodies but with the expectation that US marines could still be hailed in an emergency. Germany\u2019s reluctance to become a heavyweight military power \u2013 a legacy of atonement for past atrocity \u2013 leaves the UK and France as Europe\u2019s chief defenders (and holders of its nuclear capability). That division of labour had a certain equilibrium with all three countries in the EU. Berlin-Paris was the main political axis of the European project, while Paris-London was the continent\u2019s security axis. Brexit throws the whole thing off kilter. Theresa May saw immediately that British defence and intelligence capabilities were her strongest negotiating cards, but she played them cackhandedly. In her formal article 50 notification, she wrote that \u201cfailure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened\u201d. That was interpreted in Brussels as a threat, confirming fears that Brexit contained seeds of Trumpian malevolence towards the European project. To win back some goodwill, May last year offered \u201cunconditional\u201d security cooperation. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have ramped up talk of EU military cooperation. UK officials say that is a bluff, or rather, a rhetorical gesture of defence solidarity that is still, in material terms, meaningless without Nato. The one thing that loose talk of a European army does achieve is a reinforcement of British Eurosceptic fear about secret Brussels plots to dissolve nations into one vast superstate. London continues to side with Europe over the US on some big policy calls \u2013 the Iran nuclear deal and tariff wars, for instance. British diplomats were reassured last year by the scale of EU support in naming and sanctioning Russia as culprit in the Salisbury poisoning. So far the logic of collective enterprise has proved more compelling than the Brexiteer cult of separation or any Brussels backlash against it. But for how long? Diplomats on both sides of the Channel are battling to maintain the existing European security network while Brexit swirls around them \u2013 a nationalist squall that whips imagined problems into real ones.

The Coalition wants to get back into the contest, and is on the hunt for the knockout blow, or blows. The core objective at the moment is to get the whole country roiling about Labor\u2019s \u201cretirement tax\u201d (that isn\u2019t a tax, just like the carbon tax was never a tax despite what Tony told us). The franking credits issue has become a proxy for \u201cLabor will steal what\u2019s yours and drive the country off the cliff\u201d. The means to achieving that end are unimportant. Whatever it takes, by whatever means, as long as voters are hearing the static, and wondering whether a new Labor government would embark on a wild-eyed outbreak of redistribution, and screw up the economy. It\u2019s that mindset that leads you to a place where you can establish an \u201cinquiry\u201d into a \u201cretirement tax\u201d (that isn\u2019t a tax), funded by the taxpayer (thanks for that guys), and think it\u2019s fine for the chairman of the relevant parliamentary committee (in this case Tim Wilson) to authorise what is clearly an accompanying, partisan campaign website (endorsed by him in his committee capacity) in order to better funnel outrage to the main event. Again, in that mindset, it\u2019s OK for Wilson to decline to answer direct questions about who is funding that campaign website which is pushing submissions into the taxpayer-funded process. I don\u2019t have to disclose that information, so I won\u2019t. Voters keen to understand who is exerting influence in their democracy can talk to the hand. We decide the (taxpayer-subsidised) echo chambers, and the circumstances in which they come into being. It\u2019s also OK, when that mindset descends, for members of the government to hand out Liberal party membership forms to retirees concerned about the changes during a taxpayer-funded hearing of the standing committee on economics.

      "bodyText": "The Brazilian mining dam which collapsed in January, killing hundreds of people, suffered a leak last year that compromised its safety, according to employees who allege the mine\u2019s operators did not inform the workforce or relocate a canteen and administration building that were destroyed in the disaster. One hundred and forty-two people died and 194 are still missing after the dam near Brumadinho in Minas Gerais state collapsed on 25 January. On the day of the disaster, Vale \u2013 the Brazilian company which owns the mine \u2013 said the dam was regularly checked, most recently on 22 January, and had received \u201cdeclarations of condition of stability\u201d from T\u00dcV S\u00dcD, a German inspection company. Four days after the disaster, police arrested three Vale employees and two engineers from T\u00dcV S\u00dcD, but on Tuesday a high court ordered their release. \u201cThere was no leak in the dam,\u201d a Vale spokeswoman said in an email. But three mine workers told the Guardian that around July last year, repairs were carried out after the dam leaked water near its base. Another man said his brother \u2013 who worked at the mine and is still missing \u2013 was so worried about the leak he planned to leave his job. Around 600 people were gathered at the mine\u2019s canteen and administrative area when the dam failed, releasing 11.7m cubic meters of sludgy mining waste known as tailings. CCTV videos show the enormous, grass-covered structure collapsing into a deluge of mud which flattened the mining complex and tore across the countryside. Fernando Coelho, 35, lost his father Olavo Coelho, 63, in the disaster. The two men lived together, and both worked at the mine. Fernando said that around July last year, his father was called in to work at around 10pm one night after a leak was spotted on the lower surface of the dam. Fernando Coelho, who was working at a nearby ore treatment unit, was asked to find sand and gravel for the repair. He then followed the night\u2019s events on his radio. \u201cThe supervisor found the mud leaking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey called for my father, because he had worked his whole life with dams and mines.\u201d By 4pm the following day, workers had been brought in to fix it and the area had been sealed off. \u201cThey did the repair and said there was no problem,\u201d he said. Coelho broke into tears as he remembered his father warning him to steer clear of the dam. \u201cThat\u2019s going to burst at any time,\u201d he recalled him saying. Coelho has related the same events to state prosecutors. A spokesman for prosecutors said they would not comment on an ongoing investigation. Dam safety experts said that such a leak would mean the dam was not safe. \u201cA leak like that \u2026 would inherently make the dam more unstable,\u201d said David Chambers, an expert on tailings dam failures who co-founded the Center for Science in Public Participation. \u201cAny kind of leak through the face of the dam is significant. It shouldn\u2019t do that if it was working properly.\u201d The Brumadinho dam was built in 1976 using the \u201cupstream\u201d method, in which tailings themselves are used to build the dam. (A more expensive method uses rock and earth to contain the waste.) The same method was used to build the Fund\u00e3o dam in the same state, which failed in November 2015, killing 19 people and causing an environmental catastrophe. Fund\u00e3o was operated by Samarco \u2013 a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton \u2013 and though the companies have spent billions of dollars on clean-up, Samarco has only paid a fraction of the fines levied. An independent report blamed the disaster on \u201cliquefaction\u201d a phenomenon in which solids act like liquids. In September, a T\u00dcV S\u00dcD report concluded that the Brumadinho dam was stable. But it highlighted drainage problems and recommended installing new water pressure monitors. According to Vale, workers were fitting the new monitors on the day the dam burst \u2013 over four months later. Jos\u00e9 de Gouveia, 53, narrowly survived the disaster because he was working high above the tailings tank in an ore treatment unit. He hung on as it began to fall apart while the sea of mud passed beneath, and eventually crawled out across broken fittings. \u201cI saw a group of people who ran \u2013 but they had no chance, they were overtaken by the mud,\u201d he said. \u201cWorkmates beside me slipped and fell and died there.\u201d Gouveia also saw men working on a leak at the foot of the dam around last July. \u201cThey were containing a little leak soon after the rainy season. It was seeping water in several places at the bottom,\u201d he said. Luis Castro, 60, who works for Reframax, a subcontracted company, said he saw crews working on the dam after workmates talked about a leak. \u201cWe heard there had been a little water leak, but we didn\u2019t know what the risk could be,\u201d he said. Castro also managed to escape from the ore treatment unit when the dam failed. \u201cI thought about jumping, I looked down and I saw people shouting: \u2018I\u2019m going to die,\u2019\u201d he said.

In 2018, Jo\u00e3o Xavier, a state assembly representative for Minas Gerais, proposed a state law that would have prohibited 90% of the state\u2019s \u201cupstream\u201d dams and created more rigorous regulations for the rest. The bill was defeated, Xavier said, by the powerful mining lobby. \u201cThey argued this would harm mining in the state but the opposite is true: what harms mining is living with environmental tragedies,\u201d Xavier said.

      "bodyText": "Most of the applause lines throughout Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech hewed to the familiar party lines of border crises, perceived foreign threats, abortion and the benefits of big tax cuts. But one completely unexpected moment came in a spirited exchange with the Democratic women of the House who, all dressed in suffragette white, were already the most striking group in the chamber and, to many observers, seemed primed to upstage the president. Representative Lois Frankel, chair of the House Democratic women\u2019s working group, told CNN before the speech: \u201cWearing suffragette white is a respectful message of solidarity with women across the country, and a declaration that we will not go back on our hard-earned rights.\u201d The president\u2019s daughter Tiffany and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Fox News host and girlfriend of Donald Jr, also wore white \u2013 although it\u2019s unclear if that was meant in solidarity with the Democrats or was just a bold fashion choice. Pivoting from yet another vividly imaginative appeal for a border wall, Trump noted the economic strides women had made. \u201cNo one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58% of the newly created jobs last year,\u201d he said to applause, including from many of the members dressed in white, who jumped to their feet cheering. While there are indeed more women in the labor force, there are also more men in the workforce than ever, so the statistic was misleading. But one profession where it can be safely argued that Trump has increased the number of women is in the House \u2013 though the achievement belongs to the Democrats seeking to unseat him, not the male-heavy ranks of the Republicans. Seemingly picking up on this, Trump offered a moment of levity. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAll Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before,\u201d he went on, adding: \u201cDon\u2019t sit yet. You\u2019re going to like this.\u201d \u201cExactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before,\u201d he said. The number of Republican women in the House, on the other hand, has fallen from 23 to 13. The applause for the remarks about women in Congress segued into one of the first of numerous USA! chants that would follow throughout the night, this time with numerous Democrats joining in, something of a disorienting spectacle. Trump\u2019s turn toward abortion laws later on was not met with quite as much enthusiasm from the opposition. \u201cLawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments from birth,\u201d he said. He turned to recent developments in Virginia. \u201cWe had the case of the governor of Virginia, where he stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children, who can feel pain in the mother\u2019s womb.\u201d In both cases Trump lied about the laws. In New York the language reads that an abortion could take place when \u201cthe patient is within twenty-four weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, or there is an absence of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient\u2019s life or health\u201d. The Virginia law, since put on hold, would have changed from three to one the number of doctors required to affirm \u201cthe continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman\u201d or \u201cimpair the mental or physical health of the woman\u201d. The most lasting image of the night may have come from the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who sat behind Trump reacting with chagrin to many of his pronouncements. Before the speech began, the president greeted her.

      "body": "<p>When Kenneth Hayne humiliated Josh Frydenberg by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/feb/01/awkward-commissioner-hayne-declines-to-shake-josh-frydenbergs-hand-video\">refusing a handshake</a> as he handed over his royal commission report last week, it was tempting to see him as stony-faced fast bowler about to unleash a series of unplayable deliveries to an industry running scared of a fearsome opponent.</p> <p>After all, the banks had seen their carefully cultivated reputation for propriety shredded by Hayne attack dogs during the commission hearings. Banking shares had lost more than billions in value over the year. AMP, Australia\u2019s venerable wealth management company, had endured a near-collapse thanks to the commission exposing its appalling treatment of customers.</p> <p>But, with the big end of town cowering at the crease, Hayne instead opted for lawyerly line and length. The banks could play it straight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/04/key-points-and-recommendations-of-the-banking-royal-commission-report\">take the medicine</a> and move on. The moment of existential danger was gone.</p> <p>Although the report is withering in its contempt for the industry\u2019s profit-at-all-cost culture, it does not seek to fundamentally change the structure of the sector. Despite\u2019s weighing in at a mighty 530 pages, the report is in many ways more notable for what it doesn\u2019t contain, rather than what it does.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/feb/05/the-banking-royal-commission-report-should-be-a-mark-of-shame-for-the-sector\">The banking royal commission report should be a mark of shame for the sector | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was no recommendation to force banks to end the link between financial advice and promoting their own wealth products. Hayne says that unpicking the link could be \u201ctoo disruptive\u201d, which suggests that he has also taken into account the possible risks to the financial system of recommending too many radical changes.</p> <p>He also had surprisingly little to say about the bonus culture which he rightly identified as a main source of the problem. He wants curbs on long-term incentives for executives, but short-term bonuses will remain very much part of the system. Again, he resisted rocking the boat or interfering with how the banks are actually run.</p> <p>As for the top the executives, whose actual job it is to run the banks, they all remain in place. True, there is some doubt over whether NAB boss Andrew Thorburn and his chairman Ken Henry can survive the verbal shellacking they received in the report. But the very fact that they think they can hang on despite being condemned as incompetent speaks volumes. As the independent economist Lindsay David noted this week, the banks have long been considered too big to fail but now they appear too big to reform as well.</p> <p>The regulators, too, have escaped with a slap on the wrist despite clearly being asleep at the wheel. Hayne points out that there is no need for new laws to curb misconduct in financial services. The laws are already in place, he said, it\u2019s just that the regulators didn\u2019t enforce them. We\u2019re left with the recommendation that Asic and Apra should be dismantled if they don\u2019t raise their game.</p> <p>But there was no proverbial blood on the carpet. Analysts at the investment bank UBS declared the Hayne report a \u201cclear win for the banks\u201d. The ratings agency S&amp;P said the report showed there would be \u201cno major changes to the industry structure or competitive landscape\u201d. It\u2019s always instructive to follow the money in these situations and the emphatic verdict of investors was plain to see when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/05/big-four-banks-shares-climb-despite-hayne-royal-commission-report\">shares in the big four lenders all shot up on Tuesday </a>in the wake of the report.</p> <p>On Wednesday,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/06/commonwealth-banks-half-year-profit-slides-after-property-market-slowdown\"> half-yearly figures from Commonwealth Bank</a> reminded us of the enduring strength of the sector\u2019s profit-making machinery as it notched up earnings of nearly $5bn in the six months to December.</p> <p>The big four remain Australia\u2019s most profitable companies and the sector still dominates the ASX200 index. Without their monumental profits and dividends, all our super funds would be poorer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/05/we-should-have-got-on-with-banking-royal-commission-earlier-turnbull-says\">We should have got on with banking royal commission earlier,\u00a0Turnbull says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But perhaps in those Commonwealth figures there are the seeds of something even more worrying for the banks than the royal commission.

      "bodyText": "When Kenneth Hayne humiliated Josh Frydenberg by refusing a handshake as he handed over his royal commission report last week, it was tempting to see him as stony-faced fast bowler about to unleash a series of unplayable deliveries to an industry running scared of a fearsome opponent. After all, the banks had seen their carefully cultivated reputation for propriety shredded by Hayne attack dogs during the commission hearings. Banking shares had lost more than billions in value over the year. AMP, Australia\u2019s venerable wealth management company, had endured a near-collapse thanks to the commission exposing its appalling treatment of customers. But, with the big end of town cowering at the crease, Hayne instead opted for lawyerly line and length. The banks could play it straight, take the medicine and move on. The moment of existential danger was gone. Although the report is withering in its contempt for the industry\u2019s profit-at-all-cost culture, it does not seek to fundamentally change the structure of the sector. Despite\u2019s weighing in at a mighty 530 pages, the report is in many ways more notable for what it doesn\u2019t contain, rather than what it does. There was no recommendation to force banks to end the link between financial advice and promoting their own wealth products. Hayne says that unpicking the link could be \u201ctoo disruptive\u201d, which suggests that he has also taken into account the possible risks to the financial system of recommending too many radical changes. He also had surprisingly little to say about the bonus culture which he rightly identified as a main source of the problem. He wants curbs on long-term incentives for executives, but short-term bonuses will remain very much part of the system. Again, he resisted rocking the boat or interfering with how the banks are actually run. As for the top the executives, whose actual job it is to run the banks, they all remain in place. True, there is some doubt over whether NAB boss Andrew Thorburn and his chairman Ken Henry can survive the verbal shellacking they received in the report. But the very fact that they think they can hang on despite being condemned as incompetent speaks volumes. As the independent economist Lindsay David noted this week, the banks have long been considered too big to fail but now they appear too big to reform as well. The regulators, too, have escaped with a slap on the wrist despite clearly being asleep at the wheel. Hayne points out that there is no need for new laws to curb misconduct in financial services. The laws are already in place, he said, it\u2019s just that the regulators didn\u2019t enforce them. We\u2019re left with the recommendation that Asic and Apra should be dismantled if they don\u2019t raise their game. But there was no proverbial blood on the carpet. Analysts at the investment bank UBS declared the Hayne report a \u201cclear win for the banks\u201d. The ratings agency S&amp;P said the report showed there would be \u201cno major changes to the industry structure or competitive landscape\u201d. It\u2019s always instructive to follow the money in these situations and the emphatic verdict of investors was plain to see when shares in the big four lenders all shot up on Tuesday in the wake of the report. On Wednesday, half-yearly figures from Commonwealth Bank reminded us of the enduring strength of the sector\u2019s profit-making machinery as it notched up earnings of nearly $5bn in the six months to December. The big four remain Australia\u2019s most profitable companies and the sector still dominates the ASX200 index. Without their monumental profits and dividends, all our super funds would be poorer. But perhaps in those Commonwealth figures there are the seeds of something even more worrying for the banks than the royal commission. Commonwealth noted that cash profit was down 2.1% due to a \u201csoftening housing market\u201d, as the credit squeeze brought about by tougher lending standards crimps the banks\u2019 biggest, most profitable business \u2013 mortgages. As prices fall back to 2016 levels, the reality is that most people who bought a property in the past two years are underwater on the deal with the home worth less than they paid for it. The impact this will have on the banks\u2019 balance sheets and the wider financial system is not quantifiable. Hayne showed how greed pushed up the amount of credit pumped into the property markets in the good years. But it\u2019s fair to say that the unravelling of the housing boom could have a conversely negative impact on the way back down as homeowners feel worse and worse off, lending dries up, flattening the banks buisness model. That could be the moment when the banks face their most dangerous foe.",

Passengers want to see a railway system that they can feel confident in and they know who is accountable when things go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in Westminster to MPs and rail industry professionals, Williams said he had consistent feedback from passengers and representative groups demanding more focus on rail\u2019s customers: \u201cThere is a fear that if we continue as we are we will drive people away from the railways over time.\u201d</p> <p>Quoting data from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) showing a decline in patronage in 2017-18, after two decades of almost constant growth, Williams warned: \u201cThere is a message out there that we need to take about passengers. My observation is that we have tended to take the recent growth of passengers for granted.\u201d</p> <p>The review was commissioned by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, in September 2018 after a damning report from the ORR into the chaotic introduction of a new timetable last May that threw rail services into disarray. Thousands of trains were cancelled or seriously delayed, particularly across Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway franchises, during the early summer. Passengers on many routes have also experienced years of disruption through strikes and engineering works, against a backdrop of fares rising faster than inflation.</p> <p>Williams said that he and the review panel were getting \u201calmost everywhere we go \u2026 a sense that the government micromanages the industry\u201d.</p> <p>He said rail franchise agreements had changed over time, damaging innovation: \u201cAs reliability and punctuality has fallen \u2026 the natural tendency is to put more and more in contracts.\u201d</p> <p>Williams hinted he was open to solutions that could involve public or private control \u2013 praising both Chiltern, let on one of the longest franchises, and publicly owned Merseyrail - but said they would would evolve from the \u201ccommercial and customer model we are trying to put in place\u201d.</p> <p>The durability of the current rail franchising model has been thrown into question, even among supporters of privatisation, after the collapse of Virgin Trains East Coast in 2018.</p> <p>Unions and Labour have argued that full-scale renationalisation of the rail industry is needed. Williams said: \u201cIn certain quarters there is a rush to get to how the industry should be structured. Lets start by focusing on what we want to get to and why we want to want to get there. The appropriate structure \u2013 the how we get there \u2013 will fall into place.\u201d</p> <p>The Williams review panel is due to report in the autumn, leading to a government white paper and potential legislation to reform the rail industry in 2020.</p>",

Speaking midway through a public consultation in his year-long review on the railways, Williams said he believed the industry needed \u201cto reorientate towards the customer\u201d, adding that it had taken the growth in passengers for granted. Referencing the recent national survey that showed passengers\u2019 satisfaction with the railway had dipped to an 11-year-low, Williams said: \u201cSome passengers are put off entirely in making journeys because they lack the certainty of getting to their destination when they want to get there. \u201cThere\u2019s dissatisfaction with communication and dealing with delay. Passengers want to see a railway system that they can feel confident in and they know who is accountable when things go wrong.\u201d Speaking in Westminster to MPs and rail industry professionals, Williams said he had consistent feedback from passengers and representative groups demanding more focus on rail\u2019s customers: \u201cThere is a fear that if we continue as we are we will drive people away from the railways over time.\u201d Quoting data from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) showing a decline in patronage in 2017-18, after two decades of almost constant growth, Williams warned: \u201cThere is a message out there that we need to take about passengers. My observation is that we have tended to take the recent growth of passengers for granted.\u201d The review was commissioned by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, in September 2018 after a damning report from the ORR into the chaotic introduction of a new timetable last May that threw rail services into disarray. Thousands of trains were cancelled or seriously delayed, particularly across Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway franchises, during the early summer. Passengers on many routes have also experienced years of disruption through strikes and engineering works, against a backdrop of fares rising faster than inflation. Williams said that he and the review panel were getting \u201calmost everywhere we go \u2026 a sense that the government micromanages the industry\u201d. He said rail franchise agreements had changed over time, damaging innovation: \u201cAs reliability and punctuality has fallen \u2026 the natural tendency is to put more and more in contracts.\u201d Williams hinted he was open to solutions that could involve public or private control \u2013 praising both Chiltern, let on one of the longest franchises, and publicly owned Merseyrail - but said they would would evolve from the \u201ccommercial and customer model we are trying to put in place\u201d. The durability of the current rail franchising model has been thrown into question, even among supporters of privatisation, after the collapse of Virgin Trains East Coast in 2018. Unions and Labour have argued that full-scale renationalisation of the rail industry is needed. Williams said: \u201cIn certain quarters there is a rush to get to how the industry should be structured. Lets start by focusing on what we want to get to and why we want to want to get there. The appropriate structure \u2013 the how we get there \u2013 will fall into place.\u201d The Williams review panel is due to report in the autumn, leading to a government white paper and potential legislation to reform the rail industry in 2020.",

The California Attorney General has challenged the president\u2019s policies through more than 100 legal actions over the past two years and has plans to use his time to push back against the Administration\u2019s claims. That\u2019s a large part of why the party selected him for the role.</p> <p>\u201cXavier Becerra embodies the promise of America,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement released with the announcement. \u201cThroughout his career and most recently as the first Latino to serve as state attorney general in California history, he has kept that promise alive for millions of children and families across the nation by protecting access to affordable health care and defending the dignity of everyone in our country from the Trump administration\u2019s harmful and divisive attacks. His moral and vigilant leadership on behalf of hardworking families is a critical marker for all who believe that our country\u2019s best days are still ahead of us\u201d.</p> <p>During his reelection campaign last year, Becerra put his fight against the Trump Administration front and center, highlighting the 45 lawsuits that included <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-ruling/u-s-judge-rejects-lawsuit-seeking-to-stop-trump-border-wall-idUSKCN1GB2W1\">contesting</a> the President\u2019s border wall as a violation of environmental laws, getting injunctions that protected reproductive rights under the Affordable Care Act, and litigation <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-so-much-stake-2020-census-trump-administration-should\">arguing against</a> the addition of a census question on citizenship.</p> <p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t lawsuits that affect just a small community or part of California. Most of these lawsuits impact the entire state, plus people outside\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/us/california-today-xavier-becerra-state-of-the-union.html\">told</a> The New York Times, adding having a response in Spanish is critical to ensuring non-English speaking Americans feel like they count. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for everyone in America to hear what the state of the union is and to hear the other side\u201d.</p> <p>Becerra has had many firsts in his life. He was the first Latino to serve as Attorney General in the state, appointed by then-governor Jerry Brown to replace Kamala Harris\u2019s spot after she was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was the first member of his family to attend college, earning undergraduate and law degrees from Stanford. The 12-term former congressman was also the first Latino to serve on the House Ways and Means committee.</p> <p>Becerra previously delivered then Spanish language response to the State of the Union in 2007. Then, he called for key progressive policies including healthcare and immigration reform, and minimum wage increases in Bush\u2019s first State of the Union after Nancy Pelosi became Speaker for the first time.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c5a2ba3e4b00ef6acc680d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gabrielle-canon\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-06T00:44:12.086Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It has been less than two months since Maria Mendoza-Sanchez was granted reentry into the US following her deportation a year and a half ago \u2014 and tonight she will be seated in the audience as the president gives his State of the Union address. The guest of California Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Mendoza-Sanchez <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/30/politics/undocumented-worker-trump-state-of-the-union/index.html\">is one of many</a> partisan plus-one\u2019s invited by Democrats, who will be in attendance to serve as a rebuttal to Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cMaria is a beloved nurse, neighbor and friend in the East Bay. She is a living example of the incalculable contributions that immigrants make to our communities every single day,\u201d Congresswoman Lee said in a statement released with the announcement.</p> <p>Trump is expected to double down on calls for support for his border wall, and his claims that its construction is the most pressing national priorities. But Mendoza-Sanchez\u2019s story, recently <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-nurse-deported-to-Mexico-returns-to-a-13469436.php\">recounted</a> in the San Francisco Chronicle, shows the other side of the immigration reform debate and highlights how harsher policies against immigrants can tear families and communities apart.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past, [Trump] has used public appearances like this to demonize immigrants, spread misinformation and deceive the American people,\u201d Lee wrote in an email to supporters today. \u201cBut we all know that real people \u2014 neighbors, friends and classmates \u2014 have suffered because of the actions of the Trump Administration. That\u2019s why I will be bringing Oakland resident Maria Mendoza-Sanchez as my guest to the State of the Union tonight\u201d.</p> <p>As a teenager, Mendoza-Sanchez left her home in Mexico and hiked across the US border. She cleaned houses, sold fruit, and slept only a few hours each night, working her way through city college and into a nursing program to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse. Before she was deported in 2017 \u2014 the result of harsher penalties for undocumented immigrants issued by the Trump Administration \u2014 her dreams had come true. All that was missing was a visa, which had been struggling to get for roughly 15 years.</p> <p>For two years before she was deported, Mendoza-Sanchez was a nurse in the oncology department at a public hospital in Northern California. But, she was ineligible to apply for a visa because of how she originally came into the US.</p> <p>She spent more than a year away from her three daughters, the job she had worked so hard to get, and the community her family called home. Her husband is still separated from the family, and had to stay behind in Mexico. But Mendoza-Sanchez was one out of 65,000 who was lucky enough to be picked for a visa lottery. Her H-1B work visa, sponsored by her employer, Alameda Health Services, will give her the chance to return to nursing in the US for the next three years, with the potential for an additional three if granted an extension.</p> <p>\u201cI was thrilled that Maria was able to return home \u2013 but I haven\u2019t forgotten the many families across the East Bay who remain in limbo,\u201d Lee wrote. \u201cI hope that Maria\u2019s attendance at the State of the Union will highlight the urgency around comprehensive immigration reform. Every day that we delay is another day that families suffer needlessly. Rest assured that I will keep fighting for immigration policies that treat every person with dignity, respect and compassion\u201d.</p> <p>Along with Mendoza-Sanchez, ex-Trump National Golf Club employee Victorina Morales, an undocumented worker from Guatemala who was fired from the club after revealing her citizenship status in an interview with The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/us/trump-bedminster-golf-undocumented-workers.html\">New York Times</a>, will also be in attendance.

Jordan, all eyes are on O\u2019Rourke during Winfrey\u2019s show as he re-emerges into the political scene. Though potential presidential ambitions have simmered in rumors, O\u2019Rourke has kept a relatively low-profile the past few weeks after his narrow loss to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a move atypical of potential presidential candidates.</p> <p>Looking to capitalize on the media kerfuffle around O\u2019Rourke\u2019s appearance, a group of about 30 protesters supporting the controversial Green New Deal gathered outside the theater to pressure O\u2019Rourke into voicing his support.</p> <p>Protesters held signs reading \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d, along with other like \u201cNo fossil fuel money\u201d which referred to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s purported <a href=\"https://readsludge.com/2018/12/18/beto-orourke-removed-from-no-fossil-fuel-money-pledge-following-sludge-report/\">broken pledge</a> to not take oil and gas money for his campaign. The group chanted \u201cWhat do we want? Green New Deal\u201d and held their signs as ticket holders of the event lined up in front of the theater to go through security.

Trump attacked \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d while also announcing a summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and promising new funding to end the HIV epidemic. Members of Congress sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to a survivor of both the Holocaust and the Tree of Life synagogue shooting during the speech. Former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams gave a well received Democratic response. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also said she would make an announcement about a 2020 presidential campaign Sunday in Minneapolis. Thanks for reading.

We\u2019ll email you a summary of the day\u2019s top stories and must-reads. Subscribe now. In an instant poll, CBS finds that voters gave Trump\u2019s speech tonight a high grade In an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, Eric Trump says tonight was \u201cthe best speech [his father] had ever given.\u201d If you need a easy summary of reactions tonight, this is a good one. Regardless of the reactions to the State of the Union, Republicans had one guaranteed win, picking up a previously Democratic state senate seat in a special election in Minnesota. The seat had been won twice by Barack Obama but Donald Trump won it in 2016. Joe Kennedy III who gave the Democratic response last year, tweeted his thoughts on the speech tonight. In an interview with MSNBC, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota announced that she would make a decision about running for President on Sunday at an event in Minneapolis. Klobuchar would be the fourth female senator to join the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Trump fell just short of Bill Clinton\u2019s record for the longest State of the Union address ever. Clinton spoke for 89 minutes in 2000 and Trump spoke for 83 minutes tonight, just edging his 82 minute speech in 2018. Delaware Democrat Chris Coons had an interesting response to Trump\u2019s speech tonight The Republican National Committee has issued its formal response to Abrams. \u201cWith extreme policies and an anti-free market agenda, Stacey Abrams was rejected by her home state of Georgia last November. Tonight, Abrams\u2019 speech for a national audience replayed the same broken ideas that capsized her failed campaign. While President Trump outlined a unifying agenda to advance America\u2019s progress, Democrats are still living in the past, mourning Abrams\u2019 loss.\u201d Stacey Abrams\u2019s response is getting good reviews Abrams chastises Trump once again So even as I am very disappointed by the president\u2019s approach to our problems \u2013 I still don\u2019t want him to fail. But we need him to tell the truth, and to respect his duties and the extraordinary diversity that defines America. Abrams does use particular language talking about \u201celigible citizens\u201d after her Republican opponent attacked her last year for claiming she wanted undocumented immigrants to vote. This is the next battle for our democracy, one where all eligible citizens can have their say about the vision we want for our country. Abrams, who lost a tight race in Georgia with accusations of malfeasance against her opponent, now focuses on voting rights. Voter suppression is real. From making it harder to register and stay on the rolls to moving and closing polling places to rejecting lawful ballots, we can no longer ignore these threats to democracy Abrams now attacks Trump\u2019s desire for a border wall and insists Democrats do not support \u201copen borders.\u201d We know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan, but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart. Compassionate treatment at the border is not the same as open borders. President Reagan understood this. President Obama understood this. Americans understand this. And Democrats stand ready to effectively secure our ports and borders. But we must all embrace that from agriculture to healthcare to entrepreneurship, America is made stronger by the presence of immigrants \u2013 not walls. Abrams now attacks the Trump tax cut. The Republican tax bill rigged the system against working people. Rather than bringing back jobs, plants are closing, layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living. Abrams now hits two key Democratic priorities, the need for increased gun control legislation as well to control the cost of higher education. Abrams now attacks Trump as was previewed in an excerpt released before the speech. The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the President of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people - but our values. She contrasts this with her experience in Georgia and a call for bipartisanship. We may come from different sides of the political aisle; but, our joint commitment to the ideals of this nation cannot be negotiable. Abrams starts by describing her blue collar background, saying \u201cThese were our family values \u2013 faith, service, education and responsibility.\u201d Stacey Abrams, the losing Democratic candidate for Governor in Georgia, is now beginning her response. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea. This is one of Trump\u2019s bolder claims. It is a bit of a stretch. Tensions were building steadily over decades, particularly since the first North Korean nuclear test in 2006. There were four tests during the Obama administration, and one during the Trump era, in September 2017. But the standoff came to the brink as a result of Trump\u2019s rhetoric in late 2017 became as heated as Pyongyang\u2019s, threatening to destroy the country with \u201cfire and fury\u201d. At the start of 2018, Kim Jong-un, declared that the mission to produce a viable nuclear arsenal, and that the regime would henceforward pivot towards the economy. There have been no nuclear or missile tests since. It is unknowable to what extent this pause is due to Trump\u2019s threats and to the international sanctions on Pyongyang. Many North Korean experts have said that regime\u2019s goal was to build a nuclear arsenal to guarantee its survival, and then negotiate with the West from a position of strength. President Trump\u2019s proposal to end transmission of HIV by 2030 with a new initiative comes amid criticism of the administration\u2019s efforts to curtail LGBT rights. \u201cThe American public deserves a real commitment from their government to end the HIV epidemic,\u201d said David Stacy, director of government affairs with the Human Rights Campaign. \u201cIf this administration wants to combat the spread of HIV, they need to immediately end their efforts to cut Medicaid funding, undermine the Affordable Care Act, and license discrimination against communities most impacted by HIV. When it comes to public health, we cannot afford any more harmful attacks and empty promises from this president.\u201d About 47,500 people are newly infected with HIV each year, according to the CDC, two-thirds of whom are gay men. About 8% are injection drug users. Roughly 1.1 million Americans live with HIV/AIDS. The initiative reportedly comes at the urging of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield, who was a controversial HIV researcher before leading the department. The Trump administration has often worked to undermine programs many say are critical to stopping the spread of HIV. For example, the administration proposed cutting funds to a successful anti-AIDS program called Pepfar, and worked to gut Medicaid, a public health insurance program for the poor and disabled which HIV/AIDS patients disproportionately rely on. After a long speech, Trump finishes and works his way out of the House chamber Trump ends on an optimistic note as the closing rhetoric is far more poetic than the rest of the speech. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America\u2019s destiny -- that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world! As the speech ends, Trump pivots back to the beginning and asks once again for America to \u201cchoose greatness.\u201d This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future -- our fate -- and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness. Congress has broken out into a rendition of Happy Birthday for Judah Samet, a survivor of the Holocaust and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting who turned 81 today. Trump ad libs afterwards \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t do that for me.\u201d Trump now details negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor -- and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. Trump now describes his foreign policy as \u201cprincipled realism.\u201d Trump takes a pointed shot at those on the far left of the Democratic Party. Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence \u2013- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. Trump gets bipartisan applause for announcing \u201ctwo weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.\u201d Trump tells Congress: If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam. Trump pivots to cultural issues and calls on Congress \u201cto pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother\u2019s womb.\u201d This comes after he attacks embattled Virginia governor Ralph Northam, saying Northam \u201cstated he would execute a baby after birth.\u201d In addition to funding to fight AIDS, Trump calls for an extra $500 million to fight childhood cancer over the next ten years. In a bolder, bipartisan statement, Trump calls for increased funding to fight HIV and eliminate the disease in the next ten years No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and Aids. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. We have made incredible strides, incredible. Together, we will defeat Aids in America and beyond. Now Trump calls a tougher trade policy on China, for Congress to give him more freedom to impose tariffs as well as to pass the USMCA, Trump\u2019s replacement for NAFTA. Trump praises the increasing role of women in the work force to cheers, particularly towards the cluster of Democratic freshmen women wearing white in the chamber. He then says \u201cDon\u2019t sit yet, you\u2019ll like this\u201d before noting \u201c we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.\u201d Nancy Pelosi raises out her hands behind him to urge Democrats to stand as the chamber breaks out into chants of USA, USA. Trump adds \u201cthat\u2019s great and congratulations.\u201d Trump urges the efficacy of a border wall while asking Congress to compromise the subject which has become a symbolic totem for both parties. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let\u2019s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe. Trump now urges the building of a wall on the southern border, which he emphasizes will be a \u201csmart, strategic, see-through steel barrier.\u201d In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall -- but the proper wall never got built. I will get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier -- not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. Trump takes a shot at those on the left of the Democratic Party who have called for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement -- and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE. The pledge comes after an extended tribute to Elvin Hernandez, an Hispanic-American ICE officer who fights sex trafficking. Per Trump, \u201cThanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.\u201d Trump gave one interesting ad lib in talking about immigration tonight adding that he wants legal immigrants \u201cin the largest numbers ever.\u201d Illegal immigration is now being painted as a populist issue by Trump: No issue better illustrates the divide between America\u2019s working class and America\u2019s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration -- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals that are so crowded you can\u2019t get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is actually very cruel. Trump implores Congress to act on border security \u201cout of love.\u201d Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. Trump now warns of caravans of illegal immigrants approaching the southern border and claims Mexico is sending them in buses. Groans can be heard in the chamber. Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. Trump now addresses the coming government funding deadline for the first time The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border. Trump goes on to hail the First Step Act This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption. Trump is now spending a lengthy section of his speech talking the First Step Bill, the successful bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation which was passed last year. He\u2019s now talking about Alice Johnson, a first time non-violent drug offender who was sentenced to life in prison. Her case came to his attention due to lobbying from Kim Kardashian West and Trump commuted her sentence last year. Trump now praises a variety of bipartisan legislation that passed in the last Congress including the farm bill, legislation to deal with the opioid crisis and to refigure the VA. After hailing his economic successes , Trump attacks \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d as an obstacle, a pointed reference to Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in 2016 election. The line sparked a distinct eye roll from Speaker Nancy Pelosi. the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn\u2019t work that way! We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. Trump pronounces \u201cthe state of our union is strong\u201d to chants of USA, USA in the chamber. Trump adds \u201cthat sounds so good.\u201d Trump celebrates rolling back Obamacare as Republicans universally applaud and Democrats sit quietly In his remarks, Trump pointedly rejects the politics of \u201cresistance\u201d and ask Americans \u201cto choose greatness.\u201d But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution -- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America\u2019s future. The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness. Trump notes \u201cthere is nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America\u201d Trump acknowledges Buzz Aldrin, the second man to step foot on the moon, who is in the audience tonight. Aldrin gets bipartisan support as Trump notes the coming 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 landing on the moon. Trump gets bipartisan applause as he says \u201cwinning is not victory for our party, winning is victory for our country.\u201d As he stands before the House chamber, enjoying the applause, Trump\u2019s tie is noticeably askew, which is raising concern. Trump now shakes hands with Mike Pence and Nancy Pelosi, who will be sitting behind him as he stands at the dais and prepares to deliver the speech The House Sergeant at Arms has just announced Trump\u2019s entrance into the chamber as he shakes hands with members who have staked out seats for hours to grab a picture and a few seconds on national television with him. First Lady Melania Trump has entered the House Chamber now to loud applause. CNN reports this is her first public appearance since December 27, 2018. As part of preparations for the summit that Trump is expected to announce tonight, an American diplomat is flying to Pyongyang to work out final details. President Donald Trump is expected to announce a second summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un tonight at the end of the month. It is reportedly likely to be held in Da Nang, Vietnam. Rick Perry, the Secretary of Energy, will be the designated survivor tonight. In case of a catastrophic disaster, he will not be present at the Capitol to ensure that someone in the presidential line of succession will survive. Perry is a former Texas governor who mounted unsuccessful presidential bids in 2012 and 2016. Trump is yet again emphasizing the need for wall and a crackdown on illegal immigration in an excerpt from his speech released by the White House No issue better illustrates the divide between America\u2019s WORKING CLASS and America\u2019s POLITICAL CLASS than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Trump also is using much of the traditional boilerplate that presidents from both parties use in State of the Union addresses. The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican Agenda or a Democrat Agenda. It is the agenda of the American People. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this Great American Adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America\u2019s future. The decision is ours to make. Steve King, the Iowa Republican who lost his committee assignments after asking when the term \u201cWhite Supremacist\u201d became offensive in the latest of a series of offensive and racially charged comments over two decades in politics, has his own interesting State of the Union guest tonight. The Washington Post reports that embattled Virginia governor Ralph Northam is considering giving up his party affiliation as calls for him to resign come from all corners. Northam has faced national opprobrium since a racist picture from his medical school yearbook emerged showing a man in blackface and a man in Ku Klux Klan hood. Northam has denied being the man in the picture but admitted to wearing blackface in a Michael Jackson dance party in 1984. Tonight Xavier Becerra will be delivering the Democrats\u2019 Spanish language response to President Trump\u2019s State of the Union\u2014 and he\u2019s had plenty of practice. The California Attorney General has challenged the president\u2019s policies through more than 100 legal actions over the past two years and has plans to use his time to push back against the Administration\u2019s claims. That\u2019s a large part of why the party selected him for the role. \u201cXavier Becerra embodies the promise of America,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement released with the announcement. \u201cThroughout his career and most recently as the first Latino to serve as state attorney general in California history, he has kept that promise alive for millions of children and families across the nation by protecting access to affordable health care and defending the dignity of everyone in our country from the Trump administration\u2019s harmful and divisive attacks. His moral and vigilant leadership on behalf of hardworking families is a critical marker for all who believe that our country\u2019s best days are still ahead of us\u201d. During his reelection campaign last year, Becerra put his fight against the Trump Administration front and center, highlighting the 45 lawsuits that included contesting the President\u2019s border wall as a violation of environmental laws, getting injunctions that protected reproductive rights under the Affordable Care Act, and litigation arguing against the addition of a census question on citizenship. \u201cThese aren\u2019t lawsuits that affect just a small community or part of California. Most of these lawsuits impact the entire state, plus people outside\u201d he told The New York Times, adding having a response in Spanish is critical to ensuring non-English speaking Americans feel like they count. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for everyone in America to hear what the state of the union is and to hear the other side\u201d. Becerra has had many firsts in his life. He was the first Latino to serve as Attorney General in the state, appointed by then-governor Jerry Brown to replace Kamala Harris\u2019s spot after she was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was the first member of his family to attend college, earning undergraduate and law degrees from Stanford. The 12-term former congressman was also the first Latino to serve on the House Ways and Means committee. Becerra previously delivered then Spanish language response to the State of the Union in 2007. Then, he called for key progressive policies including healthcare and immigration reform, and minimum wage increases in Bush\u2019s first State of the Union after Nancy Pelosi became Speaker for the first time. It has been less than two months since Maria Mendoza-Sanchez was granted reentry into the US following her deportation a year and a half ago \u2014 and tonight she will be seated in the audience as the president gives his State of the Union address. The guest of California Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Mendoza-Sanchez is one of many partisan plus-one\u2019s invited by Democrats, who will be in attendance to serve as a rebuttal to Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric. \u201cMaria is a beloved nurse, neighbor and friend in the East Bay. She is a living example of the incalculable contributions that immigrants make to our communities every single day,\u201d Congresswoman Lee said in a statement released with the announcement. Trump is expected to double down on calls for support for his border wall, and his claims that its construction is the most pressing national priorities. But Mendoza-Sanchez\u2019s story, recently recounted in the San Francisco Chronicle, shows the other side of the immigration reform debate and highlights how harsher policies against immigrants can tear families and communities apart. \u201cIn the past, [Trump] has used public appearances like this to demonize immigrants, spread misinformation and deceive the American people,\u201d Lee wrote in an email to supporters today. \u201cBut we all know that real people \u2014 neighbors, friends and classmates \u2014 have suffered because of the actions of the Trump Administration. That\u2019s why I will be bringing Oakland resident Maria Mendoza-Sanchez as my guest to the State of the Union tonight\u201d. As a teenager, Mendoza-Sanchez left her home in Mexico and hiked across the US border. She cleaned houses, sold fruit, and slept only a few hours each night, working her way through city college and into a nursing program to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse. Before she was deported in 2017 \u2014 the result of harsher penalties for undocumented immigrants issued by the Trump Administration \u2014 her dreams had come true. All that was missing was a visa, which had been struggling to get for roughly 15 years. For two years before she was deported, Mendoza-Sanchez was a nurse in the oncology department at a public hospital in Northern California. But, she was ineligible to apply for a visa because of how she originally came into the US. She spent more than a year away from her three daughters, the job she had worked so hard to get, and the community her family called home. Her husband is still separated from the family, and had to stay behind in Mexico. But Mendoza-Sanchez was one out of 65,000 who was lucky enough to be picked for a visa lottery. Her H-1B work visa, sponsored by her employer, Alameda Health Services, will give her the chance to return to nursing in the US for the next three years, with the potential for an additional three if granted an extension. \u201cI was thrilled that Maria was able to return home \u2013 but I haven\u2019t forgotten the many families across the East Bay who remain in limbo,\u201d Lee wrote. \u201cI hope that Maria\u2019s attendance at the State of the Union will highlight the urgency around comprehensive immigration reform. Every day that we delay is another day that families suffer needlessly. Rest assured that I will keep fighting for immigration policies that treat every person with dignity, respect and compassion\u201d. Along with Mendoza-Sanchez, ex-Trump National Golf Club employee Victorina Morales, an undocumented worker from Guatemala who was fired from the club after revealing her citizenship status in an interview with The New York Times, will also be in attendance. She was invited by Democratic New Jersey Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman. Excerpts of the Democratic response from former Georgia state legislator Stacey Abrams have just released. Abrams, who lost the 2018 governor\u2019s race in the Peach State and is being heavily recruited to run for Senate in 2020, attacks Trump and blames him for the 35-day partial government shutdown. Just a few weeks ago, I joined volunteers to distribute meals to furloughed federal workers. They waited in line for a box of food and a sliver of hope since they hadn\u2019t received a paycheck in weeks. Making their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace. The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the President of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people - but our values. The Washington Post reports that in registering for the Texas bar, Elizabeth Warren wrote that her race was \u201cAmerican Indian.\u201d She told the Post in an interview \u201cI can\u2019t go back. But I am sorry for furthering confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and harm that resulted.\u201d Warren\u2019s ethnic heritage has long been a partisan trip line. The Massachusetts Democrat was attacked in 2012 Senate race for representing herself as a Native American in order to take advantage of affirmative action. Warren insisted that she relied on family stories but a prominent Massachusetts right wing radio host nicknamed her \u201cFauxcahontas\u201d to emphasize what he viewed as a lie. That nickname has since been transmuted by Donald Trump to simply be \u201cPocahontas\u201d and has been construed as an ethnic slur by some. In an effort to put the issue behind her, Warren released a video that included a DNA test of her heritage. That sparked even more criticism from Native Americans about whether she was attempting to circumvent the tribal citizenship process. CNN reports that President Donald Trump met with contractors at the White House on Monday to discuss building a border wall. The meeting comes less than two weeks before the next government funding deadline. Trump has long insisted that he won\u2019t sign a bill to fund the government that doesn\u2019t include wall funding. Democrats won\u2019t support a bill that funds a wall. The resulting impasse led to a five week shutdown in December and January before a temporary compromise was reached. CNN reports one unique detail from the meeting: The President is so fixated on building the wall that he told a group of political allies on Monday that he wants to paint a section of current border fencing where it meets the ocean in San Diego, a person familiar with the exchange told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. Trump complained he was told by a general that painting that area could harm the environment. At least four Democrats are boycotting the State of the Union tonight. John Lewis, a veteran congressman from Georgia and civil rights hero is boycotting as are Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Steve Cohen of Tennessee and Lewis\u2019s fellow Georgian, Hank Johnson. Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard received the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke on Tuesday. Gabbard, who is mounting a longshot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, was praised by Duke as \u201ca candidate who will actually put America First rather than Israel First.\u201d The Hawaii Democrat repudiated the endorsement. However, the endorsement is likely particularly unwanted as Gabbard is already facing scrutiny for her visit to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017 as well as past homophobic comments. In a preview of the speech given to influential Republicans at the White House yesterday, Trump said much of the speech would be about foreign policy. However, it doesn\u2019t appear the deficit will come up as White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says \u201cnobody cares\u201d about the growing deficit. Mulvaney was an ardent fiscal hawk while serving as a Republican member of Congress. Politico reports White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has invited a bipartisan group of lawmakers to Camp David on Friday. The invitation marks rare outreach across the aisle by the Trump White House which has struggled to build relationships with Democrats, particularly in the wake of the president\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric. Trump will not be attending. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, the former Texas congressman said he will decide on a presidential bid by the February. O\u2019Rourke, who narrowly lost a Senate race to Ted Cruz, has been contemplating a White House bid and went a much publicized road trip in Feburary that he chronicled in posts on the website Medium. The Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) apologized to a Buzzfeed reporter after an agent quizzed extensively about the website\u2019s reporting at JFK Airport. After Mack, an Australian citizen, was returning to the United States after getting his visa renewed, he was asked a torrent of questions by an agent at passport control about Buzzfeed\u2019s reporting on Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In a statement to Buzzfeed, CBP Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs Andrew Meehan said: \u201cOn behalf of the agency, I would like to extend our apologies to Mr. David Mack for the inappropriate remarks made to him during his CBP processing upon his arrival to the United States. The officer\u2019s comments do not reflect CBP\u2019s commitment to integrity and professionalism of its workforce. In response to this incident, CBP immediately reviewed the event and has initiated the appropriate personnel inquiry and action.\u201d Elizabeth Warren and her husband Bruce have a net worth somewhere between $4 and $11 million and she received a book advance worth $300,000 last year. The Massachusetts senator outlined her assets in financial disclosures filed Tuesday. She and her husband have previously disclosed their tax returns and had a gross income of $913,000 in 2017. Warren is the first 2020 presidential candidate to release their financial disclosure. Only four of the nine Justices on the United States Supreme Court are expected to attend tonight\u2019s State of the Union. Attendance by the Court has become increasingly spotty since Obama directly criticized the Court\u2019s ruling in Citizens United during his 2010 speech. Justice Samuel Alito responded by mouthing \u201cnot true.\u201d Among the five not attending is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who had cancer surgery in December. Ginsburg made her first public appearance yesterday since the surgery at a concert in Washington. A group of \u201cMAGA all-stars\u201d are seeking ways to privately fund a wall on the United States\u2019s southern border. Last week in McAllen, Texas, an assortment of Trumpists met to discuss building a wall even if Trump can\u2019t. It included Steve Bannon, baseball great Curt Schilling, former Colorado congressman and presidential candidate Tom Tancredo and Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state. As Politico reports: The idea, which began in December as a Florida man\u2019s quixotic online crowdfunding campaign, is becoming something more, well, concrete. Big name Trump supporters like Bannon, a former Trump campaign and White House strategist, have flocked to the project. And they have initiated talks with the Israeli firm that constructed that country\u2019s border fence with Gaza, the group told POLITICO. They expect to hold a town hall in Tucson, Arizona, as soon as Friday and to visit the border in Laredo, Texas, next week . . . Bannon told POLITICO that his team is studying whether their wall could be constructed from the hemp-based building material hempcrete. \u201cDo you understand the irony of using hempcrete to keep out marijuana?\u201d Bannon said. The group has already entered into a partnership with the Kansas-based America\u2019s Hemp Academy to supply the material if it is ultimately selected for use, according to organizers. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is visiting Iowa later this month as she explores a presidential bid. Klobuchar, a three-term Democrat first elected in 2006, has long been considered a potential presidential prospect and has occasionally made trips to Iowa, a state that is on Minnesota\u2019s southern border. As Politico reports: A December poll shows Klobuchar could be well positioned in her neighboring Iowa, where at 10 percent, she placed fourth in a crowded Democratic presidential field. She headlined several events throughout the fall in the state, stumping for Iowa Reps. Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne in the runup to the midterms. If Klobuchar enters the fray, she would become the first official candidate who hails from the Midwest, a critical battleground region in the 2020 map. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown \u2014 who is also considering a presidential run, but hasn\u2019t formally launched \u2014 held events throughout Iowa last week, as he kicked off his \u2018Dignity of Work\u2019 listening tour. Klobuchar has frequently said that the eventual 2020 Democratic nominee must focus on Midwestern voters, bringing \u201can understanding of those voices that weren\u2019t heard in 2016 from the Midwest and really from the middle of the country.\u201d Nine classmates of embattled Virginia governor Ralph Northam have signed a letter insisting that he was neither the man in blackface or the man in a Ku Klux Klan hood in a picture on his medical school year book page. Northam has faced near universal calls to resign after the picture came out and he since admitted to appearing in blackface as part of a Michael Jackson dance party. He has insisted though that he was not in the picture. Fans and protesters alike turned out in New York\u2019s Times Square on an unusually warm February Tuesday at the Playstation Theater where talk-show legend Oprah Winfrey was due to interview once-Democrat Golden Boy and former Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. Amidst other celebrity guests like Bradley Cooper and Michael B. Jordan, all eyes are on O\u2019Rourke during Winfrey\u2019s show as he re-emerges into the political scene. Though potential presidential ambitions have simmered in rumors, O\u2019Rourke has kept a relatively low-profile the past few weeks after his narrow loss to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a move atypical of potential presidential candidates. Looking to capitalize on the media kerfuffle around O\u2019Rourke\u2019s appearance, a group of about 30 protesters supporting the controversial Green New Deal gathered outside the theater to pressure O\u2019Rourke into voicing his support. Protesters held signs reading \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d, along with other like \u201cNo fossil fuel money\u201d which referred to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s purported broken pledge to not take oil and gas money for his campaign. The group chanted \u201cWhat do we want? Green New Deal\u201d and held their signs as ticket holders of the event lined up in front of the theater to go through security. Some in line were handed fliers that had a picture of Beto and a slogan \u201cStep Up Or Step Aside.\u201d \u201cThis is the beginning of an effort\u2026 where we\u2019ll be consistently protesting and urging candidates to step up their game,\u201d said Pete Sikora of New York Communities for Change, a grassroots organizing not-for-profit that coordinated the protest with the other organizations like Sunrise Movement, a climate change youth activist not-for-profit. \u201cNot only do we want them to support a Green New Deal, but we want them to put it as a central part of their platform.\u201d Specific policies within the plan have yet to unfold, but the general gist is massive government investment into clean energy jobs and infrastructure as well as policies that support low-income communities, like a federal job guarantee. Originally touted by U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement, the deal has received support from presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. Though most ticket holders in line said they were mostly excited to see Winfrey, who herself has denied rumors of a presidential run, a few O\u2019Rourke voters and fans are in the audience. Olga Espinal of Queens, New York, came to the event with her daughter, Daniella Rico. Both said they were excited to see O\u2019Rourke and would likely support O\u2019Rourke if he decided to run for president. \u201cI was really excited about him during the campaign,\u201d said Espinal, who is originally from Colombia. \u201cHe\u2019s compassionate, he\u2019s different. I like his approach to immigration.\u201d Winfrey\u2019s interview with O\u2019Rourke is set to air Feb. 16 on her cable TV channel OWN. The White House promised this morning that Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address will focus on unity. The president is set to deliver a message of optimism and \u2018comity\u2019, aides said, in his speech to the House. But Trump almost immediately undermined that promise, as he picked a fight with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and criticized the media. Trump said Schumer: \u201c[Is] upset that he didn\u2019t win the Senate, after spending a fortune, like he thought he would. Too bad we weren\u2019t given more credit for the Senate win by the media! Elswehere, Former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler moved a step closer to being in charge of the Environment Protection Agency. In his recent confirmation hearing Wheeler downplayed the severity of man-made climate change. Donald Trump\u2019s four visits to Mar-a-Lago in early 2017 cost the taxpayer $13.6m, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. Between February 3 and March 5 2017 Trump spent all but one weekend at the Florida resort, a total of 15 days, at an average cost of nearly $1m a day. The president\u2019s trips incurred $10.6 million for operating costs of government aircraft and boats, according to the GAO, a non-partisan body. Those trips cost a further $3 million for \u201ctemporary duty costs\u201d of the government employees who supported Trump\u2019s travel, including transportation, lodging, and meals and incidental expenses. Trump has made multiple trips to Mar-a-Lago since those early visits. Business trips taken by Trump family members cost the US taxpayer further hundreds of thousands of dollars, the GAO said. \u201cThe United States Secret Service incurred about $396,000, primarily for temporary duty costs, while protecting Donald Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump during three international trips taken in January and February 2017,\u201d the report said. A federal judge has agreed to dismiss a legal claim by Stormy Daniels against Michael Cohen. US District Court Judge James Otero allowed Daniels to drop a defamation case against Cohen on Monday. The claim was part of a larger lawsuit Daniels filed against Trump last year, arguing that a non-disclosure statement agreed with Trump was void as the then-presidential candidate hadn\u2019t signed it. That case against Trump is still ongoing. In December a separate case from Daniels against Trump, for defamation, was dismissed by Otero. Daniels was ordered to pay Trump nearly $293,000 for his attorneys\u2019 fees. Nancy Pelosi has invited two transgender soldiers to the State of the Union tonight, in a likely rebuke to Donald Trump. Captain Jennifer Peace and Major Ian Brown, both active duty members of the US army, will be Pelosi\u2019s guests in the chamber, along with Washington DC mayor Muriel Bowser, DNC Chair Tom Perez and a number of activists. Trump summarily barred transgender people from the military in a series of tweets in July 2017, reportedly taking military leaders by surprise. The president said the military \u201ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender (sic) in the military would entail\u201d. A 2016 study commissioned by the Department of Defense found that allowing transgender people to serve in the military would have \u201cminimal impact\u201d on medical costs or on readiness. Virginia governor Ralph Northam is still clinging to office, as the furore continues over the \u2018blackface\u2019 scandal of his own making. Northam is said to be weighing whether or not to resign as governor, with Democrats in Virginia and beyond calling for him to leave his position. State senator Louise Lucas, a prominent African-American lawmaker and former Northam ally who has pressed for him to step down, told the Associated Press that Northam doesn\u2019t need to take a few more days to make up his mind. \u201cI am so praying that he will do that and get it behind us,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWhat\u2019s a little bit more of time going to do for us?\u201d The Associated Press writes that the recruiting arm for senate Republicans is poking at Stacey Abrams, even before she delivers the formal rebuttal to Trump\u2019s State of the Union message. The National Republican Senatorial Committee released a brief video online Tuesday, stringing together snippets of past comments by Abrams \u2013 including her stating: \u201cThis is not a speech of concession\u201d after her narrow loss to Republican Brian Kemp in last year\u2019s race for Georgia governor. Other clips show Abrams talking about impeachment, presumably for Trump, and telling an interviewer that she tells folks she\u2019s \u2018met herself\u2019 and \u201cI\u2019m not overly impressed.\u201d At that point, the words, \u201cFinally, something we agree on,\u201d appear on screen. Abrams is being encouraged by Democrats to run for Senate next year against first-term Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia. Meanwhile, she\u2019s crafted the cover pic on her Twitter account to show her beaming confidently and reminding her third of a million followers that she\u2019ll be giving the response to the SOTU tonight. Democrats are making a powerful statement without anyone uttering a word at the State of the Union address tonight. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will sit on the dias behind Trump; Stacey Abrams, who narrowly missed becoming Georgia\u2019s first black woman governor, will deliver the Dems\u2019 official response. And now White House aspirant Kamala Harris is set to deliver what\u2019s being called a \u201cprebuttal\u201d address live on Facebook before the event. The Associated Press writes that Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Brett Kavanaugh on a high-profile appeals court said Tuesday she cringes at some of the language she used as a college student in writing about sexual assault, race and equal rights for women. Neomi Rao told the Senate judiciary committee that writings in which she criticized affirmative action and suggested that intoxicated women were partly responsible for date rape do not reflect her current thinking. \u201cI like to think I\u2019ve matured as a thinker, writer and a person,\u201d she said at a confirmation hearing for a seat on the US Circuit court of appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Trump nominated Rao for the seat left vacant when Brett Kavanaugh joined the supreme court. Rao, who currently serves as administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, said there were \u201ccertainly some sentences and phrases\u201d from her college writing in the 1990s that \u201cI would never use today.\u201d Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who recently revealed she was raped by her boyfriend as a college student, said Rao\u2019s writings \u201cgive me pause,\u201d in part because of the message they send to young women who may be reluctant to report a rape, as Ernst was. Rao called rape a \u201chorrible crime\u201d and said anyone who commits rape should be prosecuted. Her comment that women should stay sober to avoid placing themselves at risk was merely \u201ccommon sense\u201d advice that her own mother gave her, Rao said. Rao, 45, worked in the George W. Bush White House but has never tried a case in state or federal court. Liberal activists and some Democrats have seized on Rao\u2019s writings, in which she also derided LGBT rights as part of a \u201ctrendy\u201d political movement and questioned the science behind global warming. Rao said on Tuesday she believes in equal rights for women and LGBT people and said she believes in the \u201coverwhelming\u201d scientific consensus that climate change is real. During his State of the Union address tonight, Donald Trump is expected to talk up his presidency so far, as commanders-in-chief are wont to do, no matter the reality, and will also call for unity, while trying to project a bipartisan message. Putting a bipartisan spin on things will be tricky, however, just days after the government shutdown ended but there is still no deal in sight on the president\u2019s border wall. Trump\u2019s latest term for border security is a \u2018human wall\u2019 of military personnel. It will be interesting to see how many times he uses the word \u2018wall\u2019 in the SOTU speech and how many times it has caveats, such as human, barrier, fence, \u201cwhatever you want to call it\u201d. POTUS is expected to declare triumph over ISIS in Syria, despite defense leaders\u2019 suspicion that the group has not been defeated, let alone their ideology. A Senate committee advanced the nomination of Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Donald Trump has issued a statement welcoming the Year of the Pig. Today, people across the United States and around the world mark the beginning of the Lunar New Year with spectacular fireworks displays, joyful festivals, and family gatherings. This is a sacred time for many people of Asian descent, and it is an opportunity for all Americans to honor the important contributions these communities have made to the story of American greatness. As families, friends, and loved ones gather to welcome the Year of the Pig, we join in sharing our best wishes for good health, prosperity, and happiness. Next year is the Year of the Rat. Ivanka Trump remained silent on the Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault allegations. She made no comment after the Access Hollywood tapes recorded her father talking about sexually assaulted women. Ivanka Trump also supported Kim Reynolds for Iowa governor \u2013 someone that Guardian columnist Arwa Mahdawi noted has a \u201chorrific record on women\u2019s health\u201d \u2013 and kept quiet for months about her father\u2019s policy of separating children from their mothers and fathers at the border. (She did eventually say she was \u201cvery vehemently against family separation\u201d.) But, you know, fine: The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee will have a subpoena prepared should acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker try to dodge \u201cuncomfortable questions\u201d when he testifies before the panel on Friday, Reuters reports. \u201cTo be clear, I hope never to use this subpoena,\u201d committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told Reuters. Nadler said Whitaker should expect questions at the hearing about his communications with the White House and his refusal to recuse himself from the Mueller probe. \u201cIf he appears on time and ready to answer those questions, the subpoena will be entirely unnecessary,\u201d he added. The Fox News poll mentioned here found that 70% of Americans are in favor of increasing tax rates on incomes over $10m \u2013 and 65% favored higher taxes for incomes over $1m. Trump is expected to declare near-total triumph over the Islamic State group in Syria in his State of the Union address Tuesday, but U.S. defense officials are increasingly fearful that the militants are simply biding their time until the Americans leave the battlefield as planned, the Associated Press reports: IS militants have lost territory since Trump\u2019s surprise announcement in December that he was pulling U.S. forces out, but military officials warn the fighters could regroup within six months to a year after the Americans leave. A Defense Department watchdog report released Monday warned of just such a possibility. The Islamic State group \u201cremains a potent force of battle-hardened and well-disciplined fighters that \u2018could likely resurge in Syria\u2019 absent continued counterterrorism pressure,\u201d the report from the inspector general said. The top commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, Gen. Joseph Votel, told a Senate committee on Tuesday that of the 34,000 square miles of territory that IS once held, it now controls less than 20 square miles. \u201cIt is important to understand that even though this territory has been reclaimed, the fight against ISIS and violent extremists is not over and our mission has not changed,\u201d Votel, commander of U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, in an appearance on CNN, makes another pitch for Donald Trump\u2019s proposed deal to trade temporary protections for young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children for his border wall. She blasted Democrats for choosing not to counter the offer, which they quickly rejected. \u201cNo\u2019 is not a counter-proposal. It\u2019s a child-like response,\u201d she said, adding of Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comment that she would offer \u201cone dollar\u201d for the wall, \u201cIt\u2019s actually an insult to our border patrol agents.\u201d Conway said that Trump would be willing to call his wall a fence or anything else in order to get Democratic support, a point Trump has changed his stance on repeatedly. Democrats, she said, have gotten \u201ctongue tied\u201d in discussing the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re trying to say Wawa, my favorite store,\u201d she said. \u201cCall it what you want, but get it done.\u201d Asked about Donald Trump\u2019s golf clubs\u2019 own employment of many undocumented immigrants - at least 18 of whom have been recently fired, according to the Washington Post - she offered little defense and instead tried to change the subject to Democrats troubles in Virginia. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, in a speech on the Senate floor, says Donald Trump\u2019s economy and healthcare system are failing Americans, while the state of his administration is chaos. Trump shoots back that Schumer is \u201cjust upset that he didn\u2019t win the Senate, after spending a fortune, like he thought he would.\u201d Many observers have noted the irony of the attack, coming as the White House has pledged a speech focused on unity. From the Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden in Washington: A Senate committee advanced the nomination of Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, to run the Environmental Protection Agency. In a party line vote, Republicans sent the nomination to a final vote on the Senate floor. Wheeler, formerly the deputy administrator, has been running the agency since Scott Pruitt stepped down amid myriad ethics scandals. Wheeler has continued many of the same priorities Pruitt pursued to roll back environment and climate regulations and to ease pollution rules for industry. In his recent confirmation hearing, he downplayedthe severity of man-made climate change. \u201cIn many instances Mr. Wheeler has gone further than his predecessor in his rejection of important measures that are supported by environmentalists and industry,\u201d said the Senate environment panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, Tom Carper. Carper urged Republicans to slow down the confirmation process to examine some of Wheeler\u2019s proposals to amend rules for mercury emissions from power plants and pollution from cars. BuzzFeed News has published a cache of internal Trump Organization documents detailing negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. From the report: The documents, many of which have been exclusively obtained by BuzzFeed News, reveal that \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s claim that the development was never more than a passing notion \u2014 the effort to get the tower built was long-running, detail-oriented and directly entwined with the ups and downs of his campaign. As Trump went from rally to rally, vociferously denying any dealings in Russia, his representatives, Michael Cohen and his associate Felix Sater, worked with Trump Organization lawyers and even Ivanka Trump to push forward negotiations to build a 100-story edifice just miles from the Kremlin. The fixers believed they needed Putin\u2019s support to pull off the lucrative deal, and they planned to use Trump\u2019s public praise for him to help secure it. At the same time, they plotted to persuade Putin to openly declare his support for Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cIf he says it we own this election,\u201d Sater wrote to Cohen. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggests her supporters may want to skip watching tonight\u2019s State of the Union speech. Senator Richard Blumenthal plans to vote against the confirmation of William Barr, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general. The nomination is expected to come up in the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday. \u201cI will vote against his nomination in committee on Thursday,\u201d Blumenthal said, according to the Hill. He cited Barr\u2019s refusal to commit to releasing the full report of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference and the potential of collusion with Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe defining question for me was his declining to commit to release the Special Counsel\u2019s report fully and completely,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cHe chose not to make the commitment to release that report completely and directly to Congress and the American people.\u201d Donald Trump has a new idea - a \u201cHuman Wall\u201d to secure the southern border. Presumably such a \u201cwall\u201d would be made up of military troops. Democrats are spotlighting climate change with a number of their State of the Union guests, the Washington Post reports. Longtime climate activist Bill McKibben was invited by Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin. Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, will attend as the guest of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey. University of Washington professor Lisa Graumlich, a pioneer in using tree rings to understand climate trends, was invited by Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the Post reports. \u201cInstead of tackling the problem head-on, President Trump is burying his head in the sand and handing out favors to his friends in the coal industry,\u201d Jayapal said. The Trump administration has a plan in place to fight expected efforts by Congressional Democrats to get ahold of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, Politico reports. Federal law gives three Congressional committees - including the House Ways and Means Committee, now controlled by Democrats - the power to obtain the tax filings of any individual or business from the Internal Revenue Service. That includes Trump, who unlike every other presidential nominee in modern history refused to make his taxes public. A vote by the committee and the full House could then make the tax returns public. But the Treasury Department does not plan to give them up without a fight, according to the Politico report. They plan to use legal maneuvers to delay the release, while arguing publicly that the request is a partisan exercise. Donald Trump is \u201cas committed today as he\u2019s ever been to border security\u201d, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told CNN this morning. Asked about the president\u2019s State of the Union address tonight, Sanders said observers would have to wait and see on the content of the speech, but on border security she pledged that the president is \u201cnot gonna stop until we fix this problem\u201d. Crime will only fall if we \u201chave real border security and that includes the wall\u201d, Sanders said. Asked whether the structure is \u201ca wall or fence\u201d \u2013 Trump last week returned to saying wall, having previously suggested the wall could be a barrier, or a fence, Sanders said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is a steel barrier that you can see through.\u201d Of the subpoena issued to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee this morning, Sanders insisted: \u201cThis has nothing to do with the White House.\u201d She blamed \u201chysteria over the fact this president became president\u201d for the multiple investigations into the Trump campaign and people in his orbit. Regarding the Mueller investigation and whether Trump would commit to releasing the final report, Sanders said the White House was \u201cgoing to let [his] attorneys figure it out\u201d. Donald Trump is expected to pick Treasury Department official David Malpass to head the World Bank, Politico reports. The choice is a clear sign the Trump administration is looking to rein in international financial institutions, according to Politico. Malpass has been critical of the World Bank, global organizations like it \u201chave grown larger and more intrusive\u201d and \u201cthe challenge of refocusing them has become urgent and more difficult.\u201d The US has traditionally been allowed to choose the leader of the World Bank, but a pick like Malpass could generate opposition. A top aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told health insurance executives that Democratic leadership has deep reservations about single payer healthcare, the Intercept reports. Wendell Primus, Pelosi\u2019s top healthcare adviser, met with Blue Cross Blue Shield executives in December and told them Democrats were more focused on lowering prescription drug prices, rather than pushing for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d as some progressives would prefer. He told them Democrats were wary of single payer because of its huge cost, the widespread opposition it would generate, and the difficulties of implementing it, according to the Intercept report. Good morning. Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union speech tonight, where we\u2019ll be listening to see if he makes any news on how he plans to force through a wall on the US-Mexico border. Will he declare a national emergency, or force another government shutdown when the current three week federal spending bill expires? Trump will address a more hostile audience this year, with a Democratic-controlled House and a record number of female lawmakers. In the gallery overhead there will be two former employees of Trump\u2019s New Jersey golf club, both immigrant women who have gone public about its hiring practices. A number of other lawmakers are bringing as guests immigrants who were separated from their families at the border, and other guests intended as shots across the bow at Trump. Trump will have guests of his own, and First Lady Melania Trump is bringing an 11-year-old boy named Joshua Trump who has been bullied because of his last name. Donald Trump is expected in his speech tonight to announce a push to end transmissions of HIV by 2030. It\u2019s one section of his agenda that could draw bipartisan support. The plan calls for more funding for AIDS prevention and treatment, the Washington Post reports. Meanwhile, Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of Health and Human Services who has been working on the project, is giving a keynote speech at the American Public Health Association this morning where he may provide some details.",

      "bodyText": "Labor has endorsed a push to extend the encryption legislation\u2019s powers to state anti-corruption bodies after a last-minute carve-out to exclude them put the Morrison government at odds with the home affairs department. The department has argued it is \u201cinconsistent\u201d for bodies such as the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption to have powers to intercept electronic messages but prevent them from obtaining technical assistance to read them. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told Guardian Australia that Labor had offered to extend the industry assistance powers provided the commonwealth ombudsman had oversight. Those powers allow law enforcement agencies to order or request technology companies to build capabilities or help crack encryption or access suspects\u2019 devices and data. \u201cUnfortunately, due to the government\u2019s insistence on an urgent timetable, this issue was not adequately addressed by the intelligence committee\u2019s rushed report or by the government\u2019s hastily prepared amendments,\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cAs a matter of principle, Labor believes that state and territory anti-corruption bodies should have the same investigatory powers as the agencies that they are often tasked with investigating. \u201cLabor expects that the extension of these powers to state and territory anti-corruption bodies will be examined by the intelligence committee as it continues its inquiries.\u201d Labor passed the telecommunications (access and assistance) bill in the last sitting of parliament in 2018, after the Morrison government said law enforcement agencies urgently needed its new powers and promised to consider Labor amendments in 2019. Labor\u2019s cooperation came after a last-minute blow-up, with the government and opposition at odds over whose amendments better reflected a bipartisan parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security report. Although extending the bill\u2019s powers to anti-corruption bodies is not one of the Labor amendments before the committee, it was supported by the home affairs department and the NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission. The commission \u2013 which oversees misconduct by law enforcement agencies \u2013 submitted that it relies on telecommunications interception warrants but 93% of communications it intercepts are encrypted. It said the committee had not explained the rationale for carving out state and territory anti-corruption bodies. It warned the carve-out left it unable to use new powers to investigate serious crimes by police who are \u201cwell versed in investigative methods\u201d. \u201cThe exclusion of [the commission] \u2026 may well encourage corrupt police to use encrypted communications with confidence and encourage police corruption more broadly.\u201d",

Vice-president Mike Pence smiled with all the sincerity that his android builders had hardwired into his circuit boards. House speaker Nancy Pelosi puckered up like she was enduring a full gallon of fresh lemons. The Trump doctrine, such as it is, found its fullest expression in the carefully crafted \u2013 and sometimes rhythmically rhyming \u2013 phrases that tripped and slipped from Trump\u2019s lips. Channeling his inner Charlie Sheen, and as much tiger blood as courses through his veins he insisted \u201cAmerica is winning each and every day\u201d. But wait. There are clouds on the horizon: strange celestial illuminations that portend no good. They could imperil us all, or perhaps just those among us who go by the name of Trump. \u201cAn economic miracle is taking place in the United States \u2013 and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations,\u201d said the Trump patriarch. \u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.\u201d As rhyming slogans go, this is notch below \u201cBUILD A WALL &amp; CRIME WILL FALL!\u201d But in terms of proto-national emergencies, Mueller\u2019s many-headed investigations and indictments are far more pressing to this president than the one he\u2019s faking at the border. Which helps explain his curious choice of guest: a schoolboy who shares his last name and has been sadly mistreated by his school friends as a result. The whole schtick about inviting guests to a state of the union is to open the aperture to the world outside. In Trump\u2019s case, the world outside extends to people with the same name suffering from his own reputation. Let\u2019s face it. The state of the union bores President Trump as much as he bored us while delivering it. All that time wasted talking about the state of the union, when he really wanted to talk about the state of Trump. Perhaps he could rebrand it in time for his final delivery next year.

He has not ruled out supporting a motion to extend the pre-election sitting schedule. The threat of Labor and the independents forcing the government\u2019s hand comes as the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, suggested the banks could be too profitable. Fronting the National Press Club on Wednesday, Lowe noted Australian banks \u201cstill have higher returns on equity than many international banks\u201d and added: \u201cI don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s sustainable.\u201d He said financial institutions in Australia had been \u201cvery profitable for decades and when you are very profitable you probably don\u2019t do as much introspection as you probably should\u201d.

The prime minister has already rejected calls from Bill Shorten to extend the sitting calendar beyond the set fortnight February sitting and the budget sitting in April, with Morrison instead urging Labor to back existing banking reforms already before the parliament. But if Katter sides with Labor and the crossbench, the government could lose control of its sitting calendar as well, adding to the pressure facing the minority government. As one of seven crossbenchers, Katter\u2019s vote becomes crucial, as it gives Labor the absolute majority it needs to win a motion for additional sitting days. An outspoken supporter of the banking royal commission, Katter, who has promised the government supply, and usually abstains from what he considers \u201cpolitical games\u201d, made a point of saying he would not rule out his support to force parliament to sit longer, in order to deal with the substantive banking royal commission reforms. Currently dealing with the Townsville floods which have inundated his electorate, a spokeswoman for Katter told Guardian Australia the Queensland MP was considering the option and would consult with his crossbench colleagues and \u201cothers\u201d early next week. Katter had previously pushed for a \u201cshadow\u201d sitting of parliament in November 2017, when the Turnbull government cancelled a scheduled sitting in the wake of the section 44 constitutional crisis. Cathy McGowan\u2019s spokeswoman pointed to the Indi MP\u2019s vote in the House in November, when she supported Labor\u2019s attempts to extend the calendar, while Adam Bandt and Phelps also said they would vote yes. Andrew Wilkie said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d support an extension, while both Julia Banks and Rebehka Sharkie are also understood to be looking favourably at the move. While sitting weeks are scheduled beyond the 2 April budget week, they are unlikely to be held, with the election expected to be called just after the budget is delivered, with the likely poll date either 11 or 18 May. The government only just managed to have its original sitting calendar passed in November last year, winning the vote by one, 72 to 71. Labor is eyeing off resuming that fight, with Shorten having written to Morrison on Tuesday to request March sitting weeks. \u201cOver the past 24 hours, treasurer Frydenberg has appeared to use the small number of remaining sitting days as an excuse to delay legislative changes.

      "bodyText": "The R&amp;B singer R Kelly, who is facing multiple accusations of sexual abuse, has announced a tour to Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka, prompting concern from members of the public and some MPs. The tour, which was announced in social media posts from the singer \u2013 but was accompanied by no dates or venues \u2013 comes in the wake of an explosive documentary detailing allegations that the artist has been sexually and physically abusing women for decades. R Kelly has denied the allegations, and has faced no criminal convictions. The Australian shadow minister for immigration and border protection, Shayne Neumann, has said the Labor party would be \u201cseriously concerned\u201d if Kelly was allowed into the country. In January, a previously announced February tour of Australasia fell by the wayside, after Kelly claimed that the tour news was \u201cfake\u201d, and the promoter abandoned it. \u201cWatch my social media ... when it\u2019s time for my next international tour (which is soon) you\u2019ll hear it directly from me,\u201d Kelly said in an Instagram post in December. The promoter of the February tour, Big Music Tour, alleged that the tour had been organised, but that after it was announced \u201cother Australian promoters\u201d began presenting \u201chigher fees\u201d to Kelly and his manager. A company spokesperson told Fairfax in January that they had been \u201cworking on a solution\u201d to move forward with the tour when the explosive documentary, Surviving R Kelly, was released \u2013 causing them to pull back completely. \u201cGiven the current situation in R Kelly\u2019s personal life and the controversy surrounding him, the promoters have decided not to move forward and are focusing on other events,\u201d they said. The new tour was announced on Wednesday on the artist\u2019s Twitter, Facebook and Instagram pages. The promoter, Flamingo Dreamz, did not respond to Guardian\u2019s request for comment. In a statement, Australia\u2019s shadow immigration minister said: \u201cLabor strongly supports the refusal or cancellation of visas of non-citizens on character or criminal grounds \u2026 Labor would be seriously concerned if immigration minister David Coleman would allow an individual such as R Kelly into Australia. \u201cIf the immigration minister suspects that a non-citizen does not pass the character test, or there is a risk to the community while they are in Australia, he should use the powers he has under the Migration Act to deny or cancel their visa.\u201d A spokesperson for Australia\u2019s home affairs department said that it did not comment on individual cases but added: \u201cAll non-citizens entering Australia must meet, and continue to meet, the character requirements set out in the Migration Act 1958 (the Act). There are strong provisions under the Act to refuse or cancel a visa where a person is found not to be of good character.\u201d The Australian government has previously denied visas to Chris Brown and Floyd Mayweather following similar allegations of violence against women. A spokesperson for Immigration NZ said they had not received an application for a visa by R Kelly, but performers from visa waiver countries such as the United States did not have to apply in advance. \u201cHowever, some performers are required to apply for a visitor visa prior to travelling due to character issues,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIn general, character issues are typically existing charges or previous convictions related to offences such as robbery, sexual or common assault, or possession/use of drugs, firearms, weapons.\u201d Kelly is scheduled to perform two shows in Germany in April; a Change.org petition, signed by more than 22,000 people, is calling for these gigs to be cancelled. While the documentary Surviving R Kelly \u2013 and renewed calls by activists to #MuteRKelly \u2013 have led to widespread outrage against him, the artist has not been convicted of any crimes. Kelly has, however, been quietly dropped by his label \u2013 and last week Philadelphia passed a bill symbolically banning him from the city. Last year New Zealand\u2019s biggest hip-hop radio station, Flava, pulled its support for R Kelly and any possible tour after receiving a torrent of complaints and concerns from listeners. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of domestic and sexual violence against women in the developed world. \u201cWe hear you, and whilst he is a massive artist, you are right \u2013 all the other stuff around him is not part of what Flava is about and we cannot and will not support this show,\u201d Flava wrote on Twitter at the time.",

In a statement early on Wednesday, the Thai foreign affairs ministry defended Thailand\u2019s continuing detention of al-Araibi, a Bahraini refugee who is a resident of Australia. Australia has demanded his release and return. He was formally granted refugee status in 2017. Bahrain is seeking his extradition for a 10-year jail sentence which al-Araibi claims is politically motivated. \u201cThailand hopes that Australia and Bahrain will have the goodwill to earnestly work together towards finding a win-win solution to this issue,\u201d the ministry\u2019s statement said. \u201cThailand does not gain anything from holding Mr Hakeem in custody.

Australian federal police, acting as the Australian branch of Interpol, has been criticised for apparently failing to notice al-Araibi\u2019s refugee status when it notified Thailand of his imminent arrival. The red notice was cancelled within days, but Thailand said because Bahrain had also made a formal extradition request he could not be released. International condemnation of al-Araibi\u2019s treatment has focused on Thailand\u2019s role, particularly since it was confirmed the government has the power to release him. The statement said the \u201cexecutive branch cannot interfere with the judicial process\u201d. The ministry said it had not been aware of al-Araibi\u2019s case and would not have become involved had it not received the red notice alert and Bahrain\u2019s subsequent arrest and extradition request. \u201cIt took several days after the arrival of Mr Hakeem before the Australian authorities informed us that the red notice had been cancelled,\u201d it said. \u201cBy that time legal proceedings in Thailand \u2026 could not be reversed.\u201d However, al-Araibi supporters have questioned the timeline of his travel, and whether it was coincidentce that Bahrain requested and received its red notice at the same time he organised to travel to Thailand, despite his conviction being five years old by that time.

On Monday the Thai criminal court gave al-Araibi\u2019s lawyers 60 days to prepare a defence to Bahrain\u2019s request and refused bail. The statement maintained the legitimacy of Bahrain\u2019s arrest warrant and conviction of al-Araibi \u2013 a widely discredited verdict delivered in absentia over an act of vandalism which occurred when, or very shortly after, al-Araibi was playing in a televised football match. \u201cWe ask that everyone refrain from prejudging the court\u2019s rulings and prematurely jumping to the conclusion that Thailand will extradite Mr Hakeem back to Bahrain,\u201d it said. \u201cThe court will consider this case thoroughly and in accordance with the due process of law and the evidence provided, including Bahrain\u2019s arrest warrant and court order for Mr Hakeem, who had been convicted under Bahraini laws.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One of Australia\u2019s biggest political donors, Huang Xiangmo, has been denied re-entry into the country after his bid for citizenship was blocked and his permanent residency was cancelled, leaving him unable to return to his Sydney home. Huang, who rose to public notice after donating nearly $3m to Australia\u2019s major political parties, had his application for Australian citizenship turned down, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The paper also said Huang\u2019s permanent residency had been cancelled and the home affairs department had cancelled his Australian passport while he was out of the country. Huang, who founded the Chinese property developer Yuhu, has not been able to return to his multimillion-dollar Mosman home where he has lived with his family since 2011. In a statement, Yuhu Group Australia said Huang \u201cno longer holds any position at the company, is not involved in day-to-day operations, nor does he hold any shares\u201d. The department, the prime minister\u2019s office and Huang have been contacted for comment. In late 2017 the Labor senator Sam Dastyari was forced to resign after a series of revelations about his contact with Chinese donors after it emerged he had warned the Communist party-linked Huang in 2016 that he was probably under surveillance by government agencies. The ABC revealed Dastyari\u2019s office had asked the then immigration department \u2013 now part of home affairs \u2013 about Huang\u2019s delayed citizenship application, which had reportedly been stalled by Asio because of his links with China\u2019s ruling party. It was Dastyari\u2019s involvement with Chinese donors that prompted the government to launch its anti-foreign interference crackdown, sparking a fight which spilled into the Bennelong byelection and beyond, leaving relations between the two countries tense. Australia\u2019s position on the militarisation of the South China sea further inflamed the situation. In May 2018 China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, warned Australia to remove its \u201ccoloured glasses\u201d in its dealings with China. But the decision to cancel Huang\u2019s passport is believed to be one of the first major pushbacks Australia has made against China since passing the anti-interference legislation last year. Both major parties have been facing pressure to return the $2.7m Huang has given them in the past five years. His donation of $1.8m was also instrumental in establishing the Australia-China Relations Institute, run by a former foreign minister, Bob Carr, out of the University of Technology, Sydney. Huang had also donated $3.5m to establish the Australia-China Institute of Arts and Culture at the University of Western Sydney. The Liberal MP Andrew Hastie, who chairs the joint parliamentary intelligence and security committee, returned a $10,000 donation Huang had made to his campaign last year.

      "bodyText": "When word spread last week that Darren Weir\u2019s stables had been raided by police, it came of little surprise to most inside in the racing industry. Whispers had been circulating for months, years even, about what was happening behind the scenes at Forest Lodge. Weir\u2019s arrest and subsequent release from the Ballarat West Police Station has filled column inches ever since, but there are still many troubling uncertainties as a result of the pending action. What is certain is that Weir will not be allowed to train racehorses for a long time \u2013 four years following Wednesday\u2019s decision by the Racing Appeals and Disciplinary Board. That is the immediate consequence for Weir \u2013 a one-time battler from the bush who trained 489 winners last season. But a battler he is no more. Horses prepared by Weir in 2017-18 earned a collective $31.3m in prizemoney \u2013 $3m directly in Weir\u2019s pocket from the 10% return of winnings. That\u2019s not including his training fees paid by thousands of racehorse owners who thought they were having their four-legged investments prepared by a genius. And that\u2019s where the ripple effect begins. Questions are now being asked of his legitimacy as a horse trainer. Was he really the greatest horseman this country has produced in the modern era, or was he breaking the rules? The most obvious impact of Weir\u2019s impending ban will be the horses currently registered in his name as a trainer. All will have to be transferred to a new trainer \u2013 many already have.

      "bodyText": "Football Federation Australia has cancelled a planned Under-23s training trip to Thailand in the first instance of sporting sanctions being imposed against the Asian country amid growing calls for the release of refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi. Socceroos coach Graham Arnold said Australian national teams stood with al-Araibi, who faces a further two months in a Thai jail before discovering his fate. He is fighting an extradition order to send him back to Bahrain, where he fears he will be imprisoned and tortured, as he alleges occurred in 2012. Preliminary plans had been put in place by FFA last year to play a friendly against China in Bangkok as part of the Olyroos\u2019 preparations for the AFC Under-23 Championship qualifiers to be held in Cambodia in March, but alternatives are now being sought. \u201cOn our return from the recent AFC Asian Cup we reassessed our plans due to the ongoing detainment of Australian footballer Hakeem al-Araibi in a Thai prison,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWe are in the process of rearranging our pre-tournament camp in another Asian nation. Australia\u2019s national teams are united in their support for Hakeem al-Araibi and we call on the community to continue to campaign for his release.\u201d The move comes amid increasing pressure on Thailand to release al-Araibi and allow him to return to Australia, where he plays semi-professional football for Victorian side Pascoe Vale. Supporters of al-Araibi have stepped up calls for sanctions and boycotts \u2013 primarily imposed by world sporting bodies such as Fifa and the International Olympic Committee \u2013 against Bahrain and Thailand. On Tuesday, Australia Super Rugby club Melbourne Rebels faced stiff backlash on social media after announcing a sponsorship deal with Thai Airways. The club was accused of being \u201ctone deaf\u201d and \u201cfailing to \u201cread the room\u201d. It later apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d for any offence caused and said the club stood in full support of al-Araibi\u2019s cause and will use its new relationship to engage with the airline directly. There have also been calls to boycott Thailand in a bid to affect its tourism industry. On Tuesday FFA pledged $10,000 to kick-start fundraising efforts to help continue the global advocacy campaign to return al-Araibi to Australia. The Olyroos were scheduled to arrive for the training camp in Bangkok on 11 March, ahead of two friendly games on 14 and 17 March. They were then to fly to Cambodia for the qualifying tournament. Al-Araibi, barefoot and in shackles, appeared at the Ratchadaphisek criminal court on Monday, when he was given 60 days to prepare a defence to Bahrain\u2019s extradition order. The Bahraini government bases its extradition request on an act of vandalism which occurred when, or very shortly after, he was playing in a televised football match, but al-Araibi believes it is attempted political retribution. It has been confirmed the Thai authorities have the power to release al-Araibi and return him to Australia at any time before the 60-day deadline.",

      "bodyText": "Two people have escaped immediate deportation to Jamaica after 11th-hour interventions by their lawyers as the Home Office was accused of trying to remove people while their applications to remain in the UK under the Windrush scheme were still being considered. Lascelles White, 61, moved to the UK from the Caribbean in 1973 when he was five years old. He has applied to regularise his status under the Windrush scheme but has not received a response. Instead he was detained and was facing deportation on a charter flight to Jamaica thought to be taking off as early as Wednesday. White\u2019s solicitor, Connie Sozi from Deighton Pierce Glynn, made an urgent out-of-hours application to the high court to try to prevent his deportation and on Tuesday night, as the judge was considering the application, the Home Office informed Sozi that White would no longer be put on the flight. \u201cI submitted a letter before claim stating that Lascelles should not be removed before his application to remain in the UK under the Windrush scheme has been considered,\u201d said Sozi. \u201cThis issue does not just affect my client, but potentially others on the charter flight. If people have a legal right to be in the UK then they have that right, irrespective of whether they have criminal convictions. The home secretary is potentially removing Windrush people \u2026 who have a legal right to be here. There appears to be a systemic failure on the part of the Home Office to consider Windrush applications before trying to remove people.\u201d Christopher Richards, who is a witness in the inquest of Carlington Spencer, an immigration detainee who died in 2017, also learned on Tuesday that his deportation has been deferred by the Home Office following last-minute legal representations by his solicitor Imogen Townley at Wilsons solicitors. Home secretary Sajid Javid told parliament on Tuesday: \u201cNone of those being deported are British citizens or members of the Windrush generation.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday Labour MP David Lammy criticised the decision to restart mass deportation flights back to the Caribbean before the publication of an independent investigation into what had caused the Windrush scandal. \u201cHow can you be confident that you are not making the same mistakes?\u201d he asked. Lammy accused the government of \u201cpandering to far-right racism\u201d and lashed out at the Home Office in the House of Commons, saying that incompetence had \u201ckilled\u201d at least 11 people who had been wrongly deported back to the Caribbean. The deaths were a \u201cshocking indictment of your government\u2019s pandering to a far-right racism, sham immigration targets and a dog-whistle to the right-wing press,\u201d he said. He told Javid that the decision to send around 50 people back to Jamaica in the next few days \u2013 possibly as soon as Wednesday \u2013 was an indication that \u201cin this country black lives matter less\u201d. Outlining details of those people expected to be on the deportation flight, Lammy said that 13 came to the UK as children, nine arrived under the age of 10, 11 had indefinite leave to remain and one has a British passport. \u201cThirty-six British children will have their parents taken away by this charter flight.

Under Grayling, in 2013, the ministry created 21 community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) to manage low- and medium-risk offenders with the aim of cutting reoffending rates and costs.

The UK government has awarded contracts to three firms as it seeks to bypass congestion it predicts will mount up in Calais as a result of extra customs checks, which ministers believe will need to be carried out following a no-deal Brexit. Without contingency plans, the government fears deliveries of food and medicine could be delayed. Puissesseau has previously insisted no such disruption is likely because Calais has been planning for a no-deal Brexit for a year. In January, he told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s not true that there will not be more delay \u2026 The only thing we will be asking of the driver is that they have their customs declarations, but we will not stop and ask more than we are doing today.\u201d Speaking to the Telegraph on Tuesday, he added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for Brexit, but we have spent the money for traffic to flow regularly.\u201d Puissesseau has not been the only one to express displeasure at the UK government\u2019s plans. Jacques Gounon, the chief executive of Eurotunnel\u2019s parent company, has said the awarding of the ferry operator contracts was \u201cdistortionary and anti-competitive\u201d and would be a \u201cunilateral breach not only of the concession agreement with Eurotunnel, but more widely of existing competition and state aid law\u201d. It has been reported that the government plans to pay a law firm \u00a3800,000 for advice in anticipation of a legal action brought by the company. Reacting to Puissesseau\u2019s comments on Tuesday, the Labour MP and supporter of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, Virendra Sharma, said: \u201cSurely this is peak Chris Grayling, only this time he\u2019s gone international. All he needs to do now is release a statement blaming everyone else and his predictable path of chaos will be complete.\u201d A Department for Transport spokesman said: \u201cWhile the transport secretary strongly supports work across government with the EU to ensure a deal is reached, he will also continue to lead the DfT to ensure all contingencies are prepared for concerning Brexit.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Global tobacco companies should be paying more UK corporation tax, according to a report that claims they are not contributing their fair share despite making massive profits. Academics at the University of Bath found that the four largest cigarette companies pay hundreds of millions of pounds in tax overseas but consistently pay less than the headline rate of UK corporation tax. The companies, which disputed the report\u2019s findings, include Gauloises-maker Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco (BAT), owner of Camel and Lucky Strike. According to the report, Imperial Brands, BAT and Gallaher, a subsidiary of Japan Tobacco International (JTI), made UK operating profits of more than \u00a31bn between them in 2016 but paid \u00a383.6m combined, a rate of less than 10%. It says identifying the right amount of tax that tobacco firms should be paying was difficult and relied partly on estimates owing to \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d standards of financial reporting that made it impossible to determine companies\u2019 taxable UK profit. The authors said their analysis indicated that taxation rules should be reformed. \u201cThe UK needs better reporting and corporate taxation standards,\u201d they said, adding that firms should have to report all measures of profit in every country where they operate. The report also called for tobacco companies to be hit with a tax surcharge similar to the one applied to banks, which pay an extra 8% on profits above \u00a325m. \u201cThe lack of tax revenue generated from such a profitable industry, together with reports of firms in other industries being similarly positioned (16-20), suggests that UK corporation tax policy needs urgent reform to make sure all firms pay meaningful amounts,\u201d the report says. A spokesperson for Imperial Brands said the report made a number of estimates that the company did not recognise, adding that Imperial paid corporation tax of \u00a350m in 2018 and billions when including tobacco excise duty. \u201cOur total tax contribution in the UK is approximately \u00a34.5bn annually, making us one of the highest UK tax contributors,\u201d the company said. JTI said it paid all taxes that were due, including \u00a3138m in corporation tax from 2013-17 and \u00a33.7bn in excise duty. BAT said it had reduced its tax liabilities by putting \u00a3500m into its pension scheme between 2011 and 2016. \u201cIn 2017, once we take account of everything we do in the UK our UK corporation tax payment totalled \u00a326m,\u201d it said.",

Ministers could also reduce the impact with tax cuts and additional public spending, further limiting the damage.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s oldest independent economics research institute \u2013 in forecasts likely to embolden Brexit supporters urging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> to pursue a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/06/managed-no-deal-brexit-brexiteers\">managed no-deal</a>\u201d \u2013 said that economic growth would come close to zero in the first two years after a no-deal Brexit. However, it would avoid the recession that has been forecast by some experts.</p> <p>Although warning that every Brexit outcome would still be worse for the UK economy than remaining in the EU, it said there was sufficient headroom for the government to stabilise the economy in the short term.</p> <p>\u201cWere the UK to exit the EU without a deal in March, we would expect a sharper slowdown in economic activity than in the central case,\u201d NIESR said in a report published on Wednesday, adding: \u201cHow much the economy responds would depend on the extent to which policy steps in and eases the transition.\u201d</p> <p>The report comes after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/28/bank-of-england-says-no-deal-brexit-would-be-worse-than-2008-crisis\">Bank of England warned that Britain could plunge straight into a recession</a> worse than the one that immediately followed the financial crisis 10 years ago, a scenario which has been used by the prime minister as a warning to MPs to vote for her EU withdrawal agreement to avoid inflicting significant damage on the economy.</p> <p>While some measures have been proposed by both Britain and the EU to offset the impact of a no-deal scenario, many analysts warn that time is running out and that they may not be agreed upon in time.</p> <p>Although a recession would be avoided under the no-deal scenario put forward by the NIESR, GDP growth over the long run would remain below the level forecast should the prime minister secure a deal with Brussels. It also said it was still its central estimate that a deal could be agreed, leading to growth of about 1.5% this year.</p> <p>However, offering a possible route-map for a no-deal scenario, the NIESR analysis said that additional support could be put in place by ministers and the Bank of England to curb the short-term impact to the economy.</p> <p>Interest rates could be held steady at the current level of 0.75%, rather than raised, while measures could be taken to provide direct support to household income, including income tax cuts and higher benefits payments.</p> <p>Such interventions would, however, come with a cost. The NIESR report said unfurling such a package could add as much as \u00a360bn to government borrowing by 2023-24. It also warned that inflation could accelerate, eroding real wages and acting as a brake on the economy in future.</p> <p>Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomics at NIESR, said: \u201cAll this is not to say there will not be long-term economic costs. Those costs remain intact. These are just mitigating measures.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst it does make headlines or sensational news to suggest the economy will go into recession or not, I don\u2019t think economists have the tools to be that precise. The big picture is I think there really will be a material slowdown,\u201d he added.</p>",

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the blow to the economy from a disorderly departure from the EU could be softened by contingency plans being put in place by the government and by Brussels. Ministers could also reduce the impact with tax cuts and additional public spending, further limiting the damage. Britain\u2019s oldest independent economics research institute \u2013 in forecasts likely to embolden Brexit supporters urging Theresa May to pursue a \u201cmanaged no-deal\u201d \u2013 said that economic growth would come close to zero in the first two years after a no-deal Brexit. However, it would avoid the recession that has been forecast by some experts. Although warning that every Brexit outcome would still be worse for the UK economy than remaining in the EU, it said there was sufficient headroom for the government to stabilise the economy in the short term. \u201cWere the UK to exit the EU without a deal in March, we would expect a sharper slowdown in economic activity than in the central case,\u201d NIESR said in a report published on Wednesday, adding: \u201cHow much the economy responds would depend on the extent to which policy steps in and eases the transition.\u201d The report comes after the Bank of England warned that Britain could plunge straight into a recession worse than the one that immediately followed the financial crisis 10 years ago, a scenario which has been used by the prime minister as a warning to MPs to vote for her EU withdrawal agreement to avoid inflicting significant damage on the economy. While some measures have been proposed by both Britain and the EU to offset the impact of a no-deal scenario, many analysts warn that time is running out and that they may not be agreed upon in time. Although a recession would be avoided under the no-deal scenario put forward by the NIESR, GDP growth over the long run would remain below the level forecast should the prime minister secure a deal with Brussels. It also said it was still its central estimate that a deal could be agreed, leading to growth of about 1.5% this year. However, offering a possible route-map for a no-deal scenario, the NIESR analysis said that additional support could be put in place by ministers and the Bank of England to curb the short-term impact to the economy. Interest rates could be held steady at the current level of 0.75%, rather than raised, while measures could be taken to provide direct support to household income, including income tax cuts and higher benefits payments. Such interventions would, however, come with a cost. The NIESR report said unfurling such a package could add as much as \u00a360bn to government borrowing by 2023-24. It also warned that inflation could accelerate, eroding real wages and acting as a brake on the economy in future. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomics at NIESR, said: \u201cAll this is not to say there will not be long-term economic costs. Those costs remain intact. These are just mitigating measures. \u201cWhilst it does make headlines or sensational news to suggest the economy will go into recession or not, I don\u2019t think economists have the tools to be that precise. The big picture is I think there really will be a material slowdown,\u201d he added.",

Ideally, that means that people who like cooking videos see more cooking videos, and people who like board games see more board games.</p> <p>But the same systems have also acted to promote the worst sides of their users. Someone who searches for content relating to depression or self-harm, for instance, may find their recommendations become overrun with more of the same, pushing them in a destructive spiral.</p> <h2>What has Instagram done in response?</h2> <p>The app\u2019s head, Adam Mosseri, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/04/instagram-to-launch-sensitivity-screens-after-molly-russell-death\">said yesterday that</a> he was \u201cdeeply moved\u201d by Molly\u2019s story and acknowledged his platform was \u201cnot yet where [it] needs to be\u201d on the issues of suicide and self-harm.</p> <p>Mosseri, who ran the Facebook News Feed before being promoted to his current role in 2018, said that the encouragement of suicide and self-harm was banned on the site, but admitted that Instagram relies on users to report the content before it is purged.</p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is we do not yet find enough of these images before they\u2019re seen by other people,\u201d he added.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/04/instagram-to-launch-sensitivity-screens-after-molly-russell-death\">Mosseri also pledged to do more to hide imagery that wasn\u2019t banned on the site</a>, but which may have harmful effects if stumbled upon accidentally, such as imagery that shows, without encouraging, self-harm.</p> <h2>What is the government threatening to do?</h2> <p>Ministers are talking about redefining the role of social networks to hold them directly liable for the content that gets published on their platforms, in effect enshrining them as publishers in law.</p> <p>The digital minister, Margot James, is expected to announce proposals to crack down on the companies, saying that the government will introduce laws that force social media platforms to remove illegal content, and to prioritise the protection of users beyond their commercial interests.</p> <p>Meanwhile, parliament has also been suggesting its own form of regulation. Last week, the science and technology committee concluded that social media companies must be subject to a legal duty of care to help protect young people\u2019s health and wellbeing when accessing their sites.</p> <p>Norman Lamb, the committee\u2019s chair, said that \u201csocial media companies \u2013 who have a clear responsibility towards particularly young users \u2013 seem to be in no rush to share vital data with academics that could help tackle the very real harms our young people face in the virtual world.\u201d</p> <h2>What are the actual effects of social media on self-harm?</h2> <p>The evidence is patchy.</p> <p>One UK study found self-harm in girls aged 13-16 rose 68% from 2011 to 2014, a period that mirrors a boom in social media usage. But the authors from the University of Manchester warned more research was necessary to attribute a cause and they suggested it could partly reflect girls being more willing to talk.</p> <p>Another study led by the University of Oxford said moderate use could be beneficial but extreme usage may have a minor negative influence, pointing towards limiting adolescents\u2019 technology use.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

Last month, her father, Ian Russell, said he had \u201cno doubt Instagram helped kill my daughter\u201d, blaming algorithms used by the platform for enabling her to view more harmful content. Why are algorithms being blamed? Many social networks, including Instagram, Pinterest and YouTube, automatically curate what they show visitors in order to personalise the site. Ideally, that means that people who like cooking videos see more cooking videos, and people who like board games see more board games. But the same systems have also acted to promote the worst sides of their users. Someone who searches for content relating to depression or self-harm, for instance, may find their recommendations become overrun with more of the same, pushing them in a destructive spiral. What has Instagram done in response? The app\u2019s head, Adam Mosseri, said yesterday that he was \u201cdeeply moved\u201d by Molly\u2019s story and acknowledged his platform was \u201cnot yet where [it] needs to be\u201d on the issues of suicide and self-harm. Mosseri, who ran the Facebook News Feed before being promoted to his current role in 2018, said that the encouragement of suicide and self-harm was banned on the site, but admitted that Instagram relies on users to report the content before it is purged. \u201cThe bottom line is we do not yet find enough of these images before they\u2019re seen by other people,\u201d he added. Mosseri also pledged to do more to hide imagery that wasn\u2019t banned on the site, but which may have harmful effects if stumbled upon accidentally, such as imagery that shows, without encouraging, self-harm. What is the government threatening to do? Ministers are talking about redefining the role of social networks to hold them directly liable for the content that gets published on their platforms, in effect enshrining them as publishers in law. The digital minister, Margot James, is expected to announce proposals to crack down on the companies, saying that the government will introduce laws that force social media platforms to remove illegal content, and to prioritise the protection of users beyond their commercial interests. Meanwhile, parliament has also been suggesting its own form of regulation. Last week, the science and technology committee concluded that social media companies must be subject to a legal duty of care to help protect young people\u2019s health and wellbeing when accessing their sites. Norman Lamb, the committee\u2019s chair, said that \u201csocial media companies \u2013 who have a clear responsibility towards particularly young users \u2013 seem to be in no rush to share vital data with academics that could help tackle the very real harms our young people face in the virtual world.\u201d What are the actual effects of social media on self-harm? The evidence is patchy. One UK study found self-harm in girls aged 13-16 rose 68% from 2011 to 2014, a period that mirrors a boom in social media usage. But the authors from the University of Manchester warned more research was necessary to attribute a cause and they suggested it could partly reflect girls being more willing to talk. Another study led by the University of Oxford said moderate use could be beneficial but extreme usage may have a minor negative influence, pointing towards limiting adolescents\u2019 technology use. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.",
