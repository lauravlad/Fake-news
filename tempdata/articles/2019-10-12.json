If they persuade enough of the country it is at war, they can dismiss the wishful thinking and outright lies they peddled as irrelevant. In wartime, we expect civilians to bear some of the suffering. Only fifth columnists undermine the people\u2019s morale by saying the sacrifices are self-inflicted. From the right\u2019s point of view, a war without end is preferable to a career-ending acceptance of its responsibility. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",
