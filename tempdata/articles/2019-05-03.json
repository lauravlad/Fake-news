It came out with 93 (down 45). In the process, it saw net losses of 1,269 seats.</li> \n   <li><strong>Labour:</strong> On the face of it, the numbers don\u2019t look as bad. But Labour had hoped to make ground, not lose it. The party saw a net loss of six councils, ending up controlling 60, and had a net loss of 63 seats along the way.</li> \n   <li><strong>Lib Dems:</strong> The biggest winners. The Lib Dems managed net gains of 11 councils \u2013 leaving them in control of 18 \u2013 and 676 councillors.</li> \n   <li><strong>Greens:</strong> While they didn\u2019t take control of any councils, it was nevertheless a day of progress. They made net gains of 185 seats across England.</li> \n   <li><strong>Ukip:</strong> The party\u2019s regression continued and, with the Brexit Party not fielding candidates, Ukip\u2019s lack of progress may confound some the more simplistic analyses that rely solely on Brexiter anger to explain the main parties\u2019 difficulties. Ukip saw a net loss of 36 seats.</li> \n   <li><strong>Others:</strong> The various other parties, including independent candidates, ended up in control of six councils between them \u2013 a net increase of four \u2013 and saw net gains of 285 seats.</li> \n   <li><strong>No overall control:</strong> In all, 71 councils ended up with no party able to take overall control; an increase of 36.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>These figures represent changes calculated from the dissolution of the relevant council.

It\u2019s what we want to do, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working for, so now we must get on and do that.</p> \n   <p>I also know that last night, I\u2019m sorry to say, a good number of good local councillors across the country lost their seats. Brandon [Lewis] and I both started our careers in local government and we know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re fighting local elections against a difficult national background. I\u2019d like to thank all those councillors for all their hard work and effort that they\u2019ve put in.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s excellent to be here to recognise and celebrate a success. For the first time, you have control of North East Lincolnshire. That is an excellent result and you\u2019ve all worked extremely hard for that result.</p> \n   <p>I want to congratulate you and I want to say a huge thank you for delivering this success, but also congratulations to the people of North East Lincolnshire because they have now got a first-class Conservative council that is going to deliver for them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ccc96e58f087d3be8782f4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-03T19:32:55.283Z\">8.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Vince Cable</strong>, the Lib Dem leader, has called yesterday the party\u2019s best ever local election performance:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>These are spectacularly good results, stemming from the hard work and the commitment of our campaigners all around the country.</p> \n   <p>This is a springboard to the European elections in three weeks\u2019 time, when we hope to do well again.

For the Conservatives, the loss of more than a thousand seats and 40 councils is little short of catastrophic, while Labour will be concerned to be moving backwards and to be losing heartland councils like Middlesborough or Bolsover. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats, Greens and independents have been resurgent.</p> \n   <p>The meaning of all this will be fiercely debated but it\u2019s clear that Brexit has been a dominant factor as local government is once again overshadowed by dysfunctional national politics.</p> \n   <p>Attention is deflected from the crisis faced by local government and local public services and the real issues they face.

That does not necessarily mean that Brexit is hurting them both equally - there could other factors at play - but it does show that Labour has failed to benefit from the Brexit deadlock for which the government is primarily responsible.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) The results confirm the impression that two-party politics is on the decline. </strong>As Prof John Curtice explained on the BBC, this is only the second time since these results were first compiled, in 1982, that both main parties have been below 30%. The other time was in 2013, when Labour were on 29% and the Tories 25%.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Although the Lib Dems have done well, they are a long way behind their pre-2011 performance. </strong>From 1993, when they were on 25%, until 2010, when they were on 26%, they never fell below 20%. In 2011 they went down to 16%. Now they are up to 19%, which is an improvement, but a long way short of making this a historic success - at least, on this measure.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Even though \u201cothers\u201d are on 25%, the real non-Tory/Labour/LibDem vote is probably even higher. </strong>This category includes Ukip and the Greens.

But the party had been widely expected to gain dozens of seats - the local election experts Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher predicted two weeks ago that Labour would gain 150 seats if people voted in line with how they have voted in local council byelections in the last six months - and today\u2019s performance is not compatible with the party being on course to win the next general election. Although many of the results are in, the election analysts working for the BBC and for Sky have not yet calculated the projected national vote - the estimate of how the parties would have performed if the whole of Britain had voted in the same way as people did in the places where the elections were actually held.

In other words, the issue of Brexit does not challenge the basis of Northern Ireland\u2019s party system.</p> \n   <p>However, Brexit has the potential to shape voting behaviour within the unionist bloc in particular.

Many councils are counting this morning, not overnight, and more than half the results are yet to come. But already the outline of what is happening so far.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Conservatives and Labour are both losing seats in the English local elections in what appears in part a backlash from voters against Westminster\u2019s failure on Brexit.</strong> According to the latest figures, the Conservatives have lost control of 16 councils and have suffered a net loss of 409 seats. Labour has lost control of two councils and had a net loss of 60 seats. This is the biggest round of elections in the four-year cycle of local elections and more than 8,000 seats are being contested in England and in Northern Ireland, where counting only starts this morning. The Conservatives were expecting to do very badly (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/28/tories-should-expect-to-lose-800-seats-in-local-elections-says-analyst\">one well-respected Tory elections expect predicted last week that they would lose more than 800 seats),</a> partly because most of these seats were last contested in 2015, on the day of the general election, when the Tories did unexpectedly well. But Labour had been expecting to make gains in these elections, and so even though they are not losing as many seats, they have no reason to celebrate. Although election results can be measured in terms of seats won and councils held, probably the best indicator of success is the projected national share (PNS) - the estimate of what would happen in a general election if the whole of Britain voted in the same way as people did in the locals. It is a calculation that makes allowance for the fact that the places where the locals are taking place are not representative of Britain as a whole (ie, because there were no elections in Labour-leaning London). At last year\u2019s local elections the Tories and Labour were tied on a PNS of 35%. <strong>Sir John Curtice</strong>, the BBC\u2019s elections expert, told the Today programme earlier that it was too early to know which of the main parties was ahead on this measure. A calculation will be made later today.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Liberal Democrats have made substantial gains.</strong> They have gained control of nine councils and achieved a net gain of 283 seats, according to the latest figures. <strong>Sir Ed Davey,</strong> the Lib Dem MP, said that this had been \u201cthe best night for a generation\u201d for the party and that the results had been \u201cfantastic\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1124189330354819074\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"It's a fantastic morning.

Their efforts often go unrecognised but they are the unsung heroes of our local democracy.</p> \n   <p>Local elections are often talked about in terms of turnout. In years like this one, where they don\u2019t coincide with a general election or a European election on the same day, turnout is often as low as just a third of the electorate. However, it is difficult to tell how much election fatigue from the last two years will impact the results. Will the fallout of Brexit drive people to the polls? We are hearing that a lot of voters are staying home which could be bad news for the Conservatives.</p> \n   <p>For the Conservatives, anything short of disaster will feel like a reasonable result. They\u2019re predicted to lose hundreds of seats. But the consolation could be that the profile of these elections means they shouldn\u2019t lose control of too many councils.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Carr-West concurs with Labour\u2019s own analysis that Calderdale and Trafford are key targets:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Labour will hope to consolidate their hold on the northern, metropolitan councils and take full control of places like Calderdale and Trafford. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats should pick up anti Brexit votes and win seats but start from too far back to take over many councils though they may have their eyes on Stockport.</p> \n   <p>And, while there is always a temptation to view local elections as a glorified opinion poll, we shouldn\u2019t forget that local elections are about real issues that impact our homes, care of older people, school places, children\u2019s services, libraries, streets and refuse collection.

      "bodyText": "So, those final figures in England look like this: Conservatives: A bruising night for the party, which ended up losing control of nearly a third of the councils it had. It came out with 93 (down 45). In the process, it saw net losses of 1,269 seats. Labour: On the face of it, the numbers don\u2019t look as bad. But Labour had hoped to make ground, not lose it. The party saw a net loss of six councils, ending up controlling 60, and had a net loss of 63 seats along the way. Lib Dems: The biggest winners. The Lib Dems managed net gains of 11 councils \u2013 leaving them in control of 18 \u2013 and 676 councillors. Greens: While they didn\u2019t take control of any councils, it was nevertheless a day of progress. They made net gains of 185 seats across England. Ukip: The party\u2019s regression continued and, with the Brexit Party not fielding candidates, Ukip\u2019s lack of progress may confound some the more simplistic analyses that rely solely on Brexiter anger to explain the main parties\u2019 difficulties. Ukip saw a net loss of 36 seats. Others: The various other parties, including independent candidates, ended up in control of six councils between them \u2013 a net increase of four \u2013 and saw net gains of 285 seats. No overall control: In all, 71 councils ended up with no party able to take overall control; an increase of 36. These figures represent changes calculated from the dissolution of the relevant council. You can see how the results compare with the 2015 elections and read all the political reaction here: And counting is still going on in a large proportion of the seats in Northern Ireland, where the DUP\u2019s first openly gay candidate has been elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council. So, check back for the Guardian\u2019s coverage of those results. For now, though, we\u2019re going to close down this live blog. Thanks for reading and for all of the comments. The final English councils have declared their results and the results are worse for the Conservatives than even the most pessimistic predictions. The party lost 1,351 seats; a net loss of 1,269. But Labour did not profit hugely from their rivals\u2019 disastrous day, losing 307 of their own seats; a net loss of 63. The Lib Dems, the Greens and independent candidates were the big winners, seeing net gains of 676, 185 and 242 seats, respectively. I\u2019ll post more details on the results soon. Here\u2019s a little more from May\u2019s speech to Tory activists in Grimsby. Again, it\u2019s remarkably similar to what she told Sky News earlier: Yes, we had challenging results, but Labour were predicting that they were going to gain seats. In fact, they made net losses of seats. But I think a message has been given to both main parties from the public \u2013 I think people are saying to us: \u2018We\u2019re sending a strong message, just get on and sort Brexit out and do it\u2019. I welcome the fact that Jeremy Corbyn has said today that he sees the time is now to get a deal and to deliver on Brexit \u2013 it\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying for some time. It\u2019s what we want to do, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working for, so now we must get on and do that. I also know that last night, I\u2019m sorry to say, a good number of good local councillors across the country lost their seats. Brandon [Lewis] and I both started our careers in local government and we know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re fighting local elections against a difficult national background. I\u2019d like to thank all those councillors for all their hard work and effort that they\u2019ve put in. It\u2019s excellent to be here to recognise and celebrate a success. For the first time, you have control of North East Lincolnshire. That is an excellent result and you\u2019ve all worked extremely hard for that result. I want to congratulate you and I want to say a huge thank you for delivering this success, but also congratulations to the people of North East Lincolnshire because they have now got a first-class Conservative council that is going to deliver for them. Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, has called yesterday the party\u2019s best ever local election performance: These are spectacularly good results, stemming from the hard work and the commitment of our campaigners all around the country. This is a springboard to the European elections in three weeks\u2019 time, when we hope to do well again. Ours is the strongest Remain voice in British politics. Every Liberal Democrat vote is a vote to stop Brexit. Theresa May has been addressing the Tories\u2019 performance, admitting in an interview with Sky News that she had been expecting a \u201cdifficult election\u201d and that Brexit was \u201can added dimension\u201d. These were always going to be difficult elections for us with us nine years into a government. Of course, there is the added dimension we haven\u2019t got the Brexit deal over the line. But, of course, it wasn\u2019t a good night for Labour either \u2013 they were predicting they would make gains but they have lost over 100 seats. I think there has been a very clear message from people to both main parties that they want us to get on and deliver Brexit, so I welcome comments from Jeremy Corbyn that he thinks we should be working to ensure we can deliver a deal. She repeated a similar message when speaking to Conservative activists in a hotel in Grimsby, which lies in a council area captured by the Conservatives: It\u2019s great to be back in Grimsby and in Conservative North East Lincolnshire. Because we haven\u2019t delivered the Brexit deal through parliament yet, this was going to be a particularly challenging set of elections for both of the main parties. As the party who has been in government for nine years, it was of course always going to be particularly difficult for us. But as we look at what happened, nobody was expecting that Labour was going to do as badly as they did. Here\u2019s the lay of the land from the Press Association, with results available from 241 out of 248 councils: Conservatives: 91 councils (down 43), 3,449 seats (down 1,173) Labour: 60 councils (down six), 1,972 seats (down 68) Lib Dems: 18 councils (up 11), 1,265 seats (up 620) Green: no councils (no change), 250 seats (up 174) Ukip: no councils (no change), 31 seats (down 36) Others: Five councils (up four), 1,143 seats (up 270) There are 67 councils of which no party is in overall control, that\u2019s up by 34. The results are being interpreted by many as a poor performance by Labour, with the party seeing a net loss in seats, as well as ceding control of some councils in its heartland and failing to take much advantage of Tory travails. But Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s election coordinator, has been talking up what he says are some significant wins. As the final results come through, it\u2019s become clear that, since this morning, Labour has made some significant gains in important areas of the country. Of course we are disappointed to have lost councillors but the real story of these elections is the catastrophic result for the Tories, who are facing their largest seat loss since 1995, with over 1,000 councillors lost and 30 councils gone. Labour has won key target councils, such as Trafford, Amber Valley, Calderdale and won two mayoral seats for the first time ever. And we have made gains in key areas where repeat results in a general election would see Labour win those target constituencies. We will be stepping up our campaigning in these areas and across the rest of the country so that we\u2019re ready for the next election, whenever it comes. Here\u2019s Jonathan Carr-West, the chief executive of the Local Government Information Unit with the thinktank\u2019s final verdict on yesterday\u2019s voting: Results in these elections have been far more dramatic than anyone expected. For the Conservatives, the loss of more than a thousand seats and 40 councils is little short of catastrophic, while Labour will be concerned to be moving backwards and to be losing heartland councils like Middlesborough or Bolsover. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats, Greens and independents have been resurgent. The meaning of all this will be fiercely debated but it\u2019s clear that Brexit has been a dominant factor as local government is once again overshadowed by dysfunctional national politics. Attention is deflected from the crisis faced by local government and local public services and the real issues they face. A decade of austerity has left many councils close to breaking point. That\u2019s what we should be focusing on instead of the gridlock in Westminster. Today\u2019s results usher in a new wave of councillors who will have to rise to the urgent challenges that lie ahead. The centralist Alliance Party topped the local government poll in part of Belfast during early vote counting. The party has appealed for support to both unionists and nationalists and is trenchantly critical of Brexit and the Stormont powersharing stalemate which was denounced following the murder of journalist, Lyra McKee. Alliance held the balance of power between Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionists in the outgoing Belfast City Council, the largest in Northern Ireland. The former Alliance leader, David Ford, said: People want serious politicians getting on with serious issues rather than what we see of the two main parties squabbling and failing to form the executive at Stormont. Here\u2019s a little more on Alison Bennington, the DUP\u2019s first openly gay election candidate, who has been elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council. She hugged supporters at a Belfast count centre as it became clear she had made it. Bennington attracted 1,053 votes as part of her campaign for the pro-union and Christian party and praised the \u201cgood, hard work and good teamwork\u201d of her supporters. The DUP\u2019s founder, Rev Ian Paisley, once led a campaign to \u201cSave Ulster from Sodomy\u201d and prevent the decriminalisation of homosexuality. His fundamentalist party is staunchly opposed to same-sex marriage and has thwarted recent efforts to legalise it. Speaking on Friday, the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, said: Our party is open to everybody who subscribes to the aims and objectives of our party, wants to ensure the union is defended and we deliver all our policies. Alison will be an excellent addition to our team, she is a very hard worker. She\u2019s been a member of our party in the South Antrim association for many years and we are delighted now she is a councillor. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has backed the notion that today\u2019s English council election losses for the Tories and Labour were a clear warning that voters want to see Brexit delivered. At a fringe event at the Scottish Tory conference in Aberdeen, Gove was pressed by Graham Simpson, a Conservative MSP who has been the most vocal advocate of Brexit at Holyrood, on whether he remained confident Brexit would take place. Simpson asked him: \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a danger that it won\u2019t happen?\u201d Gove, who has been carefully wooing activists in Aberdeen before the contest to replace Theresa May, without stating he plans to run, replied: I think, in a way, that whatever else one takes from these local elections \u2013 and there are reasons for sadness when good councillors lose their seats \u2013 one lesson that we can take is that the electorate has pretty clearly said to both major parties: \u2018Get on with it\u2019. My view is that the message is more acute for Labour because the overwhelming majority of Conservative MPs have supported the prime minister but only a tiny fraction of the Labour party have. But the responsibility rests on all us in Westminster to respect that result. Good evening, we\u2019ve come full circle. Let\u2019s start with news from Beaconsfield, where \u2013 according to ITV News\u2019s Daniel Hewitt \u2013 the Conservatives have chosen not to deselect their MP, Dominic Grieve: The remain-supporting Tory MP lost a no-confidence vote in late March. You can read about that here: The DUP\u2019s first openly gay candidate, Alison Bennington, has been elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council, the Press Association reports. And on that note, I am finishing for the day. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. Here is the the latest list from the Press Association showing which councils have changed hands. Conservatives councils lost to no overall control Babergh Basildon Broxtowe Chichester Craven Eden Folkestone &amp; Hythe Malvern Hills Mendip Mid Devon Mid Suffolk North Hertfordshire North Somerset Pendle Peterborough Richmondshire St Albans South Oxfordshire Southend-on-Sea Staffordshire Moorlands Swale Tandridge Tendring Torridge Warwick Welwyn Hatfield Worcester Wyre Forest Labour councils lost to no overall control Bolsover Burnley Cannock Chase Darlington Hartlepool Middlesbrough Stockton-on-Tees Wirral Conservative gains from no overall control North East Lincolnshire Walsall Conservative gain from Labour North East Derbyshire Labour gains from no overall control Calderdale Gravesham Trafford Labour gains from Conservative Amber Valley High Peak Lib Dem gains from no overall control North Devon North Norfolk Teignbridge Lib Dem gains from Conservatives Bath &amp; North East Somerset Chelmsford Cotswold Hinckley &amp; Bosworth Mole Valley Somerset West &amp; Taunton Vale of White Horse Winchester Independent/other gains from no overall control Ashfield Independent/other gains from Conservatives North Kesteven Ratepayers or residents gain from Conservative Uttlesford This is from the Labour MP Lucy Powell. At the weekend the Sunday Express splashed on a story by David Maddox saying the Tories were expecting to lose more than 1,000 seats in the election. Maddox wrote: A senior party member told the Sunday Express that \u201ceven before the problems with Brexit we calculated we will lose more than 1,000 [remaining] seats\u201d. At the time the conventional wisdom at Westminster was that the story had been briefed as a crass and routine piece of expectation management. Perhaps it was, but an alternative explanation might be that the source was just telling the truth. According to the latest figures, the Conservatives have now suffered net losses of more than 1,100 seats. The story is now looking rather prescient. The value of sterling has gone up on the back of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit comments (see 4.56pm), Reuters reports. Sterling surged past $1.3150 on Friday after Jeremy Corbyn said parliament must break the deadlock over Brexit and \u201cget a deal done\u201d to exit the European Union. Lee Hardman, MUFG\u2019s currency analyst based in London, said \u201coptimism\u201d over a \u201ccross-party deal to break the impasse\u201d had extended the move higher in sterling. Against the dollar, the pound surged more than a percent to $1.3175, a one-month high. Against the euro, the pound surged 0.9% to 84.98p, a new one-month high. Sky News has done its own calculation as to what the local election results would mean if people had been voting across Britain as a whole. It has not released its national equivalent vote figure (which tends to be a bit different from the Curtice/BBC PNS figure), but it has produced an estimate as to what the makeup of the House of Commons would be if there had been a general election yesterday. Here are the figures: Conservatives: 280 (down 33 from now) Labour: 268 (up 22) Lib Dems: 28 (up 17) SNP: 53 (up 18) Others: 21 Although the Tories would be the largest party, an election result like this would probably result in Jeremy Corbyn running a minority administration dependent on SNP and Lib Dem support. Assuming the UK was still in the EU, that would probably mean a second referendum. Which is one reason why Tory Brexiters will want to avoid an election at all costs. Jeremy Corbyn has told ITV that the message from the local elections for MPs is that there has to be a Brexit deal. He said: I think it means there\u2019s a huge impetus on every MP, and they\u2019ve all got that message, whether they themselves are leave or remain, or the people across the country, that an arrangement has to be made, a deal has to be done, parliament has to resolve this issue - I think that is very, very clear. This is more or less exactly what Theresa May told the Welsh Tories at lunchtime, as she sought to explain what she thought was the main message for MPs from the local elections. (See 12.48pm.) Corbyn has long been committed to implementing a form of Brexit - but a Labour, pro-jobs Brexit, not what he calls a \u201cdamaging Tory Brexit\u201d. But some ministers have always had their doubts about whether Corbyn is actually willing to strike a deal with May to pass a compromise Brexit deal. These comments imply that he is genuinely serious about this. It is hard to hear them without thinking that the chance of a deal being announced in the next week or so has just risen sharply. Stuart Davies, the former Conservative councillor who heckled Theresa May at the Welsh Conservative conference at lunchtime, has explained why he told May to resign. He told the Press Association: I am furious at what she has done to our party. To put it bluntly, she is telling lies \u2013 \u2018We will be out by March the 29th\u2019. If she\u2019s given a choice, she always picks the wrong choice, and that\u2019s what she\u2019s done all the way through. She doesn\u2019t listen to people. I knew this was my opportunity to get my views across and I think I share the views of a lot of people who are party members. I did what I did because I know it was the right thing to do. The former engineer and press officer added: \u201cI shouted out: \u2018Prime minister, why don\u2019t you resign?\u2019 Her reaction? It was like looking at a rabbit caught in the headlights. I am glad I did it.\u201d Davies said he was not impressed by May\u2019s response, saying good afternoon in Welsh. \u201cBy the way, if she speaks Welsh, I\u2019m a frog,\u201d he said. In Bolsover, where Labour lost control of the council for the first time in 40 years, the outgoing council leader, Ann Syrett, said Brexit was to blame for her party doing so badly, rather than any local issues. She explained: The sad thing is that it\u2019s not anything that we\u2019ve done as an authority. We haven\u2019t had problems with any particular issue with the public. I don\u2019t get complaints. What we\u2019ve met on the doorstep is that it\u2019s just not clear to people what Labour means on Brexit. It simply isn\u2019t clear. It\u2019s come up everywhere. We\u2019ve tried to keep off it and say \u2018look we\u2019ve got a clean sheet, we\u2019re doing our best for you and it\u2019s OK\u2019 .... \u2018well, yes, but what about Brexit?\u2019 The sad thing about Brexit is that it\u2019s as divisive as the [1984 miners\u2019] strike used to be, where you go into a household and there are people on either side of the issue. It really is damaging. Syrett, who did not contest the election, was asked if she had a message for Corbyn. She said voters needed more clarity on Brexit. All I can say to him is that we really need more information, we need a very definite lead from him; whatever it is on Brexit, he\u2019s got to tell us. You can live with anything if it\u2019s certain. At the moment, everyone is living with uncertainty. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s hit this. Eleven local authority areas have been running voter ID pilots at these elections, where people were asked to provide particular forms of ID when they turned up to vote. At Woking borough council, which was trialling a version involving people having to show photo ID, turnout was 36.3%, slightly down on the 37.7% in last year\u2019s election. There were 133 rejected papers, up from 89 last year. Eric Pickles, the former Conservative party chairman, has come out in favour of a second referendum if MPs cannot reach an agreement on Brexit. Pickles, who is now a member of the House of Lords, told Sky News: If parliament can\u2019t sort [Brexit] out, then, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, because I was absolutely opposed to a second referendum, but then a clear choice has got to be put to the public in terms of where they want to go. Do they want Mrs May\u2019s deal, do they want to have Brexit without a period of transition, or do they want to stay in the European Union? Here is an article from my colleague Dan Sabbagh on five things we have learned from the elections so far. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has released figures showing the swing away from Labour to either the Greens or to the Lib Dems in certain council areas. It is keen to highlight these figures because they boost the People\u2019s Vote argument that Labour has been losing votes to parties that unequivocally back a second referendum. (See 2.45pm.) Here are the figures as calculated by People\u2019s Vote. Barnsley: 17.3% swing from Labour to LDs Coventry: 2% swing from Labour to Greens Derby: 6.2% swing from Labour to LDs Dudley: 1.4% swing from Labour to LDs NE Lincolnshire: 2.7% swing from Labour to LDs Oldham: 2.8% swing Labour to LDs Peterborough: 6.9% swing Labour to LDs; 2.7% swing Labour to Greens Sunderland: 13.4% swing Labour to LDs; 10.9% swing Labour to Greens Labour\u2019s Jamie Driscoll elected on second count at North of Tyne. Driscoll is a member of Momentum, the Labour organisation for Jeremy Corbyn supporters, and Momentum has put out this statement about his victory Devastated by Thatcherism and blighted by austerity, for decades the North East has been held back by Tory rule. By electing Momentum member Jamie Driscoll as the region\u2019s first mayor, the people of the North East have rejected the economic orthodoxy of the past 40 years and taken back power for their communities. From building good, affordable homes to creating a people\u2019s bank and highly paid, unionised green jobs, Jamie will deliver a transformative, socialist agenda for the North East and we look forward to supporting him as mayor. My colleague Aditya Chakrabortty wrote a positive profile of Driscoll last month. It\u2019s here. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has been addressing the Scottish Conservative conference in Aberdeen and and acknowledged the \u201cdisappointing\u201d local election results. He said: Of course we knew it would be a tough time in the cycle. We knew there was frustration about our national politics. He added that the European elections \u201cwill be even more challenging\u201d, saying the party should not be surprised \u201cif people tick the protest box on the ballot paper.\u201d Without anything else at stake, it will be a verdict on the delivery of Brexit. It\u2019s like being asked to rate an Amazon delivery before its even arrived. Here is some analysis that puts the projected national share (PNS) numbers in context. (See 2.53pm.) 1) Both main parties have gone backwards considerably over the last 12 months. In the 2018 local elections the Conservatives were also tied, but they were both on 35% instead of 28%, which is what they are on now. That does not necessarily mean that Brexit is hurting them both equally - there could other factors at play - but it does show that Labour has failed to benefit from the Brexit deadlock for which the government is primarily responsible. 2) The results confirm the impression that two-party politics is on the decline. As Prof John Curtice explained on the BBC, this is only the second time since these results were first compiled, in 1982, that both main parties have been below 30%. The other time was in 2013, when Labour were on 29% and the Tories 25%. 3) Although the Lib Dems have done well, they are a long way behind their pre-2011 performance. From 1993, when they were on 25%, until 2010, when they were on 26%, they never fell below 20%. In 2011 they went down to 16%. Now they are up to 19%, which is an improvement, but a long way short of making this a historic success - at least, on this measure. 4) Even though \u201cothers\u201d are on 25%, the real non-Tory/Labour/LibDem vote is probably even higher. This category includes Ukip and the Greens. But it does not include the Brexit party and Change UK, because they were not standing in these elections. The BBC has just released its figures for the projected national share - its estimate, based on the actual votes in key wards, for what would have happened if the whole of Britain had voted yesterday in line with how people voted in the wards where there were contests. It is a calculation that takes into account the fact that the places where the elections took place were not representative of the nation as a whole (for example, because there were no votes in Labour-leaning London). Here are the figures: Conservatives: 28% Labour: 28% Lib Dems: 19% Others: 25% If you are interested in how the projected national share (PNS) is calculated, there is a good analysis here. Both main parties have been humbled by deeply disappointing performances in the English local elections. With results still being counted, the Conservatives are the obvious losers. They have lost 759 councillors, according to the latest figures. But governing parties expect to go backwards in mid-term local elections, and so far the results are broadly in line with the party\u2019s dismal expectations. Labour has only lost 81 councillors. But the party had been widely expected to gain dozens of seats - the local election experts Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher predicted two weeks ago that Labour would gain 150 seats if people voted in line with how they have voted in local council byelections in the last six months - and today\u2019s performance is not compatible with the party being on course to win the next general election. Although many of the results are in, the election analysts working for the BBC and for Sky have not yet calculated the projected national vote - the estimate of how the parties would have performed if the whole of Britain had voted in the same way as people did in the places where the elections were actually held. It is a calculation that makes allowance for the fact that the places where the elections took place were not representative of Britain as a whole, and it is often seen as the most reliable overall guide to how the parties have done. Theresa May has been urged to quit by an activist heckler at the Welsh Conservative conference. She laughed off the criticism, but the results have emboldened those in her party who are demanding that she announce a date for her departure. Some Tories spoke out overnight. And Sir David Amess later told the BBC: The results are absolutely dreadful. Theresa has said that she will be leaving Number 10 which made it very difficult because, obviously, you are talking to Conservative supporters and they are saying \u2018who\u2019s going to be the next leader? What on earth is going on?\u2019 I think it would have been much more sensible, really, if before the election, through the 1922 Committee there had been some precise date put on when Theresa would be departing, and then the election process can go ahead. But leaving it up in the air certainly played very badly on the doorsteps in the area that I represent. And it is now up to the executive of the \u201822 to deal with this matter immediately when parliament returns on Tuesday. They must take action because we are haemorrhaging support. May has said that the results show voters want both main parties to \u201cdeliver Brexit\u201d. (See 12.48pm.) John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, also said in a tweet this morning that the message from the voters to politicians was \u201cBrexit - sort it\u201d. But he later said that by \u201csort it\u201d, he was not committing Labour to agreeing a deal with the government. He meant sort it \u201cwhichever way\u201d, he said. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader has said his party are \u201cthe big winners\u201d from the elections. They have gained 452 seats so far. The Green party has had its best ever set of local election results. It has gained 112 seats so far. Labour pro-Europeans have renewed calls for the party to firm up its commitment to a second referendum, saying the party\u2019s current equivocal position is costing it votes. In recent months Labour has been much more united that the Conservative party in Commons votes on Brexit. But this morning Labour MPs are disagreeing openly and profoundly about how to respond to these results. In a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, the Labour MP David Lammy said: Nye Bevan said it: people who sit in the middle of the road get run over. That is what happened to Labour last night \u2013 we fudged and hedged on a people\u2019s vote, hoping we could string voters along - but the bluff has been called. Look at the results in the so-called \u2018leave areas\u2019: they show Labour losing votes not to parties that support some form of Brexit but to parties that support a people\u2019s vote. Too often the media has caricatured these areas as if everyone who lives there are all backing Brexit but it has been clear for some time that, if this ever was true for Labour voters, it is no longer the case. Detailed polling has shown that the overwhelming majority of Labour\u2019s heartlands supporters back a new public vote on Brexit and would choose to stay in the European Union if given the chance. Some Labour figures have also criticised Corbyn personally, saying his leadership was partly to blame for the party\u2019s poor performance. Jeremy Corbyn has resisted calls for a more pro-European Brexit policy. Responding to the results, he said Labour was the only party trying to appeal to both leave voters and remain voters. (See 10.50am.) This is from Tony Robinson, the former Black Adder actor and longstanding Labour activist. It speaks for itself ... Here is a picture of Stuart Davies, the Tory activist who heckled Theresa May as she started speaking at the Welsh Conservative conference. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you resign,\u201d he shouted. As the man shouted \u201cwe don\u2019t want you here\u201d, a small group of delegates at the Welsh Conservative conference at Llangollen Pavilion clapped and chanted \u201cout\u201d, in an apparent call for the heckler to be removed. As the Press Association reports, the prime minister then drew laughter and applause from a majority of the hall as she told the conference: \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back in North Wales again - I have to say my experience of North Wales is that everybody I meet here is friendly.\u201d The Conservatives have retained control of Solihull metropolitan borough council in the West Midlands, despite seeing their majority cut, the Press Association reports. On the World at One John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, was asked what the message from the results was for Labour with regard to Brexit. He replied: I think it\u2019s mixed. If you take a look at the Labour wins, we\u2019ve won Trafford, which voted remain. We\u2019ve won Amber Valley, which voted leave. We\u2019ve won Calderdale for the first time in 20 years. That also voted leave. And we\u2019ve made some gains in areas like Telford, Plymouth, Southampton, even Southend, Basildon, Peterborough, Worthing, where we need to do well for the next general election. When he was asked what he would say to colleagues who wanted Labour to be the remain party, he replied: I would say you cannot take that lesson from a set of mixed local election results ... We\u2019ve got to be the one party, because we are the only party that can bring the country back together again. The Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted in the early hours this morning about how she thought Labour\u2019s equivocal Brexit stance was a problem for the party in the elections. She elaborated on this on the BBC\u2019s election programme: The reality is, the Labour party, people don\u2019t know where it stands at the moment as regards to Brexit. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen next week. I genuinely don\u2019t know what our position is going to be. So if people are going to the ballot box, they don\u2019t know what we stand for. Do you know what, I think the people genuinely don\u2019t mind if they disagree with it. What they want to see is courage and leadership. Phillips said she thought any Brexit deal should be subject to a confirmatory referendum. She went on: I think that the Labour party need to genuinely decide whether they are going to be a party that backs Brexit, or they are going to be a party that doesn\u2019t back Brexit. All this messing around, faffing about, is a nonsense. Phillips was then asked about this interview given by the Labour leader of Sunderland council, Graeme Miller, in the early hours this morning saying the party\u2019s support for the option of a second referendum cost him 10 seats. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chairman, made a similar point himself in a separate interview this morning. (See 9.56am.) Phillips said she did not accept this analysis. She explained: I say it\u2019s really weird that loads of them voted for the Greens and the Lib Dems, then. The idea that protest voting in Sunderland about Brexit went for the most remain parties - notwithstanding those that voted Conservative or for Ukip up there, which is frankly a dying phenomenon. The Conservatives are now close to having achieved a net loss of 600 seats. Labour are on a net loss of 75. And here are some of the latest developments, from the Press Association. Conservatives say they could lose overall control of Bromsgrove. Labour sources say Pendle is too close to call. Conservatives currently hold power, but it could move to a position of no overall control. Conservatives have kept control of Redditch borough council. They have 15 seats out of 29 with 3 seats still to be declared. The Brexit party has not been contesting these elections. It has only just been set up, and so there was not time to select candidates. But it has put out this statement from its chairman, Richard Tice. Effectively, Tice is welcoming this as a good result for the Brexit party - even though it has not won a single seat. This is not as illogical as it sounds. Here is his statement in full. The local elections are clearly disastrous for the main legacy parties. The big winners appear to be independents as people switch off and turn away from the Conservatives and Labour. It is clear that the last few years have broken any bonds between the electorate and Westminster. Their failures to deliver Brexit, and the dishonest way in which they are trying to thwart the biggest democratic vote in our history has put a spotlight on a system that is broken beyond repair. So it is no surprise that we are hearing reports of record numbers of spoilt papers across the country. On the 23rd May, at the European Elections people will have the opportunity to vote for a new style of politics, one that will listen, and deliver leadership and accountability, one that is changing politics for good. Here is a round-up of some comments from readers on the election results. There are, of course, another 13,000 BTL. I can\u2019t claim every single one is brilliant, but you can never read the comments here at Politics Live without learning something, so do take a look. Labour has released this statement from Jeremy Corbyn on the results. He said: Even at this stage of the results, we have won Trafford council and are making gains across the country, including Tory heartlands. Throughout the campaign, we have been putting forward our vision of a better society, and the need to end the austerity imposed on our communities by the Conservatives, along with the Liberal Democrats when they were in the coalition government. As well as local issues, voters have been talking to us about how the Tories\u2019 shambolic handling of Brexit is overshadowing everything else. We will continue putting our case for an alternative deal to Parliament, and we will put that case to the European Union, because Labour does not want to divide people on how they voted in 2016, we want to bring people together. I congratulate all the Labour councillors who have been elected, and I am sorry for those who were not successful. We will fight and win those seats back and, whenever a general election comes, we are absolutely ready for it. These are from Patrick English, another academic who has been working on the BBC\u2019s election analysis. In her speech, Theresa May described the results of the local elections as \u201cvery difficult\u201d. She paid tribute to councillors who had lost their seats, saying that they were not to blame for their defeat and that, as a former councillor herself, she knew how hard they worked. And she said the voters were giving a \u201csimple message\u201d to the Conservatives and Labour: \u201cJust get on and deliver Brexit.\u201d May says election results show voters want both main parties to \u201cdeliver Brexit\u201d. This is almost exactly the same as the way John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, interpreted the results this morning (see 8.26am) \u2013 or at least how he appeared to interpret the results before he clarified what he meant (or rowed back on what he had said earlier, if you are more cynical). See 9.23am. Theresa May is speaking to the Welsh Conservative conference. According to the South Wales Argus\u2019s Ian Craig, she was heckled at the start of her speech. Earlier this morning the Labour MP Neil Coyle posted this on Twitter. Coyle has been a strong critic of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, and so he seemed to be referring to the Labour leader, although not necessarily. For his colleague Bridget Phillipson, the elephant in the room was Brexit. (See 12.19pm.) But now it is clear Coyle was talking about Corbyn. He has told the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn that Corbyn\u2019s leadership was the biggest problem for the party. The People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, believe the results show Labour\u2019s equivocal stance on Brexit is harming the party. It has released this statement from one of its supporters, the Labour MP Bridget Phillipson, who represents Houghton and Sunderland South. She said: Council elections are always about local issues but Brexit was the elephant in the room and no one can deny it played a key part in Labour\u2019s disappointing performance last night. In my city of Sunderland, there was a big swing against us to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Too often places that voted for Brexit back in 2016 like Sunderland get caricatured by the media as if everyone voted leave. But the majority of Labour voters now want a people\u2019s vote on Brexit and would vote to stay in the EU given the chance. I fear Labour\u2019s position has been too hesitant and lacking in clarity over the past few months, depressing support among our voters at a time when they expect strength and leadership from my party rather than fudge. A number of voters took to social media to boast about spoiling their ballot papers in the local elections, with many referencing a disillusionment with Brexit. As the Press Association reports, people shared images of voting slips with messages including \u201cGet May out\u201d, \u201cBrexit betrayal\u201d and \u201cTraitors\u201d written across them. Another wrote: \u201cI\u2019d rather poo in my hands and clap than vote for this lot.\u201d Jordan (Jord16-) voted in the Worcester city council elections and said he spoiled his ballot because of issues surrounding Brexit. He told the Press Association: The major parties have been lying for three years straight about Brexit and, in a two-party system, neither of them deserve to be voted for at any level. I\u2019m actually a member of the Conservatives, so under normal circumstances I would have voted for them. If there was a Brexit party candidate I would have voted for them. The campaign was started by Leave.EU, which tweeted in March, encouraging people to spoil their ballot papers. As the Press Association reports, it is not illegal to spoil a ballot paper, but filling it out incorrectly or covering it with graffiti will render it invalid. The Brexit party and Change UK have not been taking part in these elections. But they will be contesting the European elections later this month and Prof Sir John Curtice, the BBC\u2019s elections expert, told BBC News a few minutes ago that the Euro results would probably show the electorate to be more fragmented than ever. Asked if Sir Vince Cable was right to say these results show the return of three-party politics, Curtice said: I think it is fair to say that this is the return of at least three-party politics. But I suspect that on 23 May we will discover that there are more than three significant players and we may see the most fragmented British electorate since the advent of mass British democracy. Earlier I quoted a tweet from the Labour MP Neil Coyle (see 9.48am) referring to \u201cBailout Barry\u201d. It was a reference to Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, saying Labour were bailing out the Tories. Here is the actual quote from Gardiner. He was speaking on one of the overnight election programmes and told the Tory Brexit minister James Cleverly: We are in there, trying to bail you guys out. We are now trying to negotiate with you because your prime minister, who\u2019s lost control of her party and lost any chance of getting her deal through parliament, has come to us and said: \u2018Please, I now need to listen to the ideas you have been putting forward. Here is Lewis Baston\u2019s take on the election results overnight. And here is how his analysis starts. Comically large swings to the Lib Dems in the commuter belt marked a night in which, in keeping with the fragmented landscape of British politics, there is not a single message from the electorate, but several. Despite the threats, the Conservative section of the electorate didn\u2019t go on strike over their party\u2019s failure to deliver Brexit. Turnout was generally down a bit, but recent political turmoil has not resulted in a big drop in participation, as had been feared. Election Maps UK, a Twitter feed that, well, does what it says on the tin, has produced maps with some of the more interesting results. These are from Jayne McCormack, the BBC\u2019s Northern Ireland political reporter. Jeremy Corbyn has tweeted a picture of himself with Labour councillors in Trafford, where the party took control of the council. A party spokesman said: Taking Trafford council is a great result for Labour and has completely extinguished Tory blue from the Greater Manchester map. Voters have seen over the last year what a difference Labour can make and have given the Labour councillors a thumping vote of confidence. These are from Steve Fisher, an academic who works with John Curtice analysing the local election results for the BBC. He says the Tories are losing about one in four of the seats they are defending. He says the Tories are doing better the more leave voters there are in an area. He says Labour are also losing seats, but fewer than the Tories. He says the Lib Dems have more than doubled their number of seats. He says there are almost three times as many independent councillors as four years ago. And he says the Greens have gained from the decline of the two main parties. Here are two more pro-European Labour MPs who support a second referendum saying the local election results show why the party\u2019s current equivocal stance on Brexit is flawed. Jeremy Corbyn is in Trafford, where Labour has been celebrating taking control of the council, which was previously under no overall control. Here are the main points he made in a brief interview with the BBC. Corbyn admitted Labour could have done better in the elections. He thanked Labour councillors how had lost their seats for their service, but pointed out that the Tories had most many more seats. (According to the latest count, the Tories are down 442, and Labour down 79.) Asked if he hoped to do better, he said: Of course we wanted to do better. We always want to do better. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in politics. He admitted that Brexit was a factor. Asked why Labour was losing control of councils in some heartland areas, he replied: Some of them were local factors. Some of them were people probably disagreeing with both parties on attitudes to towards the European Union. He insisted that Labour was the only party trying to appeal to both sides on Brexit. He said: Our policy is that we are the only party that seeks to appeal to people however they voted in 2016, and to ensure that we try to defend jobs and working conditions in this country. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, has said his party are \u201cthe big winners\u201d from these elections. He said: Voters have sent a clear message that they no longer have confidence in the Conservatives, but they are also refusing to reward Labour while the party prevaricates on the big issue of the day: Brexit. Our army of 100,000 members and 250,000 supporters have shown us to be the strongest campaigning force in local government, in remain and leave areas alike. We are winning from leave-voting Chelmsford to remain-voting Cotswolds, gaining ground in rural England and cities too. This is from the Labour MP Darren Jones. The Green party says it has had its best-ever election night. The party has won 42 new seats, and is represented on 16 new councils. In a press statement Jonathan Bartley, the party\u2019s co-leader, said: This is the biggest election night in our history. Greens are winning right across the country, and taking seats from a wide range of other parties. The Green message is clearly taking hold and can win anywhere. Voters see that we need a new kind of politics, one that recognises the huge imperative of acting on climate change, but also the social emergency that is creating misery and suffering in communities across the country. They want clear, consistent politics, principles and values. It is also clear that Brexit has played a significant role in these elections. Greens have been clear in standing up for the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union and will continue to do so. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chairman, told BBC News this morning that the Labour leader of Sunderland council was blaming the party\u2019s support for the option of a second referendum as the reason for it losing nine seats on the council. \u201cPeople want to see Brexit over and done with,\u201d said Lavery, who is one of the shadow cabinet members most hostile to a second referendum. Labour has lost overall control in party stronghold Bolsover for the first time. As the Press Association reports, voters stripped the party of 13 seats in the Derbyshire town\u2019s local council elections, giving them now just 18 on the council and taking away their majority. In what is traditionally a Labour heartland, the Conservatives gained two seats. The Liberal Democrats took one seat and Independents are up by 10, taking them to 16 seats. The town is represented in the Commons by the leftwing Labour MP Dennis Skinner. These are from the Labour MP Neil Coyle, who has often criticised Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership in the past. This is a reference to Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, saying Labour is \u201cbailing out\u201d the Tories over Brexit. There were local elections in Northern Ireland as well as in England yesterday. But counting in Northern Ireland only started this morning. Northern Ireland uses the single transferable vote for local elections, which makes the counting more complicated. Jamie Pow at Democratic Audit has a good guide to what to look out for in the Northern Ireland elections here. Here is an excerpt. As in other parts of the UK, Brexit is at the top of the political agenda in Northern Ireland \u2013 and it is an issue that reinforces, rather than undercuts, the ethno-national dimension. Nationalists overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU; a majority of unionists voted for the UK to leave. In other words, the issue of Brexit does not challenge the basis of Northern Ireland\u2019s party system. However, Brexit has the potential to shape voting behaviour within the unionist bloc in particular. While a clear majority of unionist voters (66 percent) supported leave in the 2016 referendum, a significant minority (34 percent) did not. The two main unionist parties were divided during the campaign itself: the DUP advocated leave, but the UUP backed remain. The Conservatives have lost Peterborough city council to no overall control after three years in charge of the consistently marginal authority, the Press Association reports. The Tories now hold 28 of 60 seats on the council after the party lost three seats to Labour and one each to the Green party and the Liberal Democrats, but also gained one seat from Labour. Ukip lost the only seat it held on the council to the Lib Dems. Labour remains the second largest group on the council with 17 seats, followed by the Lib Dems with nine. There is particular interest in the city because there will be a byelection in Peterborough on Thursday 6 June after the successful recall petition against Fiona Onasanya, who was elected as a Labour MP but then jailed for lying about a speeding offence. Here is the Change UK MP Chuka Umunna on the results. Here are two Labour MPs who favour a second referendum tweeting on the results. Robert Peston, ITV\u2019s political editor, read John McDonnell\u2019s tweet (see 8.26am) in much the same way I did. McDonnell is now claiming that he has been misinterpreted. Personally, I think it is hard to equate the message \u201cBrexit - sort it\u201d with the second referendum/remain outcome that many in the Labour party would like to see, but if McDonnell says that that is not what he meant, it is fair to take him at his word. Curtice also told the BBC that the Greens were getting 11% of the vote, up five points on last year. He said they were on course for their best ever local election results. Sir John Curtice, the BBC\u2019s lead election analyst, told the Today programme that his analysis suggested the Lib Dem surge was not being driven by support for a second referendum. He explained: The Liberal Democrats used to be the traditional party of protest. And then they went into coalition with the Conservatives and they rather lost that mantle. It looks as though they are beginning to recover that mantle, particularly in areas where until recently they had quite a lot of strength. But when you actually look, is there any evidence that the Liberal Democrats are doing better in remain areas than in leave areas? The truth is that the evidence seems to be lacking. So it seems easier to interpret this as evidence of Liberal Democrats recovering from the coalition, being the party of protest, and that\u2019s the basis of their success, rather than necessarily a rush of enthusiasm for the idea of a second EU referendum. The Press Association has just filed this useful list of councils that have changed hands. Conservative councils lost to no overall control Basildon Broxtowe Folkestone &amp; Hythe Peterborough St Albans South Oxfordshire Southend-on-Sea Tandridge Tendring Welwyn Hatfield Worcester Labour councils lost to no overall control Bolsover Hartlepool Wirral Conservative gains from no overall control North East Lincolnshire Walsall Labour gain from no overall control Trafford Lib Dem gains from no overall control North Devon North Norfolk Liberal Democrat gains from Conservatives Bath &amp; North East Somerset Chelmsford Cotswold Hinckley &amp; Bosworth Somerset West &amp; Taunton Vale of White Horse Winchester Independent/others gain from no overall control Ashfield Independent/others gain from Conservatives North Kesteven Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, says John McDonnell (see 8.26am) is taking the wrong message from the local election results. There were no elections in Scotland, and Sturgeon\u2019s view is doubtless influenced by the fact that she is leader of a country that voted 62% remain. England as a whole voted 53% leave and, because there were no elections in pro-remain London, these local elections were held in places that overall voted 56% leave (according to this analysis). Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, was on the Today programme a few minutes ago, and his take on the message from the local elections was remarkably similar to John McDonnell\u2019s. (See 8.26am.) Lewis said these were always going to be tough elections for the Tories, because these seats were last fought in 2015, when David Cameron won a surprise general election victory. Lewis went on: I absolutely accept that there is huge frustration, not just with our members and activists, but the public around where parliament and we have got ourselves to on delivering on Brexit. I think there is a very clear message to both parties that we have to get on with getting Brexit done. Ruth Davidson, the Conservative leader in Scotland, said the English local election results should be a spur to both Labour and the Tories to reach a compromise on Brexit. In one of her first interviews since returning from maternity leave, she told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: I do understand the frustration that\u2019s out there. The results that are coming in should really focus minds in the talks that are going on between my party and the Labour party to get a deal through so that we can have that orderly Brexit that will allow the country to move on. Politicians told the people that they would make this decision and that that decision would be respected. And now it looks as if we the professional classes we\u2019re the stumbling block to making this happen. Davidson, who was a leading remain campaigner, rejected both a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum. She said: I genuinely believe that the answer lies in the middle. It will require a compromise both from people within my party and from people within the Labour party. I\u2019m really hopeful, actually, that the talks that have been ongoing in the last week can can reach that sort of resolution. And again denied that she had any plans to lead the Tory party. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty consistent that that\u2019s not where my ambitions lie. I want to be the first minister of Scotland. I\u2019ve no interest in No 10.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and one of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s key allies, has just posted this on Twitter. This could be very significant. Labour is currently engaged in cross-party talks with the government on a possible Brexit compromise, but some in government suspect Corbyn is just stringing Theresa May along and that he has no real desire to reach a deal and allow her to pass a Brexit agreement. McDonnell\u2019s tweet may be the clearest sign yet we\u2019ve had from the Labour leadeship and this is not the case, and a deal could be on the cards. Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s campaigns chair, was on the Today programme a few minutes ago talking about the results. Here are the main points he made. Gwynne said this had been \u201ca tough set of elections\u201d for Labour. He conceded the party would have to consider why it had not done better. We have to take stock [of those results] and look at why the Labour vote either did not come out, or felt frustrated and voted for independents and smaller parties. He conceded that Brexit had been a factor. When asked about the comments from Labour MPs like Jess Phillips who say Labour was being punished for not having a more pro-European stance (see 7.59am), he said: Undoubtedly Brexit played a part in the results. It was the first opportunity people have had to vote. And there has been that sense of frustration. But he also defended the party\u2019s equivocal stance. He said: It is not a bad thing for a party that seeks to govern in the national interest to want to bring together our polarised and divided society. He conceded that the Lib Dems\u2019 stance on Brexit may have contributed to their success. But he insisted that other factors were involved too. He said: I think you will find that a number of those Liberal Democrat gains were in seats that historically always were Liberal Democrat. And here is Gwynne on BBC News. Here is a summary of the state of play so far. Many councils are counting this morning, not overnight, and more than half the results are yet to come. But already the outline of what is happening so far. The Conservatives and Labour are both losing seats in the English local elections in what appears in part a backlash from voters against Westminster\u2019s failure on Brexit. According to the latest figures, the Conservatives have lost control of 16 councils and have suffered a net loss of 409 seats. Labour has lost control of two councils and had a net loss of 60 seats. This is the biggest round of elections in the four-year cycle of local elections and more than 8,000 seats are being contested in England and in Northern Ireland, where counting only starts this morning. The Conservatives were expecting to do very badly (one well-respected Tory elections expect predicted last week that they would lose more than 800 seats), partly because most of these seats were last contested in 2015, on the day of the general election, when the Tories did unexpectedly well. But Labour had been expecting to make gains in these elections, and so even though they are not losing as many seats, they have no reason to celebrate. Although election results can be measured in terms of seats won and councils held, probably the best indicator of success is the projected national share (PNS) - the estimate of what would happen in a general election if the whole of Britain voted in the same way as people did in the locals. It is a calculation that makes allowance for the fact that the places where the locals are taking place are not representative of Britain as a whole (ie, because there were no elections in Labour-leaning London). At last year\u2019s local elections the Tories and Labour were tied on a PNS of 35%. Sir John Curtice, the BBC\u2019s elections expert, told the Today programme earlier that it was too early to know which of the main parties was ahead on this measure. A calculation will be made later today. The Liberal Democrats have made substantial gains. They have gained control of nine councils and achieved a net gain of 283 seats, according to the latest figures. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem MP, said that this had been \u201cthe best night for a generation\u201d for the party and that the results had been \u201cfantastic\u201d. The dire Tory results have led to renewed calls for Theresa May to stand down as party leader. In an interview overnight Priti Patel, the Brexiter former cabinet minister, made this argument. And Bernard Jenkin, another Tory Brexiter, told the BBC: If the Conservative party does not mend its ways pretty quickly, the Conservative party is going to be toast. That meant delivering Brexit, he explained. And Crispin Blunt, another Tory Brexit, made the same point on the Today programme. He said: I was publicly one of those who thought [May] should go in December. There is no reason for me to change that judgment. She now formally has the leadership without a challenge under our rules until December, but plainly we are going to need a new leader at some point to get a clear strategy to get Brexit over the line. Labour pro-Europeans have blamed the party\u2019s equivocal stance on Brexit for the party\u2019s poor performance. This what Labour MP Wes Streeting posted on Twitter earlier. And this is what the Labour MP Jess Phillips posted on Twitter earlier. Curtice told the Today programme earlier this morning that there were signs Labour was losing both leave and remain voters. He said: The truth is, the evidence of the opinion polls has been that, whereas it has been leave voters in particular who have been wanting to punish the Conservatives - though that was not perhaps as evident last night as you might imagine - on the Labour side the party has been losing both remain and leave voters. And in a sense therefore the problem with the fudge isn\u2019t just necessarily that it does not deliver the Brexit the Labour leave voters are looking for, it doesn\u2019t satisfy Labour remain voter either. Curtice told the Today programme the results suggest two-party politics in England is fragmenting. He explained: What is very clear is that both of [the two main parties[ are significantly weaker than they were 12 months ago, and that indeed that dominance of British electoral politics, and the restoration of that domination - one of the characteristics of the 2017 general election when over 80% of voters voted either Conservative or Labour - that already seems to be in the dim and distant past. And the fragmentation of British politics, which has long been a theme over the last 20/30 years, while there was a hiccup in 2017, now looks as though it has been restored, partly through the partial recovery of the Liberal Democrats, although they are still nothing like as strong as they were before the coalition. He also said the fact that there has been a large rise in the number of independent councillors being elected - a net gain of 85 so for far - confirmed this. Here I think perhaps is the clearest evidence that voters, frankly, were willing to take whatever stick they could use to beat the two largest parties. You can catch up with the latest results here. Here is Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGiU, the local government thinktank, on what the results show so far. It\u2019s looking like a pretty grim night for the Conservatives and Labour and a very good night for the Lib Dems. The Conservatives were expecting to lose hundreds of seats and they have. But they\u2019ve also lost control of 13 councils so far. Councils due to declare on Friday are more solidly Conservative, so they will be hoping that trend doesn\u2019t continue; if it does, things could be even worse than they were expecting. Things aren\u2019t as bad for Labour. They have taken control of Trafford but they\u2019re also losing seats and have lost control of Hartlepool and Wirral. Labour and Conservative local leaders have angrily blamed the national parties for their losses. Big winners are the Liberal Democrats, up hundreds of seats with surprise wins in Winchester, Chelmsford and Bath and North East Somerset. Does this mean that remain voters are flocking to the Lib Dems while disillusioned Tory and Labour leave voters simply stay home? Perhaps. But we shouldn\u2019t forget the salience of local issues. Campaigners around the country have been desperate to shift the debate on to local issues and have had some success. These elections are not a glorified opinion poll, they\u2019re about electing councillors who will make decisions about the local services people rely on. The Lib Dems have won control of Vale of White Horse district council from Conservatives after winning 20 of the 38 seats with several results still to come, the Press Association reports. More results from the LGiU, the local government thinktank. Here are some more results coming through in the last hour or so, taken from the Press Association feed. The Conservatives have failed to take control of Torbay, after winning 15 seats of the 35 declared with just one result to come. The Conservatives have lost control of Broxtowe council after Labour gained seats. Stoke-on-Trent will remain under no overall control. Labour had been hoping to win it. The Lib Dems have won control of Chelmsford from Conservatives after winning at least 29 seats. The Conservatives have held Hertsmere. Independents have won a majority in Ashfield, which was previously under no overall control. Here is the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran commenting on the overnight results. The Lib Dems have won control of Bath and North East Somerset Council from the Conservatives, the Press Association reports. It says Sir Vince Cable\u2019s party won 37 seats - including the ward where prominent Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg lives - to gain an overall majority of 15. Casualties included leader of the council Tim Warren, who lost his Mendip seat to Liberal Democrat David Wood, cabinet member for transport Mark Shelford and veteran Conservative councillor Les Kew, who was beaten by 20-year-old Ryan Wills. The Conservatives had won control of the council in 2015 from the Liberal Democrats and held 36 seats, but were left with just 11. Commenting on the result, Warren said: I feel we\u2019ve been given a kicking for something that wasn\u2019t our fault. I don\u2019t think people are happy. The people that voted to remain blame us for leaving and the people that voted to leave blame us because we haven\u2019t left yet. I think it\u2019s almost anti-political. I think a lot of people didn\u2019t turn out and I think they want to punish us for a lack of action in Government, if I am honest. I\u2019m sure there are one or two things we\u2019ve done locally they don\u2019t like, but on a whole I think it\u2019s national issues. The guy who took my seat did a great campaign and when you are running a council you have to work full-time, and I didn\u2019t have the time to match him. It sounds a bit cheap to blame anybody, but Brexit didn\u2019t help. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, picking up from Alison Rourke. Here are the latest results, from the Press Association feed. Conservatives Councils held: 29 (down 11) Seats won: 896 (down 254) Labour Councils held: 37 (down 2) Seats won: 806 (down 45) Lib Dems Councils held: 8 (up 6) Seats won: 384 (up 177) Greens Seats won: 40 (up 33) Ukip Seats won: 12 (down 4) Here\u2019s an emoji take on tonight\u2019s results from the BBC\u2019s @nickeardleybbc Pundits in the Twitterverse are beginning to wonder if Vince Cable will still stand down as leader of the Lib Dems after tonight\u2019s big wins for the party. Professor John Curtice has been telling the BBC that this is a terrible night for the major parties. Here\u2019s the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg\u2019s take on where she thinks we are so far, with the caveat that there are still many hundreds of seats still to declare. It\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that the Liberal Democrats are the big winners from tonight. There\u2019s talk that they are being seen as the natural party of opposition as voters turn away from the Tories and Labour, in both leave and remain areas. In a blow to Labour, the party has lost its control of Bolsover in Derbyshire, a council it has held since 1973. It lost 13 seats in this election, 10 of which were picked up by Independents and two by Conservatives. Just a reminder that you can find out what\u2019s going on in your local area using the Guardian\u2019s live results tracker. The picture is becoming clearer with losses mounting for the Tories and wins mounting for the Lib Dems. The senior Tory Brexiter MP Sir Bernard Jenkin has been blaming Theresa May for tonight\u2019s drubbing, saying voters overwhelmingly believed that she had \u201clost the plot\u201d and that the time had come for a change of leader. He told PA: She still has a degree of personal sympathy but I think people think it is time for a change. They can see that she has lost the plot. They can see she is not in control of events. Certainly among Conservative activists and council candidates there is an almost universal feeling that it is time for her to move on. I feel that I am starting to sound repetitive. The Lib Dems have taken control from the Tories in Cotswold. Here\u2019s a good visual take from Ian Jones at PA on how the night has gone so far. I mentioned earlier that the Lib Dems have made gains in Bath, with Dave Wood beating the Conservative council leader, Tim Warren. Warren Bath and North East Somerset Council until the annual general meeting, told Press Association: I feel we\u2019ve been given a kicking for something that wasn\u2019t our fault. I don\u2019t think people are happy. The people that voted to remain blame us for leaving and the people that voted to leave blame us because we haven\u2019t left yet. I think its almost anti-political. I think a lot of people didn\u2019t turn out and I think they want to punish us for a lack of action in government, if I am honest. I\u2019m sure there are one or two things we\u2019ve done locally they don\u2019t like but on a whole I think its national issues. The guy who took my seat did a great campaign and when you are running a council you have to work full-time and I didn\u2019t have the time to match him. It sounds a bit cheap to blame anybody but Brexit didn\u2019t help. Asked whether there needed to be changes in leadership or policies at the top of the Conservative party, Warren replied: \u201cThere needs to be a change in action.\u201d It looks like there is starting to be some movement on who is being punished the most in this election. Earlier in the night, Labour and the Tories were both suffering at the hands of the Liberal Democrats and independent candidates. The BBC has just published it\u2019s latest scoreboard which shows the Tories have lost 212 local council seats in England, Labour has lost 54 and the Lib Dems have gained 145. Results are coming in thick and fast now. The Lib Dems have also won North Norfolk, the BBC is reporting, which was previously no overall control. Some more results coming in of changes of council control. The Lib Dems have gained Winchester from the Conservatives. I\u2019ll bring you the details as soon as I have them. Labour has taken Trafford, winning it back from no overall control. Labour was +6 there but the Conservatives lost 9 seats. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far as results continue to come in from these local elections and local councils in England. The Guardian and the BBC\u2019s live results are both reporting losses for Labour and the Conservatives (as is Sky), though their tallies vary a little. The Guardian\u2019s live tracker has change in council seats as Conservatives -93, Labour -32, Lib Dems +76, Ukip + 2, Green +15, and others +32. The BBC\u2019s latest tally with 71 of 248 councils declared has the changes as: Conservatives -169, Labour -57, Lib Dems +115, Ukip -25, Green +18, others +118. Anger over Brexit is being cited as one of the reasons for voters punishing the major parties. Arch Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg might not be delighted by the fact that he has a new Lib Dem councillor. Dave Wood has beaten council leader Tim Warren in Bath. So far the Liberal Democrats and independent candidates are proving to be the big winners from tonight\u2019s elections, as voters turn away from the major parties. It\u2019s worth noting that we are only part way through the night and the overall picture won\u2019t be clear for some time. Labour\u2019s shadow defence minister, Nia Griffiths, is currently telling Sky News that in some councils, voters are punishing Labour candidates for the cuts that have been implemented by the Tory government. \u201cThe lesson from this one is there are a lot of local factors. But I think there is an issue that poeple are generally turned off politics,\u201d she said. Acknowledging that Labour had lost seats to the Lib Dems and to independents, she said: \u201cWhen people want to protest they often look for something different.\u201d These election results are obviously not good for the Labour party, which must have hoped that Theresa May\u2019s inability to deliver on Brexit would have helped them. Apparently not. I\u2019m hearing from Labour that they think these are a tough set of elections in areas that traditionally favour the Tories and that the mess the government has made of Brexit has hit turnout. The party also thinks local factors have been important, including in Sunderland, where they say independents have made a strong showing. (Labour lost 9 sets, Lib Dems picked up 2, Tories picked up 4, UKP 3, Greens 1). The Labour leader in Sunderland, Graeme Miller, however, squarely blamed the party\u2019s stance on Brexit as the reason for losses. See post from two hours ago . Just taking stock for a moment of where we are overall. The BBC tally for England is showing Labour has lost 54 councillors, the Tories have lost 103 and the Lib Dems have picked up 75. They will be sobering numbers for the two major party leaders. Independent Andy Preston says he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be prouder\u201d to be the new mayor of Middlesbrough, winning 17,418 versus the Labour candidate Mick Thompson\u2019s 6,693. As well as local council elections, there are several mayoral elections taking place tonight, including in Middlesbrough, where Labour has lost by a huge margin to independent businessman Andy Preston. And by a whopping margin of nearly three to one. Brexit is again taking centre stage with Newcastle\u2019s City Council Labour leader, Nick Forbes attacking his party\u2019s \u201cconstant fudge\u201d. In Southend-on-Sea, the Tories have lost control, losing a sizeable eight seats. The Guardian\u2019s North of England editor, @helenpidd says it\u2019s looking like it may be a \u201cdead heat\u201d in Stockport between Labour and the Lib Dems. This would be a great night for the Lib Dems who started with just 5 seats there. Henry Newman, director @OpenEurope agrees that this slap in the face to Labour in many electorates is a message to get off the fence on Brexit. Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall says these elections may encourage the leaders of the two main parties to try to cut a deal on Brexit. Final results are in for Bolton and it\u2019s been a terrible night there for Labour, who lost seven seats. No party retains overall control. It looks like we have a result for St Albans now, with the Conservatives losing to no overall control, the BBC is reporting. Earlier we reported the Tory council leader had lost his seat to the Lib Dems. Another change of control, this time in Walsall. The Tories have taken control back from no overall control. They picked up two seats and Labour lost two there. In Sunderland, Labour has kept control of the council but lost a thumping 9 seats. Four went to the Tories, two to Lib Dems, 3 to UKIP and one to the Greens. The Labour council leader Graeme Miller is blaming Brexit, saying leave voters deserted the party over its stance on a second referendum. I\u2019m hearing from the Liberal Democrats that their vote share has gone up 9% in Liverpool and in St Albans the conservative council leader has lost his seat to the Lib Dems. And Jessica Elgot makes the point that in fact no overall control is a pretty good summary of the county just now. https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/1124104146049732609 So far 15 councils out of 249 have have been declared. There\u2019s been three that have seen a change in control \u2013 Hartlepool which has gone from Labour to no overall control. Labour lost four seats there and Independents won three. Wirral has also gone from Labour to no overall control. Labour lost two seats and the Greens picked up two there. The Tories also picked up one. Basildon has changed from Conservatives to no overall control, where four Tory councillors lost their seats, and were picked by by Labour and Independents, two a piece. Just a reminder you can stay up to date on election results as they come in on our live tracker here: The For Britain Movement, which is a splinter party from UKIP, has gained its first council seat in Britain, it\u2019s being reported. Meanwhile it\u2019s looking like the Greens have done well on Merseyside. The Guardian\u2019s chief political correspondent @jessicaelgot says they are up by 12% there and Labor is down by 14%. Another big theme of the night is that both major parties are doing badly. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg is reporting the Tories have lost Basildon and Tandridge in Surrey and Labour has lost control of Wirral. One of the themes from the night seems to be low turnout. BBC journalist Rob Mayor in the West Midlands is reporting that turnout in one ward was 19%. In Penhill &amp; Upper Stratton (Swindon), the Conservatives have made a gain from Labour, with a 6.6% swing to the party. Good evening, well actually good morning and welcome to this live blog coverage of the local elections, I\u2019m Alison Rourke. There are plenty results to come with some 8,200 seats up for grabs in these elections, in what\u2019s being seen as a key test for Theresa May. Candidates are contesting 248 English local council elections and all 11 local councils in Northern Ireland. There are also elections for six directly elected mayors. You can get up to speed on all the key races here wiht this handy overview of the key battleground areas from our chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot. We\u2019re getting a few results now; though perhaps not yet all that much clarity on what they mean. My colleague, Alison Rourke, is now taking over the search for some. Labour will be hoping to make progress in Swindon, which has been talked up as a bellwether council. But they\u2019ve just seen the Tories take a ward from them there. That said, it\u2019s perhaps worth noting that \u2013 according to the BBC \u2013 Labour\u2019s overall share of the vote in Swindon is up so far; albeit with many votes still to count. Sky News\u2019 Beth Rigby adds this insight: My colleague, Jessica Elgot, has this on the Lib Dems, who have been making positive noises this evening: The Green party has gained its first seats of the evening, taking Sunderland\u2019s Washington South and the Wirral\u2019s Birkenhead and Tranmere wards from Labour: And, almost at the same time, it\u2019s emerged that Labour lost another seat to Ukip in Sunderland: You can follow the local election results as each council declares here: The page will be updated as we get the results for council areas, rather than individual wards. We\u2019ll continue to post interesting ward results here, so keep an eye on both. The Lib Dems are sounding hopeful this evening \u2013 and they\u2019ve just gained their first wards of the evening. They are Sunderland\u2019s Doxford and Millfield, which they\u2019ve taken from Labour: Labour\u2019s vote appears to be down by a not-insignificant margin as the early results come in from Sunderland. Appearing on BBC News, the party\u2019s shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, is spinning that as less problematic than might perhaps have been expected in a Brexit-backing area. And says the city appears to still be solidly backing Labour. We have our second gain of the evening: It has gone to the Tories, who have taken Sunderland\u2019s St Chad\u2019s ward from Labour. There are still a lot of votes to be counted in Sunderland before control of the city council is decided, however. Two Sunderland wards and one in Basildon are the first to declare their results \u2013 and all three are Labour holds: Very shortly afterwards, according to Newcastle\u2019s Evening Chronicle, Sunderland\u2019s Hendon ward declared another Labour hold. Sky News\u2019 Lewis Goodall has this tentative analysis of what these very early results might mean: The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said it\u2019s natural for voters to feel disappointed with the current state of politics. He\u2019s told Sky News this evening: I agree, I can\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s frustrating because the Brexit issue has clouded all the other issues. I\u2019d rather people on a local election were voting on how their local council performed ... often you will have a hard-working local councillor doing their best knocked out by what\u2019s happening in the national politics. The comedy writer, James Felton, notes a slight problem with this now-deleted tweet: The former Tory party deputy chairman, James Cleverly, has told Sky News he\u2019s concerned the Tories will face a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d Brexit backlash today \u2013 and has blamed that partly on Labour, whom he accuses of not helping the government. He also told the broadcaster he fears the damage to the Conservatives could be in the region of 1,000 seats. The chief executive of Local Government Information Unit thinktank, Jonathan Carr-West, is playing down the likelihood of a high turnout today, since the local elections were not being held alongside a general election. And that, he says, spells bad news for the Tories. As polls close in these local elections, tribute must be paid to the thousands of council employees who made today happen and will be working tirelessly through the night to ensure each and every vote is counted. Their efforts often go unrecognised but they are the unsung heroes of our local democracy. Local elections are often talked about in terms of turnout. In years like this one, where they don\u2019t coincide with a general election or a European election on the same day, turnout is often as low as just a third of the electorate. However, it is difficult to tell how much election fatigue from the last two years will impact the results. Will the fallout of Brexit drive people to the polls? We are hearing that a lot of voters are staying home which could be bad news for the Conservatives. For the Conservatives, anything short of disaster will feel like a reasonable result. They\u2019re predicted to lose hundreds of seats. But the consolation could be that the profile of these elections means they shouldn\u2019t lose control of too many councils. Carr-West concurs with Labour\u2019s own analysis that Calderdale and Trafford are key targets: Labour will hope to consolidate their hold on the northern, metropolitan councils and take full control of places like Calderdale and Trafford. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats should pick up anti Brexit votes and win seats but start from too far back to take over many councils though they may have their eyes on Stockport. And, while there is always a temptation to view local elections as a glorified opinion poll, we shouldn\u2019t forget that local elections are about real issues that impact our homes, care of older people, school places, children\u2019s services, libraries, streets and refuse collection. All the things that matter most in our day to day lives. In Northern Ireland, 819 local government election candidates are standing across 11 council areas. No indication has yet been given as to how many voters turned out at the 1,463 polling stations. There will be overnight verification of unused ballot papers, with councils ready to begin counting at 8am on Friday. Counting will continue into Saturday. Northern Ireland\u2019s political leaders have cast their votes in their local areas. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, voted in the Co Fermanagh village of Brookeborough, while the Sinn Fein vice president, Michelle O\u2019Neill, voted in Clonoe, Co Tyrone. The Ulster Unionist leader, Robin Swann, voted in Ballymena, the SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, voted in Londonderry and the Alliance leader, Naomi Long, voted in east Belfast. Among the noteworthy races will be the efforts of Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s former West Tyrone MP, Barry McElduff, to return from the political wilderness. He was forced to step aside after offending the families of those shot dead by republicans at the height of the Troubles in Kingsmill, Co Armagh. He is running for a place on Fermanagh and Omagh District Council in the far west. In Newtownabbey, near Belfast, the DUP\u2019s first openly-gay candidate is seeking election. Alison Bennington is standing for a party that has repeatedly vetoed same-sex marriage and holds what it sees as strong Christian values. It is also the first poll since the journalist, Lyra McKee, was shot dead by dissident republicans. Her death prompted revulsion against the group blamed for the killing and a call by a Catholic priest for politicians to redouble efforts to restore devolved powersharing. Fresh negotiations are due to begin next week following McKee\u2019s death. The election is being conducted by single transferable vote, a proportional representation system. The polls have now closed across those council areas that were holding elections today. We\u2019re expecting results to begin coming from around midnight. Meanwhile, here\u2019s some reaction from the political parties. Labour are playing down their chances, stressing that the vast majority of those councils are in Tory heartlands, whereas many of the metropolitan areas where Labour might expect to do well are only electing one in three of their councillors. Moreover, Labour sources are saying, those parties to which the Tories might be expected to lose the most votes \u2013 the Brexit party and Ukip \u2013 are not on the ballot papers, lessening the options for a pro-Brexit right-of-centre protest vote. The Lib Dems are predicted to win back many of the seats they lost in 2015, while Labour sources indicate they will consider it a good night if the party takes Trafford and Calderdale councils. Labour would also consider Gravesham, in Kent, an excellent result because it is an area in which Ukip has previously done well. The Lib Dems, on the other hand, are hopeful, with sources pointing out that, while 2015 was poor, last May\u2019s local elections threw up their best results in 15 years. They define success today as gains in the triple figures and more gains than Labour. The party is particularly excited about Winchester, Chelmsford and North Devon, as well as North Norfolk and Vale of White Horse. Earlier this afternoon, my colleague Heather Stewart put together an excellent primer on what we expect to happen this evening: More than 8,200 seats are up for grabs \u2013 and half of them are Conservative seats \u2013 so the elections will be a key test for Theresa May. Candidates are contesting 248 English local councils and all 11 local councils in Northern Ireland. There are also elections for six directly elected mayors: in Bedford, Copeland, Leicester, Mansfield, Middlesbrough and North of Tyne. No elections are taking place in Scotland, Wales or London. More than half the councils \u2013 134 \u2013 are controlled by the Tories, 67 by Labour. Seven are held by the Lib Dems and 35 have no overall control. The remaining five are new councils, owing to local authority mergers.",

      "body": "<p>The acclaimed poet Imtiaz Dharker has turned down the poet laureateship, the highest honour in British poetry, citing a need to focus on her writing \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pakistani-scot-to-be-poet-laureate-zwh53h9ww\">despite reports that she was set to be named as the next holder of the position</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI had to weigh the privacy I need to write poems against the demands of a public role. The poems won,\u201d Dharker, who was born in Pakistan and grew up in Glasgow, said. \u201cIt was a huge honour to be considered for the role of poet laureate and I have been overwhelmed by the messages of support and encouragement from all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>Although it was reported by the Sunday Times last week that Dharker was due to be announced as laureate this month, the Guardian understands that no formal offer has been made to or accepted by any candidate for the laureateship, and that the selection process is still under way, with Dharker giving way to other contenders on Friday.</p> <p>The laureateship is not known for bringing the muse of poetry to its incumbents. Andrew Motion, who was laureate from 1999 to 2009, called the role \u201c<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7607897.stm\">very, very damaging to my work</a>\u201d, saying while still in post: \u201cI dried up completely about five years ago and can\u2019t write anything except to commission.\u201d The public-facing position grants an annual stipend of \u00a35,750 \u2013 used by the current laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, to fund a new poetry prize \u2013 and, traditionally, a \u201cbutt of sack\u201d, equivalent to roughly 600 bottles of sherry.<br><br>Last November, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport convened a panel of experts to make recommendations about who should succeed Duffy after her 10-year tenure as laureate ends. But with Duffy having now completed her final project as laureate \u2013 a collection by various poets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/27/into-thin-air-carol-ann-duffy-presents-poems-about-our-vanishing-insect-world\">responding to the collapse in the insect population</a> \u2013 and with the 10th anniversary of her laureateship having passed on 1 May, the DCMS has been silent about who will take up her laurels, a delay that is being blamed on the government\u2019s preoccupation with other issues.</p> <p>A DCMS spokeswoman said on Friday: \u201cThe recommendations of an independent panel have been considered in the usual way. An appointment has not yet been confirmed.\u201d</p> <p>The expert panel\u2019s shortlist of potential successors was believed to include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/17/imtiaz-dharker-queens-gold-medal-poetry\">Dharker</a>, who is widely studied for GCSE and A-level and who reads to more than 25,000 students each year through the Poetry Live! schools programme. Other contenders are rumoured include Daljit Nagra, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/02/poet-laureate-the-highest-office-in-poetry\">Simon Armitage</a>, Lemn Sissay, Alice Oswald and Jackie Kay \u2013 although Kay, who is Scottish makar, has effectively said she is not an option for the role. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/02/as-poet-laureate-succession-race-begins-carol-ann-duffy\">She told the Guardian last November</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t think the powers that be would want to combine the two.\u201d</p> <p>Wendy Cope and Benjamin Zephaniah have both emphatically ruled themselves out. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/02/as-poet-laureate-succession-race-begins-carol-ann-duffy\">Cope said</a>: \u201cIf it\u2019s a competition, it is one that many poets have no interest in winning.\u201d Zephaniah said: \u201cI have absolutely no interest in this job. I won\u2019t work for them. They oppress me, they upset me, and they are not worthy.\u201d</p> <p>Armitage has been more positive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/02/poet-laureate-the-highest-office-in-poetry\">writing in the Guardian</a> that \u201cthe laureateship should be the highest office in poetry and that the laureate should be the guardian of those ideals\u201d. Nagra said on Friday he had not yet been approached.</p> <p>Oswald, a highly respected name, has potentially signalled a lack of interest in the laureateship by throwing her hat into the ring for the UK\u2019s second most prestigious poetry position: the<a href=\"https://secure.ersvotes.com/V2-4-4/oxfordpoetry19/en/home?bbp=-1&amp;x=-1\"> Oxford professor of poetry</a>. Currently held by Armitage, the role is voted on by Oxford graduates. Potential candidates must propose themselves, and then gather together 50 supporting nominations by 9 May to stand in the election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cad5ce7d876d814030574cb667aa3d873128c760\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cad5ce7d876d814030574cb667aa3d873128c760/0_187_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Oswald, who has put herself forward as a contender for the Oxford professor of poetry role.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out of the running?

She would be Oxford\u2019s first female professor of poetry. Although Ruth Padel was elected to the position in 2009, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/25/ruth-padel-resigns-oxford-poetry-professor\">resigned </a>nine days later after claims that she had tipped off journalists about allegations of sexual harassment made against her rival for the post, Derek Walcott.</p> <p>Oxford English faculty board chair professor Ros Ballaster said the professor of poetry position was \u201can unusual but important one\u201d. \u201cEach new professor brings their own wisdom, interests and viewpoint to the lectures they deliver, but they always offer a platform for wider conversations about the place of poetry in society and culture,\u201d said Ballaster. \u201cWe hope not only to appoint an outstanding individual to represent poetry in the heart of learning, but also to stimulate lively debate and new encounters with a diverse range of voices.\u201d</p> <p>Ballaster hailed Oxford\u2019s \u201ctransparent, open and simple\u201d election process \u2013 which stands in direct contrast to the appointment of the laureate. A public announcement about the position has been promised by \u201cearly May\u201d \u2013 or as soon as Theresa May\u2019s office finds time to sign off on it. One observer told the Guardian: \u201cI don\u2019t think the poet laureate is very high up her list of concerns at the moment.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The acclaimed poet Imtiaz Dharker has turned down the poet laureateship, the highest honour in British poetry, citing a need to focus on her writing \u2013 and despite reports that she was set to be named as the next holder of the position. \u201cI had to weigh the privacy I need to write poems against the demands of a public role. The poems won,\u201d Dharker, who was born in Pakistan and grew up in Glasgow, said. \u201cIt was a huge honour to be considered for the role of poet laureate and I have been overwhelmed by the messages of support and encouragement from all over the world.\u201d Although it was reported by the Sunday Times last week that Dharker was due to be announced as laureate this month, the Guardian understands that no formal offer has been made to or accepted by any candidate for the laureateship, and that the selection process is still under way, with Dharker giving way to other contenders on Friday. The laureateship is not known for bringing the muse of poetry to its incumbents. Andrew Motion, who was laureate from 1999 to 2009, called the role \u201cvery, very damaging to my work\u201d, saying while still in post: \u201cI dried up completely about five years ago and can\u2019t write anything except to commission.\u201d The public-facing position grants an annual stipend of \u00a35,750 \u2013 used by the current laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, to fund a new poetry prize \u2013 and, traditionally, a \u201cbutt of sack\u201d, equivalent to roughly 600 bottles of sherry. Last November, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport convened a panel of experts to make recommendations about who should succeed Duffy after her 10-year tenure as laureate ends. But with Duffy having now completed her final project as laureate \u2013 a collection by various poets responding to the collapse in the insect population \u2013 and with the 10th anniversary of her laureateship having passed on 1 May, the DCMS has been silent about who will take up her laurels, a delay that is being blamed on the government\u2019s preoccupation with other issues. A DCMS spokeswoman said on Friday: \u201cThe recommendations of an independent panel have been considered in the usual way. An appointment has not yet been confirmed.\u201d The expert panel\u2019s shortlist of potential successors was believed to include Dharker, who is widely studied for GCSE and A-level and who reads to more than 25,000 students each year through the Poetry Live! schools programme. Other contenders are rumoured include Daljit Nagra, Simon Armitage, Lemn Sissay, Alice Oswald and Jackie Kay \u2013 although Kay, who is Scottish makar, has effectively said she is not an option for the role. She told the Guardian last November: \u201cI don\u2019t think the powers that be would want to combine the two.\u201d Wendy Cope and Benjamin Zephaniah have both emphatically ruled themselves out. Cope said: \u201cIf it\u2019s a competition, it is one that many poets have no interest in winning.\u201d Zephaniah said: \u201cI have absolutely no interest in this job. I won\u2019t work for them. They oppress me, they upset me, and they are not worthy.\u201d Armitage has been more positive, writing in the Guardian that \u201cthe laureateship should be the highest office in poetry and that the laureate should be the guardian of those ideals\u201d. Nagra said on Friday he had not yet been approached. Oswald, a highly respected name, has potentially signalled a lack of interest in the laureateship by throwing her hat into the ring for the UK\u2019s second most prestigious poetry position: the Oxford professor of poetry. Currently held by Armitage, the role is voted on by Oxford graduates. Potential candidates must propose themselves, and then gather together 50 supporting nominations by 9 May to stand in the election. Oswald is up against the Australian poet John Leonard and the Canadian-British poet Todd Swift. She would be Oxford\u2019s first female professor of poetry. Although Ruth Padel was elected to the position in 2009, she resigned nine days later after claims that she had tipped off journalists about allegations of sexual harassment made against her rival for the post, Derek Walcott. Oxford English faculty board chair professor Ros Ballaster said the professor of poetry position was \u201can unusual but important one\u201d. \u201cEach new professor brings their own wisdom, interests and viewpoint to the lectures they deliver, but they always offer a platform for wider conversations about the place of poetry in society and culture,\u201d said Ballaster. \u201cWe hope not only to appoint an outstanding individual to represent poetry in the heart of learning, but also to stimulate lively debate and new encounters with a diverse range of voices.\u201d Ballaster hailed Oxford\u2019s \u201ctransparent, open and simple\u201d election process \u2013 which stands in direct contrast to the appointment of the laureate. A public announcement about the position has been promised by \u201cearly May\u201d \u2013 or as soon as Theresa May\u2019s office finds time to sign off on it. One observer told the Guardian: \u201cI don\u2019t think the poet laureate is very high up her list of concerns at the moment.\u201d",

There is another subset of power, agency, ideas and progress that often gets overlooked in the search for solutions to the world\u2019s problems. There are estimated to be upwards of 4,000 cities around the world with more than 100,000 inhabitants. They are a burgeoning political, economic and social force, often able to implement change more deftly and decisively than national governments. Witness congestion charges, bike sharing, digital hubs, green energy solutions, even immigration protection. For this week\u2019s Upside, journalists on our Cities desk have been scouting out great examples from Europe such as: The Swedish city that took a stand against neo-Nazism. The Berlin specialist stores breathing life back into retail. The Venetians trying to combat Europe\u2019s worst tourist crisis. The Cities-Upside crossover will continue into next week. Watch this space for more great examples of urban renewal. Data A slew of opinion poll data published exclusively by the Guardian this week is worth reflecting on. It asked 25,000 people worldwide for views on globalisation, populism, immigration and nationhood. The results told us what we know deep down but often forget in the daily hurly-burly: most people are pretty moderate, sensible and conciliatory. (A lot are pessimistic though \u2013 and clearly need to sign up to the Upside.) They are also generally a bit less hostile to immigration than previously thought. What we liked This University of Washington article on what triggers compulsive smartphone use, and what we might do to keep our phone habits in check. Also this Huff Post piece about a teacher encouraging her pupils to be open about their mental health, with a \u201cwall of feelings\u201d. What we heard Poor health and social isolation is often due to GPs, the NHS (and the medical model) not opening up to community groups. The solution is for them to do so.

If my current Labour councillor loses their seat, it will most likely go Tory and I will be even angrier that Labour continues to facilitate Tory tyranny. If Labour calculates that remainers should back them \u2013 despite being a Brexit party \u2013 simply to beat the Tories, they have miscalculated dramatically and the consequences will lay squarely with them. DaveCP \u2018I voted for parties other than Labour for the first time ever\u2019 For the first time ever yesterday, I voted for parties other than Labour (Lib Dem and Greens). I am a former Labour party member and a classic middle-class Labour voter. But I will not be voting for them for the foreseeable future, rather, I will be voting for centre parties with a clear public vote or remain policy. If Labour helps the Tories to get Brexit through, I will never vote for them again. Judging by last night\u2019s results, I\u2019d say there are plenty of people who share my view. Galveston \u2018I voted Lib Dem because there weren\u2019t any Green candidates in my area\u2019 I voted Lib Dem because there weren\u2019t any Green candidates in my local area, despite the fact that the Somerset Levels will disappear with rising sea levels over the next 100 years or require colossal expenditure on sea defences. The timing of the sacking of Gavin Williamson seems to have coincided very neatly with what would otherwise have been the dominant news story \u2013 the Climate Change Emergency debate in Parliament, where the Labour motion passed without a vote and the report from the Commons Committee on Climate Change that proposes a zero carbon UK by 2050. solarevolution",
