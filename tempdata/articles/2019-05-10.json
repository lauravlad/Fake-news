It is polling in the 30s in most regions (except London and Scotland). On those numbers, it will always pick up quite a few seats. It is unlikely that many of their voters are going to change their minds, policies or no policies. The only game in town if you oppose Brexit is to support a Remain party that stands a fair chance of getting an MEP elected (eg supporting Change UK in Scotland is a wasted vote). <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/128851633\">Ian MacLaren</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018With my fingers burned by Nick Clegg I would know better\u2019</h2> \n<p>Did the fact that I once voted tactically, giving Clegg the opportunity to donate my vote to the very party I was hoping to prevent, actually contribute to Cameron being in a strong enough position to bring about the referendum in the first place?</p> \n<p>Either way, with my fingers burned, I would know better than to ever do other than vote with my own conscience in future. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/128852580\">R2D2noisy</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Yet another attempt by Britain to put its own interests ahead of those of Europe\u2019</h2> \n<p>The European parliamentary elections is not a glorified opinion poll on Brexit, and it is a shame to see them being regarded as such. The EU elections are to determine the composition of the EU Parliament. What we need are European MPs who will seek to reform the EU from within, who will seek to transform the elitist top-down neo-liberal version of the EU into a genuinely bottom-up democratic one, where people not elites determine the shape of the EU.</p> \n<p>I can\u2019t see any point voting for parties like change UK, which seems to be a vanity project for failed MPs and has no policies and no ideas.</p> \n<p>There are 27 of the countries in the EU and the EU Parliament members all have different views on which way forward the EU should take. If the only reason people vote in the parliamentary elections is because they regard it as an opinion poll about Brexit this will be seen as yet another attempt by Britain to put its own interests ahead of those of Europe. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/128857209\">jacqueshebert</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018The European elections are a confirmatory vote\u2019</h2> \n<p>Finally, it appears to me that there is a resolution in sight, for any uncertainty on what the people of this country are seeking.

I\u2019m amazed how little mind is given to voting tactically normally: it\u2019s usually the Guardian\u2019s own Polly Toynbee banging this drum and ... no one else. The trick comes from realising that voting is extremely important, but that it should only be a tiny part of one\u2019s political engagement: on one day, on one ballot paper, you put a cross. People might have no time for the pro-independence shenanigans of Plaid Cymru or the SNP, or they might still be feeling the ramifications of the austerity that the Liberal Democrats helped collaborate and enable. They\u2019re all battles for another time. On that one day, you fight the battle ahead of you by merely placing a cross. Haigin88 \u2018Remain got it wrong in 2016 and look like getting it wrong again\u2019 There has been too much focus on tactical voting and not nearly enough on turnout and voter registration. The ordinary voter is neither interested or understanding of the complexities of FPTP or in this case D\u2019Hondt. They simply want a simple message on who to vote for and why. Remain got that wrong in 2016 and look like getting it wrong again. If the Brexit voting cohort turn out in force and everyone else sits on their hands, Farage will be assured his \u201cvictory\u201d and we can kiss goodbye to a second referendum \u2013 and, do you know what? It will probably be a good thing, as remain would lose again. screamingman \u2018Getting behind the lead remain party in each region will increase the total number of EU supporting MEPs elected\u2019 The EU elections are a peculiar election that uses a specific proportional representation method called the D\u2019Hondt mathematical system. This plus the emergence of Change UK and The Brexit Party has complicated the maths. The most important messages are: 1) low turnout will benefit the Brexit Party, and 2) getting behind the lead remain party in each region will increase the total number of EU supporting MEPs elected. 3) In terms of totalling the predicted percentages for all remain parties versus all leave parties \u2013 the research shows a 57% for remain versus 43% for leave. Gina Miller \u2018The only game in town if you oppose Brexit is to support a Remain party\u2019 I think everyone is missing the point on the popularity of Brexit Party. It is polling in the 30s in most regions (except London and Scotland). On those numbers, it will always pick up quite a few seats. It is unlikely that many of their voters are going to change their minds, policies or no policies. The only game in town if you oppose Brexit is to support a Remain party that stands a fair chance of getting an MEP elected (eg supporting Change UK in Scotland is a wasted vote). Ian MacLaren \u2018With my fingers burned by Nick Clegg I would know better\u2019 Did the fact that I once voted tactically, giving Clegg the opportunity to donate my vote to the very party I was hoping to prevent, actually contribute to Cameron being in a strong enough position to bring about the referendum in the first place? Either way, with my fingers burned, I would know better than to ever do other than vote with my own conscience in future. R2D2noisy \u2018Yet another attempt by Britain to put its own interests ahead of those of Europe\u2019 The European parliamentary elections is not a glorified opinion poll on Brexit, and it is a shame to see them being regarded as such. The EU elections are to determine the composition of the EU Parliament. What we need are European MPs who will seek to reform the EU from within, who will seek to transform the elitist top-down neo-liberal version of the EU into a genuinely bottom-up democratic one, where people not elites determine the shape of the EU. I can\u2019t see any point voting for parties like change UK, which seems to be a vanity project for failed MPs and has no policies and no ideas. There are 27 of the countries in the EU and the EU Parliament members all have different views on which way forward the EU should take. If the only reason people vote in the parliamentary elections is because they regard it as an opinion poll about Brexit this will be seen as yet another attempt by Britain to put its own interests ahead of those of Europe. jacqueshebert \u2018The European elections are a confirmatory vote\u2019 Finally, it appears to me that there is a resolution in sight, for any uncertainty on what the people of this country are seeking. A confirmatory vote. We have one approaching in a couple of weeks time. The European elections. There can be no doubt that Labour, the Conservatives, Brexit Party and UKIP are all \u201cLeave\u201d parties as it is written in their manifestos. Equally, we all know that the Lib Dems, SNP and Greens support remain. So, straightforward stuff this ... people can vote for whichever party they feel best represents what they are looking for. That way, by the end of May we will have had a confirmatory vote, one way or the other, that clearly demonstrates the current \u201cwill of the people\u201d. Who could argue with that? Cransley \u2018I\u2019m virtually alone in treating these elections for the purpose for which they\u2019re intended\u2019 It isn\u2019t a confirmatory vote. I, for example, will vote Labour because I\u2019d like to see the centre-left S&amp;D grouping get enough support to beat the EPP, the centre-right technocrats who\u2019ve dominated the EU parliament for all of this century. I\u2019ve voted Green in the past because I admire their beliefs and their reformist programme, but this time I think we require a strong bolster against the right-wing insurgence that is likely. I realise I\u2019m virtually alone in treating these elections for the purpose for which they\u2019re intended, but I think that\u2019s an important part of taking democracy seriously. I will not use them as an opinion poll or a proxy referendum on a domestic parliamentary issue. alexito \u2018Our democracy is far more important than the arrogance of our political class\u2019 The simple reason [Farage will do well] is a huge amount of the electorate are angry that our political class, along with the establishment are trying to overturn the referendum result. This is no longer about whether anyone voted Leave or Remain, it is about our democracy. So there are going to be huge numbers of Leave voters, and plenty of Remainers voting for the Brexit party to make it clear it is us the electorate who are in charge. You cannot lead the British electorate down that very long garden path to renege at the last minute which is what our political class are doing. As such I hope the Brexit party win as much as the popular vote as they can, with the maximum number of MEPs. Our democracy is far more important than the arrogance, and self entitlement of our political class. DBS \u2018We always have to go through this process of working out who we would least like to see get in\u2019 Perhaps the most extraordinary thing in all of this is how, even when we are supposedly devising a PR system for electing our represenatiatives, we come up with a system where you still find that you cannot just vote for the party that best represents your views... We always have to go through this process of working out who we would least like to see get in and pitch our vote to this aim. It\u2019s almost as though we do not want small parties taking the power from the big parties, and we don\u2019t want our politicians to represent the full range of opinions in this country. I suspect that it is our obsession with strong parties and strong government that is putting people off the political process and our political representatives more than anything else. ghotiface Click on the name under each comment to view it in the original thread and expand the discussion",

Candidates running in the election said the party was \u201calmost in denial\u201d that the poll was happening and continued to insist they would not need to take up their seats in the European parliament, despite fading prospects for a cross-party deal with Labour that would enable Brexit to happen before 2 July. The fears of a dismal performance have been stoked by the fact that the party plans to spend no money on candidate campaigning, will not publish a manifesto and is refusing to hold a launch. One MEP said candidates were funding their campaigns out of their own pockets, unlike previous years when there was a central pot of funding available. They have been told they are allowed to have their own regional manifestos, but many are not bothering, and there will be no central party manifesto. \u201cThe thinking is that if we make no effort then we will have an excuse for having done so badly. But it is seriously embarrassing,\u201d said one MEP. Another Conservative source said internal data showed the party could do worse than the Brexit party, Labour, the Lib Dems, Change UK and even potentially the Greens, with support at less than 10%. That would translate to only a handful of seats, down from the current 22. A second CCHQ source said the outlook was \u201cabsolutely dire\u201d and worse even than the public pollsters were predicting because the party was planning to put in no effort whatsoever, apart from a free mailshot. Part of the problem is the party\u2019s activist base, as they are not motivated to campaign for the Conservatives when Brexit has not been delivered as previously promised. Surveys suggest around three in five members are planning to vote for Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. After a meeting with Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, earlier this week, MEP candidates were left with the impression that Theresa May would give a speech next week setting out the party\u2019s European election message. However, a No 10 source said there were \u201cno plans\u201d for such an intervention. With a dire showing predicted, May is expected to make another effort to get her withdrawal bill through the House of Commons or let MPs vote on various different options for Brexit within the next two weeks. The prime minister\u2019s official spokeswoman said No 10 hoped to \u201cbring forward\u201d the bill before Whitsun recess on 23 May \u2013 the day of the European elections. However, she will only do this if there is enough support from across the House of Commons, including Labour, to stop it being voted down at the first hurdle. One plan under consideration is publishing the bill before the 11-day break for MPs and then allowing them to debate and vote on it after they have had time to contemplate the results of the European elections, which are likely to lead to a strong showing for Farage\u2019s Brexit party. One cabinet minister said there was a case for daring Labour to vote it down, as that would put the pressure back on them. However, if the withdrawal bill were to be voted down, the prime minister would have to prorogue parliament and put forward a new Queen\u2019s Speech, but there is no certainty that she even has support for a new programme of legislation. If a Queen\u2019s Speech fell then it could bring down the government. Backing from the DUP would be crucial to getting through a Queen\u2019s Speech but they could need a new agreement involving more money for Northern Ireland to achieve that. In a sign May is gearing up for parliamentary battles ahead, she hosted lunch for Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, Nigel Dodds, the DUP Westminster leader, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the chief whip, at her Chequers country residence on Thursday. The talks involved the drive to get the prime minister\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill through parliament, as well as the confidence and supply deal that is due to expire at the end of this parliamentary session. Sources close to the government said May made it clear she wants to restore the Northern Ireland assembly before leaving office and is open to a renewed confidence and supply agreement with the DUP. May has refused to step down until Brexit is achieved, but a further array of Conservative candidates were jostling for position on Thursday in the expectation that she could soon be out of office. Esther McVey, a Brexiter who quit the cabinet in protest at May\u2019s Brexit deal, became the third Tory openly to declare her ambition to be prime minister, after Andrea Leadsom and Rory Stewart. Another potential candidate, Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, also gave a wide-ranging speech on the future of the 21st century worker and warned that \u201ca no-deal prime minister would not be able to command a majority in the House of Commons\u201d. David Gauke, the justice secretary who has his eye on the chancellorship, gave a speech warning against \u201cculture wars\u201d and against a no-deal Brexit, while Priti Patel, a former development secretary, gave a speech saying there should be a \u201cnew generation of political leaders to effectively take back control\u201d.",
