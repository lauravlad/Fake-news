But Corbyn pointed out that it was Trump who had said it did only a few months ago.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US president used the</strong><strong> interview with his ally Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, </strong><strong>to try to offer backing to Boris Johnson.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/31/general-election-latest-news-brexit-labour-tory-real-change-is-coming-says-corbyn-at-labours-campaign-launch-live-news?page=with:block-5dbb148e8f08d669cdab08ac#block-5dbb148e8f08d669cdab08ac\">He said Corbyn would be \u201cso bad\u201d for the UK</a> and that Farage and Johnson would be an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d if they joined up.

It\u2019s not about any individual on this platform.

He also sidestepped a question about how he would vote in the referendum Labour plans to hold after the election offering a choice between remain and a soft Brexit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/31/general-election-latest-news-brexit-labour-tory-real-change-is-coming-says-corbyn-at-labours-campaign-launch-live-news?page=with:block-5dbacf7e8f08d669cdab04e7#block-5dbacf7e8f08d669cdab04e7\">You can read a summary of his key points here</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/boris-johnson-accused-report-russia-dominic-grieve\">accused of preventing the publication of a report</a> assessing the security threat posed to the UK by Russia. </strong>The cross-party intelligence and security committee said it had expected him to approve publication by now.</li> \n   <li><strong>The former Conservative MP, Antoinette Sandbach, joined the Lib Dems.</strong> Sandbach, one of 21 Tory MPs to be kicked out for voting against the government, will contest her current seat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/31/general-election-latest-news-brexit-labour-tory-real-change-is-coming-says-corbyn-at-labours-campaign-launch-live-news?page=with:block-5dbb5a628f08cb84c60a2797#block-5dbb5a628f08cb84c60a2797\">on behalf of her new party</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>A \u00a3100,000 grant awarded to the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s Hacker House company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/jennifer-arcuri-100k-grant-was-appropriate-says-government-report\">has been declared \u201cappropriate\u201d</a> by the government\u2019s internal audit agency. </strong>The report was immediately labelled a \u201cwhitewash\u201d by Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson.</li> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister could be poised to sound the death knell for the UK\u2019s controversial shale gas industry after more than a decade of support for fracking, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/31/boris-johnson-poised-to-rule-out-new-fracking-say-sources\">according to sources</a>. </strong>Johnson could promise an effective ban as part of his election campaign and green groups believe it could help kill off the industry.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Labour MP Keith Vaz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/keith-vaz-suspended-from-commons-for-six-months\">has been formally suspended</a> from the Commons for six months for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an investigation. </strong>The move was endorsed without a vote after<strong> </strong>a brief Commons debate.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague <strong>Rowena Mason</strong> has the full story:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/trump-says-johnson-and-farage-could-form-unstoppable-force\">Trump says Johnson and Farage could form 'unstoppable force'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-31T23:26:29.427Z\">at 11.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dbb69ed8f08c428d8934673\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-31T23:11:30.365Z\">11.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague, <strong>Peter Walker</strong>, has just published a story on Sandbach joining the Lib Dems:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/tory-rebel-antoinette-sandbach-joins-lib-dems-ahead-of-election\">Tory rebel Antoinette Sandbach joins Lib Dems ahead of election</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dbb64df8f08cb84c60a27e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-31T22:54:17.767Z\">10.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In June, as the Tory leadership contest raged, Sandbach complained of abuse at the hands of male party colleagues.

Together Johnson and Farage would be an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d, Trump said.</p> \n  <p>Trump also said that there were aspects of Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal that would obstruct a UK-US trade deal. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To be honest with you, this deal, under certain aspects of the deal, you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t trade. We can\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK ...</p> \n   <p>Under certain ways, we\u2019re precluded - which would be ridiculous. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>From the extract broadcast just now, it is not clear exactly why Trump thought the Brexit plan would hinder a trade deal, but he may have been referring to its level playing field proposals.</p> \n  <p>Trump rejected claims, which Jeremy Corbyn has been making strongly, that the NHS would be threatened by a UK-US trade deal. Health would not be a part of any deal, Trump claimed. \u201cIt is not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>Trump claimed UK-US trade could be four or five times higher than it is now under a deal, which he said would make Britain \u201cmuch bigger economically than it is right now\u201d.</p> \n  <p>And Trump claimed Corbyn would bad for the UK. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Corbyn would be so bad for your country, he\u2019d be so bad, he\u2019d take you on such a bad way. He\u2019d take you into such bad places. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Corbyn is unlikely to lose any sleep over this non-endorsement. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/explore/public_figure/Donald_Trump\">According to YouGov, </a>two thirds of Britons have a negative opinion of Trump.

It was Labour\u2019s platform that mattered, he said. He replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s not about any individual on this platform. It\u2019s not a presidential election ... It\u2019s about each and every one of us standing as labour candidates - the Labour shadow cabinet or any other position - with all the diversity that we\u2019ve got and all the different life experiences we bring to this country and to our party and to our parliament. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is a lot of truth in this. People do vote for candidates and parties, not individual leaders, and at the last election Labour performed far better than was expected by people who thought that Corbyn\u2019s leadership would be the decisive factor. But elections do decide who serves as prime minister, and you cannot pretend leadership is irrelevant.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that he wanted all NHS services to be delivered by NHS employees. </strong>In response to a question about whether he wanted to stop some NHS services being provided by private companies, as is the case now, he said it was possible to visit a hospital pharmacy now and find that the staff there were not NHS employees. But they wanted to be NHS employees, he said. He went on: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes, I do want our NHS to be one where everyone delivering the services of the NHS are NHS employees, part of the family of NHS employees. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He sidestepped a question about how he would vote in the referendum Labour plans to hold after the election offering a choice between remain and a soft Brexit. </strong>Corbyn has repeatedly refused to answer this question, fuelling speculation that he might personally remain neutral.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to commit Labour to abolishing public schools. </strong>Asked if Labour would get rid of schools like Eton, he said that the manifesto would be decided at a clause V meeting (a meeting of the shadow cabinet, Labour\u2019s national executive committee and union leaders). But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For starters, we will definitely be making sure that all those private schools \u2013 public schools as they call themselves \u2013 will actually have to pay their taxes in a fair and proper way.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This will not come as any surprise to anyone who looked closely at what Angela Rayner, the shadow education, was promising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/22/labour-conference-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-party-to-have-two-deputy-leaders-live-news?page=with:block-5d8748438f08f30dc5bc014b#block-5d8748438f08f30dc5bc014b\">in her speech to the Labour conference in September.</a> But there was a difference between what Rayner actually promised (integrating private schools with state schools), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/22/labour-conference-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-party-to-have-two-deputy-leaders-live-news?page=with:block-5d87aaee8f08f9df5bdd9591#block-5d87aaee8f08f9df5bdd9591\">what the much more radical motion passed by delegates actually promised</a>, and the way Momentum, the organisation for Corbyn supporters, described the significance of the motion.

He recovers, and jokes about there only being seven more weeks of this to go.</p> \n  <p>He says Labour will properly fund youth services.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: How will Labour fix the education system?</em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says the Tories said they were introducing a fair funding system for schools. But that was Orwellian, he says. It was cut after cut after cut.</p> \n  <p>He says he wants to remove the stress on children they suffer under the education system. League tables are great things, he says. He says that as an Arsenal supporter. But he says they do not work for education. They are contributing to rising stress for chldren.

Almost 40% of the children in his community are in poverty. A third of people live in the rented sector. People are terrified of universal credit. He says his community has people who are totally up against it. He has been proud to represent his constituency.</p> \n  <p>And, whatever position he has held, he has always worked flat out to represent the people who elected him.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would you appoint all your shadow cabinet to the same jobs in cabinet?</em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says it would not be appropriate to decide who will serve in cabinet now.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would you serve a full five-year term as PM?</em></p> \n  <p>He says he loves meeting people, he loves campaigning, and he will be so proud to lead a Labour government that ends universal credit and builds the homes the country needs.</p> \n  <p>When he joined Labour in the 1960s, he wanted a more just society and a peaceful world. Nothing in those beliefs has changed.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would Labour abolish Eton?</em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says the manifesto is still being written. He says it will be discussed at the clause V meeting. For starters, Labour will ensure public schools have to pay their taxes in full.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Do you think all leaders should publish their tax returns? </em></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says he and John McDonnell publish theirs in full. The first time he did this, it turned out he had overpaid tax by about \u00a3300.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: When did you last speak to Nicola Sturgeon?</em></p> \n  <p>About 10 days ago, Corbyn says.

It is true that Labour voted against the programme motion, setting aside just three days for MPs to debate the bill. But the programme motion was defeated because the DUP (supposedly Johnson\u2019s allies) and former Tories who had had the whip removed voted against it, and Labour offered to strike a deal with the government on a programme motion giving MPs more time to debate the bill, which may well have passed. But Johnson did not try this, and instead shelved the bill and went for an election.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claims there would be two referendums in 2020 under Labour.</strong> It is true that Labour wants to hold a second Brexit referendum next year, but the party says it would not allow a second Scottish independence referendum in 2020.

You never hear candidates saying that they are on the side of vested interests or the elite (even though some of them are).</p> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has been trying his own version of this positioning, with No 10 advisers saying that, because he is campaigning on a pledge to deliver Brexit, he is standing up for the people against parliament.</p> \n  <p>Corbyn will say he is standing up for the people against the elite, or the \u201cprivileged few\u2019.

      "bodyText": "But that\u2019s it from us this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: Aspects of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would obstruct US-UK trade, Donald Trump claimed in a UK radio interview. No 10 sought to counter the claim, which has the potential to seriously damage Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign, shortly after the interview was broadcast on LBC. Labour batted away criticism from Trump, with the party\u2019s leader accusing the US president of interfering in the UK\u2019s general election. Trump claimed the US did not require the NHS to be on the table in any post-Brexit bilateral trade talks. But Corbyn pointed out that it was Trump who had said it did only a few months ago. The US president used the interview with his ally Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, to try to offer backing to Boris Johnson. He said Corbyn would be \u201cso bad\u201d for the UK and that Farage and Johnson would be an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d if they joined up. Some observers suggested the comments could be more useful to Corbyn than to Johnson. Labour launched its general election campaign, with the party\u2019s leader insisting he will not be its focus. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s not about any individual on this platform. It\u2019s not a presidential election,\u201d Corbyn said when asked about his own personal extremely low approval ratings. Corbyn pledged to immediately begin buying property to house rough sleepers if Labour win the election. The Labour leader added that everyone delivering NHS services should be an NHS employee but he refused to commit Labour to abolishing public schools. He also sidestepped a question about how he would vote in the referendum Labour plans to hold after the election offering a choice between remain and a soft Brexit. You can read a summary of his key points here. Johnson was accused of preventing the publication of a report assessing the security threat posed to the UK by Russia. The cross-party intelligence and security committee said it had expected him to approve publication by now. The former Conservative MP, Antoinette Sandbach, joined the Lib Dems. Sandbach, one of 21 Tory MPs to be kicked out for voting against the government, will contest her current seat on behalf of her new party. A \u00a3100,000 grant awarded to the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s Hacker House company has been declared \u201cappropriate\u201d by the government\u2019s internal audit agency. The report was immediately labelled a \u201cwhitewash\u201d by Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson. The prime minister could be poised to sound the death knell for the UK\u2019s controversial shale gas industry after more than a decade of support for fracking, according to sources. Johnson could promise an effective ban as part of his election campaign and green groups believe it could help kill off the industry. The Labour MP Keith Vaz has been formally suspended from the Commons for six months for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an investigation. The move was endorsed without a vote after a brief Commons debate. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague Rowena Mason has the full story: My colleague, Peter Walker, has just published a story on Sandbach joining the Lib Dems: In June, as the Tory leadership contest raged, Sandbach complained of abuse at the hands of male party colleagues. She tweeted an image of messages she said were from one and suggested that similar abuse had been behind the decisions of three female former Conservative MPs to leave the party. Sandbach, who was then still a Tory MP and was supporting Rory Stewart in the party\u2019s leadership race, said the message read: \u201cYou too are a disgrace. Time you left the party I think.\u201d She added: Barely is the ink dry on the results and the dark ops begin. This from a male conservative MP to me as I sit on the train home. She tagged it with the words \u201ccompletewankspangle\u201d but later deleted the tweet. In a supplementary tweet that remained live, she wrote: It\u2019s bad enough when you get it from complete strangers. Is it any wonder three female MPs left. Just last week, my colleague Maya Wolfe-Robinson visited Sandbach\u2019s constituency; a safe Tory seat is estimated to have voted 52% in favour of leave in the referendum. She reported that Sandbach felt her stance \u2013 voting for Theresa May\u2019s deal, but against a no-deal Brexit \u2013 reflected her constituents\u2019 views. Here\u2019s what she found when she spoke to some of them: Earlier this month, Sandbach lost a vote of confidence among members of her local Conservative party association. She was appealing the withdrawal of the Tory whip, following the prime minister\u2019s decision to remove it after she voted with opposition MPs to take control of the Commons order paper in September. But Tory party members in her Eddisbury constituency in Cheshire passed a vote of no confidence in her. The ballot was symbolic but opened the door to formal deselection. At the time, Sandbach complained of \u201centryism\u201d and said she was granted only six minutes to set out her defence. This is obviously deeply disappointing, but I won\u2019t allow an unrepresentative handful of people decide who gets to be the MP for tens of thousands of Eddisbury voters. All my constituents can rest assured that I will continue to represent them in parliament, standing up for a sensible, pragmatic Brexit deal and confirming that it is what the people want through a \u2018final say\u2019 confirmatory referendum. Antoinette Sandbach has become the latest of the 21 MPs from whom the Tory whip was withdrawn last month to move over the Lib Dems, the party has announced. Sandbach will stand for the party for her current seat in the constituency of Eddisbury, in Cheshire, on 12 December. As the news was announced tonight, she said: This general election will be the most important in my lifetime. People have a very clear choice, the Conservative party offers years of uncertainty whilst the Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit. I\u2019m so proud to stand alongside other Liberal Democrat candidates across the country to fight for a brighter future with Jo Swinson, our candidate to be prime minister. I will stand on my strong local record, helping to secure local investment, fighting for fair funding for our schools and to secure additional funding in local health services. Our country deserves so much better than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. I can\u2019t wait to get to work, win this election and then deliver for my constituents and our country. Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has added: I am delighted to welcome Antoinette to the Liberal Democrats. She is a passionate campaigner, and will be a fantastic candidate at the general election and a great addition to our party. Her defection clearly shows that the Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of Remain and attracting support from right across the political spectrum. Antoinette is one of the millions of people who are tired of the two old parties, led by people who will take our country backwards, not forwards. It is only the Liberal Democrats that will stop Brexit and build the brighter future that our country deserves. The BBC is set to reject Labour\u2019s complaint about a Panorama documentary which alleged widespread antisemitism in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party, according to individuals with knowledge of the case. The decision is likely to set up a clash between the public broadcaster and the opposition that will run during the forthcoming general election campaign. The episode of Panorama entitled \u201cIs Labour Anti-Semitic?\u201d was broadcast this summer and made a number of claims about Labour\u2019s attitude towards the issue in recent years. It interviewed party activists and officials who said they were undermined by senior Labour bosses in their attempts to tackle antisemitism. Labour strongly rejected the programme\u2019s conclusions, which included suggestions from a group of whistleblowers including the former general secretary Iain McNicol that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s director of strategy and communications, Seumas Milne, and the current general secretary, Jennie Formby, interfered with investigations into antisemitism. However, the Guardian has learned that the BBC\u2019s Executive Complaints Unit, the top level of the broadcaster\u2019s internal complaints process, has finished investigating the concerns raised by Labour and decided to back the programme-makers. A BBC spokesperson declined to comment. My colleague, Rowena Mason, has just published this story on Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cPR stunt\u201d visit to a Cambridgeshire hospital: Julia Simons, a 23-year-old medical student, who had confronted the prime minister, said: Staff were not informed even when he was in the hospital. He was too cowardly to face the uncensored opinions of staff because we know the reality the effects of his government\u2019s and party\u2019s policies on patients. A No 10 spokesman has contradicted Trump\u2019s claim that a UK-US trade deal might not be possible under Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit withdrawal agreement. The PM negotiated a new deal which ensures that we take back control of our laws, trade, borders and money; a deal which people said he would never negotiate. Under this new deal, the whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union, which means we can strike our own free trade deals around the world from which every part of the UK will benefit. Last night, my colleague Rowena Mason reported that the Tories\u2019 election campaign was set to be run by Isaac Levido, the former right-hand man of Lynton Crosby. The PM\u2019s de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, was not due to be centrally involved and had remained in Downing Street, she reported. This evening, she has this update: It emerged earlier this afternoon that an inquiry had concluded the \u00a3100,000 government grant given to a firm run by Jennifer Arcuri, the US businesswoman embroiled in a conflict of interest row over her close friendship with Boris Johnson, was \u201cappropriate\u201d. The shadow culture secretary and Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, has now said: This \u2018review\u2019 is a complete whitewash. The documents published raise more questions than we had before. No one reading Hacker House\u2019s grant application would give the company a penny, let alone \u00a3100,000 of tax payers\u2019 money. The fundamental question of why Hacker House was ever given this grant remains unanswered. The public deserve to know why their money was handled so irresponsibly. We will not let this lie. On Corbyn, Trump said: I have great relationships with many of the leaders, including Boris. He\u2019s a fantastic man and I think he\u2019s the exact right guy for the time and I know you and him will end up doing something that could be terrific if you (Farage) and he, if you and he get together as, you know, an unstoppable force. And Corbyn would be so bad for your country. He\u2019d be so bad, he\u2019d take you in such a bad way. He\u2019d take you into such bad places. But, your country has tremendous potential, it\u2019s a great country. Trump told LBC he has got on well with both the current and former prime ministers on a personal level. Referring to the current occupant of No 10, Trump said: Oh yeah, Boris and I have a great friendship, we\u2019ve become friends. Boris and I, when he was running they were saying: \u2018He\u2019s the Trump, he\u2019s the Trump.\u2019 We have a lot of the same things going, I guess. Boris is a terrific guy, you know that he\u2019s a terrific guy. I think it was time for Boris, it was time you needed him. As some correspondents in Westminster have pointed out, this could end up playing better for Labour than for the Conservatives: Referring to his relationships with Theresa May, Trump told LBC: Well, I liked her very much. You know, I disagreed with certain things that she did but I like her; she was always very nice to me, I was nice to her ... I told her exactly how to make a deal but she didn\u2019t listen to me and that\u2019s okay; not everybody listens to me. Some people do. According to May, Trump\u2019s advice to her was to \u201csue the European Union\u201d. Trump also suggested that gossip about the US having its eyes on the NHS may have started with the Labour leader, telling LBC: I don\u2019t even know where your healthcare system started with respect to us taking over your healthcare system. I mean it\u2019s so ridiculous I think Corbyn put that out there. In reality, besides Trump having himself put it out there (see previous post), his ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, has also explicitly and publicly raised the prospect. On US designs on parts of the NHS, Trump told LBC: No, not at all, we wouldn\u2019t even be involved in that no. We\u2019re trying to fix our health service. We all have our health service problems ... No. it\u2019s not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system. No, we\u2019re just talking about trade. The US president has previously contradicted himself on whether or not Washington would want the NHS on the table in trade talks. In June, he said: When you\u2019re dealing on trade, everything is on the table. So NHS or anything else. A lot more than that. Later the same day, he said: I don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade. Here\u2019s what Trump told Farage on his discussions with the prime minister over the latter\u2019s Brexit deal: We wanna do trade with the UK and they wanna do trade with us and, to be honest with you, this deal \u2013 under certain aspects of the deal \u2013 you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t trade. Trump added that the US would be barred from some parts of the UK market under Johnson\u2019s deal; a situation that he said \u201cwould be ridiculous\u201d. Reacting to Trump\u2019s LBC interview, the Lib Dems\u2019 foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, has said: Donald Trump is unfit to hold the office of president of the United States. Boris Johnson is unfit to be prime minister of the United Kingdom. This endorsement is yet another example of the cuddly relationship between the two men. As the saying goes, you can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep. Trump is a bully, a misogynist and a racist. Yet the Conservatives have fawned to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with him. A trade deal that would threaten food standards and our precious NHS. Liberal Democrats will continue to stand up to regressive politics and will continue to fight to stop Brexit and build a brighter future. As has been suggested elsewhere, Farage has opened himself up to claims of hypocrisy by inviting a sitting US president to intervene when the UK is preparing to vote on its future. Here\u2019s what the Brexit party leader told Fox News in 2016 in reaction to Barack Obama saying the UK would be at the back of the queue in trade negotiations if it voted to leave the EU: Vladimir Putin behaved in a more statesmanlike manner than President Obama did in this referendum campaign. Obama came to Britain and, I think, behaved disgracefully; telling us we would be at the back of the queue. Vladimir Putin maintained his silence throughout the whole campaign. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has responded to Trump\u2019s interview with LBC, tweeting: Corbyn\u2019s referring to Trump\u2019s claim that the US would have no involvement in the NHS under a post-Brexit US-UK trade deal. The US president has, at different times, said the NHS would and would not be on the table in any such negotiations. Donald Trump opened his interview with LBC by again repeating his nonsense claim to have correctly predicted the result of the Brexit referendum when he opened his Turnberry golf course on 24 June 2016. The Brexit referendum was held on 23 June 2016. Trump\u2019s interviewer, the political campaigner and Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, nodded, said \u201cyep\u201d and allowed the false claim to pass. Donald Trump has used an interview with his ally Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader and LBC broadcaster, to intervene in the UK election. Trump said that Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cso bad\u201d for the UK, and that Farage and Boris Johnson would be an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d if they joined up in some way. (See 5.28pm.) Trump also criticised Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan, saying it could obstruct a UK-US trade deal. (See 5.28pm.) Corbyn has insisted Labour\u2019s 2019 general election campaign is \u201cnot about me\u201d, as he declined to say whether he would step aside if the party failed to dislodge Johnson from Downing Street in six weeks. Johnson has been accused of preventing the publication of a report assessing the security threat posed by Russia to the UK and whether a future general election could be affected by Kremlin-sponsored disinformation. A \u00a3100,000 grant awarded to the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s Hacker House company by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) has been considered \u201cappropriate\u201d by the government\u2019s internal audit agency. The prime minister could be poised to sound the death knell for the UK\u2019s controversial shale gas industry after more than a decade of support for fracking, according to sources. The Labour MP Keith Vaz has been formally suspended from the Commons for six months for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an investigation, after the Commons endorsed the findings of an inquiry. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. On Radio 4\u2019s PM programme Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, dismissed President Trump\u2019s claim that a Jeremy Corbyn government would take Britain into a bad place. (See 5.28pm.) McDonald said: I think the bad place a lot of Americans experienced [is] at the hands of Donald Trump. So I\u2019m really not concerned that Nigel Farage and Donald Trump have reaffirmed their commitment to one another. We do know that the American pharmaceutical industry is very interested in our national health service and we have made it abundantly clear that the NHS is not for sale and Donald Trump is not going get anywhere near our NHS. And nor are we enthused at the prospect of chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef coming into our country with low standards for food safety. We are not going to be tolerating anything like that. Here is some comment from journalists on the Trump interview. From the BBC\u2019s Jon Sopel From my colleague Paul Johnson From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has recorded an interview with his political ally Donald Trump for his LBC radio show. The whole thing is being broadcast later, but LBC has just broadcast a clip, and it included Trump saying that he thought Farage should be uniting in some way with Boris Johnson. Together Johnson and Farage would be an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d, Trump said. Trump also said that there were aspects of Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal that would obstruct a UK-US trade deal. He said: To be honest with you, this deal, under certain aspects of the deal, you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t trade. We can\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK ... Under certain ways, we\u2019re precluded - which would be ridiculous. From the extract broadcast just now, it is not clear exactly why Trump thought the Brexit plan would hinder a trade deal, but he may have been referring to its level playing field proposals. Trump rejected claims, which Jeremy Corbyn has been making strongly, that the NHS would be threatened by a UK-US trade deal. Health would not be a part of any deal, Trump claimed. \u201cIt is not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system,\u201d he said. Trump claimed UK-US trade could be four or five times higher than it is now under a deal, which he said would make Britain \u201cmuch bigger economically than it is right now\u201d. And Trump claimed Corbyn would bad for the UK. He said: Corbyn would be so bad for your country, he\u2019d be so bad, he\u2019d take you on such a bad way. He\u2019d take you into such bad places. Corbyn is unlikely to lose any sleep over this non-endorsement. According to YouGov, two thirds of Britons have a negative opinion of Trump. Only 19% have a positive view of him - and they are unlikely to include many potential Labour voters. The legislation to allow the early election has now had royal assent, the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley reports. With John Bercow standing down as Speaker at the end of today, here is a Guardian compilation of some of the highlights of his time in the chair. And here are some excerpts from what was said when MPs paid tribute to him yesterday. Boris Johnson was booed as he ended a visit to Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge, the Cambridge News reports. There is a story here and a live blog covering the visit here. The pro-Labour Skwawkbox blog has also posted some footage. These are from Mark Urban, Newsnight\u2019s diplomatic editor, on the story that Boris Johnson has been accused of holding back the publication of a report from parliament\u2019s intelligence and security report looking at the issue of Russian interference in British elections. Labour would rather run a minority government if necessary than try to form a coalition or pact with another party, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said. Speaking to Sky News this morning, at the Labour campaign launch, McDonnell said he expected the party to win a majority. But when asked what would happen if it didn\u2019t, but if it was still in a position to govern (ie, it was the largest party in a hung parliament), he replied: We would run a minority government. We\u2019d implement the policies and we\u2019d expect the other parties to support them. If they didn\u2019t, well, we\u2019ll go back to the people. Look, who wouldn\u2019t vote for a \u00a310 living wage? Who wouldn\u2019t vote for the way in which we want to solve Brexit, going back to the people? Who wouldn\u2019t vote for actually ensuring we invested in all our public services, and a fair taxation system? Asked if Labour would consider a confidence and supply agreement with one of the smaller parties, McDonnell went on: No deals, no deals. We do in as a majority government. If there is a minority, we will implement our manifesto, full stop. Jeremy Corbyn has said that Labour will \u201cimmediately\u201d start rehousing the homeless if it wins the election. Speaking at a campaign event in Milton Keynes, Corbyn called the level of homelessness in the UK a \u201cdisgrace and insult to our country\u201d, and promised a Labour government would end austerity. As the Press Assocaition reports, he said: On our first day in office, we will immediately buy all the properties necessary to house the rough sleepers. Boris Johnson made an election stop at a primary school in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where he joined a group of children in an activity sorting pictures of London into past and present, the Press Association reports. The PM held one black and white image aloft and suggested \u201cpast?\u201d. One pupil agreed and said it \u201clooks dirtier\u201d, to which the prime minister replied: \u201cThat was when Ken Livingstone was running it.\u201d Referring to a photo of London Bridge, Johnson told the youngsters: \u201cYou know what they used to do? They used to stick the decapitated heads of the enemies on spikes.\u201d He also visited a classroom where children were mummifying pumpkins with salt, and another where they made firework collages. At the last election the conventional opinion polls turned out to be a very poor guide to the result. On that basis some people argue they should be ignored completely, but the political parties take them seriously, they are better than most other ways of trying to gauge public opinion and even sceptics will admit that they pick up movements in opinion, even if they don\u2019t provide a reliable guide to the final result. With that in mind, here are the results of the three polls around today. An Ipsos Mori poll for the Evening Standard gives the Tories a 17-point lead over Labour. The poll also confirms that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal approval ratings remain dismal. The Standard reports: Mr Johnson has the best personal scores of any leader since 2017, with 46% satisfied and 44% dissatisfied \u2014 a net score of plus 2. Conservatives are overwhelmingly happy with their leader, with 80% satisfied and 9% dissatisfied. Mr Corbyn has failed to improve since last month\u2019s record-breaking low personal scores. Just 15% of voters are happy with his performance and 75% are unhappy \u2014 a net score of minus 60. Labour voters are divided about their leader, with 46% satisfied and 49% dissatisfied. A YouGov poll gives the Tories a 15-point lead over Labour. A Survation poll for the Daily Mail gives the Tories an eight-point lead over Labour. As the Mail reports, it also gives Boris Johnson a small lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the issue of health. It says: Asked which leader had the best health policies, 36% of voters said Mr Johnson while 34% opted for Mr Corbyn. There is more information here on the Guardian\u2019s election poll tracker. I missed this picture earlier. Perhaps Jeremy Corbyn was practising for when he meets the Queen ... The House of Commons has just approved the recommendation from the Commons standards committee for Keith Vaz to be suspended for six months for offering to buy drugs for sex workers. The motion was passed without a division. With parliament due to be dissolved at the end of Tuesday ahead of the general election, the decision may have little practical effect. Vaz is under pressure not to stand again as a candidate. (See 9.47am). The debate was marked by a bitter exchanges between Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative backbencher, and John Bercow, who is on his last day as Speaker. Bridgen accused Bercow of being biased in favour of Vaz. Bercow denied this and, referring to Bridgen, he told MPs: He can try to smear me, he will get the square root of nowhere. Here is a good question from below the line. You are right, but you are missing something. It was Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby who put it to Jeremy Corbyn that he has the lowest approval rating for any opposition leader since 1977. (See 11.51am.) She was referring to this Ipsos Mori survey. But I don\u2019t think she meant it in the way you have interpreted it. What Ipsos Mori says is that Corbyn has \u201cthe lowest net satisfaction ratings of any opposition leader since the survey began in 1977\u201d - not the lowest rating since the opposition leader in 1977, Margaret Thatcher. Here are the figures. Boris Johnson has been accused of sitting on a key report assessing the threat posed by Russia to Britain\u2019s democratic processes, the Press Association reports. The former attorney general Dominic Grieve argued voters must have access to the report by the intelligence and security committee, which he chairs, given an election has been called for 12 December. He said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the prime minister to \u201csit on it\u201d, informing the Commons that Johnson should have confirmed on Thursday that no classified matters were remaining in the report. The full story is here. After his failure to meet his cast-iron, \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to deliver Brexit by 31 October (today), you might have thought that Boris Johnson would think twice before setting a fresh deadline for Brexit. But he has been at it again. During a visit to Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge, he said if the Conservatives were elected, Brexit would definitely happen by the end of January. He said: If you vote for us and we get our programme through ... then we can be out at the absolute latest by January next year. He also said he had an \u201coven-ready\u201d Brexit deal ready to go if he won the election. This morning the Telegraph splashed on a story saying the Brexit party could stand aside in hundreds of seats - a move that could considerably help the Conservatives, who are at risk from the pro-Brexit vote being split. As Gordon Rayner and James Rothwell report in their story (paywall): Splits have emerged in Nigel Farage\u2019s party over its election strategy, with several senior figures backing the \u2018sensible\u2019 option of focusing its resources on a small number of Leave-voting Labour seats that it stands a realistic chance of winning. One senior Brexit party MEP suggested the party could field as few as 20 candidates, while other sources suggested the figure would be nearer 100. Mr Farage, who previously suggested he would field 600 candidates, said on Wednesday night he was still \u2018working through\u2019 his options, but there are fears at the top of the party that splitting the Leave vote in marginal constituencies could lead to a Jeremy Corbyn premiership. Asked about the report today, Farage played it down, but did not deny it outright. He told PA Media: This is idle speculation. I have not spoken to anyone of any seniority in the party [about this]. The Lib Dems have confirmed they are standing aside in Beaconsfield to help Dominic Grieve, the former Tory, run as a pro-remain independent candidate. Rob Castell, the party\u2019s former parliamentary candidate, said it was true that he would step back because of these \u201cunprecedented times\u201d. Grieve, a supporter of a second referendum and key architect of the parliamentary battle against no deal, said today: I will run as an independent. I have no idea what the outcome will be. All I can do is offer myself to my constituents as an individual. If they want me, I\u2019m here to serve. If they don\u2019t, no hard feelings. In Grieve\u2019s Buckinghamshire seat of Beaconsfield, he won 36,559 votes for the Tories in 2017, compared with Labour\u2019s 12,016 and 4,448 for the Lib Dems. At first minister\u2019s questions in the Scottish parliament the Scottish Tories\u2019 interim leader, Jackson Carlaw, immediately asked Nicola Sturgeon if she\u2019d like to thank Jeremy Corbyn for allowing her a second independence referendum. (Actually Corbyn was yesterday using the same form of words that the Labour leadership has done since the summer: opposing independence but not refusing another referendum, though not in early years of a Labour government. The trouble is that this contradicts Scottish Labour\u2019s official policy and, like their Brexit stance, isn\u2019t easy to put across on the doorsteps.) Sturgeon hit back by asking Carlaw about a story in this morning\u2019s Times, suggesting an electoral pact by Tories and Labour to step back and allow the Lib Dems a clear run in their attempts to oust SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, in his Highland constituency, previously held by the late Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy. She also hit a nerve by telling Carlaw that she sympathised with him, given that his party had so little confidence in him that they used a backbencher\u2019s photo in their election material. This refers to leaflets bearing the face of recently departed leader Ruth Davidson: the loss of her personal voter appeal is something the Scottish Tories are expected to feel keenly during this campaign. While Sturgeon hammered her message that only a vote for the SNP could keep the Tories out of Downing Street, and Carlaw pitched the Tory guarantee of no more referendums, don\u2019t expect the electioneering at Holyrood to let up anytime soon .... Jeremy Corbyn will be pleased with that speech. It had a clear message, it was very well received from the activists in the hall and even the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges, who has cast more vitriol over Corbyn than almost anyone else in the British commentariat, had to concede that Corbyn had done a good job. It did not contain any surprises, but it set out Labour\u2019s platform quite compellingly. The key points from the speech are summarised at 9.02am and at 9.24am. As usual, the more unexpected stuff came in the Q&amp;A. Here are the main points. Corbyn said the election was not about him personally. In response to a question about his own personal extremely low approval ratings, he said it was not a \u201cpresidential election\u201d. It was Labour\u2019s platform that mattered, he said. He replied: It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s not about any individual on this platform. It\u2019s not a presidential election ... It\u2019s about each and every one of us standing as labour candidates - the Labour shadow cabinet or any other position - with all the diversity that we\u2019ve got and all the different life experiences we bring to this country and to our party and to our parliament. There is a lot of truth in this. People do vote for candidates and parties, not individual leaders, and at the last election Labour performed far better than was expected by people who thought that Corbyn\u2019s leadership would be the decisive factor. But elections do decide who serves as prime minister, and you cannot pretend leadership is irrelevant. He said that he wanted all NHS services to be delivered by NHS employees. In response to a question about whether he wanted to stop some NHS services being provided by private companies, as is the case now, he said it was possible to visit a hospital pharmacy now and find that the staff there were not NHS employees. But they wanted to be NHS employees, he said. He went on: Yes, I do want our NHS to be one where everyone delivering the services of the NHS are NHS employees, part of the family of NHS employees. He sidestepped a question about how he would vote in the referendum Labour plans to hold after the election offering a choice between remain and a soft Brexit. Corbyn has repeatedly refused to answer this question, fuelling speculation that he might personally remain neutral. He refused to commit Labour to abolishing public schools. Asked if Labour would get rid of schools like Eton, he said that the manifesto would be decided at a clause V meeting (a meeting of the shadow cabinet, Labour\u2019s national executive committee and union leaders). But he went on: For starters, we will definitely be making sure that all those private schools \u2013 public schools as they call themselves \u2013 will actually have to pay their taxes in a fair and proper way. This will not come as any surprise to anyone who looked closely at what Angela Rayner, the shadow education, was promising in her speech to the Labour conference in September. But there was a difference between what Rayner actually promised (integrating private schools with state schools), what the much more radical motion passed by delegates actually promised, and the way Momentum, the organisation for Corbyn supporters, described the significance of the motion. It put out a press release after the composite was carried saying: \u201cLabour commits to abolishing private schools in next manifesto.\u201d From what Corbyn is saying today, it sounds as if the manifesto will not be saying that. Corbyn refused to commit himself to serving a full five-year term if elected prime minister. He refused to commit to appoint members of the shadow cabinet to the cabinet posts they currently shadow. He said that he last spoke to Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scottish first minster, about 10 days ago. He implied that, if he were prime minister, he would be better than Johnson at maintaining good relations with other parties. I do keep in touch with, obviously, political leaders around the country because that is what leading the party is all about. You know what, when we go into government, it\u2019s going to be so much different and so much better, because we\u2019ll have a different world and a different society and take government that doesn\u2019t try and divide people, but instead tries to bring them together. According to the Times Scottish political editor, Kieran Andrews, Sturgeon was less cordial when speaking about Corbyn at first minister\u2019s questions today. Corbyn said he would like the media to \u201cjust report what we say\u201d. Talking about the campaign, he said: I\u2019ll be all over the country, meeting people, listening to people and taking that message there. And I ask our media, as good journalists, to just report what we say. This was just a plea for fair reporting, but it has attracted some comment on Twitter from journalists who have had to put up with complaints from left that reporting what No 10 says amounts to mere stenography. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said when asked about his own personal extremely low approval ratings. He said it was not a \u201cpresidential election\u201d. It was Labour\u2019s platform that mattered, he said. He explained: It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s not about any individual on this platform. It\u2019s not a presidential election ... It\u2019s about each and every one of us standing as Labour candidates \u2013 the Labour shadow cabinet or any other position \u2013 with all the diversity that we\u2019ve got and all the different life experiences we bring to this country and to our party and to our parliament. The event is now over. I will post a summary shortly. Corbyn is now taking questions from Labour supporters at the event. Q: What will Labour do to improve youth services? Corbyn says we should be cherishing and supporting young people. Some councils have been able to maintain youth services. He says he wants to say thank you to youth workers for what they do. At this point his voice seems to give out for a moment. He recovers, and jokes about there only being seven more weeks of this to go. He says Labour will properly fund youth services. Q: How will Labour fix the education system? Corbyn says the Tories said they were introducing a fair funding system for schools. But that was Orwellian, he says. It was cut after cut after cut. He says he wants to remove the stress on children they suffer under the education system. League tables are great things, he says. He says that as an Arsenal supporter. But he says they do not work for education. They are contributing to rising stress for chldren. That is why Labour would end testing at key stage one and key stage two. More questions. Q: Are you part of the Islington elite? Corbyn says he has been MP for Islington North since 1983. Almost 40% of the children in his community are in poverty. A third of people live in the rented sector. People are terrified of universal credit. He says his community has people who are totally up against it. He has been proud to represent his constituency. And, whatever position he has held, he has always worked flat out to represent the people who elected him. Q: Would you appoint all your shadow cabinet to the same jobs in cabinet? Corbyn says it would not be appropriate to decide who will serve in cabinet now. Q: Would you serve a full five-year term as PM? He says he loves meeting people, he loves campaigning, and he will be so proud to lead a Labour government that ends universal credit and builds the homes the country needs. When he joined Labour in the 1960s, he wanted a more just society and a peaceful world. Nothing in those beliefs has changed. Q: Would Labour abolish Eton? Corbyn says the manifesto is still being written. He says it will be discussed at the clause V meeting. For starters, Labour will ensure public schools have to pay their taxes in full. Q: Do you think all leaders should publish their tax returns? Corbyn says he and John McDonnell publish theirs in full. The first time he did this, it turned out he had overpaid tax by about \u00a3300. Q: When did you last speak to Nicola Sturgeon? About 10 days ago, Corbyn says. He says as a political leader he has to keep in touch. Jeremy Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: Your pitch to the public is similar to your one in 2017. Why do you think the message will work now when you did not win then? Corbyn says he is putting a pitch to the public about what can be achieved. He says there have been three Tory leaders since he became Labour leader. And the government has been defeated in parliament 48 times. He is prepared for this campaign. Q: In 2017 you defied your critics. But now you have the lowest polling ratings of any opposition leader since 1977. How will you get the public to feel the same way about you as people in this room do? And if you lose, will you stand aside? Corbyn says it is not about him, or any individual on this platform. \u201cIt is not a presidential election.\u201d He says it is about Labour candidates, \u201cwith all the diversity we\u2019ve got and all the life experiences we bring to this country\u201d. He says he asks the media to just report what he says. Corbyn counters concerns about his leadership by saying election is not about him. Q: How will you vote in the next Brexit referendum? Corbyn says Brexit has divided people, communities and families. He says there are people who voted leave and remain who experience the same problems. He says Labour wants to take no deal off the table. That is why he refused to support any move that might allow Boris Johnson do to this. He says a Labour government would open negotiations with the EU about a sensible relationship with the EU, that would not destroy jobs. There would be a customs union, which would keep the border in Ireland as it is now. And the Good Friday agreement would be intake. And a sweetheart trade deal with Donald Trump would not be an option. Q: The private sector provides services for thousands of people already under the NHS. Would you end these arrangements? Corbyn says private companies that do not get NHS contracts sue the NHS. He says he asked Richard Branson to give the money Virgin Health got form this to the NHS. He says he wants everyone delivering NHS services to be NHS employees. Corbyn says everyone delivering NHS services should be an NHS employee. From the Scotsman\u2019s Paris Gourtsoyannis Corbyn is now on his peroration. Boris Johnson thought he was being smart holding this election in a dark and cold December. He thinks you won\u2019t go out to vote. He thinks you won\u2019t go out to campaign. Well I say this: Labour will be out there in every city, town and village with the biggest and most confident campaign that our country has ever seen, bringing a message of hope and change to every community. Even if the rivers freeze over, we\u2019re going out to bring about real change for the many, not the few. All we need to keep us warm is the thought of removing Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives from government \u2013 and the chance to rebuild and transform our country. Back in Battersea Arts Centre Corbyn says: when Labour wins, everyone wins. Hundreds of thousands of people in every part of our country who will make this the biggest people-powered campaign in history. We\u2019re young, we\u2019re old, we\u2019re black, we\u2019re white, we\u2019re straight, we\u2019re gay, we\u2019re women, we\u2019re men, we\u2019re people of all faiths and none, from the north and from the south. And when Labour wins, the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins. We all win. The Conservative party press office is posting tweets rebutting Corbyn\u2019s speech as he delivers it. Here are some examples. Corbyn says Boris Johnson wants people to think that Brexit is being blocked by an establishment elite. But people know that the Conservatives are the establishment elite, he says. Corbyn is now using the \u201cwhose side are you on\u201d passage I quoted earlier. (See 9.24am.) Corbyn says a decade of Conservative cuts has done huge damage to the country. After a decade when real wages have fallen, for too many people, what they see is the community they love being run down through years of deliberate neglect. The evidence of a decade of economic vandalism is all around them. It\u2019s there in the boarded up shops. In the closed library and swimming pool. In youth centres that have closed their doors. The high street like a ghost town. The elderly couple who are scared to walk down their road because violent crime has doubled. The army veteran sleeping under blankets in a doorway. People struggling to make ends meet. The mother and her children eating from a food bank because they\u2019ve been forced onto universal credit. That\u2019s the evidence of Conservative cuts. Well I say, no more. Labour would end austerity and scrap universal credit, he says. Corbyn turns to the claim that Brexit could open up the NHS to American corporations. Despite his denials, the NHS is up for grabs by US corporations in a one-sided Trump trade sell-out. Channel 4 Dispatches revealed this week that the cost of drugs and medicines has repeatedly been discussed between US and UK trade officials. Remember Johnson\u2019s famous promise of \u00a3350m a week for the NHS? Well his toxic Brexit trade deal with Trump could hand over \u00a3500m a week of NHS money to big drugs corporations. We will stop them. Labour won\u2019t let Donald Trump get his hands on our National Health Service. It\u2019s not for sale, to him or anyone. (I am using the quotes from the text sent out by Labour. Corbyn is making some minor changes to the text, but the quotes I am using represent what he is saying.) At this point activists in the hall break into a change of \u201cnot for sale\u201d for 10 seconds or so. Corbyn turns to Brexit. Friends, today is the 31st of October, the day Boris Johnson promised we would leave the EU. He said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than delay beyond today. But he has failed. And that failure is his alone. You can\u2019t trust Boris Johnson. Corbyn confirms Labour\u2019s plan to hold a referendum, with voters being given a choice between a \u201csensible deal\u201d and remain. It is not complicated, he says (trying to counter claims that Labour\u2019s Brexit policy is not straightforward.) Corbyn says this election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform the country, and to ensure that no community in any part of the country is ever left behind again. Some people say real change is not possible, he says. Really? A health service where people do not have to wait, and prescriptions are free? Is that asking too much? Is it asking to much to have a care system where people are treated with dignity, with free personal care? It is asking to much to have a real living wage for everyone, including young workers from the age of 16? Is it asking too much to have homes that people can afford, rents that don\u2019t break the bank, and an end to the disgrace of rough sleeping? 30 hours free childcare for all children. A good education from cradle to grave. Is that too much to ask? Corbyn says he would put rail, mail and water into public ownership, ending the Tory rip-off. What about real action on the climate crisis by creating hundreds of thousands of new, green energy jobs in communities where they\u2019re most desperately needed? No, that\u2019s not asking too much. Because we have to radically change course now to avoid living on a hostile and dying planet. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He says he is launching the most ambitious and radical campaign the country has ever seen. If you want to live in a society that works for everyone, not just billionaires, if you want to stop the cuts and save the environment, then this is your chance to vote for it. He says the choice could not be clearer. Labour stands with you, he says. It will put wealth and power in the hands of the many. Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, who think they are born to rule, will only ever look after the few, he says. De Cordova is talking about her constituents who have been affected by government spending cuts. And, on Brexit, she says regardless of how people voted, no one voted for their living standards to go down. Battersea voted overwhelmingly to remain, as she did, she says. And she says only Labour will sort Brexit out, by giving the British people a final say. Labour will end the privatisation of the NHS, she says. It will build more home, and tackle the climate crisis through Labour\u2019s green new deal. Marsha de Cordova, the Labour MP for Battersea, is introducing Jeremy Corbyn. The event is in Battersea Arts Centre. She won the seat from the Tories in 2017 with a majority of 2,416. She says Battersea has a radical history. London\u2019s first black mayor, John Archer, was elected in this very building, she says. The event is starting now. Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow cabinet are coming in. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg The Labour campaign launch is due to start at 11am. These are from the BBC\u2019s Peter Saull, who is there. Last night Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, announced that she would be standing down from parliament. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Radio Leicester this morning, she insisted that she was leaving not \u201cfor any reasons of disagreement with the prime minister or the direction of the government at all\u201d. She said the abuse she had received as an MP had contributed to the decision, adding: I think the role of being an MP has changed. I think the abuse, because of the platforms, because of how strongly people feel about the current political situation, that has changed enormously in the almost 10 years since I started. Here is an updated list of the MPs standing down from the Institute for Government\u2019s Gavin Freeguard. And here is some Twitter comment on Morgan\u2019s resignation. From the Economist\u2019s John Peet From the author and political commentator Robert Harris From Newsnight\u2019s Emily Maitlis Even if women are standing down in the same proportion as men, it does look as if the average age of the women who are standing down is lower than the average age of the departing men. Many of the men going are at the end of their careers. I have not had time to do the maths, but that seems to be less true of the women. More than 300,000 people have applied to register to vote in 48 hours, according to government figures. As the Press Association reports, a total of 139,162 applications were submitted on Tuesday, followed by 177,105 on Wednesday. This is well above the typical number for weekday applications, which has been averaging around 37,000 for the past month. There is no sign of Boris Johnson this morning yet, but here, for the record, is the statement he released overnight ahead of the visits he is doing today to a school, a hospital and a police station. He said: Today should have been the day that Brexit was delivered and we finally left the EU. But, despite the great new deal I agreed with the EU, Jeremy Corbyn refused to allow that to happen \u2013 insisting upon more dither, more delay and more uncertainty for families and business. We cannot continue along this path. I didn\u2019t want an election \u2013 like the country I wanted to get Brexit done, but it is the only way forward. The public wants and expects the government to give them hope and to improve their opportunities. This is exactly what my government has been doing for the past 99 days and exactly what my government will continue to do if the public choose the Conservatives in this election. I want next year to be a great year for our country \u2013 with more investment in frontline NHS services, the recruitment of thousands more police officers to reduce violent crime and investment in every one of our primary and secondary schools across the country. The alternative is for the people of this country to spend the next year, which should be a glorious year, going through the toxic, tedious torpor of two more referendums \u2013 on EU membership and Scottish independence \u2013 thanks to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s incessant indecision. Now is the time to break the deadlock so we can move on as a country. The Conservatives will campaign for a parliament that gets Brexit done and delivers on the people\u2019s priorities, including the NHS, education and crime. And here are the two main points Johnson is making. As is almost routine with Johnson statements, neither of them is properly true. Johnson claims that Labour is to blame for parliament not being able to pass his Bexit deal. It is true that Labour voted against the programme motion, setting aside just three days for MPs to debate the bill. But the programme motion was defeated because the DUP (supposedly Johnson\u2019s allies) and former Tories who had had the whip removed voted against it, and Labour offered to strike a deal with the government on a programme motion giving MPs more time to debate the bill, which may well have passed. But Johnson did not try this, and instead shelved the bill and went for an election. Johnson claims there would be two referendums in 2020 under Labour. It is true that Labour wants to hold a second Brexit referendum next year, but the party says it would not allow a second Scottish independence referendum in 2020. Johnson is making this claim because Corbyn has not ruled out allowing a second Scottish independence referendum at some point, and its exact timing would be a matter of negotiation between London and Edinburgh. Yesterday the Liberal Democrats sent out a note inviting journalists to a slogan launch this morning. That could be a first. Having covered general elections since the 1990s, I\u2019ve seen poster launches, campaign launches and manifesto launches, but never something billed as an event to announce just a slogan. My colleague Peter Walker was there. And it turns out the slogan is: Stop Brexit, Build a Brighter Future. Peter is not over-impressed. While we are on the subject of the Commons standards committee, MPs will later debate a motion saying they should suspend the Labour MP Keith Vaz, as recommended by the committee, for offering to buy drugs for sex workers. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said Vaz should stand down instead of standing for election again. She said: I think he should consider his position. I think he himself should agree not to be a candidate. It has been a very sad issue, not just for him but for his family and his children. When it was put to her that the Labour party has not removed the whip from Vaz, a move that would prevent him from standing again as a Labour candidate, she replied: \u201cNot yet.\u201d The Conservative MP Sir Henry Bellingham has been ordered to apologise to the Commons for the late declaration of a financial interest, the Press Association reports. The Commons standards committee found he did not declare his non-executive chairmanship of Clifton Africa Ltd, an African mining and development company, within the 28 days required. In a report the committee said such cases were normally dealt with through a \u201crectification\u201d procedure, but, despite \u201cextensive\u201d correspondence with the parliamentary commissioner for standards, it said Bellingham had taken \u201cfar too long\u201d to correct the record. As a result, the committee said it was recommending that he should issue a written apology to the house. The Conservatives argue that Labour\u2019s claim to be offering change (see 9.02am) is bogus because the party is offering another referendum on Brexit. This is what James Cleverly, the Tory chairman, said in a statement last night, responding to the advance extracts from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech released in advance. Cleverly said: A vote for Labour is not a vote for change. It is precisely the opposite - a vote for more delay and uncertainty on Brexit, meaning the government can\u2019t focus on people\u2019s priorities, like the NHS, schools and crime. (But Cleverly also said in his statement that Labour\u2019s \u201cextreme economic ideas would wreck the economy\u201d - which I suppose would be change of a sort.) As Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason write in their overnight story, Jeremy Corbyn will use his speech this morning at the Labour campaign launch to assert that his party is on the side of the people. This is another standard piece of election rhetoric. You never hear candidates saying that they are on the side of vested interests or the elite (even though some of them are). Boris Johnson has been trying his own version of this positioning, with No 10 advisers saying that, because he is campaigning on a pledge to deliver Brexit, he is standing up for the people against parliament. Corbyn will say he is standing up for the people against the elite, or the \u201cprivileged few\u2019. And in his speech he will name examples of what he means by the elite. It is worth quoting the passage at lengthy so here it is. You know what really scares the elite? What they\u2019re actually afraid of is paying their taxes. So in this election they\u2019ll fight harder and dirtier than ever before. They\u2019ll throw everything at us because they know we\u2019re not afraid to take them on. So we\u2019re going after the tax dodgers. We\u2019re going after the dodgy landlords. We\u2019re going after the bad bosses. We\u2019re going after the big polluters. Because we know whose side we\u2019re on. So are you on the side of the tax dodgers, who are taking us all for a ride? People who think it\u2019s ok to rip people off, hide their money in tax havens so they can have a new super yacht. Or the children with special educational needs who aren\u2019t getting the support they deserve because of Tory and Lib Dem government cuts? Whose side are you on? The dodgy landlords, like the Duke of Westminster, Britain\u2019s youngest billionaire, who tried to evict whole blocks of families, to make way for luxury apartments? Or the millions of tenants in Britain who struggle to pay their rent each month? Whose side are you on? The bad bosses like Mike Ashley, the billionaire who won\u2019t pay his staff properly and is running Newcastle United into the ground? Or his exploited workforce, like the woman who was reportedly forced to give birth in a warehouse toilet because she was terrified of missing her shift? Whose side are you on? The big polluters like Jim Ratcliffe, Britain\u2019s richest man who makes his money by polluting the environment? Or the children growing up in our cities with reduced lung capacity because of choking pollution? \u201cWhose side are you on? The greedy bankers like Crispin Odey, who makes millions betting against our country and on other people\u2019s misery and donated huge sums to Johnson and the Conservative Party? Or are you on the side of working people, the people who create the wealth that\u2019s then squirreled away in tax havens? And whose side are you on? The billionaire media barons like Rupert Murdoch, whose empire pumps out propaganda to support a rigged system. Or the overwhelming majority who want to live in a decent, fair, diverse and prosperous society? You know whose side Labour\u2019s on. And we have something that the Rupert Murdochs, the Mike Ashleys, and the Boris Johnsons don\u2019t have. We have people. Hundreds of thousands of people in every part of our country, who will make this the biggest people-powered campaign in history. Essentially there are only three sorts of election campaign: \u2018it\u2019s time for a change\u2019; \u2018give us more time to finish the job\u2019; or (when all else fails) \u2018don\u2019t let the other lot ruin it\u2019. The easiest and most effective message is normally the first one (which is why sometimes incumbents even try and run on a \u2018change\u2019 platform) and today this is what Jeremy Corbyn will offer the electorate when he launches Labour\u2019s election campaign at an event with the shadow cabinet. According to extracts released in advance, Corbyn will say: We stand for the many. Boris Johnson\u2019s born-to-rule Conservatives protect the privileged few. They\u2019ve slashed taxes for the richest and vital services and support for everyone else. But real change is coming. We will end the Conservatives\u2019 great rip-off by putting rail, mail and water into public ownership so they work for everyone, not just Tory donors and shareholders in tax havens. We will invest in every nation and region, rebuild our public services and give our NHS, schools and police the money they need by taxing those at the top to properly fund services for everyone. This election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country, take on the vested interests holding people back and ensure that no community is left behind. I will quote more from the speech soon. And here is our overnight election story, also covering what Corbyn will say. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Lib Dems launch their election slogan, which will be on a poster on a van that will later drive around Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Islington North constituency. After 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a business statement in the Commons. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow cabinet launch Labour\u2019s general election campaign at an event at Battersea Arts centre in south London. After 11am: MPs debate the standards committee recommendation for Labour\u2019s Keith Vaz to be suspended for six months. Boris Johnson is also doing election visits today, going to a hospital, a school and a police station in different parts of the country to highlight what he calls \u201cthe people\u2019s priorities\u201d. It is John Bercow\u2019s last day in office as Commons Speaker. And at some point today the culture department is expected to publish its report into how Johnson\u2019s close friend, the American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, secured a \u00a3100,000 grant from the department. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively on general election developments. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

When you\u2019re selling 8.7m vehicles a year, that stuff can add up to a large number. But is it right to call it a merger? Each set of shareholders will get 50% of the new Dutch holding company, but that\u2019s not the whole story. Fiat Chrysler is extracting a lot more value, in the form of cash and businesses, before the transaction takes place. The share price reaction told the tale \u2013 Fiat Chrysler up 8%, PSA down 13%. PSA gets the better end of the boardroom split, with its chief executive Carlos Tavares behind the wheel, but it\u2019s paying for the privilege. A Jefferies analyst reckons PSA is paying an effective 32% takeover premium for control. The Italian Agnelli family, who control Fiat Chrysler, look to be the winners. Lloyds looks in decent shape despite \u00a322bn PPI hit By way of reminder, Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s first estimate of its bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance, or PPI, was \u00a33.2bn. That was back in 2011. Final total: \u00a321.8bn, probably. The last gasp of PPI ruined the quarterly figures but, beyond the minimal headline profits, life doesn\u2019t look too bad. \u201cCredit quality remains strong,\u201d said the bank. If that assessment is correct, it\u2019s a decent boast at this late stage of the business cycle.",

      "body": "<p>Larry Elliott\u2019s column (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/24/eu-workers-rights-capital-multinationals\" title=\"\">The EU is no defender of workers\u2019 rights</a>, 25 October) argues that social Europe \u201cnever delivered all that much\u201d. Europe may not yet be the socialist paradise we want it to become, but dismissing all its achievements on workers\u2019 rights is a costly mistake. Elliott\u2019s piece does not mention the most symbolic of all EU labour regulations: the working time directive. A longstanding obsession of the Tories and neoliberals in Britain, it remains the only standard applicable in the UK protecting workers against longer hours.</p> <p>Regarding other rights like paid annual leave, workplace equality, part-time work, maternity and parental leave, workplace safety etc, the EU legislated to ensure the minimum standards are met in every single member state, whose government can then be even more generous \u2013 and, if not, the safety net is there to protect those most at risk.</p> <p>Elliott\u2019s argument that this is mere pessimism misses the point that as long as we trade with the rest of the world, we need decent labour standards abroad, as well as at home, to protect UK workers against social dumping. This is actually a red line for the EU in Brexit negotiations: ensuring a level playing field, so that EU workers are protected against future deregulation in the UK.</p> <p>The revision of the EU posting of workers directive will put posted workers and their local co-workers on an equal footing, enshrining the principle of equal pay for equal work in the same workplace. Employers are now obliged to offer equal pay from the start of the posting, as well as the same allowances and reimbursement for travel and accommodation costs. It also allows the UK to deem national collective agreements as mandatory for posted workers \u2013 something that effectively solves the problems resulting from the Viking and Laval European court of justice case law that Elliott refers to.</p> <p>There are battles we can\u2019t fight on our own. Workers\u2019 rights in a globalised economy is one of them.<br><strong>Jude Kirton-Darling MEP </strong><em>Labour\u2019s spokesperson on employment and social affairs in the European parliament</em><br><strong>Agnes Jongerius MEP </strong><em>Coordinator for </em><em>Socialists &amp; Democrats group in the employment and social affairs committee of the European parliament</em></p> <p>\u2022 While Larry Elliott has every right to express some scepticism about the EU\u2019s defence of workers\u2019 rights, he shouldn\u2019t forget that the EU has been a crucible of innovation for gender equality policies, and regulation, to encourage male involvement in the care of young children. If the UK implements the 2019 <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=89&amp;furtherNews=yes&amp;newsId=9438&amp;langId=en\" title=\"\">work-life balance directive</a> by 2022 two of our four months of parental leave will need to be ringfenced for fathers/partners and be paid.</p> <p>At the moment UK parental leave is unpaid and confused in parents\u2019 minds with shared parental leave (SPL). British fathers/partners can only use SPL if mothers transfer their maternity leave entitlements.

      "bodyText": "Larry Elliott\u2019s column (The EU is no defender of workers\u2019 rights, 25 October) argues that social Europe \u201cnever delivered all that much\u201d. Europe may not yet be the socialist paradise we want it to become, but dismissing all its achievements on workers\u2019 rights is a costly mistake. Elliott\u2019s piece does not mention the most symbolic of all EU labour regulations: the working time directive. A longstanding obsession of the Tories and neoliberals in Britain, it remains the only standard applicable in the UK protecting workers against longer hours. Regarding other rights like paid annual leave, workplace equality, part-time work, maternity and parental leave, workplace safety etc, the EU legislated to ensure the minimum standards are met in every single member state, whose government can then be even more generous \u2013 and, if not, the safety net is there to protect those most at risk. Elliott\u2019s argument that this is mere pessimism misses the point that as long as we trade with the rest of the world, we need decent labour standards abroad, as well as at home, to protect UK workers against social dumping. This is actually a red line for the EU in Brexit negotiations: ensuring a level playing field, so that EU workers are protected against future deregulation in the UK. The revision of the EU posting of workers directive will put posted workers and their local co-workers on an equal footing, enshrining the principle of equal pay for equal work in the same workplace. Employers are now obliged to offer equal pay from the start of the posting, as well as the same allowances and reimbursement for travel and accommodation costs. It also allows the UK to deem national collective agreements as mandatory for posted workers \u2013 something that effectively solves the problems resulting from the Viking and Laval European court of justice case law that Elliott refers to. There are battles we can\u2019t fight on our own. Workers\u2019 rights in a globalised economy is one of them. Jude Kirton-Darling MEP Labour\u2019s spokesperson on employment and social affairs in the European parliament Agnes Jongerius MEP Coordinator for Socialists &amp; Democrats group in the employment and social affairs committee of the European parliament \u2022 While Larry Elliott has every right to express some scepticism about the EU\u2019s defence of workers\u2019 rights, he shouldn\u2019t forget that the EU has been a crucible of innovation for gender equality policies, and regulation, to encourage male involvement in the care of young children. If the UK implements the 2019 work-life balance directive by 2022 two of our four months of parental leave will need to be ringfenced for fathers/partners and be paid. At the moment UK parental leave is unpaid and confused in parents\u2019 minds with shared parental leave (SPL). British fathers/partners can only use SPL if mothers transfer their maternity leave entitlements. Evidence shows that these maternal transfer designs, with low income replacement, are ineffective in promoting parental sharing in these vital early years. The UK\u2019s statutory maternity leave is only highly paid for six weeks at 90% income replacement, followed by 33 weeks at a low flat rate (\u00a3145.18 weekly). Working mothers across Europe are much more likely to have 14 weeks at full income replacement. Professor Margaret O\u2019Brien Director, Thomas Coram Research Unit, University College London \u2022 Ronald E Conway (Letters, 29 October), in seeking to justify the contribution of the EU to worker health and safety, ignores the improvements in the UK since the 1970s driven by the groundbreaking 1974 Health and Safety at Work etc Act.

The number of worker fatalities had been on a downward trend since the early 1980s, and that trend continued after EU legislation came into play in the 1990s; how far EU law impacted on that continuing reduction is difficult to judge, but it was not the main driver. Risk assessment was implicit in managing health and safety risks well before the EU-based management of health and safety at work regulations were made in 1992. The core duty on employers under the 1974 act \u201cto ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of their employees\u201d required risk identification and risk management \u2013 the key components of risk assessment. Yes, the EU has promoted significant improvements in health and safety, for example through the display screen equipment and workplace directives.

It does not have to. Remain is a decision that should be taken by the people, not the political elites of party leaders and advisers, still less the offshore-owned press and the US-financed outfits that have been campaigning against Europe all this century.</p> <p>Labour now has a clear policy of offering a referendum on Brexit. That is a good democratic offer and strongly supported by Labour leaders like John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, most MPs and nearly all party activists, as well as the party conference. One can have pointless \u201chow many angels dancing on the head of a pin\u201d debates about Labour\u2019s talks with Brussels in the event of Labour heading a government, but Brussels is used to such processes. Look at Labour\u2019s talks after winning power in 1974 followed by the 1975 referendum, or the Danish and Irish talks on their status in the EU after voters said no in their referendums.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s key message should be \u201ctrust the people\u201d after the hopeless mess political elites have made of Brexit since 2016. In effect Labour can make a two-for-one manifesto offer. Vote Labour and you firstly get policies addressing the disastrous austerity legacy of Tory-Lib Dem ministers between 2010 and 2015 and, secondly, you get the right that Boris Johnson will deny you to decide the nation\u2019s future relations with our friends and partners in Europe.<br><strong>Dr Denis MacShane</strong><br><em>Former Europe minister</em></p> <p>\u2022 In your profile of Andrew Murray, Labour\u2019s chief of staff, rightly asserts that \u201cpolitics takes a while to catch up with economics\u201d but that the financial crash of 2008 has left those wanting a return to New Labour or \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with nowhere to go. Neoliberalism has run its course. Where he is rather less perceptive is failing to recognise that his own politics have hit exactly the same problem.</p> <p>Lexit, the dream of \u201csocialism in one country\u201d, or even a go-it-alone Keynesianism, ran out of road more than four decades ago. For all European nations the optimal economic area is now continental in scale. All the main production processes rely on integrated supply chains, operating across borders. Everywhere, there has been a huge surge in cross-border commercial activity. That\u2019s why 10,000 freight vehicles a day pass through Dover and around 4.4 million lorry journeys are made between the rest of the EU and the UK each year.</p> <p>For the left and progressives generally, the alternative to hyper-globalisation cannot be a retreat to nationalist boltholes. Rather it has to develop a trans-European strategy that corresponds to the realities of the 21st-century economy and the profound challenges thrown up by the environmental crisis.

      "bodyText": "My old friend Andrew Murray is correct to say that Labour cannot afford to obsess over remain in the election campaign (Labour should stay neutral on Brexit, says key adviser, 31 October). It does not have to. Remain is a decision that should be taken by the people, not the political elites of party leaders and advisers, still less the offshore-owned press and the US-financed outfits that have been campaigning against Europe all this century. Labour now has a clear policy of offering a referendum on Brexit. That is a good democratic offer and strongly supported by Labour leaders like John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, most MPs and nearly all party activists, as well as the party conference. One can have pointless \u201chow many angels dancing on the head of a pin\u201d debates about Labour\u2019s talks with Brussels in the event of Labour heading a government, but Brussels is used to such processes. Look at Labour\u2019s talks after winning power in 1974 followed by the 1975 referendum, or the Danish and Irish talks on their status in the EU after voters said no in their referendums. Labour\u2019s key message should be \u201ctrust the people\u201d after the hopeless mess political elites have made of Brexit since 2016. In effect Labour can make a two-for-one manifesto offer. Vote Labour and you firstly get policies addressing the disastrous austerity legacy of Tory-Lib Dem ministers between 2010 and 2015 and, secondly, you get the right that Boris Johnson will deny you to decide the nation\u2019s future relations with our friends and partners in Europe. Dr Denis MacShane Former Europe minister \u2022 In your profile of Andrew Murray, Labour\u2019s chief of staff, rightly asserts that \u201cpolitics takes a while to catch up with economics\u201d but that the financial crash of 2008 has left those wanting a return to New Labour or \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with nowhere to go. Neoliberalism has run its course. Where he is rather less perceptive is failing to recognise that his own politics have hit exactly the same problem. Lexit, the dream of \u201csocialism in one country\u201d, or even a go-it-alone Keynesianism, ran out of road more than four decades ago. For all European nations the optimal economic area is now continental in scale. All the main production processes rely on integrated supply chains, operating across borders. Everywhere, there has been a huge surge in cross-border commercial activity. That\u2019s why 10,000 freight vehicles a day pass through Dover and around 4.4 million lorry journeys are made between the rest of the EU and the UK each year. For the left and progressives generally, the alternative to hyper-globalisation cannot be a retreat to nationalist boltholes. Rather it has to develop a trans-European strategy that corresponds to the realities of the 21st-century economy and the profound challenges thrown up by the environmental crisis. How long do we have to wait for Andrew Murray\u2019s politics and those of his fellow Lexiteers to catch up with economic reality?

The Labour leader named five members of \u201cthe elite\u201d he would target if he becomes prime minister: Mike Ashley, the owner of Sports Direct; Crispin Odey, a hedge fund boss who made millions betting against the pound in the run-up to the EU referendum; Jim Ratcliffe, the chief executive of the petrochemicals company Ineos; Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Sun and the Times; and Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, who controls a large central London property empire. \u201cThis election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country, take on the vested interests holding people back and ensure that no community is left behind,\u201d Corbyn said as he launched Labour\u2019s general election campaign in south London. \u201cTogether, we can pull down a corrupt system and build a fairer country that genuinely does care for all.\u201d Mike Ashley Who is he? Ashley is the 74th richest person in the UK, with an estimated \u00a32bn fortune. He owns a 62% stake in Sports Direct, which has 670 stores and employs about 17,000 people. He also owns the House of Fraser department store chain and Newcastle United football club. The charge sheet Corbyn said Ashley was an example of a \u201cbad boss\u201d who exploits workers by using zero-hours contracts. He said one of Ashley\u2019s employees had felt \u201cforced to give birth in a warehouse toilet because she was terrified of missing her shift\u201d. MPs have previously accused Ashley of running Sports Direct like a \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d, after a Guardian undercover investigation in 2015 revealed conditions at its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.

      "bodyText": "After just over a decade as Speaker and an estimated 14,000 throaty cries of \u201cOrder!\u201d, it was perhaps typical of John Bercow that his final day in the Commons featured not only lengthy tributes but a brutal row with an MP conducted with his trademark icy passive-aggression. Bercow, possibly the most high-profile modern Speaker, and certainly the most interventionist and divisive, had faced what was, by recent standards, a relatively low-key day in the chamber. It was during one of these \u2013 a half-hour debate on endorsing a disciplinary report on the Labour MP Keith Vaz \u2013 that Bercow found time for a final disagreement with one of his many long-time foes, Andrew Bridgen. After the Tory MP used his speech to accuse Bercow of being too lax over Vaz, the Speaker ordered Bridgen to sit down, admonishing him for \u201cextreme folly as well as sheer nastiness\u201d. Bridgen sarcastically thanked Bercow for his \u201chelp and advice\u201d, but was again stopped in his tracks. \u201cDon\u2019t mix it with the chair,\u201d Bercow fumed, face fixed into what Boris Johnson had half-affectionately described the day before as his \u201cTony Montana scowl\u201d, a reference to Al Pacino\u2019s character in Scarface. The paradox of this ferocious set-to was that it came almost immediately after MPs had spent slightly under three hours lavishing praise on Bercow. Some tributes were notably arch, such as when Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, assured Bercow that his much-used arcane verbs such as \u201cchuntering\u201d were \u201cnow in common parlance in pubs and clubs across England\u201d. But others were hugely sincere. Rosie Duffield thanked Bercow for his kindness to her family when she was sworn in as the 2017-elected Labour MP for Canterbury, saying her father, who has Alzheimer\u2019s, still repeatedly talks with fondness of the day. It was, overall, probably a fitting swan song for the 157th Speaker, who is standing down at December\u2019s election after 22 years in the Commons, the first dozen as a Tory MP and shadow minister. While Bercow took over amid the furore of the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal, his prominence has grown since the 2016 Brexit referendum, where he has proved a regular thorn in the side of government, allowing backbench MPs significant scope to shape \u2013 some critics would say obstruct \u2013 the departure process. Commons-watchers say Bercow has reshaped the role of his office, for example with the huge increase in urgent questions to ministers. \u201cI think he\u2019s changed the nature of the role,\u201d said Ruth Fox, director of the parliamentary research group the Hansard Society. Bercow\u2019s greatest impact was perhaps \u201cin making parliament a more outward-facing institution\u201d, Fox said, such as his work with the education centre and youth parliament. Even his notoriety must be seen in the political context of the era, she added: \u201cHe\u2019s a Speaker who for three-quarters of his time in office has presided over a hung parliament. He\u2019s had to make decisions at a time when political parties are fragmented, and haven\u2019t really operated in parliament as they normally do. \u201cWe\u2019ll only really get a sense of his record and his reputation when he\u2019s gone and we see how his successor fares. Because if his successor faces some or all of these same challenges, we\u2019ll see how they deal with it. \u201cWe\u2019ll also see if backbench MPs are happy if his successor is less inclined to defend their rights and more inclined to allow the executive an easier ride.\u201d There are, however, some more obviously troubling aspects to Bercow\u2019s tenure. He has been accused by former aides of bullying. He vehemently denies the claims, but his departure means the investigatory process could stop. And while Bercow\u2019s colourfully-worded put-downs might have earned him a global audience, some MPs vehemently dislike what they say can be a bullying, condescending manner in the chair. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant, among nine MPs seeking to replace Bercow in an election process scheduled for Monday, told the Guardian last week he had recently walked out of the Commons chamber as he disliked the way the Speaker was chastising one Conservative. What seems clear is that whatever of Bercow\u2019s procedural innovations remain under a new Speaker, their style will be different. It is perhaps no surprise that the two favourites are Lindsay Hoyle and Eleanor Laing, both deputy Speakers, who are known quantities and significantly more understated in their approach. As for Bercow, who has three school-age children, he must now vacate the lavish apartment inside parliament that comes with the job, and at the age of 56, seek a new career. Previous Speakers have been made peers, but several government briefings have indicated that Bercow will be denied this. However, the attention-grabbing manner that perhaps played a role in this could bring an alternative path, with several reports that he will be in demand on the US lecture circuit. Those up for the Speaker\u2019s job Lindsay Hoyle: the Labour MP for Chorley since 1997, and a deputy Speaker since 2010, he is seen as the front-runner for the post. Eleanor Laing: another deputy Speaker, Laing is a Conservative, and is MP for Epping Forest. She could pip Hoyle to the job. Chris Bryant: a popular Labour backbencher and self-professed Commons geek \u2013 he has written a two-volume history of parliament \u2013 Bryant is another possible winner. Rosie Winterton: also a deputy Speaker, since 2017, Winterton was formerly Labour\u2019s chief whip. Harriet Harman: the longest-serving female MP and a reformer of its procedures for decades, the Labour MP has campaigned energetically but is now seen as perhaps an outsider. Meg Hillier: an east London Labour MP, she chairs the influential Public Accounts Committee. Edward Leigh: veteran Tory backbencher \u2013 he has represented Gainsborough since 1983. Henry Bellingham: a Tory of the same vintage, being MP for North West Norfolk since 1983. Shailesh Vara: yet another Conservative. MP for North West Cambridgeshire since 2005 and a former Northern Ireland minister.",

Social media are no different. Zuckerberg makes the same claim as America\u2019s gun lobby: Facebook does not kill people, people do. As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden revelations</a> showed, the boundary between social media and mass surveillance, whether by capitalism or the state, is now hopelessly permeable. Like any market, this one must be regulated. It is a poor comment on western democracy that it still is not.</p> <p>Anyone delving into this realm is easily lost in technology and jargon, but we must try. Wiser heads \u2013 including at times Zuckerberg himself \u2013 have recognised that things are getting out of hand. Facebook, Google and Twitter this year lobbied the British government to introduce a mechanism for combating \u201conline harm\u201d. They remain reluctant to take that responsibility themselves.</p> <p>I believe this presents a regulatory challenge on a scale not seen since the early debates over nuclear weapons. We must somehow disentangle the public from the private digital sphere. There must be control over those who trade the identities and behaviour of individual citizens. We must define the concept of causing online harm, as distinct from causing offence. We must place obligation and liability on digital \u201cpublishers\u201d for the accuracy and legality of third-party content \u2013 as we do on conventional publishers.</p> <p>As in any public forum, anonymity must end for those expecting the privilege of access to public debate. Facebook and others accept de facto moral liability, by filtering and censoring \u201cunsuitable\u201d content. They accept, at last, that showing teenagers how to take their own lives is not free speech but public menace.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/facebook-earnings-twitter-performance-finances\">Political controversies overshadow Facebook's strong financial report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now they must accept that regulators should dictate the rules of democracy, or it will degenerate into an online Game of Thrones. Publishers have an obligation not to disseminate lies. One reason for the ongoing popularity of the mainstream media, such as the BBC, the New York Times and this newspaper, is that their information is trusted. Some editor is subjecting their output to some ideal of balance, fairness and accuracy. Material is not spewed out at random, or targeted so as to confirm individual bias. Editors are not, as early web enthusiasts predicted, out of date. They are necessary.</p> <p>The British press has fought against state regulation, other than over monopoly and laws of libel. I think that is right, not out of principle but because statutory regulation is not justified by press misbehaviour or imbalance \u2013 or not yet. Self-regulation sort of works. At present it is not the mainstream media driving decent people out of politics. It is what Zuboff calls the \u201cpsychic numbing of strip-search technology\u201d. We have not begun to grasp its potency or its aura of invincibility. Today\u2019s robber barons steal from us not our money but something more important, our privacy and integrity as individuals. They cannot remain unregulated.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Zuckerberg makes the same claim as America\u2019s gun lobby: Facebook does not kill people, people do. As the Edward Snowden revelations showed, the boundary between social media and mass surveillance, whether by capitalism or the state, is now hopelessly permeable. Like any market, this one must be regulated. It is a poor comment on western democracy that it still is not. Anyone delving into this realm is easily lost in technology and jargon, but we must try. Wiser heads \u2013 including at times Zuckerberg himself \u2013 have recognised that things are getting out of hand. Facebook, Google and Twitter this year lobbied the British government to introduce a mechanism for combating \u201conline harm\u201d. They remain reluctant to take that responsibility themselves. I believe this presents a regulatory challenge on a scale not seen since the early debates over nuclear weapons. We must somehow disentangle the public from the private digital sphere. There must be control over those who trade the identities and behaviour of individual citizens. We must define the concept of causing online harm, as distinct from causing offence. We must place obligation and liability on digital \u201cpublishers\u201d for the accuracy and legality of third-party content \u2013 as we do on conventional publishers. As in any public forum, anonymity must end for those expecting the privilege of access to public debate. Facebook and others accept de facto moral liability, by filtering and censoring \u201cunsuitable\u201d content. They accept, at last, that showing teenagers how to take their own lives is not free speech but public menace. Now they must accept that regulators should dictate the rules of democracy, or it will degenerate into an online Game of Thrones. Publishers have an obligation not to disseminate lies. One reason for the ongoing popularity of the mainstream media, such as the BBC, the New York Times and this newspaper, is that their information is trusted. Some editor is subjecting their output to some ideal of balance, fairness and accuracy. Material is not spewed out at random, or targeted so as to confirm individual bias. Editors are not, as early web enthusiasts predicted, out of date. They are necessary. The British press has fought against state regulation, other than over monopoly and laws of libel. I think that is right, not out of principle but because statutory regulation is not justified by press misbehaviour or imbalance \u2013 or not yet. Self-regulation sort of works. At present it is not the mainstream media driving decent people out of politics. It is what Zuboff calls the \u201cpsychic numbing of strip-search technology\u201d. We have not begun to grasp its potency or its aura of invincibility. Today\u2019s robber barons steal from us not our money but something more important, our privacy and integrity as individuals. They cannot remain unregulated. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The Labour MP Keith Vaz has been formally suspended from the Commons for six months for offering to buy drugs for sex workers and failing to cooperate with an investigation, after the Commons endorsed the findings of an inquiry. The case of the Leicester East MP was rushed through the Commons before the dissolution of parliament next week so as to assist the Labour party if it decides to prevent him from standing again in the 12 December election. Following a brief Commons debate on the report by the standards committee, published on Monday, it was endorsed without a vote. If Vaz is re-elected he could face further action from the committee over comments posted to his personal website following the report, the Commons was told. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, who also represents a Leicester seat, told the debate that the statement on Vaz\u2019s website dismissed the inquiry\u2019s finding, calling some of the evidence \u201ccompleted discredited\u201d, and denied he had been uncooperative. In response the chair of the standards committee, Labour\u2019s Kate Green, said it would be open for the newly-constituted committee to hear a complaint about this. If Vaz was re-elected, she added, his six-month suspension would be held over to the next parliament. The inquiry into Vaz examined claims published in the Sunday Mirror in 2016 that he offered to buy cocaine for male sex workers while posing as an industrial washing machine salesman. Vaz\u2019s explanation, which included that he had amnesia and could not recall key events, was \u201cnot believable and, indeed, ludicrous\u201d, the inquiry found. It examined claims that Vaz visited a flat he owned and met two men who recorded the events that followed. Vaz told the Romanian male escorts his name was Jim and he was a washing machine salesman.

The Conservatives will campaign for a parliament that gets Brexit done and delivers on the people\u2019s priorities, including the NHS, education and crime.\u201d Corbyn will dismiss Johnson\u2019s claims to represent the \u201cpeople\u201d at his campaign launch event in south London, where he will promise to take on \u201cborn-to-rule Conservatives,\u201d who \u201cprotect the privileged few\u201d. Among his criticisms of high-profile businessmen, Corbyn will renew his war of words with the Sports Direct founder, asking: \u201cWhose side are you on? The bad bosses like Mike Ashley, the billionaire who won\u2019t pay his staff properly and is running Newcastle United into the ground? Or his exploited workforce, like the woman who was reportedly forced to give birth in a warehouse toilet because she was terrified of missing her shift?\u201d He will also take aim at \u201cbig polluters\u201d such as Britain\u2019s richest man Jim Ratcliffe, \u201cgreedy bankers\u201d such as Odey and \u201cbillionaire media barons\u201d such as Murdoch. Labour has launched a funding drive, hoping to repeat its success in 2017 of raising millions of pounds through small, individual donations from members and supporters. The Corbyn-supporting campaign group Momentum announced on Wednesday that it had raised \u00a3100,000 within 12 hours of the election being called \u2013 and Labour emailed supporters to say it had already taken in \u00a3400,000. Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, Laura Parker, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been completely blown away. This surge in donations shows the huge strength of our people-powered movement, and that if we all step up, chip in and get involved we can beat the Tories and their big corporate donors. I\u2019m proud Momentum has no big corporate backers and that we\u2019re powered by the donations of ordinary people who want real change across the country.\u201d Labour strategists insist they will fight an offensive campaign, pushing resources into the constituencies the party would have to win to put Corbyn in No 10. In 2017, Corbyn allies complained that cautious Ed Miliband-era officials constrained their ambition and devoted too much funding to defending potentially vulnerable seats. The party will also have to confront critical decisions about the content of the manifesto. Grassroots campaign groups allied to Momentum are pushing for the inclusion of radical policies on issues including migration and the future of public schools, which were passed at Labour\u2019s conference. A final decision would be taken by a meeting of party decision-makers, including trade union representatives and members of the ruling national executive committee (NEC), with some urging caution. While the campaign is expected to focus on Brexit and the debate over funding of public services, the Conservatives will also attempt to link Labour to the possibility of another Scottish independence referendum. During his visits on Thursday, Johnson will again accuse Corbyn of wanting to tie up next year in the \u201ctoxic, tedious torpor of two more referendums\u201d on both Brexit and Scotland. Labour accused Johnson of \u201cfantasy and fake news\u201d for repeatedly suggesting Labour would hold two referendums in 2020 if Corbyn becomes prime minister. While Corbyn\u2019s spokesman repeatedly ruled out a new independence poll in the \u201cformative years\u201d of a Labour government, he made clear Corbyn would be prepared to give the green light to one later in the next parliament. Corbyn and Johnson both rehearsed their campaign attack lines as they faced each other at PMQs on Wednesday for the final time before the 12 December general election. Johnson accused the Labour leader of \u201cconsigning next year, which should be a wonderful year for our country, to two more referendums: another referendum on the EU because he cannot make up his mind what he thinks, flip-flopping this way and that; and another referendum on Scottish independence.\u201d His spokesman later suggested Labour had struck a \u201cbackroom deal\u201d with Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National party (SNP). A Labour spokesman said: \u201cThere is no such agreement. There is no commitment to such a referendum. Labour doesn\u2019t support there being another Scottish independence referendum, and we\u2019ve set out a very clear position that we would not agree to such a thing in the formative years of a Labour government \u2013 so I think we can put that claim down to fantasy and fake news.\u201d He added: \u201cAt the same time, if there was a request from the Scottish parliament and the Scottish government later on, we would not seek to block it.\u201d The clash over Scotland\u2019s future came as Labour fires up its campaign machine for a bruising six weeks on the road. Corbyn will launch the party\u2019s campaign on Thursday morning, and plans to criss-cross the country in a battle bus, as he did in 2017. Labour has repeatedly said there will be no formal pacts or coalitions with the SNP. But some shadow cabinet ministers privately admit they are relaxed about the prospect of an agreement of some kind with Sturgeon\u2019s party. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and Corbyn have worked closely with each other in recent weeks, as the opposition parties have cooperated to block a no-deal Brexit. The SNP seized on the comments. Pete Wishart, one of its MPs, said: \u201cThis election is only on day one, and the SNP\u2019s argument for Scotland\u2019s right to choose its own future is winning.\u201d",
