The calculation was that Gove would be more brutal in debate. After tonight, that\u2019s not looking such a good judgment because Hunt was more assertive than we\u2019ve seen him before, challenging Johnson repeatedly on specifics. Judged on these skirmishes, Hunt won the debate handsomely. He came over as better briefed and more forensic, and there were several moments in the debate where Johnson found bluster and bonhomie a poor substitute for arguments.</p> \n  <p>That said, given what all the polling is telling us about the Conservative membership, it would have taken a Titanic disaster for Johnson start throwing away large numbers of votes amongst the (possibly few) Tory members who have not already returned the ballot papers that went out by post last week. Johnson sounded glib and cavalier, but it would be impossible to have been involved in Conservative politics and not to have noticed that he\u2019s like that already. Also, Johnson did better in the second half than in the first half - fighting Hunt to a draw on tax, to my ears, and deflating Hunt a bit by making him admit that his \u201ckeep Kim Darroch\u201d pledge only lasted until Christmas. </p> \n  <p>The debate exposed two big faultlines between the two men. Johnson is determined to play down the risk of a no-deal Brexit, while Hunt isn\u2019t. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/09/theresa-may-stands-by-uk-ambassador-in-wake-of-trump-criticism-politics-live?page=with:block-5d24e7db8f0845f89e309dec#block-5d24e7db8f0845f89e309dec\">8.18pm.)</a> And, while Hunt is willing to be at least moderately critical of President Trump, tonight Johnson refused point blank. Mainstream UK opinion, and certainly Guardian opinion, would be with Hunt on both this issues. But most Tory members are Brexiters, and there is a lot of polling evidence to suggest that leave voters believe the risks of a no-deal Brexit have been exaggerated. And, on Trump, Johnson was effectively endorsing his claim that May\u2019s Brexit strategy has been a disaster - an assessment shared by many grassroots Conservatives. Johnson acquitted himself poorly this evening but, ideologically, he is probably in the right place for someone this electorate.</p> \n  <p>And one more point; it is important to remember that debates almost never have as much impact on elections as the media assume. </p> \n  <p>So, overall, it was a clear, technical victory for Hunt - but probably a superficial one too.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dab4b8fa6a2e5e6f241d59a36aec1cfe9a5a78b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dab4b8fa6a2e5e6f241d59a36aec1cfe9a5a78b/0_111_5485_3290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson (left) and Jeremy Hunt in the debate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson (left) and Jeremy Hunt in the debate.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Han Yan/Xinhua/Barcroft Media</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T09:46:58.780Z\">at 10.46am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d24f0f38f08d0b6ca52d578\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-09T19:56:46.874Z\">8.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Closing statements</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>They are now making closing statements.</p> \n  <p>Hunt says he wants to make this amazing country.

This represents a tiny minority, but one antisemite is one too many, and we will continue to act against this repugnant form of racism.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d24b6c48f0845f89e309b9d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-09T15:49:41.341Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>These are from <strong>Ian Blackford</strong>, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, explaining why SNPs MPs will be voting on the amendments to allow same-sex marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland even though the party normally abstains on devolved matters.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534042192744448\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For those asking, I strongly support equal marriage, and women\u2019s right to choose on abortion.</p>\u2014 Ian Blackford (@IanBlackfordMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534042192744448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534292227723264\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I'm very proud that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theSNP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theSNP</a> government introduced the UK\u2019s most progressive equal marriage law, and that Scotland is the only part of the UK where couples from Northern Ireland can convert their civil partnership to a same-sex marriage</p>\u2014 Ian Blackford (@IanBlackfordMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534292227723264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534639520358400\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theSNP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theSNP</a> will always defend the principle of devolution, there are a specific set of circumstances in Northern Ireland where there has been no functioning Assembly for an extended period.</p>\u2014 Ian Blackford (@IanBlackfordMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148534639520358400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanBlackfordMP/status/1148535515773362177\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In these circumstances, we believe it is right to give MPs a vote on these important human rights issues.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt escalated the blue-on-blue warfare in Tuesday night\u2019s televised debate, trading blows on which potential prime minister could see through a no-deal Brexit, as Hunt repeatedly emphasised his rival\u2019s refusal to answer questions. As Jessica Elgot reports, the bitter back-and-forth, which will raise questions over whether Hunt could serve in a Johnson government after the aspersions he cast on his rival, saw the foreign secretary accuse Johnson of putting personal ambition above the welfare of the country. In the hour-long ITV broadcast, Johnson swerved questions repeatedly on whether he would resign if he failed to deliver Brexit by 31 October and declined to condemn Donald Trump for his attacks on the British ambassador. Johnson also gave equivocal answers on issues including HS2, Heathrow\u2019s third runway, and abortion and LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. MPs have voted resoundingly to extend same-sex marriage and access to abortion to Northern Ireland, bringing the region into line with the rest of the UK on the two significant social issues. Transatlantic tensions over the British ambassador\u2019s leaked criticisms of Donald Trump have grown into a diplomatic crisis after the US president attacked Sir Kim Darroch as \u201ca pompous fool\u201d and his commerce secretary postponed planned trade talks with Liam Fox. Jeremy Corbyn has sought to draw a line under Labour\u2019s Brexit travails by announcing a \u201csettled\u201d policy of backing remain in any referendum called on a Conservative deal. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason on who did best. The ITV debate started just as MPs were voting on Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 17. (See 8.02pm.) It was defeated by 293 votes to 289 - a majority of 4. So, two of Grieve\u2019s amendments were defeated, but one was passed. (See 7.41pm.) This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the debate on Twitter. Generally, the view seems to be that Jeremy Hunt did well, but not well enough to make a difference. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From ITV\u2019s Tom Bradby From my colleague Jennifer Rankin From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman From the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne From the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire And here\u2019s an extract from Maguire\u2019s article. The foreign secretary gave a spirited, combative performance, and Johnson spent much of the hour on the ropes and visibly rattled as a result. But does it stand any chance of translating into a shock victory? For the answer, look to Johnson\u2019s reply to the final question of the debate: what qualities did the candidates most admire in their opponent? The frontrunner responded with mockery of Hunt\u2019s ability to change his mind on Brexit. Add that to his willingness to commit what many Tory members believe to be the unforgivable heresy of entertaining EU membership beyond 31 October and it is plain to see why, despite his far from watertight platform, Johnson remains in pole position. From the BBC\u2019s Susana Mendonca From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole From ITV\u2019s Piers Morgan From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley From ITV\u2019s Susanna Reid From the Telegraph\u2019s Tim Stanley In the early stages of the Tory leadership contest the Boris Johnson camp concluded that Michael Gove would pose more of a threat than Jeremy Hunt in the final stage of the contest, and it is widely assumed at Westminster that this assessment resulted in Team Johnson lending Hunt the votes he need to beat Gove by just two in the MPs\u2019 ballot. The calculation was that Gove would be more brutal in debate. After tonight, that\u2019s not looking such a good judgment because Hunt was more assertive than we\u2019ve seen him before, challenging Johnson repeatedly on specifics. Judged on these skirmishes, Hunt won the debate handsomely. He came over as better briefed and more forensic, and there were several moments in the debate where Johnson found bluster and bonhomie a poor substitute for arguments. That said, given what all the polling is telling us about the Conservative membership, it would have taken a Titanic disaster for Johnson start throwing away large numbers of votes amongst the (possibly few) Tory members who have not already returned the ballot papers that went out by post last week. Johnson sounded glib and cavalier, but it would be impossible to have been involved in Conservative politics and not to have noticed that he\u2019s like that already. Also, Johnson did better in the second half than in the first half - fighting Hunt to a draw on tax, to my ears, and deflating Hunt a bit by making him admit that his \u201ckeep Kim Darroch\u201d pledge only lasted until Christmas. The debate exposed two big faultlines between the two men. Johnson is determined to play down the risk of a no-deal Brexit, while Hunt isn\u2019t. (See 8.18pm.) And, while Hunt is willing to be at least moderately critical of President Trump, tonight Johnson refused point blank. Mainstream UK opinion, and certainly Guardian opinion, would be with Hunt on both this issues. But most Tory members are Brexiters, and there is a lot of polling evidence to suggest that leave voters believe the risks of a no-deal Brexit have been exaggerated. And, on Trump, Johnson was effectively endorsing his claim that May\u2019s Brexit strategy has been a disaster - an assessment shared by many grassroots Conservatives. Johnson acquitted himself poorly this evening but, ideologically, he is probably in the right place for someone this electorate. And one more point; it is important to remember that debates almost never have as much impact on elections as the media assume. So, overall, it was a clear, technical victory for Hunt - but probably a superficial one too. They are now making closing statements. Hunt says he wants to make this amazing country. He only makes promises he can keep. Our country deserves no less, he says. Johnson says the only way to get this country off \u201cthe hamster wheel of doom\u201d is by getting Brexit done. This is an amazing country. Now is the time to show we believe in Britain, he says. And that\u2019s it. The debate is over. Reaction, analysis and a summary coming up soon. Q: What do you admire about each other? Johnson says he admires Hunt\u2019s ability to change his mind - as he did over Brexit. Hunt says he admires Johnson\u2019s ability to not answer the question. Johnson cracks a joke, and you forget the question. It\u2019s a good trait in a politician. Q: Should HS2 be abandoned? Johnson says it should be reviewed, but he won\u2019t commit to abandoning it. Hunt says it should be backed to the hilt. Q: Will you publish a plan for social care this year? Yes, says Hunt. Yes, says Johnson. Q: Will you stop Heathrow\u2019s third runway going ahead? Johnson says he has the gravest reservations about this. Hunt says Johnson should be able to answer this. Q: Would you scrap universal credit? No, says Hunt. He says it has teething problems, but it is right in principle. Johnson also says he would keep it. Q: Do you support extending abortion rights and same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland? Yes, says Hunt. Johnson says these are matters for the Northern Ireland assembly. Q: Why was your first plan tax cuts for the rich? Johnson says it was part of a package. Hunt butts in. He says it was a mistake. He says he has spent his life telling people that the Tories are not just a party for the rich. Johnson asks Hunt if he is in favour of people on modest incomes having to pay higher rates of tax. Johnson is refusing to let Hunt answer. He claims Hunt won\u2019t reply, but he has not let him reply. Hunt says Johnson never answers the question. He says his priority for tax cuts would be people on low incomes. He says he has spent his life saying the Tories are not the party of the rich, but a party for everyone. Q: I am struggling to manage. Why are you prioritising tax cuts for the rich or for business, instead of for people like me? Hunt says he has prioritised corporation tax cuts. But that is because he wants to boost the economy. President Trump cut business taxes, and the US economy is now growing twice as fast as the UK\u2019s. He says he wants to grow the size of the cake. \u201cAbsolutely right,\u201d says Johnson. He says he would focus on the hardest pressed. He says as mayor of London he expanded the living wage. He wants to help the low paid by taking them out of national insurance. But he also thinks too many people are being dragged into the higher rate of tax. Q: Can someone trust a remain voter to deliver Brexit? Yes, says Hunt. He says he voted remain, but he delivered the extra \u00a3350m week promised for the NHS. Q: Why did you get your facts wrong on Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? Johnson says the Iranians are to blame for what happened to her. They are back. Q: Tell us about your character, your qualities? Johnson says he can get surprise results in difficult circumstances, as he did when he was London mayor. Hunt says he is prepared to deliver tough messages, as he did to President Trump today. Q: What is your response? Johnson says it is very important to have a good relationship with the White House. He says Trump was dragged into a political debate. That is sometimes not the right thing to do. On Kim Darroch, Johnson says it is vital that advice given to ministers should not be leaked by ministers. Johnson refuses to criticise President Trump for what he said about Theresa May. Q: Will Kim Darroch stay in office? Hunt says who chooses our ambassador is a matter for the UK government. If he is PM, Darroch stays. Johnson repeats his point about the need for ministers not to leak. Johnson implies that a minister was to blame for the Kim Darroch leak. Q: Will you keep him? Johnson refuses to say. Hunt says he will keep Darroch until he is due to retire. Johnson refuses to say that. But he says he, and he alone, will decide who takes politically important jobs like this one. Johnson refuses to commit to keeping Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington. Section 1 - Snap verdict: There was talk this morning about Hunt needing to summon up a degree of fight not seen before to have any chance tonight, but so far, he is managing that. In strict debating terms, he is getting the better of Johnson time and time again. His challenge to Johnson about being willing to resign if he did not deliver Brexit by 31 October worked (Johnson\u2019s reply sounded evasive), and his line about getting facts wrong being okay for a columnist, but not for a PM, was the zinger of the opening section. Julia Etchingham asks people to raise their hands if they think the UK will leave the EU by 31 October. Hunt raises his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit\u201d, says Johnson. He says he thought Hunt thought it could not be done. And the first third of the programme is over. Q: Would you do a deal with the Brexit party? Johnson says he does not believe in doing deals with any party? Q: What would your alternative to an election be? Hunt says he is the best person to get a deal, so the UK avoids this choice. He says he is a negotiator by backround. But if we take a hardline approach, the EU will to. Getting Brexit right is not about \u201cblind optimism\u201d, he says. Johnson says he resigned over the withdrawal agreement. Hunt points out that he voted for it too. Q: Would you be willing to prorogue parliament to get no-deal through? Hunt says the last time this was tried, we had a civil war. So he will say no. Johnson says it would be mistake to take anything off the table. He says Hunt has not set any timetable for coming out. He accuses Hunt of \u201cescalating the fears\u201d of a no-deal Brexit. He says the UK must come out, so the government can get back to the issues people want to talk about. Q: Parliament will not vote for no-deal. So isn\u2019t a general election inevitable? Hunt says this is why he is not setting 31 October as an absolute deadline. He does not want go back to the electorate until he has delivered Brexit. Johnson says it is \u201ctotally defeatist\u201d not to set 31 October. He says parliament has just voted against ruling out no-deal. (It is not clear what he is referring to - that is not how most people would describe tonight\u2019s votes.) Hunt accuses Johnson of \u201cpeddling optimism\u201d. He says it is important to be honest about the challenges ahead. Who said blood, sweat, toil and tears? Johnson corrects Hunt\u2019s Churchill quote. Hunt claims, if the UK prepares, it can get through this. But we should not pretend it will be a \u201cwalk in the park\u201d, he says. Hunt says in their last debate Johnson said Gatt 24 would allow the UK to avoid tariffs. But Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, says that is wrong. He says getting facts wrong is okay for a newspaper columnist, but not for someone doing this job. Johnson pushes back, claiming he never said the UK could use this unilaterally, but Hunt says that is not what he said. And Hunt says Johnson\u2019s claim the risk of a no-deal Brexit is a million to one is not correct, and irresponsible. Q: My business would suffer under no-deal. What will you do to avoid one? Johnson says he does not think there is much risk of no-deal. Hunt says he has run his business. He knows what it is like to face threats like this. He mentions visiting a steel business that would be harmed by tariffs. He has a 10-point plan. Q: Do you accept there is a cost to no-deal? Johnson says, badly handled, no-deal could be costly. He says it is \u201cvanishingly inexpensive\u201d if you prepare. Johnson says a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cvanishingly inexpensive\u201d if the UK prepares. Q: What is your plan for the backstop? Hunt says his plan is based on the Alternative Arrangements Commission report? Q: How long will it take? Hunt says it will take some time to set up. Q: Your plan? Johnson says there are a range of options, much as set out in the Alternative Arrangements Commission paper. Q: The EU has said it has looked the world over for a solution, and not found one. Johnson says they did not say that. He says solutions are available. Johnson says if the UK is willing to delay, the EU will not take it seriously. Hunt ask Johnson if he will resign if he fails to take the UK out by 31 October. Johnson at first dodges the question. Hunt presses him, and Johnson says it is important not to hold out any prospect of not coming out by 31 October. He says making that promise could encourage the EU to delay. Johnson says promising to resign if Brexit is not delivered by 31 October could give the EU an incentive to delay. Hunt says this is not leadership. Q: So how long will you delay? Hunt starts answering. Johnson challenges him repeatedly: Christmas? Hunt implies Johnson has been rude to the EU. He says he has a serious strategy. Julie Etchingham says the audience is made up of people how have voted Tory, or might do so in the future. Q: I used to vote Tory, but now I back the Brexit party, and I want to see Nigel Farage in Number 10. Can you guarantee we will leave the EU by 31 October? Hunt says he is as keen as anyone to deliver Brexit by 31 October. But there has been a breach of trust, and MPs should only make promises they can keep. Johnson says it is absolutely vital to leave by 31 October. Jeremy Hunt goes next. \u201cAs a tough negotiator, I will deliver Brexit,\u201d he says. But he will do so much more. He is an entrepreneur, he will reform services as he did with the NHS, and he knows how to get young people to vote Tory, he says. He says he won a marginal seat. And polls show he has most appeal to the public at large, he says. Boris Johnson goes first. He says we can carry on as now, or change, and put the country on the path to success. The way to do that is to deliver Brexit, propose plans for better infrastructure, and beat Jeremy Corbyn. The ITV debate is starting. MPs are now voting on Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 17. Following the decision of the Speaker not to call his new clause 14, this is the Grieve amendment being voted on tonight with the most bite. It would require the progress reports that MPs have just voted to have fortnightly (see 7.41pm) to be debated. As the Hansard Society\u2019s Brigid Fowler explained, under the amendment MPs would debate an amendable motion - which means they could be used to trigger further Brexit votes. MPs have voted down Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 16 - by 292 to 289. MPs are now voting on Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 16. Here is the full text of it. Clause 3, page 2, line 16, leave out \u201cthe report\u201d and insert \u201cany report under this section\u201d In his explanatory statement Grieve describes this simply as \u201ca consequential amendment\u201d, meaning that now the bill has been amended to require fortnightly reports (see 7.21pm), the singular noun in this clause is no longer appropriate. Dominic Grieve has won - by a single vote. MPs voted for his amendment (see 7.18pm and 7.21pm) by 294 votes to 293. Here is Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, commenting ahead of tonight\u2019s ITV debate. From Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti, who is in Salford for the ITV debate This is what Lord Turnberg told Newsnight about why he was resigning the Labour whip. (See 3.43pm.) I am very saddened to have had to resign the Labour whip not least because my differences lie with the party leadership and machine and not with my very supportive colleagues in the Lords who share my values. It is not just the policies on foreign affairs- pro Russia, pro Venezuela, anti- America - and not just Brexit vacillation and bypassing parliamentary opinion, but the overt antisemitism that permeates the party machine that is no longer possible for me to tolerate. I fear for the future of this party to which I have devoted myself for so any years. Here is the full text of Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 15. Clause 3, page 2, line 15, at end insert\u2014 \u201c(1A) The secretary of state shall make a further report under subsection 1 on or before 9 October 2019 at least every fourteen calendar days thereafter until either an Executive is formed or until 18 December 2019, whichever is the sooner.\u201d And here is Grieve\u2019s explanatory note. This amendment would require fortnightly reports to be made after the conference recess until an executive was formed, or until the December recess. In the Commons MPs are now voting on Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment 15. It is one that is intended to stop a new PM being able to prorogue parliament in the autumn, although whether in practice it will have that effect is a matter of debate. (See 2.07pm and 2.46pm.) Grieve thinks that, as long as this amendment does get passed, it will get beefed up in the Lords to make it more effective. (See 5.55pm.) This will probably be the closest vote of the night. Here is Boris Johnson arriving for the ITV Tory leadership debate in Salford. It starts at 8pm, and of course we will be covering it live. And here is Jeremy Hunt, who is going for the tieless look. The Julian Lewis amendment has been passed by 308 votes to 228 - a majority of 80. Here is the explanatory note from Lewis saying what his amendment will do. The subsection would include placing a duty on the secretary of state to report on the options available to ensure that veterans of the Troubles would be able to assist in a truth recovery process, for the benefit of bereaved families, without fear of prosecution. The Hansard Society\u2019s Brigid Fowler has posted a detailed Twitter thread explaining what the Grieve amendments being voted on tonight actually do. It starts here. But, sadly, the key issue is left unresolved. MPs are now voting on an amendment tabled by the Tory MP Julian Lewis that would oblige the government to investigate how military veterans of the Troubles could contribute to the truth recovery process without fear of prosecution. In the Commons John Penrose, the Northern Ireland minister, has just said that the government will accept one of Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendments \u2013 an innocuous one, amendment 14 \u2013 bringing forward the date when a progress report must be presented to parliament. But he said the government will oppose the other ones due to be vote on tonight. These are amendments saying that the government should make fortnightly reports on progress towards getting the power-sharing executive restored in Northern Ireland in the autumn, and that these reports should be debated. Grieve believes that, in practice, these would stop a new PM proroguing parliament, because if parliament were prorogued, these conditions could not be met. Penrose did not address this point, but he said they would introduce an excessive and unnecessary level of procedure into the bill. This is from Franki Appleton from Marie Stopes UK, which provides abortion services, on the Commons vote. This is a historic day for women\u2019s rights. As an organisation that has supported the push for abortion access in Northern Ireland, we are delighted that MPs have taken this opportunity to demand law reform and give every woman in the UK access to safe, legal abortion. For too long, women in Northern Ireland have been treated as second-class citizens, forcing them to give birth to babies they know will not survive outside of the womb, forcing rape victims to travel overseas to end their pregnancy and prosecuting mothers for protecting their daughters by procuring the same pills available on the NHS in England, Wales and Scotland. From the landslide referendum in the Republic of Ireland to today\u2019s momentous vote in Westminster, grievous rights are beginning to be righted and we join all the wonderful people who have campaigned for this in celebrating this much longed for progress. Lord Triesman has given an interview to Newsnight\u2019s Emily Maitlis about his decision to resign the Labour whip in the House of Lords today over antisemitism. (See 3.18pm.) This is what Triesman said about the decision. It\u2019s been building for a long time, with incident after incident. It\u2019s like a mad psychodrama. You pick up the morning\u2019s papers, and there\u2019s another issue. And quite aside from the issues that are in the public domain, the stream of invective that you get on social media is absolutely unbelievable \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody. So I think we have got to the point now where it is just unsustainable to continue. You have to take a decision about what your own ethics are. And this is what he said when asked to justify the claim he made in his resignation letter that Jeremy Corbyn is personally antisemitic. Asked for evidence of this, Triesman replied: If you look at event after event after event, and there is now a huge list of events. And you ask yourself the question, in relation to any one has he made the right call on it? And the answer is not once, never. And in those circumstances, it\u2019s hard not to come to the conclusion that he either is indifferent to the problem or he is part of the problem. And here is a statement from Sinn Fein on the two votes. It\u2019s from the Sinn Fein MP Elisha McCallion. Marriage equality, like Irish language rights, victims and women\u2019s rights should be addressed by the Assembly. They have not been because rights have been repeatedly vetoed by the DUP, enabled by the British government. It was inevitable that the British government\u2019s failure to defend basic rights available everywhere else on these islands would be confronted. This was the message coming out of Westminster today. Rights delayed are rights denied and the obvious political imperative now is to ensure that all citizens are afforded rights and equality, regardless of where they live on these islands. Here is Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, on tonight\u2019s two Commons votes. Today parliament has voted to ensure that love no longer has borders and women are not treated as second class citizens. The government must now act to bring forward legislation on marriage equality and abortion reform if the Northern Ireland assembly and Executive are not returned before 21 October. Labour has long called on the government to take action on these issues and will work with the government to see it implemented. The size of the majority pays tribute to the campaigning of many in Northern Ireland and the determination of Labour MP\u2019s Conor McGinn, Diana Johnson and Stella Creasy amongst others. This is from Sky News. And here is the full list of 332 MPs who voted for the Stella Creasy amendment on liberalising the abortion law in Northern Ireland. And here is the full list of the 99 MPs who voted against - 84 Tories, eight DUP, five Labour, two SNP and one independent. The other two DUP MPs were tellers. Back in the Commons Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European, is now speaking about his various amendments intended to stop the next prime minster proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit in the autumn. Steve Brine, a fellow Tory, asks if the amendments would prevent prorogation without new clause 14 being passed. NC14 is the one that is not being put to a vote. (See 2.07pm and 2.46pm.) Grieve says with NC14 his amendments would definitely stop prorogation in the autumn. But even without it, the others are worth having, he says. Sir Oliver Letwin, a fellow Conservative, asks Grieve if he agrees that the other amendments (saying MPs would have to make fortnightly reports to parliament and allow those reports to be debated - see 2.46pm) would allow someone to take a case to the supreme court if the PM did try to prorogue parliament. Grieve does accept that. He also said that, if peers decide to include a version of NC14 when the bill is in the Lords, then MPs will get the chance to debate it when the bill comes back to the Commons. Letwin intervenes again. He says the Speaker probably decided not to allow a vote on NC14 because he considered it outside the \u201cscope\u201d of the bill (a technical parliamentary term). But he says that in the Lords peers apply a wider definition of scope. Here is the full list of the 383 MPs who voted in favour of Conor McGinn\u2019s same-sex marriage amendment. And here is the full list of the 73 MPs who voted against \u2013 65 Tories and eight from the DUP. The other two DUP were acting as tellers. Today\u2019s majority of 310 in favour of same-sex marriage compares with the 225 majority in favour six years ago when MPs voted in favour of same-sex marriage for England and Wales. The Scottish parliament voted for same-sex marriage in 2014. MPs have passed the Creasy amendment to liberalise the abortion law in Northern Irelnd (see 5.30pm) by 332 votes to 99 \u2013 a majority of 233. Back in the Commons MPs are now voting on Stella Creasy\u2019s new clause 10 (NC10) on abortion. It says: Clause 1, page 1, line 3, at end insert\u2014 \u201c(2) This section comes into force on the day after the secretary of state has laid before both Houses of Parliament regulations to enable the effective application in Northern Ireland of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in order to guarantee the rights of all women in Northern Ireland.\u201d And here is Creasy\u2019s explanatory statement. The report of the inquiry concerning the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland under article 8 of the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women called on the UK government to take all measures necessary to ensure the effective application of the convention to guarantee the rights of all women in Northern Ireland, in the absence of a functioning government in Northern Ireland since January 2017. Jeremy Hunt, the underdog in the Tory leadership contest, has told President Trump on Twitter his comments about Theresa May \u201cdisrespectful and wrong\u201d. Hunt says he would keep Sir Kim Darroch as UK ambassador to the US, despite President Trump saying he won\u2019t deal with him. Hunt\u2019s comments contrast with the approach taken by Boris Johnson, the clear favourite in the leadership contest, who did not criticise President Trump when asked about this earlier and instead boasted about his \u201cgood relationship\u201d with Trump\u2019s White House. (See 3pm.) MPs have voted to introduce same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, unless the power-sharing executive is revived by 21 October, by 383 votes to 73 - a majority of 310. From my colleague Peter Walker Here is John Simpson, the BBC\u2019s former world affairs editor, on President Trump\u2019s outburst and the UK\u2019s response. Here are some quotes from the debate. From Labour\u2019s Conor McGinn At the minute the executive and the assembly exists in the ether or as a concept, not a reality. So if they can\u2019t make this [same-sex marriage] law, we will make it here because - as I have said often - rights delayed are rights denied. We will make the law here and then when the Assembly is back up and running the power remains for them to change it. From Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy I am a passionate defender of women\u2019s rights, I believe powerfully that if women are not able to have equal control over their bodies as men are then we will never have true freedom. If we say to women we will force you to continue an unwanted pregnancy, they will always be second class citizens to male counterparts ... I ask the House, how much longer are the women of Northern Ireland expected to wait? How much more are they expected to suffer until we speak up for the best of what this place does as human rights defenders, not human rights deniers? From Karin Smyth, the shadow Northern Ireland minister We heard [on the day of Lyra McKee\u2019s funeral] was that Lyra was making arrangements for her own marriage to her partner. It really struck me sitting in the cathedral of the huge sadness, the huge irony, when we rightly praised this remarkable young woman for being a child of the peace process, for being so openly happy with her own sexuality, with having touched every part of Northern Ireland society with her optimism. That she was making those plans for her own marriage to the woman that she loved but what her own society was saying to her was essentially \u2018away you go to Donegal, you can\u2019t do that here\u2019. What a great testament it would be to her memory and the thousands of people across Northern Ireland who simply want to express their love that we would make progress on this issue. From the DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley There is no right under the international treaties to terminate an unborn life, that is the fact of the matter, and we have got to make sure that that right, the right to life, is upheld. And this is what McGinn\u2019s NC1 actually says. Marriage of same-sex couples in Northern Ireland (1) The secretary of state must make regulations to change the law relating to marriage in Northern Ireland to provide that marriage between same-sex couples is lawful. (2) Regulations under this section must be in force no later than 21 October 2019, subject to subsections (3) and (4). (3) A statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (1) \u2014 (a) must be laid before both Houses of Parliament; (b) is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament. (4) If a Northern Ireland executive is formed before the regulations under this section come into force, any regulations made under this section and any extant obligations arising under subsection (1) shall cease to have effect. And here is the McGinn\u2019s explanatory statement saying that this actually means in practice. This new clause would require UK secondary legislation to extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland unless a Northern Ireland executive is formed by 21 October 2019. In the Commons MPs are now voting on Conor McGinn\u2019s new clause 1 (NC1) amendment on same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. The Labour party has issued this response to the claims about the party being antisemitic made by Lord Triesman in his letter resigning the party whip in the Lords. (See 3.18pm.) A party spokesperson said: We completely reject these false and offensive claims. The Labour party at all levels is implacably opposed to antisemitism and is determined to root out this social cancer from our movement and society. Labour is taking decisive action against antisemitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. And since Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with has increased four-fold. Our records show that antisemitism cases that have gone through the stages of our disciplinary procedures since September 2015 account for about 0.06% of the party\u2019s membership. This represents a tiny minority, but one antisemite is one too many, and we will continue to act against this repugnant form of racism. These are from Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, explaining why SNPs MPs will be voting on the amendments to allow same-sex marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland even though the party normally abstains on devolved matters. Labour is now committed to campaigning for remain in any referendum on a Tory Brexit deal, or on a no-deal Brexit. But what remains unresolved is what Labour would propose if there were a general election before Brexit took place. In an interview with the BBC, when asked what Labour\u2019s position would be in an election if the UK were still in the EU, Jeremy Corbyn replied: Well the next election will come when it comes, it could be this October, it could be next year, if could be in 2022. I don\u2019t know anymore than you do. What you\u2019ve probably gathered from this discussion is that we have a very large party, a very large membership and many parts to our party and our movement. We have a democratic process, we will decide very quickly at the start of that campaign exactly what our position will be. But Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, told the World at One that he did not think Labour could win an election unless it was opposed to Brexit. He said: As I understand it no decision has been taken yet on [Labour\u2019s election position on Brexit]. But, look, if we do end up at an election we are going to have to be absolutely clear. And my position is this: If Labour goes into that election saying we\u2019re going to try and deliver Brexit then I think we\u2019d find it very, very hard indeed to win that general election. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, on President Trump\u2019s latest outburst. Sky\u2019s Deborah Haynes has found an entrepreneur (not Jeremy Hunt). Sir Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the US who has now been declared persona non grata by President Trump, will not be accompanying Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, to the White House for a meeting with Ivanka Trump, journalists were told at the Downing Street afternoon lobby briefing. And here is some comment from Jon Sopel, the BBC\u2019s North America editor. The Irish government has said it has \u201cno easy answers\u201d to avoid checks on the Irish border in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal. After a special cabinet meeting heard of the \u201cdire\u201d consequences, it released a 117-page report (pdf) outlining the country\u2019s contingency plans for no deal warning of \u201cprofound\u201d effects for Northern Ireland and Ireland. It warns the \u201cconsequences of a no-deal Brexit for the political process in Northern Ireland could be very damaging\u201d and that a \u201cno-deal Brexit risks significantly undermining wider community relations and political stability in Northern Ireland with potential related security concerns.\u201d The report said the government\u2019s assessment was that there was now \u201ca significant risk of a no deal Brexit on 31 October\u201d and preparation for such an event was now a priority. No deal would be \u201chighly disruptive and will have profound political, economic and legal implications, first and foremost for the UK, including most significantly Northern Ireland, as well as having significant impacts on Ireland and the rest of the EU\u201d It warned of a potential \u00a36bn cost to the Irish economy and \u201csignificant short term risks\u201d with an estimated increase in unemployment of 50-55,000 \u201cafter the UK leaves the EU\u201d. A third peer, Lord Turnberg, is resigning the Labour whip, according to the BBC\u2019s Mathew Harris. Turnberg is another eminent doctor. He was made a Labour peer in the 1990s. According to BBC Newsnight, Ara Darzi, a surgeon who was made a peer and a health minister by Gordon Brown, is also resigning the Labour whip. Lord Triesman, who was Labour\u2019s general secretary under Tony Blair and who subsequently served as a minister under Blair and Gordon Brown, has announced today that he is resigning the Labour whip. In a letter to Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, he says some of the party\u2019s policy positions (primarily on Brexit, Russia and defence) are \u201cimpossible to take seriously\u201d, but mostly he focuses on antisemitism, saying Labour is no longer a safe political environment for Jewish people. He says: My sad conclusion is that the Labour party is very plainly institutionally antisemitic, and its leader and his circle are antisemitic, having never once made the right judgment call about an issue reflecting deep prejudice. The number of examples is shocking. It is no longer a safe political environment for Jewish people or other opponents of antisemitism. It it time to recognise the reality. I always said it was worth hanging on to fight so long as there was a prospect of winning. I now don\u2019t believe with this leadership there is. During a visit to Manchester airport, Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, said he was not embarrassed to say he had good relations with the Trump White House. He said: I have got a good relationship with the White House and I have no embarrassment in saying that. I think it\u2019s very important that we have a strong relationship with our most important ally. The United States is, has been, will be and for the foreseeable future our number one political military friend. Asked whether the president was right to criticise Theresa May and the way Brexit talks have been handled, Johnson replied: Myself, I have said some pretty critical things about the Brexit negotiations so far and that\u2019s one of the reasons I am standing tonight and one of the reasons I am putting myself forward. I think there is a chance to do things differently, a chance to break away from the failed old can-kicking approaching. Now is the time to really get a grip on this. Stop being so defeatist in our approach to the EU negotiations and maybe be a lot more positive about our country and what it can do. From the Press Association report, it is not clear whether Johnson was aware of President Trump\u2019s latest criticism of May (she was \u201cfoolish\u201d and her policy a \u201cdisaster\u201d - see 1.47pm) when he was speaking, or whether Johnson was just commenting in relation to what Trump said about May yesterday (she made a \u201cmess\u201d of it). According to Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Hutton, the Tory MP Dominic Grieve is relaxed about his main amendment not being called (see 2.07pm) because he thinks his other amendments which are due to be put to a vote would stop a new PM proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. The other Grieve amendments (14, 15 and 17) would require ministers to make fortnightly reports to parliament about progress towards restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland (and subject of the bill) and for those reports to be debated. It is questionable whether these amendments would stop a new PM proroguing parliament in the autumn. But Bloomberg argue that they could provide legal grounds for someone to challenge a decision to prorogue parliament in court. The first set of votes this afternoon, including on the amendments on same-sex marriage and abortion, will take place at around 5pm. Nick Boles, the former Tory who now sits as an independent, says that when the second stage of the debate starts after those votes, he intends to raise President Trump\u2019s latest comments (see 1.47pm) on a point of order. In the Northern Ireland debate the Labour MP Stella Creasy is speaking now about her amendment, which would extend the right to abortion in Northern Ireland by saying the government would have to comply with the UN convention for the elimination of discrimination against women. She says women in Northern Ireland risk prison for procuring abortion pills. She says the UK cannot tell other countries to enforce human rights standards when it is denying basic rights to women in Northern Ireland. More on the Dominic Grieve amendments. (See 12.37pm.) Although new clause 14 (NC14), the central Grieve amendment intended to stop a new prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, has not been called, other Grieve amendments have been called. But, as Nikki da Costa, a former director of legislative affairs in Downing Street explains, the other Grieve amendments would not necessarily stop a new PM proroguing parliament. She explains why in these tweets. You can read the text of all the amendments to the bill here (pdf). Theresa May faces a full-blown diplomatic standoff with the US after Donald Trump condemned Britain\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d ambassador to Washington over leaked memos critical of the White House, as Downing Street insisted Sir Kim Darroch had its full support, my colleague Peter Walker reports. The escalating crisis began after a Sunday newspaper printed extracts of confidential memos in which Darroch labelled Trump\u2019s administration \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d. The US president announced on Monday that he would no longer deal with the ambassador. In a fresh volley of tweets on Tuesday morning, Trump again condemned Darroch, and renewed his criticism of the prime minister over her Brexit negotiations, which he had praised on his state visit to the UK just over a month ago. Here is Peter\u2019s story. And here are the Trump tweets. Ireland will not be providing options for dealing with animals and agrifood as they cross the Irish border in its no-deal contingency plans to be published later today. It will say, instead, that more talks are needed on the issue with the European Commission. The last time the UK was on the precipice of a no-deal Brexit, sources told the Guardian that checks on animals and agrifood would be mandatory from day one, meaning overnight disruption for trade of milk and lamb from Northern Ireland into the republic. At a special cabinet meeting this morning, Irish ministers were briefed by the deputy prime minister Simon Coveney on the \u201cdire consequences\u201d of no-deal for Ireland the all-island economy. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, is expected to be questioned by opposition MPs in the Dail at 2pm, with Coveney giving a briefing to the media at 4pm on the updated no deal plans. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, is speaking in the debate now. He says it is wrong that this bill, which is about allowing the suspension of the Northern Ireland assembly to continue, has been hijacked for other purposes. He says, under the McGinn amendment, if it is passed, there would be no further vote in the Commons before the law was changed to allow same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland (assuming the powers-sharing executive is not restored by 21 October). The DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson says MPs have repeatedly complained about the use of Henry VIII powers. But he says the amendment would allow a Henry VIII power to be used to impose same-sex marriage on Northern Ireland. Dodds agrees that this is not an appropriate way to decide this matter for Northern Ireland. Maria Miller, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, is speaking in the debate now. She says she was equalities minister when same-sex marriage was introduced. She says the law was not extended to Northern Ireland because the government wanted to respect the devolution settlement. She says she will not decide how she is going to vote tonight until she has heard the government make its case. She says her heart is telling her to vote for the McGinn amendment. But her head needs to be convinced, because of the concerns about the need to respect the principle of devolution. In the Commons Conor McGinn says the House of Commons failed people in Northern Ireland by not decriminalising homosexuality in Northern Ireland when it was decriminalised in England. And he says it has failed them by not extending same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland. He ends his speech by saying tonight MPs must no longer let it down. We have already posted reaction to today\u2019s announcement from Jeremy Corbyn about Labour\u2019s latest shift on Brexit from the Liberal Democrats (see 12.03pm). Here is some more reaction. From Labour MP Phil Wilson, in a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which is campaigning for a second referendum Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s public insistence that the next Conservative prime minister put any Brexit proposal to a final say referendum, where we will all have the chance to stay in the EU, is a positive step forward for Labour. It is an outrage that Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt believe this decision can be confined to the 0.25% of the population who are Conservative members. It must be for the people to decide our future and give their explicit consent for a specific form of Brexit in a people\u2019s vote. But one email to Labour members and a press release do not make a campaign. Labour has the chance to speak up for its values and to channel the growing anger in the country about the negation of democracy that is being imposed on us all. Our voters and our members will not tolerate further confusion or foot-dragging. Instead, we now need to join together with all those from across the political spectrum who have long since been demanding that the people get the final say on Brexit. From Chris Leslie, the former Labour MP who now represents the Independent Group for Change Corbyn has confirmed that if you vote Labour, you\u2019ll get Brexit. His commitment to campaign against Brexit only if the Conservatives are in government simply isn\u2019t good enough. Brexit - whether a Labour Brexit or a Conservative Brexit - will cost people\u2019s jobs, put businesses in jeopardy, and diminish Britain in the eyes of our neighbours. Corbyn\u2019s refusal to be honest about that fact is a deep betrayal of the people Labour used to represent. From Naomi Smith, CEO of the the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, but Labour can\u2019t believe that both their own deal and remaining are best for Britain. It\u2019s decision time for the Labour leadership. If they don\u2019t settle on campaigning to stop Brexit then they will be letting down the vast majority of their membership, voters and the country. From Michael Chessum from Another Europe is Possible, a leftwing group campaigning for remain Today\u2019s move is significant and a big victory for the grassroots of the Labour party. We now need Labour to throw its huge weight behind the campaign to stop Brexit. Only a radical politics which promises fundamental change, more equality and public investment can beat Brexit - not status quo centrism. Good though today\u2019s news is, Labour still needs to clearly commit to opposing Brexit, and to unequivocally defending free movement and transforming Europe. Ultimately, policy must be made by members, not in backrooms. We will continue to campaign from the grassroots up, and we are mobilising another huge wave of motions for conference in September. MPs are now starting their debate on the Northern Ireland bill. The Labour MP Conor McGinn starts. His amendment, new clause 1 (NC1), says, if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland is not restored by 21 October, the UK parliament should legislate to allow same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. If the power-sharing executive is restored before that, it would be up to them, he says. And if the executive is revived after Westminster has changed the law, it will have the power to change the law back, he suggests. The DUP MP Ian Paisley says, if this amendment passes, it could give one party in Northern Ireland an incentive not to revive the executive. McGinn says Paisley is referring to Sinn Fein. He says he has spoken to Sinn Fein, and he knows Sinn Fein wants the devolved assembly to make this decision. John Bercow, the Speaker, is now making a statement about the Northern Ireland bill. He says last night his office received a call from a \u201ctabloid scribbler\u201d who had heard the Speaker would not be chairing the proceedings this afternoon. He says kindness and generosity of spirit prevent him from naming the individual. But he says it is a long-established convention that the Speaker does not chair proceedings for a committee of the whole house (ie, when the committee stage of a bill is being considered by all MPs, not just a committee of about 20 of them - as is happening this afternoon.). He says this is a rule going back to the 17th century. He says he hopes the \u201cchappie has now got the point\u201d. Good Afternoon. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Sarah Marsh, who has been writing the blog this morning. Quite soon MPs will start the second and final day\u2019s debate on the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill. As Seth Jacobson reports, the Tory pro-European Dominic Grieve tabled an amendment intended to ensure that the next prime minister could not prorogue parliament in September and October to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. But it has just emerged that John Bercow, the Speaker, is not calling the amendment, which means it will not be put to a vote. Bercow blocks vote on amendment intended to stop next PM proroguing parliament for no-deal. The Guardian\u2019s Gaby Hinsliff has written about Corbyn\u2019s backing of a second referendum. She writes: Is Labour really the party of remain, or leave? The official answer for a good three years has been both, which increasingly means in the eyes of many voters it is neither convincingly. The paradox of this week\u2019s otherwise seismic shift in Labour Brexit positioning is that once the dust settles, essentially that\u2019s still true. Jeremy Corbyn does seem finally to have been cornered into a second referendum on Brexit, with trade union leaders unanimously agreeing this week that if a Conservative government brings any sort of deal (or a firm date for leaving with no deal) before parliament, Labour should demand a referendum on it and campaign to remain. Here is Gaby\u2019s article in full. The Liberal Democrats who, to Labour\u2019s cost, made so many gains in the European elections in May, say Labour\u2019s new position on a second referendum does not make it a remain party. The Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake said: Labour are still a party of Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn can pretend all he likes that the Labour party are finally moving towards backing the Liberal Democrat policy of a People\u2019s Vote, but it is clear it is still his intention to negotiate a damaging Brexit deal if he gets the keys to number ten. Labour must start being transparent with the British people. Any Brexit deal, whoever it is negotiated by, will damage our country. It will mean job losses, problems for our NHS, and more time wasted on not tackling the biggest issues facing the UK. The Liberal Democrats have been unequivocal in our fight to stop Brexit and Corbyn should join us. The only real route out of this mess is a People\u2019s Vote, with the option to stay in the EU. Protests have taken place outside Labour headquarters as a disputes panel of the party\u2019s national executive meets on Tuesday to discuss whether to reinstate Chris Williamson. Williamson, the MP for Derby North, had been suspended for suggesting the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism complaints. But he was last week let back into the party with a reprimand by a three-person disciplinary panel, prompting a fierce reaction. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson joined MPs and peers to demand he lose the whip, while nearly 70 Labour staff members wrote to express their outrage. He was put back under suspension after Keith Vaz, one of the members of the disputes panel who had argued for him to be readmitted, said the decision should be reviewed. The disputes panel will meet this morning to discuss whether to refer him up to a further disciplinary sub-committee of the National Executive Committee, which may decide to send the case for further investigation or allow him to be readmitted. If he is let back in, Williamson is likely to face a selection battle in his own constituency after a bitter row with the trade union Unite. The Guardian\u2019s political editor Heather Stewart reports on party\u2019s decision to campaign to stay in EU rather than back no deal or Tory deal in people\u2019s vote. Labour have announced their Brexit position in a letter from Jeremy Corbyn to party members. He says: Dear member, I am proud to lead the Labour Party \u2013 the greatest political party and social movement in this country. We all recognise that the issue of Brexit has been divisive in our communities and sometimes in our party too. As democrats, Labour accepted the result of the 2016 referendum. In our 2017 manifesto, Labour also committed to oppose a No Deal Brexit and the Tories\u2019 Brexit plans \u2013 which threatened jobs, living standards, and the open multicultural society that we as internationalists value so much. I want to pay tribute to Keir Starmer and the shadow Brexit team for holding the Government to account during this process. That helped secure a meaningful vote on their deal \u2013 which we then defeated three times \u2013 including inflicting the largest ever defeat on any Government. And following their refusal to publish their legal advice, this Government became the first to be held in contempt of Parliament. Labour set out a compromise plan to try to bring the country together based around a customs union, a strong single market relationship and protection of environmental regulations and rights at work. We continue to believe this is a sensible alternative that could bring the country together. But the Prime Minister refused to compromise and was unable to deliver, so we ended cross-party talks. Now both Tory leadership candidates are threatening a No Deal Brexit - or at best a race to the bottom and a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump: that runs down industry, opens up our NHS and other public services to yet more privatisation, and shreds environmental protections, rights at work and consumer standards. I have spent the past few weeks consulting with the shadow cabinet, MPs, affiliated unions and the NEC. I have also had feedback from members via the National Policy Forum consultation on Brexit. Whoever becomes the new Prime Minister should have the confidence to put their deal, or No Deal, back to the people in a public vote. In those circumstances, I want to make it clear that Labour would campaign for Remain against either No Deal or a Tory deal that does not protect the economy and jobs. Labour has a crucial, historic duty to safeguard jobs, rights and living standards. But no Brexit outcome alone can do that. We need a general election. After nine years of austerity, too many people in this country cannot find decent secure well-paid work, and have to rely on public services that have been severely cut back. Our country is ravaged by inequality and rising poverty, huge regional imbalances of investment, and the government is failing to tackle the climate emergency facing us all. That is why we need a Labour government to end austerity and rebuild our country for the many not the few. Yours, Jeremy Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has said that the next prime minister should put their Brexit deal to a vote, and if that happened the Labour party would campaign for remain. The news has been met with a strong response on social media. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg said: It\u2019s progress of a sort as Corbyn explicit that he\u2019d support staying in the EU in that hypothetical scenario, but he doesn\u2019t sign up to the manifesto demand which would have gone further. Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that the Labour party will campaign for remain in a referendum \u201cagainst no deal or a Tory deal\u201d. On Tuesday morning, the leader of the Labour party, convened a meeting of the party\u2019s shadow cabinet to agree a settled Brexit position. But Heather also notes that the announcement, in a long email to members, does not include anything explaining what Labour\u2019s position would be after a general election. Sir David warned: The problem you\u2019re opening now is a very serious one, if the world climate change goes on it is going to be facing huge problems with immigration. Large parts of Africa are going to be even less inhabitable than they are now, and there will be major upsets in the balance between our national boundaries. These kind of problems are going to grow inexorably and we are going to have to decide what we do about it, that\u2019s going to happen. He said industry should be encouraged to invest in new technologies for generating, storing and transporting energy, such as batteries, and that he thought progress was being made. Channel 4\u2019s chief executive Alex Mahon has said that the broadcaster does not make reality TV or observational programmes merely because they are cheap and \u201cfill schedules\u201d. Speaking before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee inquiry into reality TV, Mahon said there is a \u201chuge public appetite\u201d for programmes that show \u201cdifferent groups of people doing things in society\u201d. Damian Collins, chairman of the DCMS, suggested that such programmes involving members of the public are \u201cquite cheap to make\u201d and that they take up more space in the TV schedule than they did 20 years ago. Mahon said: \u201cIt is important that as public service broadcasters we tell challenging stories about life in Britain today and give insight into that, yes, it\u2019s not necessarily cheaper to do than doing other things. \u201cThere are some genres of non-scripted programming that are cheap, sometimes quizzes if you make them in bulk, and there are some genres that are very expensive, which are in the multiple hundreds of thousands of pounds per episode to make because they are very complex to construct. \u201cIf you take a programme like One Born Every Minute... a life-affirming show and incredibly entertaining for audiences. It\u2019s certainly not cheap to make because of the way we make it, construct it, the way we film it and work with contributors on it. \u201cSo I would refute the suggestion that we are doing that to fill schedules with \u2018cheap things\u2019; we are doing those programmes often to create insight into society.\u201d Sir David Attenborough said the UK\u2019s record on tackling climate change \u201cis pretty good\u201d. But he added: \u201cWho started the problem? This country. It was the industrial revolution which started here, and what was the industrial revolution, it was based on burning coal. As it was us who started the problems, and if we are now taking a lead in solving the problem that only the right and responsible thing to do.\u201d On the 2050 target he said: \u201cMy only hope is we don\u2019t backslide. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough target. It\u2019s not an easy statement to have made, it\u2019s going to cost money. \u201cIt\u2019s not just piety, anybody can express pious views, its a practical commitment, and I hope to goodness we can achieve that.\u201d The broadcaster also said that the cost of air travel would have to increase to reduce emissions. \u201cI certainly worry that the job I do involves me travelling, I have travelled by air only too frequently in the last few months to make programmes, some of them about this very subject we are talking about,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThe long-term solution is we work out a way of powering aeroplanes electrically.\u201d Sir David said the voices of \u201cdisbelief\u201d on climate change should not be stamped out and it was important that they should be heard in public. But he said: I\u2019m sorry there are people who are in power internationally, notably of course the US, but also Australia, which is extraordinary because Australia is having to deal with some of the most extreme manifestations of climate change, and these voices are already heard ... One hopes the electorate will respond to that. And he said public attitudes towards the environment had been \u201ctransformed\u201d \u2013 drawing a parallel to changing attitudes to slavery in the 19th century. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s campaign says it can \u201crun up a big win\u201d in Scotland after the foreign secretary\u2019s strong performance at last Friday\u2019s hustings in Perth and a snap poll of Scottish councillors suggesting that two-thirds were backing him against Boris Johnson. The Guardian has reported previously on fears amongst Scottish Conservatives that a Johnson premiership could boost support for independence: now Hunt\u2019s campaign has released snapshot figures showing that, out of a survey of more than 100 Tory councillors, 60 were backing Hunt as opposed to 36 supporting Johnson. A campaign source said: \u201cThe vast majority of Scottish Conservative MSPs are backing Jeremy and it looks like the same picture across the wider party. We are hopeful of running up a big win for Jeremy north of the border.\u201d Hunt certainly came across as more definitive on the union at Friday\u2019s event. He said he would not give Holyrood permission to hold a second independence referendum, but warned that the party must \u201cprepare\u201d for another poll given the possibility of a Corbyn government allowing one in exchange for SNP support at Westminster. Johnson underlined his passion for the union but refused to answer definitely on the question of a s30 order. But it\u2019s worth remembering that the Scottish government has made ample capital out of the fact that Scotland voted one way on the EU referendum while the rest of the Britain voted another. If Hunt does benefit from a Scottish surge, and wins in Scotland whilst Johnson triumphs in England, one can only wonder how that may be similarly weaponised in months to come. Quizzed on whether the UK\u2019s new legal \u201cnet zero\u201d target for 2050 was sufficient or whether calls from campaigners for a 2025 goal was realistic, Sir David said: \u201cyou can\u2019t be radical enough in deal with issues at the moment.\u201d \u201cThe question is what is practically possible, and how can we take the electorate with us in dealing with these problems. \u201cDealing with problems means we\u2019ve got to change our lifestyle.\u201d \u201cThe electorate of tomorrow are already making their voices very clear, that\u2019s a source of great comfort.\u201d And he said: \u201cI\u2019m OK for the next decade, all of us are OK, we won\u2019t face the problems that are coming. \u201cThe problems of the next 20 to 30 years are great problems that are going to cause great social unrest and cause great changes in what we eat and how we live.\u201d On the issue of plastic, Sir David said: \u201cI\u2019ve been going on about plastics for 20 years. Anybody who swims know that, or anyone who travels can see, the horrors of what plastic pollution can do. \u201cI\u2019ve been putting it in programmes for years, and nobody took any notice\u201d. Then a two-minute clip in his programme Blue Planet II \u201crang a bell with people\u201d, he added. Sir David Attenborough is in parliament talking about climate change. He said the most vivid example he has seen of the changing climate was revisiting the Great Barrier Reef and seeing how it had bleached because of rising temperatures. He told Parliament\u2019s Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee that when visiting the Australian landmark in the 1950s he had \u201cthe extraordinary experience of diving on the reef and suddenly seeing this multitude of fantastic beautiful forms of life.\u201d But of returning 10 years ago, he said: \u201cInstead of multitudes of wonderful forms of life I was struck by how it was bleached white because of the rising temperatures and increasing acidity of the seas\u201d. When he started out in natural history, Sir David did not talk about climate change, because \u201cwe didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t believe we could change the climate, or worse the changes we were going to inflict were irreversible, which they are if we go on as we are.\u201d And he said: \u201cI\u2019m not by nature a propagandist\u201d, but added \u201cif you become aware of what is happening you don\u2019t have any alternative\u201d. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney is to warn the Irish cabinet this morning over the \u201cdire\u201d consequences of no deal in Ireland and for the all-Ireland economy. On Tuesday, he will deliver three reports to a special cabinet meeting with the principle paper running to more than 100 pages. It is understood that checks on goods crossing the border from Northern Ireland could be conducted elsewhere in relation to customs and VAT but the unsolved challenge is mandatory checks on animals and agrifood including the one third of Northern Ireland milk that goes south for cheese, butter and dried milk products for exported infant formula and confectionary. One option being considered by the EU agriculture department is to disrupt the all-Ireland economy. At present, this involves one third of milk from Northern Ireland being processed south of the border and more than 400,000 sheep being slaughtered annually in abattoirs hundreds of miles away in the republic. Environment secretary Michael Gove has said that Britain cannot \u201coffshore\u201d responsibilities for food standards in any future trade deals including agreement with the US which chlorinates its chicken before sale. He said animal welfare standards of British farming had to be \u201cprotected\u201d to guarantee consumer trust in what they eat. \u201cWhat we cannot have is an approach towards trade that tries to offshore our responsibilities and undermine high standards that British farmers produce,\u201d he told the National Farmers\u2019 Union summer party in Westminster on Monday evening. His front bench future is in the balance and his consistent advocacy for continuing animal welfare standards has not been shared by everyone around the cabinet table. Gove said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that the problems that exist with chlorinated chicken are a direct result of lower animal welfare standards in some parts of the United States than here and we have to maintain and protect the high animal welfare standards that are number one in British agriculture.\u201d He added: \u201cOne of the things that underpins agriculture is high agriculture standards and the provenance of that which we sell. That needs to be protected ... Protection is not a dirty word when it comes to ensure that we have standards in which consumers can trust. \u201c NFU president Minette Batters said she was \u201cmassively concerned\u201d that Gove\u2019s pledges would be reneged on in a future cabinet. \u201cIt\u2019s not opposition to leaving, it\u2019s about a managed deal that can enshrine our values\u201d William Hague has urged Boris Johnson to rule out suspending parliament in a no-deal Brexit scenario. The former Conservative party leader said Johnson must avoid suspending Parliament in order to try to get a no-deal Brexit through if he becomes prime minister. Lord Hague said the frontrunner in the battle for Downing Street should use a head-to-head TV debate with rival Jeremy Hunt on Tuesday to make clear he would not use a parliamentary \u201cmanoeuvre\u201d in this way. The call came as former attorney general Dominic Grieve has tabled an amendment to the Northern Ireland Bill - intended to keep government in the province running in the absence of the devolved institutions - requiring Parliament to come back to the issue in October. The move is designed to try to ensure the next prime minister cannot push through a no deal on October 31, the current EU deadline for agreeing on a deal, simply by suspending - or \u201cproroguing\u201d - Parliament. Commons Speaker John Bercow is expected to announce on Tuesday whether he has selected the amendment for debate, giving MPs the chance to vote on it. Johnson, who has said he will take Britain out of the EU by the end of October \u201cdo or die\u201d, warned such tactics risked playing into the hands of Jeremy Corbyn and Labour. Lord Hague, who backs Mr Hunt in the Tory leadership race, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt is very important that Parliament is able to give its opinion.\u201d Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson will appear on a live ITV debate at 8pm on Tuesday to battle to be the next Tory party leader. Johnson will hope to use the occasion to seal his position as the clear frontrunner, with polls giving him an overwhelming lead. Proroguing the House of Commons to achieve a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cthe end of parliamentary democracy\u201d in the UK, Dominic Grieve has said in defending his move to seek to remove the option. Grieve\u2019s amendment, which has cross-party support including from a handful of fellow Conservative MPs, is to the Northern Ireland bill going through the Commons, and would require fortnightly reports on that country\u2019s formation of an executive, which has been vacant since 2017. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Grieve said the amendment calls for \u201cregular motions before parliament in September and particularly October\u201d. If passed, it would prevent the parliamentary session being prorogued, or abruptly ended, in the lead-up to the 31 October departure date. Catch up on the latest Guardian political stories of the day: Whoever is behind the leak of sensitive diplomatic messages was intent on sabotaging the British ambassador to the US in order for them to be replaced by someone \u201cmore congenial\u201d, a person who formerly held the role has claimed. Sir Christopher Meyer said there was a \u201cpossible range of villains\u201d who could be responsible for the leaking of memos in which Sir Kim Darroch described the US administration under Donald Trump as \u201cinept\u201d. Sir Christopher told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cHere there is a possible range of villains who come into the frame. But it was clearly somebody who set out, deliberately, to sabotage Sir Kim\u2019s ambassadorship, to make his position untenable, and to have him replaced by somebody more congenial to the leaker.\u201d There has been fierce criticism of the mystery leaker from government ministers. The person or people behind it should \u201cregret the moment for the rest of their life\u201d, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said, while defence minister Tobias Ellwood suggested the leaker put \u201cself-interest above country\u201d. A formal leak investigation has been launched by the Foreign Office, and in the Commons there were calls for a police investigation amid widespread anger at the diplomatic fall-out. Foreign Secretary and Conservative Party leadership contender Jeremy Hunt said \u201call avenues of inquiry\u201d would be explored to find out how it happened. Hunt told The Sun: \u201cOf course it would be massively concerning if it was the act of a foreign, hostile state. \u201cI\u2019ve seen no evidence that that\u2019s the case, but we\u2019ll look at the leak inquiry very carefully.\u201d William Hague, the former leader of the Conservative party, has said that leadership hopefuls Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson should rule out dissolving parliament to get through a no-deal Brexit. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Hague said: \u201cHe should rule it out. For a Conservative government to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit, in defiance of the pleas of business and farming organisations, and increasing the risks to the union of the United Kingdom, and defying any attempts to have a vote in Parliament, would be an extraordinary combination of things to do, so yes I do think Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt should rule that out.\u201d He supported former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, bringing the amendment against prorogation:\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that parliament is able to give its opinion. It ought to be unthinkable that we could leave the EU by a manoeuvre, by a procedural ruse of some kind.\u201d He added: \u201cWhile I don\u2019t agree with everything Dominic has said or tried to do, I sympathise with attempts to ensure that Parliament can have its say.\u201d Trump has criticised the UK ambassador, following a leak in which he described the US president as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d. But this morning, people have come out in defence of Sir Kim Darroch, the UK\u2019s ambassador to Washington. Tory former foreign secretary Lord William Hague told the BBC: \u201cYou can\u2019t change an ambassador at the demand of a host country. \u201cIt is their job to give an honest assessment of what is happening in that country.\u201d A former British ambassador to the US , Sir Christopher Meyer, branded Trump \u201cinsecure\u201d. He said: \u201cIt just shows President Trump\u2019s sensitivity. The House of Commons sits from 11.30am with an hour of justice questions. It could be one of the last times the secretary of state for Justice, David Gauke, appears in this role, after the Tory MP said he will quit the cabinet if Johnson becomes prime minister. He made this announcement as he would want to fight a no-deal Brexit. If he was to leave by the end of the month it would mean that the government would need to appoint their seventh justice secretary in just seven years. Elsewhere, Parliament will host broadcasting legend David Attenborough today. He will be giving evidence on climate change to the Commons business committee at 10 am. On Tuesday, student climate network activists will also meet political leaders including Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford. From 10.30am, the department for culture, media and sport committee will question senior Channel 4 executives. The health secretary Matt Hancock is giving evidence to the Commons Health and Social Care Committee from 2.30pm. Outside of Westminster, in Brussels, the Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet Michel Barnier this afternoon. A Labour group is campaigning to abolish Eton, and other elite private schools in England. Activists are aiming to capitalise on Boris Johnson\u2019s likely election as Conservative leader and are circulating a motion for the party\u2019s conference in September that would commit a Labour government to stripping fee-paying schools of their privileges and integrating them into the state system. The group, Labour Against Private Schools, launched the campaign on Tuesday using the @AbolishEtonTwitter handle. It is backed by a number of Labour MPs including the former party leader Ed Miliband. MPs prepare to vote on the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Bill at 7pm this evening. Much attention is on the speaker John Bercow who will announce at mid-morning which amendments have been selected for votes, and there are three which could have a seismic impact. Labour MP Conor McGinn\u2019s \u201cnew clause 1\u201d, which would legalize gay marriage in Northern Ireland. Labour colleague Diana Johnson\u2019s \u201cnew clause 9\u201d which would force ministers to review abortion rights in the province. Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment to prevent the next prime minister from proroguing parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. A former British ambassador to the US has branded president Donald Trump \u201cinsecure\u201d over the diplomatic war of words raging between London and Washington DC. Referring to Trump\u2019s declaration he would no longer deal with the UK\u2019s ambassador Sir Kim Darroch, previous occupant of the post Sir Christopher Meyer told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt just shows President Trump\u2019s sensitivity. \u201cHis insecurity, which Sir Kim himself bore witness to.\u201d Referring to whoever leaked diplomatic cables from Sir Kim, Sir Christopher said: \u201cHere there is a possible range of villains who come into the frame. \u201cBut, it was clearly somebody who set out, deliberately, to sabotage Sir Kim\u2019s ambassadorship, to make his position untenable, and to have him replaced by somebody more congenial to the leaker.\u201d Exactly a year ago today Boris Johnson quit as foreign secretary in protest at Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan. One year on, and the former mayor is making a play to be prime minister. The final two Tory leadership hopefuls \u2013 Jeremy Hunt and Johnson \u2013 will go head to head on a live TV debate this evening. Millions of viewers will tune in to ITV1 at 8 pm as they battle it out before a live audience in Salford, Greater Manchester. The discussion will be hosted by TV newsreader and journalist ,Julie Etchingham, who will moderate the hour-long debate, with audience members asking questions pre-vetted by ITV. Welcome to the live blog, where we will be running through the political news of the day. On Tuesday, the main story is US president Donald Trump\u2019s scathing attack on Theresa May and the British ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch. The diplomat\u2019s frank assessments of Trump as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d were leaked to the Mail on Sunday, prompting the president to launch a tirade against Darroch. He said: \u201cI do not know the ambassador, but he is not liked or well thought of within the US. We will no longer deal with him. The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister. While I thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent state visit last month, it was the Queen who I was most impressed with!\u201d May last night vowed to stand by Darroch. In a statement issued at 10.19 p.m, a UK government spokesman said Darroch maintains the prime minister\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d. The US president also took aim against May and her representatives, saying they had made a \u201cmess\u201d over Brexit, contrary to his advice. Just weeks ago, he praised the prime minister in person on his state visit to the UK, saying she had done a \u201cvery good job\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>There was a brief frisson of excitement when someone said that Jason McCartney was in the spin room for the ITV leadership debate in Manchester. No one knew the former North Melbourne Aussie rules footballer and current list manager at the Greater Western Sydney Giants was in town. Then the excitement died a little. It was a different Jason McCartney. Jason McCartney, the former Tory MP who lost his seat at the 2017 general election and was now delegated to be cheerleader in chief for Team Boris. Point man to explain to a room full of hacks why his man had won the debate. Even if he hadn\u2019t. Understandably McCartney looked slightly overawed by the responsibility.</p> <p>Over on the other side of the room rooting for Team Hunt was another former MP, Rob Wilson. Him and me neither. It hadn\u2019t been meant to be like this. The spin room had been billed to be full of ambitious Tory MPs, slavering for top jobs when their man became prime minister. Except it turned out that the Conservative whips hadn\u2019t quite trusted their Labour counterparts to pair their absentee MPs and had ordered them all back to Westminster for the crucial vote on the Dominic Grieve amendment to force parliament to report fortnightly throughout October. Even then it hadn\u2019t been enough as the government was defeated by a single vote. A sign of things to come.</p> <p>The debate proper began with both men appearing on stage like two contestants in a dodgy 1980s game show. Boris Johnson stared at the floor. A man-boy dressed in an ill-fitting suit. Don\u2019t mess this up, he told himself. All he needed to do was get through the next hour and he would end up as prime minister. \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d he babbled. On reflection, taking a large amount of amphetamines just minutes before going on air hadn\u2019t been that good an idea. Jeremy Hunt was in full psycho Colonel Kurtz mode. Eyes fixed and jaw clenched. A cocktail of steroids and napalm was a heady mix. He was the entrepreneur with a plan. The first health secretary to have run the NHS.

      "bodyText": "There was a brief frisson of excitement when someone said that Jason McCartney was in the spin room for the ITV leadership debate in Manchester. No one knew the former North Melbourne Aussie rules footballer and current list manager at the Greater Western Sydney Giants was in town. Then the excitement died a little. It was a different Jason McCartney. Jason McCartney, the former Tory MP who lost his seat at the 2017 general election and was now delegated to be cheerleader in chief for Team Boris. Point man to explain to a room full of hacks why his man had won the debate. Even if he hadn\u2019t. Understandably McCartney looked slightly overawed by the responsibility. Over on the other side of the room rooting for Team Hunt was another former MP, Rob Wilson. Him and me neither. It hadn\u2019t been meant to be like this. The spin room had been billed to be full of ambitious Tory MPs, slavering for top jobs when their man became prime minister. Except it turned out that the Conservative whips hadn\u2019t quite trusted their Labour counterparts to pair their absentee MPs and had ordered them all back to Westminster for the crucial vote on the Dominic Grieve amendment to force parliament to report fortnightly throughout October. Even then it hadn\u2019t been enough as the government was defeated by a single vote. A sign of things to come. The debate proper began with both men appearing on stage like two contestants in a dodgy 1980s game show. Boris Johnson stared at the floor. A man-boy dressed in an ill-fitting suit. Don\u2019t mess this up, he told himself. All he needed to do was get through the next hour and he would end up as prime minister. \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d he babbled. On reflection, taking a large amount of amphetamines just minutes before going on air hadn\u2019t been that good an idea. Jeremy Hunt was in full psycho Colonel Kurtz mode. Eyes fixed and jaw clenched. A cocktail of steroids and napalm was a heady mix. He was the entrepreneur with a plan. The first health secretary to have run the NHS. Into the ground. That pretty much turned out to be the highlight of the entire show \u2013 apart from the ad break \u2013 with Johnson choosing to treat proceedings like a third-rate debate at the Oxford Union. \u201cI\u2019ve got a four-point plan,\u201d he shouted. No one had apparently told him he was wearing a microphone. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a 10-point plan,\u201d Hunt countered. Boris looked rather put out. The fact that neither plan bore any close examination was neither here nor there. Colonel Kurtz then went on the offensive. Would Boris resign if he failed to deliver Brexit by 31 October? PIFFFLEPAFFLEWIFFFLEWAFFLE. Was that a yes or no? PIFFLEPAFFLEWIFFLEWAFFLE. We all just needed to believe. In something. Anything. Be optimistic. So long as it included Boris becoming prime minister.

Trump would vent his anger, and gain private British assurances that Sir Kim Darroch will be replaced by someone more palatable by the end of the year.</p> \n<p>It would create an awkward interlude in the special relationship but every family has bust-ups.</p> \n<p>But Trump does not seem to be in a mood to let this pass. As Darroch wrote in one of his leaked memos, the president radiates insecurity, and only one-syllable fawning keeps him on the rails.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/donald-trump-calls-theresa-may-foolish-as-diplomatic-row-escalates\">Trump calls May foolish as diplomatic row escalates</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Theresa May, increasingly the target of Trump\u2019s unfriendly fire, has so far clearly decided to stand up for Britain, the diplomatic profession and support Darroch by simply refusing to move him. She will have prevented a revolt in the civil service by doing so, and may feel relieved that the artifice of her friendship with the president is drawing to a close.</p> \n<p>Yet Darroch is not scheduled to leave the post until the end of the year. Trump withdrew Darroch\u2019s invitation to a state dinner for the Emir of Qatar, and clearly intends to go on in this mode. If he decides other US state institutions should blackball the ambassador, the president is entitled to issue the instruction. He can, if he so wishes, expel Darroch from the country. Emissaries are there at the pleasure of the country to which they are sent.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"58ad8bc4-5408-46b3-a20f-7fe1f19f60df\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s2g10sZPYUg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump could even extend the embargo on contacts to all British diplomatic staff. In extremis, relations between the intelligence agencies could be curtailed. Trump anyway has a mixed view of British intelligence after one former agent, Christopher Steele, played a role in compiling the dossier on the president\u2019s alleged collusion with the Russians during the 2016 election.</p> \n<p>Trump, as he has shown innumerable times, is capable of anything, including a 180-degree turn in one tweet to the next.</p> \n<p>In reality, May had little option but to stand by Darroch, given the insults hurled at her by the president and the country\u2019s self-respect on the line.</p> \n<p>It will be for the remaining grownups in the Trump administration, including the US ambassador to Britain, Woody Johnson, to try to limit the fallout by making sure Trump\u2019s only target is Barroch and not the UK more broadly.</p> \n<p>Liam Fox, who is close to the US administration and a loyal ally of May, was in Washington this week working overtime to achieve this, largely by trying to put Darroch\u2019s memos in context and assuring the president that the ambassador\u2019s selectively leaked views do not reflect UK government thinking.</p> \n<p>The standoff could continue, but with time the president\u2019s attention will stray on to another item on Fox News.</p> \n<p>But May has only weeks left in office, and neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Hunt, if elected leader, will be able to avoid the hottest item in their in-tray when one of them becomes prime minister.</p> \n<p>It should not be beyond the wit of some of the best diplomats in the land, and even Johnson, to assure Trump that his new bete noire \u2013 Darroch \u2013 is leaving imminently, and someone more palatable is on his, or her, way.

      "bodyText": "In normal times, the breakdown in relations between Donald Trump and the British ambassador to the US could be readily finessed. Trump would vent his anger, and gain private British assurances that Sir Kim Darroch will be replaced by someone more palatable by the end of the year. It would create an awkward interlude in the special relationship but every family has bust-ups. But Trump does not seem to be in a mood to let this pass. As Darroch wrote in one of his leaked memos, the president radiates insecurity, and only one-syllable fawning keeps him on the rails. Theresa May, increasingly the target of Trump\u2019s unfriendly fire, has so far clearly decided to stand up for Britain, the diplomatic profession and support Darroch by simply refusing to move him. She will have prevented a revolt in the civil service by doing so, and may feel relieved that the artifice of her friendship with the president is drawing to a close. Yet Darroch is not scheduled to leave the post until the end of the year. Trump withdrew Darroch\u2019s invitation to a state dinner for the Emir of Qatar, and clearly intends to go on in this mode. If he decides other US state institutions should blackball the ambassador, the president is entitled to issue the instruction. He can, if he so wishes, expel Darroch from the country. Emissaries are there at the pleasure of the country to which they are sent. Trump could even extend the embargo on contacts to all British diplomatic staff. In extremis, relations between the intelligence agencies could be curtailed. Trump anyway has a mixed view of British intelligence after one former agent, Christopher Steele, played a role in compiling the dossier on the president\u2019s alleged collusion with the Russians during the 2016 election. Trump, as he has shown innumerable times, is capable of anything, including a 180-degree turn in one tweet to the next. In reality, May had little option but to stand by Darroch, given the insults hurled at her by the president and the country\u2019s self-respect on the line. It will be for the remaining grownups in the Trump administration, including the US ambassador to Britain, Woody Johnson, to try to limit the fallout by making sure Trump\u2019s only target is Barroch and not the UK more broadly. Liam Fox, who is close to the US administration and a loyal ally of May, was in Washington this week working overtime to achieve this, largely by trying to put Darroch\u2019s memos in context and assuring the president that the ambassador\u2019s selectively leaked views do not reflect UK government thinking. The standoff could continue, but with time the president\u2019s attention will stray on to another item on Fox News. But May has only weeks left in office, and neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Hunt, if elected leader, will be able to avoid the hottest item in their in-tray when one of them becomes prime minister. It should not be beyond the wit of some of the best diplomats in the land, and even Johnson, to assure Trump that his new bete noire \u2013 Darroch \u2013 is leaving imminently, and someone more palatable is on his, or her, way. Given the long lead time in which these major appointments are made, Johnson could plausibly announce a successor in September, as part of a wider shakeup, in time for the new person to take over in the late autumn. But the bullying tone adopted by Trump does not make the choices easy for Johnson, a man that shares Trump\u2019s vision of Brexit, and what it could mean for a reinvigorated special relationship. The existing danger for Johnson is that if Trump lauds his elevation too much, he will find himself portrayed not as prime minister, but as the governor of the 51st state. If the consequence of Brexit is obeisance to Trump, that is not a good look, including among the patriotic classes that do not view national liberation in terms of swopping vassalage to Brussels for Washington. On the other hand, if Johnson can show his friendship with the Trump family means he can persuade the president to de-escalate the crisis that would be a bonus. In Tuesday night\u2019s TV debate between Hunt and Johnson, both candidates are likely to be asked whether they would support someone from outside the diplomatic service taking up the Washington job, so by implication accepting there is some merit in Trump\u2019s criticisms of the British civil service. To appoint an outsider in the current context would be symbolic, and potentially perilous. Tom Fletcher, a former ambassador to Lebanon who is close to the Foreign Office, has been one of the most prominent former diplomats out defending impartial, professional, brilliant public servants.

About \u00a3415,000 is from donations, with more than \u00a3330,000 given since May. About \u00a3385,000 came in fees for speeches, including \u00a3123,000 for a single address to a media conference in Delhi. Johnson also receives \u00a323,000 a month for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/daily-telegraph-apology-boris-johnson-drug-dealer-regulator\">his Telegraph column</a>, and makes money from book royalties.</p>\n    <p>Hunt is lagging considerably in donations, having pulled in just under \u00a3186,000 over the same nine-month period, all donated since May.

      "bodyText": "The UK is among the worst countries in Europe for cycling participation, and the government is predicted to achieve just a third of the 800m extra cycling trips by 2025 it had aimed for. What\u2019s more, much of the growth so far has been restricted to London. This is why Tuesday\u2019s debate among MPs on government support for cycling and walking \u2013 or rather, the lack thereof \u2013 is so important. The government\u2019s attitude towards cycling was summed up when the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, complained that cycle lanes \u201ccause too much of a problem for road users\u201d \u2013 before knocking a man off his bike outside parliament just weeks later. This neglect doesn\u2019t just risk the safety of cyclists but jeopardises our planet. The UN intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that the world has 11 years for global warming to be kept to a maximum rise of 1.5C over pre-industrial levels, yet the UK is way off track to meet its own climate change targets and is further still from meeting its commitments under the Paris climate agreement. This failure is being driven by a rising trend in emissions caused largely by increased traffic growth, which has left transport as the UK\u2019s single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and the worst-performing sector when it comes to reducing carbon emissions. For too long, transport has been put in the \u201ctoo difficult\u201d box as far as climate change is concerned. If this is to change, a transformation in the funding and priority given to cycling and walking is needed. This failure on transport emissions is the result of deliberate government policy encouraging traffic growth through an ever-expanding multibillion-pound programme of road building. At the same time, public transport subsidies have been slashed and campaigners are warning that spending on England outside London is set to fall to 37p per person per head in 2020-21. Climate change should be the number one priority of the Department for Transport (DfT), with focus and resources directed towards sustainable modes of transport. It is hugely under-appreciated how big a part cycling and walking must play in this. Were the UK to achieve the same cycling culture and levels of infrastructure as the Netherlands, we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from car travel by as much as a third. That\u2019s not to mention the many social and economic benefits, such as tackling the air pollution crisis and reaping health benefits that could save the NHS up to \u00a39bn per year. Encouraging active travel will also breathe new life into our towns and cities by reclaiming the urban realm, creating public spaces that are freer from traffic and accompanying pollutants, and fostering environments that are pleasant places in which to live and work. This is a significant task, but we have the benefit of international examples to guide us on how this can be achieved. Cities in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark experienced steep declines in cycling until policy changes in the 1970s put them on a trajectory to become the most cycle-friendly places in the world.

      "bodyText": "Representative Eric Swalwell dropped out of the 2020 presidential race. Some of the gajillion other Democratic candidates still fighting the good fight responded. Representative Justin Amash, the first Republican to back impeachment of President Trump, sent formal notification today that he is withdrawing his membership from the House Republican Conference and resigning from the House oversight and reform committee. The United Nations\u2019 human rights chief said she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the conditions migrants and refugees face in US detention facilities. Attorney general William Barr said he sees a way around the citizenship census question, but did not detail exactly what that plan was. Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein was charged with sex trafficking minors today, raising questions about his many powerful friends. President Bill Clinton has since issued a statement about his dealings with Epstein. Sir Kim Darroch, UK ambassador to Washington, was reportedly disinvited from dinner with the emir of Qatar. But Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots who was allegedly caught up in a Florida sex trafficking ring earlier this year, still got to keep his invite. The Associated Press is reporting that the State Department is proposing the sale of $2.2bn in arms to Taiwan, including 108 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger surface-to-air missiles. The Chinese foreign ministry firmly opposes US arms sales to Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as its territory. Taiwan split from China in 1949. The State Department says the arms will help Taiwan \u201cmeet current and future regional threats.\u201d President Trump tweeted about California governor Gavin Newsom declaring a state of emergency following two large earthquakes in southern California. President Bill Clinton issued a statement on Jeffrey Epstein and the sex trafficking case against him: The Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census. The Associated Press is reporting that attorney general William Barr sees a way to legally require 2020 census respondents answer the question. However, he would not detail said plan. If you\u2019ll recall back to June, when the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision to reject the commerce department\u2019s justification for including the question, the court did not deem the question unconstitutional (though pro-democracy advocates have warned that a citizenship question would suppress participation among immigrant-aligned population and disenfranchise Democratic-leaning voters). The court ruled that the justification was not credible. The justification, as stated by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, was to obtain better data to enforce the Voting Rights Act, the civil rights-era legislation against voter discrimination. From the Associated Press: Barr said he has been in regular contact with Trump over the issue of the citizenship question. \u201cI agree with him that the Supreme Court decision was wrong,\u201d the attorney general said. He said he believes there is \u201can opportunity potentially to cure the lack of clarity that was the problem and we might as well take a shot at doing that.\u201d Barr\u2019s statement comes after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the Trump administration of having a goal of \u201cmaking America white again\u201d with its census question. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are among a group of lawmakers proposing to declare climate change an official emergency. My colleague Emily Holden now has the text of that resolution: Read more about the resolution here: Remember Felix Sater? The Moscow-born businessman at the center of the Trump Tower Moscow project? The United Nations\u2019 human rights chief said she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the conditions migrants and refugees face in US detention facilities, the Associated Press is reporting. Children stopped by border agents should never be held in immigration detention facilities or separated from their families, said United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, and \u201cany deprivation of liberty of adult migrants and refugees should be a measure of last resort.\u201d A spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights office, Ravina Shamdasani, said Bachelet decided to speak out more forcefully than before after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general issued a report last week warning of dangerous conditions in U.S. immigration detention facilities. Many migrants and refugees set off on \u201cperilous journeys with their children in search of protection and dignity and away from violence and hunger,\u201d Bachelet said in a statement. \u201cWhen they finally believe they have arrived in safety, they may find themselves separated from their loved ones and locked in undignified conditions,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis should never happen anywhere.\u201d President Donald Trump said Sunday that migrants were coming from \u201cunbelievable poverty\u201d and \u201cthose are people that are very happy with what\u2019s going on because, relatively speaking, they\u2019re in much better shape right now\u201d in U.S. custody. He went on to praise the work of the Border Patrol and other law enforcement officers on the U.S.-Mexico border, saying, \u201cit\u2019s incredible what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019ve had to become nurses. They\u2019ve had to become janitors.\u201d The Homeland Security report was the second by the inspector general\u2019s office to blast conditions at temporary detention centers in Texas where migrants are held. The first, based on visits to Border Patrol facilities in western Texas in May, showed dozens of migrants packed into spaces so tight that some had to stand on toilets. It detailed how 900 migrants were in a 125-person facility at one point, with many held for weeks in violation of the government\u2019s policy. Last week\u2019s report, released July 2, said several Border Patrol facilities in south Texas were dangerously overcrowded. Detainees banged on cell windows, shouted and pressed notes to a window for inspectors, according to the report released July 2. A photo showed a man holding a piece of cardboard with one word: \u201chelp.\u201d Inspectors also warned that many children had no access to showers and were being detained long past the maximum of 72 hours. Five children have died in Border Patrol custody since December. \u201cAs a pediatrician, but also as a mother and a former head of state, I am deeply shocked that children are forced to sleep on the floor in overcrowded facilities, without access to adequate health care or food, and with poor sanitation conditions,\u201d Bachelet, a former president of Chile, said Monday. \u201cDetaining a child even for short periods under good conditions can have a serious impact on their health and development \u2014 consider the damage being done every day by allowing this alarming situation to continue,\u201d she said. Bachelet acknowledged the \u201csovereign prerogative\u201d of countries to set the conditions under which foreigners are permitted to enter and stay but also highlighted their human rights obligations. Her office said she recognized the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of challenges faced by migrants\u2019 countries of origin, the ones they travel through and destinations like the U.S. \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House,\u201d so says World Cup champion Megan Rapinoe, but what about the Senate? The House Judiciary Committee has released the written responses from the former chief of staff to former White House counsel Don McGahn: Downing Street responds to the statements from President Trump regarding UK ambassador Sir Kim Darroch and his leaked assessments of the administration: If you need a quick memory jog, Sir Kim Darroch is the UK ambassador to Washington. Leaked memos revealed Darroch\u2019s scathing assessment of the White House: \u201cWe don\u2019t really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept.\u201d For more on Darroch, read here: Representative Justin Amash, the first Republican to back impeachment of President Trump, sent formal notification today that he is withdrawing his membership from the House Republican Conference and resigning from the House oversight and reform committee. As House Democrats began issuing subpoenas for President Trump\u2019s financial records, the Justice Department fought a federal judge\u2019s decision to allow the lawsuit accusing Trump of profiting off the presidency to go forward, the Associated Press is reporting: Justice Department lawyers want an appeals court to take the case instead. They filed papers Monday seeking to move the case from federal court in D.C. to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. They also want to stop subpoena requests seeking Trump\u2019s business tax returns, and documents from Trump\u2019s D.C. and New York hotels, Mar-a-Lago Club and Trump Tower. Justice Department lawyers said answering the 37 subpoena requests by July 29 would cause Trump irreparable injury. Our climate and environment reporter, Susie Cagle, listened in on President Trump\u2019s speech about \u201cmaintaining a healthy environment.\u201d Here are some choice quotes from the speech: \u201cI went to the fires in California. It\u2019s also management. It\u2019s a lot of things happening.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t have dirty floors \u2026. you can\u2019t have 20 years of leaves.\u201d \u201cI will say this, I spoke with the governor of California, and the process of cleaning is now really taking precedent. A lot of people are looking at forest management.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have any forest fires.\u201d (This is false) \u201cI spoke to certain countries - well-known countries - that say, \u2018We\u2019re a forest nation.\u2019 And they don\u2019t have problems....Because they manage, they clean.\u201d \u201cWhen I went to California, they sort of scoffed at me for the first two weeks, ... and after about five weeks they said, \u2018He\u2019s right.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s a lot to unpack there. First, take a read of this article, which will disprove many of the president\u2019s points: Fire management is important, but fires are also natural. Forest fires will happen, and experts say they\u2019ll happen more often with the climate crisis going the way it\u2019s going. The issue in California is that much of what is burning is not forest - it\u2019s inhabited areas. The top two Democratic presidential candidates weigh in on Representative Eric Swalwell dropping out of the race: Representative Eric Swalwell of California announced today that he will be ending his 2020 presidential bid. Hey all, Vivian Ho with the west coast bureau taking over for Tom McCarthy. Happy Monday. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Wealthy sex offender Jeffrey Epstein pleaded not guilty in federal court in New York to two counts of sex trafficking. Prosecutors accused him of victimizing dozens of girls as young as 14 and requested that he be detained pending trial. A bail hearing was set for Monday. Former friends hosted by Epstein at his homes or aboard his plane include Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Allen Dershowitz. \u201cToo often adults in our society have turned a blind eye to this type of criminal behavior alleged here,\u201d an FBI official in the case said. Epstein had earlier avoided prison by striking a sweetheart deal overseen by current labor secretary Alexander Acosta. The White House did not comment on Epstein\u2019s arrest. Trump tweeted that \u201cwe will no longer deal with\u201d British ambassador Kim Darroch after cables by Darroch critical of Trump were leaked. Trump also blamed PM Theresa May for the Brexit \u201cmess.\u201d Attorney general William Barr said he saw a legal way for the Trump administration to include a citizenship question on the US Census and said the Supreme Court was \u201cwrong\u201d to deny an earlier effort. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said the intention behind the proposed Census question was \u201cmaking America white again.\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign raised $19.1m in the second quarter of this year, besting Bernie Sanders. Donald Trump at the White House has just delivered a speech about \u201cmaintaining a healthy environment\u201d. You can watch it here (skip to 3:00 for Trump): Representative Eric Swalwell is holding a news conference. Earlier guidance was he would suspend his presidential campaign today to run again for congress. Update: that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. \u201cToday ends our presidential campaign.\u201d \u201cHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused President Donald Trump\u2019s administration Monday of having a goal of \u2018making America white again\u2019 with its plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census,\u201d Bloomberg reports: \u201cYou know his hat? \u2018Making America white again.\u2019 They want to make sure that people, certain people, are counted,\u201d Pelosi said at a press conference on election security. \u201cIt\u2019s really disgraceful and it\u2019s not what our founders had in mind.\u201d Read further. A last dispatch from Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s day in court, via Victoria Bekiempis: Several of Epstein\u2019s accusers were present at court for the proceedings. David Boies and Sigrid McCawley, lawyers for some of Epstein\u2019s accusers, lauded the arrest. Boies said \u201cour clients are extremely gratified.\u201d McCawley read statements from two Epstein accusers, Giuffre and Sarah Ransome, during a brief presser after the proceedings. In this statement, Giuffre said she was \u201cdeeply pleased\u201d by federal prosecutors\u2019 decision to arrest him, and said \u201cit is time for Jeffrey Epstein, and those who participated in these sex crimes, to be brought to justice.\u201d Ransome\u2019s statement, also read by McCawley, said \u201cthe news of my abuser\u2019s arrest today was a step in the right direction to finally hold Epstein accountable for his crimes and restore my faith that power and money can\u2019t triumph over justice.\u201d Ned Price, who served under Barack Obama as a special assistant to the president for national security affairs, said Trump\u2019s tweets about UK ambassador to the US Kim Darroch only reinforced Darroch\u2019s descriptions of Trump in private. \u201cThe UK ambassador didn\u2019t write anything that wasn\u2019t already patently obvious to an informed observer,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe spoke of Donald Trump as someone with thin skin, as someone with a delicate ego, as someone who would be receptive to pandering, and just look at Trump\u2019s reaction. \u201cHe has proved the ambassador right in every respect \u2014 by proving he is ego driven, by proving he is thin-skinned, and by proving he will quite literally refuse to deal with people who don\u2019t say nice things about him.\u201d Attorney General William Barr said Monday that he sees a legal path to adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, despite a Supreme Court ruling that blocked its inclusion, at least temporarily, the AP reports: In an interview with The Associated Press, Barr said the Trump administration will take action in the coming days that he believes will allow the government to ask the controversial question. Barr would not detail the administration\u2019s plans, though a senior official said President Donald Trump is expected to issue a presidential memorandum to the Commerce Department instructing it to include the question. The Supreme Court\u2019s June ruling was a blow to Trump , who has been pressing for the government to ask about citizenship on next year\u2019s census. The U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s experts have said a question asking about citizenship would discourage immigrants from participating in the survey and result in a less accurate census. That in turn would redistribute money and political power away from Democratic-led cities where immigrants tend to cluster to whiter, rural areas where Republicans do well. Barr said he has been in regular contact with Trump over the issue. \u201cI agree with him that the Supreme Court decision was wrong,\u201d said Barr. He said he believes there is \u201can opportunity potentially to cure the lack of clarity that was the problem and we might as well take a shot at doing that.\u201d What Barr calls an innocent-sounding \u201clack of clarity\u201d on the administration\u2019s part, chief justice John Roberts saw as a \u201ccontrived\u201d \u201cdistraction\u201d from the administration\u2019s real reason for wanting the citizenship question, which Trump himself helpfully stated on Friday: \u201cNumber one, you need it for Congress \u2014 you need it for Congress for districting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need it for appropriations \u2014 where are the funds going? How many people are there? Are they citizens? Are they not citizens? You need it for many reasons.\u201d \u201cDistricting.\u201d The commerce department had argued before the supreme court that the question was needed to improve data for the administration of the Voting Rights Act. Attorney General William Barr says Democrats are trying to create a \u201cpublic spectacle\u201d by subpoenaing Special Counsel Robert Mueller to testify before Congress about the Russia investigation, the AP reports: In an interview with The Associated Press, Barr says the Justice Department would support Mueller if he decides he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to subject himself\u201d to congressional testimony. Barr also says the Justice Department would seek to block any attempt by Congress to subpoena members of the special counsel\u2019s team. There is no indication that Mueller is planning to skip his July 17 appearance before Congress. He\u2019s said he will not go beyond his 448-page report released in April. Mueller no longer works for the Justice Department, but the department could attempt to limit his testimony about decisions he made as special counsel. The department of homeland security has asked the defense department to authorize 1,000 additional Texas National Guard troops \u201cto provide supplemental holding and port of entry enforcement support\u201d to US customs and border patrol efforts within Texas, CNN reports. A crisis of migrants detained in subhuman conditions at the border shows no signs of abating, writes Amanda Holpuch: Hundreds of children at a migrant detention center in Texas are being held in \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions that amount to an \u201cemergency public health crisis\u201d and should be allowed immediate access to doctors, according to an attorney who gained rare access to the facility. Elora Mukherjee, the director of Columbia Law School\u2019s immigrant rights clinic, was one of six attorneys to visit the detention center in Clint as part of ongoing litigation about an agreement that states unaccompanied children can\u2019t be held in US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities for more than 72 hours. The team found that children had no adequate access to medical care, had no basic sanitation, were exposed to extreme cold and did not have adequate access to drinking water or food. \u201cI\u2019ve been visiting children detained in federal immigration custody for 12 years,\u201d Mukherjee told the Guardian. \u201cI have never seen anything like this before. I have never seen, smelled, had to bear witness to such degrading and inhumane conditions.\u201d Read further: The president adds new reaction to the Kim Darroch telegrams. He blames Theresa May for creating a \u201cmess\u201d with Brexit, says Darroch \u201cis not liked\u2019 and \u201cwe will no longer deal with him\u201d, and then predicts a new incoming PM and says the queen impressed him most. Before a different judge in the Epstein case, Rossmiller, the assistant US attorney, is asked whether he anticipates \u201cother defendants\u201d (via Courthouse News): Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign raised $19.1m in the second quarter of this year, more than triple her total of the previous quarter. The number outran Bernie Sanders and was behind only the Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg campaigns \u2013 and she did it without holding fundraisers. Warren\u2019s campaign reported 384,000 donors, a $28 average donation and $19.7m cash on hand, the Washington Post said. Earlier today Jul\u00edan Castro, the former housing secretary, announced he had more than 130,000 individual donors, clearing a key threshold to qualify for future presidential debates. Read our recent coverage of the Warren campaign: \u201cOur country\u2019s in real trouble,\u201d Warren said, pacing as she spoke. \u201cA lot of trouble. \u201cSo what\u2019s it going to take to change that?\u201d she continued. \u201cBig, structural change.\u201d Alexandra Barker, the host of the event, couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cIf things don\u2019t change, this is the home I\u2019ll sell to send him to college,\u201d she said, hugging her 11-year-old son, Ricky. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone who can actually get it done, I believe it\u2019s going to be her.\u201d More than six months into her presidential campaign \u2013 after holding 105 town halls, answering nearly 500 questions from voters and taking more than 35,000 selfies \u2013 the Massachusetts senator has emerged as a top-tier contender, and increasingly as the top choice of the American left, in the crowded race for the Democratic nomination. The hearing has adjourned to resume on Thursday, Courthouse News reports. Update: in a second hearing before a different judge, the bail hearing was moved to Monday. Epstein\u2019s lawyer, Reid Weingarten, is speaking in court, Courthouse News reports: The report continues: Rossmiller slams one of Weingarten\u2019s statements: \u201cSurely the concept of child prostitution is offensive\u201d and outside federal law. Rossmiller on Weingarten calling the conduct \u201cancient\u201d: The prosecutor notes that it is not beyond the statute of limitations. Weingarten then rose to assert that Epstein claimed \u201cThere\u2019s no statutory rape\u201d supplying graphic detail that might be triggering for some readers. Link to report here. Assistant US attorney Alex Rossmiller is arguing in court that Epstein must be detained prior to trial, saying \u201che\u2019s a man of nearly infinite means\u201d, Courthouse News reports: via Victoria Bekiempis in court: When asked to enter a plea, Epstein told the judge \u201cnot guilty, your honor,\u201d while maintaining an air of resigned stoicism. \u201cA fatigued-looking Jeffrey Epstein was just brought into the courtroom,\u201d reports Victoria Bekiempis from federal court in Manhattan. \u201cHe sported navy blue jail scrubs and his silver hair was messy.\u201d And then there were... something like 26? It looks like California Representative Eric Swalwell, who made combatting gun violence the central issue of his brief presidential campaign, will drop out of the race, the Los Angeles Times reports: But elsewhere today there have been reports that Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge funder turned progressive philanthropist and environmentalist, has told people he\u2019s going to get into the race after all. Will it happen? For now let\u2019s call it a wash. In court documents, prosecutors describe \u201ca vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls\u201d seized at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan mansion. The document states in part: \u201cThe defendant, a registered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant; rather, he is a continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting deeply serious charges\u201d. Another friend of Epstein: prominent Trump defender Allen Dershowitz: Dershowitz is the author of The Case Against Impeaching Trump. Asked to comment Saturday on Epstein\u2019s arrest, Dershowitz told the Daily Beast, \u201cI\u2019ll wait to see what the evidence is.\u201d Dershowitz also called the Miami Herald\u2019s reporting on Epstein \u201cFake News\u201d and mounted a public campaign against Pulitzer buzz for the reporting: Also from the Epstein news conference, William F Sweeney of the FBI criticized adults who \u201chave turned a blind eye to this type of criminal behavior,\u201d reports legal analyst and professor Jennifer Taub: Berman, the US Attorney in the southern district of New York (a Trump appointee, no less), praised the \u201cexcellent investigative journalism\u201d that helped his team build their case against Epstein. Dig into Julie K Brown\u2019s reporting here. When a reporter asked how Epstein could be prosecuted here given his non-prosecution agreement in the Southern District of Florida, Berman explained that the Florida non-prosecution agreement was only binding there, Victoria Bekiempis reports. Asked why the public corruption unit was investigating Epstein \u2013 potentially indicating the involvement of a government official at some level \u2013 Berman answered, \u201cI\u2019m not getting into staffing decisions at the US Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d \u201cI have confidence that the public corruption unit is able to handle...as it has so many other matters.\u201d \u201cI will again urge you not to read into the unit assignment anything one way or the other.\u201d \u201cNude photographs of what appeared to be underage girls\u201d were seized at Epstein\u2019s residence, prosecutors say. Then they make the case for Epstein\u2019s detention: \u201cWe think he\u2019s a significant flight risk and that is why we are seeking detention pending trial. \u201cHe has enormous wealth.. and [the charges] carry with them a maximum sentence of 45 years in jail, which given Epstein\u2019s age is an effective life sentence.\u201d They note Epstein has two airplanes and lives much of the year abroad. It all adds up to a flight risk, they say. Prosecutors in Manhattan note that other high-profile individuals have been associates with Epstein in the past and there has been speculation about their potential involvement in the case. Prosecutors say they won\u2019t be commenting on any such speculation and that unwillingness to comment should not be taken one way or another. Maurene Comey, former FBI director James Comey\u2019s daughter, is among the prosecutors pursuing the case against Epstein, Victoria Bekiempis reports. She is present at the Manhattan US Attorney\u2019s press conference on Epstein\u2019s indictment. Berman said prosecutors will ask for Epstein to be detained pending his case. \u201cThe alleged behavior shocks the conscience and while the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, it is still profoundly important to the many alleged victims, now young women,\u201d Berman said at a press conference. \u201cThey deserve their day in court, and we are proud to be standing up for them by bringing this indictment.\u201d Manhattan US attorney Geoffrey Berman is addressing reporters. He says Epstein was arrested at Teterboro airport in New Jersey at 5:30pm Saturday. He says Epstein is suspected of exploiting and abusing \u201cdozens of victims\u201d \u201cas young as 14 years old at time of recruitment.\u201d He describes the victims as \u201cchildren who were asked to engage in direct or indirect sex acts in exchange for money\u201d while Epstein was two or three times their age. He says people, unnamed, failed to confront Epstein\u2019s criminal behavior. They \u201cturned a blind eye,\u201d Berman said. To the victims, Berman asks them \u201cto take a good look at this man.\u201d \u201cIf you have been victimized in any way, or if you are somebody who has additional information... we want to hear from you,\u201d Berman says. He walks potential victims through the phone tree they will navigate if they call the 1-800 number. \u201cThe Jeffrey Epstein case is number one on that list of major cases in the country.\u201d \u201cThere never was, nor will there be, an excuse for this kind of behavior.\u201d Victoria Bekiempis (vicbekiempis) is outside federal court in Manhattan awaiting a news conference expected to follow an appearance in court by accused child molester Jeffrey Epstein. The FBI has made a callout for potential victims. Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman issued a statement on Epstein\u2019s indictment on two charges of sex trafficking: \u201cEpstein exploited girls who were vulnerable to abuse, enticed them with cash payments, and escalated his conduct to include sex acts, often occurring at his residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,\u201d Berman said. \u201cWhile the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, the victims \u2013 then children and now young women \u2013 are no less entitled to their day in court. \u201cMy Office is proud to stand up for these victims by bringing this indictment.\u201d This is not far from the White House: Only three weeks to wait before the next Democratic presidential debate. This one will be hosted by CNN, which has announced, in a reality show twist worthy of the age of Trump, that the candidate lineup will be decided by live draw. Once again, the debate will be held over two nights, July 30-31, with half the field onstage each night. In the first debate pundits were split on whether Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s accidental exile in the land of also-rans \u2013 she was on a separate stage from Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg \u2013 helped her or hurt her. The second debate will be moderated by CNN journalists Dana Bash, Don Lemon and Jake Tapper. Democrats in the early presidential contest states of Iowa and Nevada will be able to cast their votes over the telephone instead of showing up at their states\u2019 traditional neighborhood caucus meetings next February, according to plans unveiled by the state parties, the AP reports. Only a handful of states are using caucuses to settle on a Democratic presidential candidate this year. Allowing voters to access caucuses by phone could change the dynamics of the process, which in the past has favored candidates with particularly enthused (not to mention able-bodied) followings because voters must show up in person and remain on-site, sometimes for hours, as the candidate is selected. AP: The tele-caucus systems, the result of a mandate from the Democratic National Committee, are aimed at opening the local-level political gatherings to more people, especially evening shift-workers and people with disabilities, whom critics of the caucuses have long said are blocked from the process. The changes are expected to boost voter participation across the board, presenting a new opportunity for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 candidates to drive up support in the crucial early voting states. \u201cThis is a no-excuse option\u201d for participation, said Shelby Wiltz, the Nevada Democrats\u2019 caucus director.

A federal grand jury in New York is investigating top Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy, examining whether he used his position as vice chair of President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee to drum up business deals with foreign leaders, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and people familiar with the matter. Last year it was revealed that Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer at the time, arranged for a $1.6m payment to a Playboy playmate in 2017 to keep secret her sexual relationship with Broidy. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, which took money from shell companies tied to foreign donors, was already under investigation in New York for allegedly harvesting money from donors and transferring it to friends and associates of the Trump family who had relatively small roles in the inauguration. The event took in and disbursed $107m. But the new investigation scrutinizes an alleged scheme by Broidy to capitalize on his post in another way, AP reports: A wide-ranging subpoena the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Brooklyn recently sent to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee seeks records relating to 20 individuals and businesses. All have connections to Broidy, his investment and defense contracting firms, and foreign officials he pursued deals with \u2014 including the current president of Angola and two politicians in Romania. Prosecutors appear to be investigating whether Broidy exploited his access to Trump for personal gain and violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal for U.S. citizens to offer foreign officials \u201canything of value\u201d to gain a business advantage. Things of value in this case could have been an invitation to the January 2017 inaugural events or access to Trump. A statement released to the AP by Broidy\u2019s attorneys said that at no point did Broidy or his global security firm Circinus have a contract or exchange of money with \u201cany Romanian government agency, proxy or agent.\u201d It also said that while Circinus did reach an agreement with Angola in 2016 there was no connection whatsoever to the inauguration or Broidy\u2019s role on the inaugural committee. \u201cAny implication to the contrary is completely false,\u201d the statement said.

Court documents unsealed Monday show that Jeffrey Epstein is charged with creating and maintaining a network that allowed him to sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls, the Associated Press reports [update: read the indictment here]: The alleged victims were as young as 14 at the time. Epstein was taken into custody on Saturday. Authorities say he paid underage girls for massages and then molested them at his homes in Florida and New York in the early 2000s. Read earlier. Epstein was expected to appear in Manhattan federal court later Monday. Melania Trump is headed to West Virginia for meetings about the opioid epidemic: In other first lady news, in case you missed it over the holiday weekend: A new indictment against Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier and erstwhile friend of luminaries including Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Prince Andrew and others, has just been unsealed in New York, Victoria Bekiempis (@vicbekiempis) reports for the Guardian. Epstein faces two counts: sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking, for alleged encounters between 2002 and 2005. Epstein is being prosecuted in the southern district of New York. He avoided a prison sentence on similar charges in the early 2000s in a lenient plea deal that required him to pay restitution to victims and register as a sex offender. That deal was overseen by former Miami US Attorney and current Trump labor secretary Alexander Acosta. The White House has not commented on Epstein\u2019s arrest. In 2002, Trump called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d and mentioned his love of girls on the \u201cyounger side.\u201d There\u2019s buzz \u2013 unclear how much substance to it \u2013 about whether, as part of this new prosecution, Epstein might end up spilling stories about one or another of his powerful former friends. Hello and welcome to our live politics coverage. Hours after the USA triumphed in the Women\u2019s World Cup on Sunday, Donald Trump told reporters that the White House had not thought to invite the team for a visit, but would \u201clook at it\u201d. A couple weeks ago, however, the president invited the team to the White House in a tweet. On Sunday, Trump said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t really thought about it. We\u2019ll look at that,\u201d Voice of America reports. In June, Trump slammed team co-captain Megan Rapinoe, who had vowed never to visit Trump at home, and said: \u201cI am now inviting the TEAM, win or lose.\u201d Rapinoe, 34, repeated her vow not to visit the White House on Saturday. Asked about it by Agence France-Presse, she said: \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to everyone about it, obviously not myself, not Ali Krieger, and I suspect not many, if any, of the other players [would attend the visit].\u201d Trump has hosted many men\u2019s championship teams at the White House including minor division college football champions the North Dakota Bisons, whom Trump served fast food. Now the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has invited the team to the US Capitol: There\u2019s a lot of politics news out there this morning. Thank you for joining us ... perhaps from your office? To be fair, many of these elected officials will be busy running for president.",
