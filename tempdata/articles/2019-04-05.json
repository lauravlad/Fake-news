      "body": "<p>Larry Elliott (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/04/customs-union-soft-brexit-trade-goods\" title=\"\">The value of a customs union is overrated</a>, 4 April) fails to explain why Britain appears to underperform in trade within the EU. To argue that the customs union is somehow biased in favour of countries such as Germany and France at the expense of British companies is without merit.</p> <p>Many so-called \u201cBritish companies\u201d are British only in the sense that they are incorporated in Britain. They otherwise do not reflect any sense of British \u201cownership\u201d. This situation is very different in Germany and France. VW the German auto manufacturer is an example. The German government holds a golden share in VW that prevents it from being bought by non-German parties. In France, Renault benefits from state participation in ownership. Little wonder that they perform better in terms of inter-EU trade and further afield. They are strong, well-established, leading-edge businesses. They have subsidiary networks throughout the EU and elsewhere.</p> <p>The British auto industry is very different. When the national industry collapsed in the 1980s \u2013 a consequence of long-standing neglect \u2013 auto manufacturers such as Nissan, Honda and Toyota migrated to Britain. They did so because it promised tariff-free access into EU markets. Their ownership, however, lies outside Britain.</p> <p>Strategic decisions are not taken in Britain. Britain is but a small bit in a much bigger picture for them. For these reasons the British auto industry will be less strong both within the EU and internationally. To blame this on the customs union is a cop-out. It is wishful thinking to imagine that Britain will secure a more favourable customs union deal with the EU or negotiate more favourable trade deals outside the EU. If we want to export more goods, the UK needs, as Larry Elliott makes clear, to be better at manufacturing things customers want to buy and stop blaming the EU for our own shortcomings.<br><strong>Richard Tudway</strong><br><em>Principal at the Centre for International Economics</em></p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott questions the value of a customs union. This issue addresses the principal weakness of British business. Before a nation can export goods, it first has to invest in saleable products. Since the demise of the empire, British business has preferred to buy US computer products, on which to run its financial services industries. Britain\u2019s financial services have been financed by the sale of Britain\u2019s land and property. The decline of Britain is the result of a lack of commitment to Britain\u2019s future. Britain is run by salesmen: engineering is for the lower orders. As with Brexit, British politicians expect foreigners to do the hard work.<br><strong>Martin London</strong><br><em>Henllan, Denbighshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott fails to mention the main reason why Labour and others are arguing for a customs union with the EU: the Irish border. Rules of origin checks are required at borders between different customs regimes, to ensure that the right tariffs have been paid on the right goods. This requires hard infrastructure at the Northern Irish border, which could reignite tensions that led to violence during the Troubles. While a customs union alone will not remove the need for all checks, it will be a necessary and significant part of an open border: indeed, this is why customs union membership is the main provision in the Northern Irish backstop.<br><strong>David Lawrence</strong><br><em>Senior political adviser, Trade Justice Movement</em></p> <p>\u2022 Michael Morpurgo wrote fine children\u2019s stories, but he misses the mark on Brexit (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/04/europe-family-brexit-children-eu\" title=\"\">Brexit is a bitter story to tell our children</a>, 5 April). Under the deal that remainers oppose, the German Gruffalo illustrator Axel Scheffler would be entitled to stay in Britain. Peace and democracy are not creations of the EU \u2013 do Canada, Norway and Switzerland not have them? \u2013 and far from the EU creating prosperity, it has destroyed it across Spain, Italy and Greece.</p> <p>Brexiteers do not \u201cblame Europe for most of our ills\u201d, we blame it for taking a net \u00a313bn a year from us (after the UK rebate) while we received only \u00a34.1bn back, forcing uncontrolled EU immigration on us under the rules of the single market, damaging agriculture through protectionism, and substituting Brussels horse trading and stitch-ups for the right to govern our own country. As for his proposal of \u201ccreating a reformed Europe\u201d, that really is a story for children.<br><strong>Christopher Clayton</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Thank you, Michael Morpurgo for articulating the views of so many other people. Nobody pretends the EU is perfect, but being part of it offers a far better prospect for our collective future. As the disastrous consequences of leaving the EU \u2013 including the likely breakup of the UK, and the obvious dangers for Ireland and Northern Ireland \u2013 become ever more clear, we all need reminding of the positive achievements of the EU. Let us now hear more about this from our politicians too. Many must now realise in their heart of hearts, whatever they say publicly, that no form of Brexit will match the advantages of remaining part of the EU. Congratulations to Michael Morpurgo for reminding us why.<br><strong>Brian Willan</strong><br><em>Uffculme, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 Those Tory MPs unhappy to see Mrs May talking to alleged Marxist Jeremy Corbyn should remember that trying to \u201ccook up a deal with a Marxist\u201d is nothing new and that Marx\u2019s influence remains everywhere (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/theresa-may-warned-brexit-pact-with-corbyn-could-tear-tories-apart\" title=\"\">Two ministers quit amid widespread Tory fury over May\u2019s talks with Labour</a>, 4 April).</p> <p>Clement Attlee, a fervent hater of communism, saw it just like Marx \u2013 as a \u201cspectre haunting Europe\u201d. To maintain order in the postwar upheaval, keep the ghost at bay and capitalism on its feet, Attlee instituted a great deal of Marx\u2019s social thinking \u2013 health provision, housing, workplace safety, welfare, pensions et al \u2013 much of it, however reluctantly, accepted as Tory policy. If Marx did make a mistake it was to forget that the capitalists could read.<br><strong>David Beake</strong><br><em>Budock Water, Cornwall </em></p> <p>\u2022 The flooded House of Commons chamber (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/04/house-of-commons-suspended-water-pours-through-ceiling\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 5 April) is not only a metaphor for the mess the country is in over Brexit, but a statement of the medieval state in which our legislature works. It is time it is turned into a museum, or even mausoleum, with a modern, fit-for-purpose chamber replacing it.

      "bodyText": "Larry Elliott (The value of a customs union is overrated, 4 April) fails to explain why Britain appears to underperform in trade within the EU. To argue that the customs union is somehow biased in favour of countries such as Germany and France at the expense of British companies is without merit. Many so-called \u201cBritish companies\u201d are British only in the sense that they are incorporated in Britain. They otherwise do not reflect any sense of British \u201cownership\u201d. This situation is very different in Germany and France. VW the German auto manufacturer is an example. The German government holds a golden share in VW that prevents it from being bought by non-German parties. In France, Renault benefits from state participation in ownership. Little wonder that they perform better in terms of inter-EU trade and further afield. They are strong, well-established, leading-edge businesses. They have subsidiary networks throughout the EU and elsewhere. The British auto industry is very different. When the national industry collapsed in the 1980s \u2013 a consequence of long-standing neglect \u2013 auto manufacturers such as Nissan, Honda and Toyota migrated to Britain. They did so because it promised tariff-free access into EU markets. Their ownership, however, lies outside Britain. Strategic decisions are not taken in Britain. Britain is but a small bit in a much bigger picture for them. For these reasons the British auto industry will be less strong both within the EU and internationally. To blame this on the customs union is a cop-out. It is wishful thinking to imagine that Britain will secure a more favourable customs union deal with the EU or negotiate more favourable trade deals outside the EU. If we want to export more goods, the UK needs, as Larry Elliott makes clear, to be better at manufacturing things customers want to buy and stop blaming the EU for our own shortcomings. Richard Tudway Principal at the Centre for International Economics \u2022 Larry Elliott questions the value of a customs union. This issue addresses the principal weakness of British business. Before a nation can export goods, it first has to invest in saleable products. Since the demise of the empire, British business has preferred to buy US computer products, on which to run its financial services industries. Britain\u2019s financial services have been financed by the sale of Britain\u2019s land and property. The decline of Britain is the result of a lack of commitment to Britain\u2019s future. Britain is run by salesmen: engineering is for the lower orders. As with Brexit, British politicians expect foreigners to do the hard work. Martin London Henllan, Denbighshire \u2022 Larry Elliott fails to mention the main reason why Labour and others are arguing for a customs union with the EU: the Irish border. Rules of origin checks are required at borders between different customs regimes, to ensure that the right tariffs have been paid on the right goods. This requires hard infrastructure at the Northern Irish border, which could reignite tensions that led to violence during the Troubles. While a customs union alone will not remove the need for all checks, it will be a necessary and significant part of an open border: indeed, this is why customs union membership is the main provision in the Northern Irish backstop. David Lawrence Senior political adviser, Trade Justice Movement \u2022 Michael Morpurgo wrote fine children\u2019s stories, but he misses the mark on Brexit (Brexit is a bitter story to tell our children, 5 April). Under the deal that remainers oppose, the German Gruffalo illustrator Axel Scheffler would be entitled to stay in Britain. Peace and democracy are not creations of the EU \u2013 do Canada, Norway and Switzerland not have them? \u2013 and far from the EU creating prosperity, it has destroyed it across Spain, Italy and Greece. Brexiteers do not \u201cblame Europe for most of our ills\u201d, we blame it for taking a net \u00a313bn a year from us (after the UK rebate) while we received only \u00a34.1bn back, forcing uncontrolled EU immigration on us under the rules of the single market, damaging agriculture through protectionism, and substituting Brussels horse trading and stitch-ups for the right to govern our own country. As for his proposal of \u201ccreating a reformed Europe\u201d, that really is a story for children. Christopher Clayton Chester \u2022 Thank you, Michael Morpurgo for articulating the views of so many other people. Nobody pretends the EU is perfect, but being part of it offers a far better prospect for our collective future. As the disastrous consequences of leaving the EU \u2013 including the likely breakup of the UK, and the obvious dangers for Ireland and Northern Ireland \u2013 become ever more clear, we all need reminding of the positive achievements of the EU. Let us now hear more about this from our politicians too. Many must now realise in their heart of hearts, whatever they say publicly, that no form of Brexit will match the advantages of remaining part of the EU. Congratulations to Michael Morpurgo for reminding us why. Brian Willan Uffculme, Devon \u2022 Those Tory MPs unhappy to see Mrs May talking to alleged Marxist Jeremy Corbyn should remember that trying to \u201ccook up a deal with a Marxist\u201d is nothing new and that Marx\u2019s influence remains everywhere (Two ministers quit amid widespread Tory fury over May\u2019s talks with Labour, 4 April). Clement Attlee, a fervent hater of communism, saw it just like Marx \u2013 as a \u201cspectre haunting Europe\u201d. To maintain order in the postwar upheaval, keep the ghost at bay and capitalism on its feet, Attlee instituted a great deal of Marx\u2019s social thinking \u2013 health provision, housing, workplace safety, welfare, pensions et al \u2013 much of it, however reluctantly, accepted as Tory policy. If Marx did make a mistake it was to forget that the capitalists could read. David Beake Budock Water, Cornwall \u2022 The flooded House of Commons chamber (Report, 5 April) is not only a metaphor for the mess the country is in over Brexit, but a statement of the medieval state in which our legislature works. It is time it is turned into a museum, or even mausoleum, with a modern, fit-for-purpose chamber replacing it. It should be based on an amphitheatre, with business conducted during a sensible working day. Out would go the ridiculous division lobbies with members voting at their desks electronically. An elected second chamber would include some appointed expert members to shadow government ministers and provide advice to members of the second chamber. Election by the single transferable vote would deliver a legislature fit for the 21st century. Haydn Thomas Sidmouth, Devon \u2022 Has Jonathan Jones missed the sexual dimension in Anish Kapoor\u2019s depiction of Brexit Britain, which he fails to discuss (On the edge of the abyss, G2, 3 April)? We are, of course, about to be royally screwed.

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>My life is now basically a series of cancellations. Last week I had to miss the launch of Elizabeth Day\u2019s life-affirming new book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/31/liar-ayelet-gundar-goshen-how-to-fail-elizabeth-day-the-long-forgotten-david-whitehouse-review\">How to Fail</a>, which is unmissable for anyone who is haunted by the idea they invariably get life wrong. Today I had to miss the party for Damian Barr\u2019s compelling, compassionate new novel, You Will Be Safe, a multi-layered book that brings together the Boer war and present-day South Africa. Next week, I will be missing Spurs\u2019 quarter-final Champions League game against Manchester City. Though that could well turn out to be a blessing. Call it the Brexit effect. Twice, the Commons held late votes during which it could find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/01/brexit-deadlock-continues-as-mps-fail-to-find-compromise\">nothing on which to agree</a>. On Wednesday, I will be in Brussels as the prime minister tries to convince the EU to give her another homework extension. Brexit has long since messed with my psyche. I wake up every morning with a tension headache and by the time that has passed I\u2019m on to the full-blown anxiety that comes with the realisation that absolutely no one in parliament has a clue how any of this is going to pan out and somehow I\u2019ve got to try to be funny about it. Nor is sleep much relief as my dreams are mostly nightmares. Now I also feel like I have been reduced to a series of bodily functions that does the occasional bit of typing. The UK may be struggling to leave the EU but Brexit has been entirely successful in separating me from myself.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>Another day of chaos. Just as I thought I was in with a chance of getting home in daylight and possibly going to the gym, we get told that the prime minister will be giving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/02/may-to-ask-for-short-brexit-extension-and-reaches-out-to-labour\">a TV statement</a> from Downing Street. So everyone in Westminster stopped whatever they had been doing and concentrated on Theresa May offering the Labour leader a spot of work experience as prime minister in exchange for him sharing the blame for screwing up Brexit. Still, the bad news for lobby journalists was good news for some. Not least Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave campaign director. Thanks to May\u2019s intervention, no one bothered to report that the Commons had spent an hour and a half debating why Cummings was such a childish pain in the arse. Despite being summoned on several occasions to appear before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee \u2013 an invitation that even a rogue\u2019s gallery of Rupert Murdoch, Philip Green and Mike Ashley couldn\u2019t get out of \u2013 Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/commons-report-rules-dominic-cummings-in-contempt-of-parliament\">told them to sod off</a> on each occasion. He would only come if there was a new select committee set up just for him. Needless to say this didn\u2019t go down too well with most MPs, though Cummings did still have his supporters among some Brexiter MPs. Michael Fabricant suggested that despite being the former special adviser to Michael Gove and one of the best-connected men in Westminster, Cummings was just an out-of-his depth ingenue. A poor boy from a poor family. George Eustice tried comparing him to the mother of a murdered child whose phone had been hacked. Seriously. Amazing to think these two MPs were the best their constituencies had to offer.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Sometimes even a sucker catches an even break. The upside of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/jeremy-corbyn-under-pressure-to-back-public-vote-on-brexit-deal\">Theresa and Jeremy</a> exchanging awkward glances across the Downing Street table meant I could after all get to see Spurs\u2019 first game at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/apr/03/tottenham-new-stadium-spurs-numbers-game-crystal-palace\">their new stadium</a> after nearly two soulless years at Wembley. That had been another date I had expected to be cancelled. Walking up Tottenham High Road it felt like a coming home with all the same shops and cafes still there and the first sight of the stadium was breathtaking. An enormous Death Star that dominated the entire neighbourhood. The inside of the ground was every bit as impressive as I had been led to believe. Not the facilities \u2013 I wasn\u2019t too bothered about them as I don\u2019t go to football for the on-tap Diet Coke \u2013 but for the giant wall of the South Stand and the proximity to the pitch. It felt almost as intimate as the old White Hart Lane. Almost. Because even as I was enjoying the new stadium part of me was overwhelmed with nostalgia for the old one. Yes, it was too small and a bit knackered and Spurs have now laid a claim to the big league, but I rather liked things the way they were. The old ground contained years of memories that went well beyond football that I didn\u2019t want to let go, and I don\u2019t feel ready to commit to a new relationship with the Death Star. Give it time, I guess. The best part was meeting up with old friends \u2013 a group of us had all made sure we got season tickets next to each other \u2013 and having a good moan about Spurs being so Spursy. Which they were. After a nervy first half in which the players looked a bit clueless, it was entirely appropriate that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/03/tottenham-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">first goal in the new ground</a> came via a large deflection. Start as you mean to go on.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>After passing through the Commons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/mps-pass-motion-to-debate-article-50-extension-by-one-vote\">by one vote</a> the day before, Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill to force the government to request an extension to prevent a no-deal Brexit \u2013 the Labour MP is this week\u2019s prime minister \u2013 began its passage through the Lords. It was not an edifying spectacle, as a hardcore of about a dozen elderly Tory Brexiter peers \u2013 many of whom are still fighting the same battle with Europe they were fighting while serving in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet during the 1980s \u2013 railed against the \u201ctyranny\u201d of elected democracy as they tried to kill the passage of the bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/04/labour-lords-deputy-lady-hayter-accuses-tories-filibuster-no-deal-brexit-bill\">in a series of lengthy filibusters</a>. Prize for the most hypocritical intervention of the day went to the climate-change denying, no-deal fanatic, hereditary peerMatt Ridley. As Sky News\u2019s Faisal Islam <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1113873068747841539\">observed</a>, it was a bit much for Ridley to complain about it being unprecedented for a bill to be passed in a day, when the Lords had to do just that during the financial crisis when Northern Rock \u2013 of which he was chair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/oct/20/5\">during its collapse</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/18/northernrock.banking3\">was nationalised</a> to protect investors. Later that evening I bumped into Peter Lilley, who had also spent the day trying to talk out the Cooper bill, in the Newsnight green room, where I was due to do the paper review. Lilley declared the day to have been a total success, claiming it had never been his intention to block the bill, only to ensure an extra day of debate on Monday to allow their lordships more time to deliberate. If only Lilley had just said that in the Lords earlier in the day, he could have saved everyone a lot of bother, as it had looked for all the world as if his prime objective had been to keep alive the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. It\u2019s not just the winners who get to rewrite history.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>It can be a bit of a downer when colleagues describe some people of roughly my age as boring, old has-beens. But then it\u2019s hard to disagree, as the people they are talking about invariably are boring, old has-beens, whose world view hasn\u2019t changed in 40 years. Despite this, the only recent brush with ageism that I can recall was the young woman on the tube insisting on giving up her seat for me, even though it must have been obvious I was doing my best to ignore her. Judging from a recent report in the journal <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/home\">Lancet Public Health</a>, which found that people who suffer from depression, coronary heart disease and arthritis are more likely to experience ageism, it appears I may have been lucky. As far as I know I don\u2019t have a heart condition \u2013 my friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnsutherland\">John Sutherland</a> recently steered me to a heart rate app that confirms my average heart rate of 60 beats per minute with a healthy rhythm \u2013 but I do tick the boxes for depression and arthritis. There again, I have done for years. My mental health has always been decidedly iffy and I first developed arthritis soon after my first knee operation in my early 20s. Though perhaps this could explain why I have escaped too much ageism.

      "bodyText": "Monday My life is now basically a series of cancellations. Last week I had to miss the launch of Elizabeth Day\u2019s life-affirming new book, How to Fail, which is unmissable for anyone who is haunted by the idea they invariably get life wrong. Today I had to miss the party for Damian Barr\u2019s compelling, compassionate new novel, You Will Be Safe, a multi-layered book that brings together the Boer war and present-day South Africa. Next week, I will be missing Spurs\u2019 quarter-final Champions League game against Manchester City. Though that could well turn out to be a blessing. Call it the Brexit effect. Twice, the Commons held late votes during which it could find nothing on which to agree. On Wednesday, I will be in Brussels as the prime minister tries to convince the EU to give her another homework extension. Brexit has long since messed with my psyche. I wake up every morning with a tension headache and by the time that has passed I\u2019m on to the full-blown anxiety that comes with the realisation that absolutely no one in parliament has a clue how any of this is going to pan out and somehow I\u2019ve got to try to be funny about it. Nor is sleep much relief as my dreams are mostly nightmares. Now I also feel like I have been reduced to a series of bodily functions that does the occasional bit of typing. The UK may be struggling to leave the EU but Brexit has been entirely successful in separating me from myself. Tuesday Another day of chaos. Just as I thought I was in with a chance of getting home in daylight and possibly going to the gym, we get told that the prime minister will be giving a TV statement from Downing Street. So everyone in Westminster stopped whatever they had been doing and concentrated on Theresa May offering the Labour leader a spot of work experience as prime minister in exchange for him sharing the blame for screwing up Brexit. Still, the bad news for lobby journalists was good news for some. Not least Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave campaign director. Thanks to May\u2019s intervention, no one bothered to report that the Commons had spent an hour and a half debating why Cummings was such a childish pain in the arse. Despite being summoned on several occasions to appear before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee \u2013 an invitation that even a rogue\u2019s gallery of Rupert Murdoch, Philip Green and Mike Ashley couldn\u2019t get out of \u2013 Cummings told them to sod off on each occasion. He would only come if there was a new select committee set up just for him. Needless to say this didn\u2019t go down too well with most MPs, though Cummings did still have his supporters among some Brexiter MPs. Michael Fabricant suggested that despite being the former special adviser to Michael Gove and one of the best-connected men in Westminster, Cummings was just an out-of-his depth ingenue. A poor boy from a poor family. George Eustice tried comparing him to the mother of a murdered child whose phone had been hacked. Seriously. Amazing to think these two MPs were the best their constituencies had to offer. Wednesday Sometimes even a sucker catches an even break. The upside of Theresa and Jeremy exchanging awkward glances across the Downing Street table meant I could after all get to see Spurs\u2019 first game at their new stadium after nearly two soulless years at Wembley. That had been another date I had expected to be cancelled. Walking up Tottenham High Road it felt like a coming home with all the same shops and cafes still there and the first sight of the stadium was breathtaking. An enormous Death Star that dominated the entire neighbourhood. The inside of the ground was every bit as impressive as I had been led to believe. Not the facilities \u2013 I wasn\u2019t too bothered about them as I don\u2019t go to football for the on-tap Diet Coke \u2013 but for the giant wall of the South Stand and the proximity to the pitch. It felt almost as intimate as the old White Hart Lane. Almost. Because even as I was enjoying the new stadium part of me was overwhelmed with nostalgia for the old one. Yes, it was too small and a bit knackered and Spurs have now laid a claim to the big league, but I rather liked things the way they were. The old ground contained years of memories that went well beyond football that I didn\u2019t want to let go, and I don\u2019t feel ready to commit to a new relationship with the Death Star. Give it time, I guess. The best part was meeting up with old friends \u2013 a group of us had all made sure we got season tickets next to each other \u2013 and having a good moan about Spurs being so Spursy. Which they were. After a nervy first half in which the players looked a bit clueless, it was entirely appropriate that the first goal in the new ground came via a large deflection.
