Moylan, who worked with Johnson early in his political career, has criticised the promise of \u201cno infrastructure\u201d at the Irish border after Brexit and argued Dublin should accept \u201ca minimally visible trade border\u201d.</p> \n<p>Hammond is one of many senior Tories on the other wing of the party who will fight hard against a no-deal outcome, with the chancellor even suggesting he could vote down his own government to stop it.</p> \n<p>Thursday\u2019s crunch Commons vote is set to expose those divisions in the House of Commons, which are likely to plague an incoming Johnson administration. On Wednesday, peers passed beefed-up protections against a new prime minister attempting to prorogue parliament to force an exit from the EU on 31 October.</p> \n<p>The amendment, which was backed by 13 rebel Tory peers, builds on <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/live/2019/jul/09/theresa-may-stands-by-uk-ambassador-in-wake-of-trump-criticism-politics-live?page=with:block-5d24df2a8f08cf92bb76c9b7#block-5d24df2a8f08cf92bb76c9b7\">an amendment to the bill passed in the Commons last week</a>, to mandate fortnightly reports from the government on progress being made towards restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland.</p> \n<p>The new Lords amendment would ensure these have to be debated in the weeks before the Brexit deadline, theoretically making it illegal for the government to prorogue parliament in the autumn if the power-sharing executive has not been restored.</p> \n<p>Though it passed the House of Lords by a hefty majority of 103, the previous amendment by Dominic Grieve passed by just one vote \u2013 after a government whip forgot to vote.</p> \n<p>In her speech, May refused to criticise Johnson\u2019s approach directly, but suggest that refusal to shift from a rigid ideology was the cause of the UK\u2019s current predicament.</p> \n<p>Asked whether she would rule out that she was talking about Johnson or the US president Donald Trump, she called the remarks \u201ca general observation I have seen in politics across the world \u2026 I wanted to speak about it today as I think it is important to bring debate back into a more reasoned area so that people holding different views can have serious debate and discussion with each other.\u201d</p> \n<p>May said when she had brought her deal to parliament, MPs were already entrenched in their pre-referendum positions and railed against the coarsening of language in politics, highlighting that \u201cill words that go unchallenged are the first step on a continuum to ill deeds, towards a much darker place where hatred and prejudice drive not only what people say, but also what they do.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cSome are losing the ability to disagree without demeaning the views of others,\u201d she said, highlighting the abuse of female MPs in particular. \u201cThis descent of our debate into rancour and tribal bitterness, and in some cases even vile abuse at a criminal level, is corrosive to the democratic values which we should all be seeking to uphold.\u201d</p> \n<p>The departing prime minister also said she regretted making mistakes in her own language, particularly having referred to EU migrants as \u201cqueue-jumpers\u201d, when confronted over accusations that she had contributed to demonising language.</p> \n<p>Following her criticism of Trump for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/14/trump-squad-tlaib-omar-pressley-ocasio-cortez\">using racist language towards US congresswomen</a>, May took aim at populism across the globe.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis absolutism is not confined to British politics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt festers in politics all across the world. We see it in the rise of political parties on the far left and far right in Europe and beyond.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd we see it in the increasingly adversarial nature of international relations, which some view as a zero-sum game where one country can only gain if others lose. And where power, unconstrained by rules, is the only currency of value.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis absolutism at home and abroad is the opposite of politics at its best. It refuses to accept that other points of view are reasonable. It ascribes bad motives to those taking those different views.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour MP David Lammy described May\u2019s speech as \u201chollow words\u201d, referencing the controversial Home Office advertising campaign of 2013 that encouraged illegal immigrants to \u201cgo home or face arrest\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHollow words from a PM who spent her years in office promoting Nigel Farage\u2019s agenda with populist rhetoric, insulting EU citizens as \u2018queue-jumpers\u2019, and saying internationalists are \u2018citizens of nowhere\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never forget the \u2018Go home\u2019 vans you put on our streets.\u201d</p>",

The chancellor expressed his horror after Rees-Mogg used a Daily Telegraph opinion piece to dismiss the \u201cpure silliness\u201d of Treasury forecasts suggesting a \u00a390bn hit to the economy. Rees-Mogg claimed there were economic models that showed \u201cthe total positive impact of no deal could be in the region of about \u00a380bn\u201d.

The Telegraph reported on Wednesday that Johnson has appointed the hardline Eurosceptic Daniel Moylan as a senior Brexit policy adviser. Moylan, who worked with Johnson early in his political career, has criticised the promise of \u201cno infrastructure\u201d at the Irish border after Brexit and argued Dublin should accept \u201ca minimally visible trade border\u201d. Hammond is one of many senior Tories on the other wing of the party who will fight hard against a no-deal outcome, with the chancellor even suggesting he could vote down his own government to stop it. Thursday\u2019s crunch Commons vote is set to expose those divisions in the House of Commons, which are likely to plague an incoming Johnson administration. On Wednesday, peers passed beefed-up protections against a new prime minister attempting to prorogue parliament to force an exit from the EU on 31 October. The amendment, which was backed by 13 rebel Tory peers, builds on an amendment to the bill passed in the Commons last week, to mandate fortnightly reports from the government on progress being made towards restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. The new Lords amendment would ensure these have to be debated in the weeks before the Brexit deadline, theoretically making it illegal for the government to prorogue parliament in the autumn if the power-sharing executive has not been restored. Though it passed the House of Lords by a hefty majority of 103, the previous amendment by Dominic Grieve passed by just one vote \u2013 after a government whip forgot to vote. In her speech, May refused to criticise Johnson\u2019s approach directly, but suggest that refusal to shift from a rigid ideology was the cause of the UK\u2019s current predicament. Asked whether she would rule out that she was talking about Johnson or the US president Donald Trump, she called the remarks \u201ca general observation I have seen in politics across the world \u2026 I wanted to speak about it today as I think it is important to bring debate back into a more reasoned area so that people holding different views can have serious debate and discussion with each other.\u201d May said when she had brought her deal to parliament, MPs were already entrenched in their pre-referendum positions and railed against the coarsening of language in politics, highlighting that \u201cill words that go unchallenged are the first step on a continuum to ill deeds, towards a much darker place where hatred and prejudice drive not only what people say, but also what they do.\u201d \u201cSome are losing the ability to disagree without demeaning the views of others,\u201d she said, highlighting the abuse of female MPs in particular. \u201cThis descent of our debate into rancour and tribal bitterness, and in some cases even vile abuse at a criminal level, is corrosive to the democratic values which we should all be seeking to uphold.\u201d The departing prime minister also said she regretted making mistakes in her own language, particularly having referred to EU migrants as \u201cqueue-jumpers\u201d, when confronted over accusations that she had contributed to demonising language. Following her criticism of Trump for using racist language towards US congresswomen, May took aim at populism across the globe. \u201cThis absolutism is not confined to British politics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt festers in politics all across the world. We see it in the rise of political parties on the far left and far right in Europe and beyond. \u201cAnd we see it in the increasingly adversarial nature of international relations, which some view as a zero-sum game where one country can only gain if others lose. And where power, unconstrained by rules, is the only currency of value. \u201cThis absolutism at home and abroad is the opposite of politics at its best. It refuses to accept that other points of view are reasonable. It ascribes bad motives to those taking those different views.\u201d Labour MP David Lammy described May\u2019s speech as \u201chollow words\u201d, referencing the controversial Home Office advertising campaign of 2013 that encouraged illegal immigrants to \u201cgo home or face arrest\u201d. \u201cHollow words from a PM who spent her years in office promoting Nigel Farage\u2019s agenda with populist rhetoric, insulting EU citizens as \u2018queue-jumpers\u2019, and saying internationalists are \u2018citizens of nowhere\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never forget the \u2018Go home\u2019 vans you put on our streets.\u201d",

It did not \u201cland\u201d happily. He said the press could be like a \u201cferal beast\u201d and, unsurprisingly, when they wrote it up the following day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/12/tonyblair.labour\">the newspapers took a dim view. </a>In some ways it was a gutless speech - he singled out the Independent for criticism, but not the Daily Mail - but some of its analysis was sound, and it was vindicated by the Leveson inquiry.</p> \n  <p>Theresa May has also given a valedictory speech on a general topic, the state of politics. Her general point, that opinion in Britain and elsewhere is becoming increasingly polarised and that this is making compromise harder, was a sound one. In fact, it is one of the great truths of our time. And yet the speech as a whole was exceptionally poor, mainly for two reasons.</p> \n  <p>First, as many people have been pointing out on Twitter (roundup coming soon), May refused to accept any responsibility at all for this state of affairs. As a speech, it was striking for its lack of self-awareness. You can understand why a prime minister might not want to telegraph their flaws at the start of their premiership, but with just seven days left in office to go, an element of contrition would have been welcome. It would be wrong to claim that May is wholly to blame for our Brexit deadlock (it is possible that no other PM could have found a compromise acceptable to parliament), but May herself played a part in entrenching divisions by pandering to the Brexiter right in her first few months in office,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/16/tory-leadership-latest-news-johnson-will-bring-down-government-if-he-goes-for-no-deal-brexit-says-top-tory-live-news?page=with:block-5d2de76e8f08d0b6ca531ba8#block-5d2de76e8f08d0b6ca531ba8\"> when she was laying down red lines that made subsequent compromise much harder. </a>This was the period when Nigel Farage found it hard to fault a word she said. When she was asked to address this in the Q&amp;A, she just reacted angrily. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/17/brexit-tory-leadership-pmqs-boris-johnson-theresa-may-mcdonnell-sets-out-labours-three-strategies-for-ending-in-work-poverty-live-news?page=with:block-5d2f325c8f08d0b6ca5326fa#block-5d2f325c8f08d0b6ca5326fa\">3.39pm.) </a></p> \n  <p>The second problem with the speech, partially related to the first, was that it was almost devoid of analysis. May painted a recognisable picture of a world where opinions are increasingly divided and extreme, but had nothing to say about how we\u2019ve got here. Is it social media? Loss of faith in neoliberalism, or capitalism generally, to deliver rising prosperity? A backlash against multiculturalism? A rise in nationalism? Russian meddling? I don\u2019t know. But May does not seem to know either, and she supposedly has access to the finest minds in government. The absence of an analytic framework in the speech also meant its prescriptions were rather meaningless. We should all be a bit nicer to each other and compromise, she said. But if she had worked out the cause of the problem, she would have been better placed to argue for a solution.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-17T15:48:56.158Z\">at 4.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2f35968f0845f89e30ef3d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-17T14:52:20.645Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: How worried are you about what is happening in the US?

The invasion took place 16 years ago. But it still affects political thinking in Britain profoundly (it helps to explain Jeremy Corbyn becoming Labour leader, for example) and so it is surprising that an interview given by <strong>Tony Blair</strong> to Prospect magazine has not attracted more attention.</p> \n  <p>Blair does not go as far as to admit that the decision to join the US invasion of Iraq was wrong. But in the interview he does seems to go further than he has ever done before in suggesting that, if he had his time again, he would have taken a different decision.</p> \n  <p>Blair spoke to Prospect\u2019s <strong>Steve Bloomfield </strong>for <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/tony-blair-second-thoughts-war-iraq-liberal-interventionism\">a long article Bloomfield was writing about the case for liberal intervention.</a> Bloomfield raises the Chicago speech Blair gave in 1999, in which Blair set five tests he thought should apply before a country intervenes militarily in another. Bloomfield goes on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Few speeches by a British prime minister have been as influential, so the tests are worth recapping: \u201cFirst, are we sure of our case? [\u2026] Second, have we exhausted all diplomatic options? [\u2026] Third, on the basis of a practical assessment of the situation, are there military operations we can sensibly and prudently undertake? Fourth, are we prepared for the long term? [\u2026] And finally, do we have national interests involved?\u201d</p> \n   <p>Calling a question a test, however, doesn\u2019t make the answer to it any less subjective\u2014or contentious. While there was relatively little opposition to Britain\u2019s intervention in Kosovo in 1999 and in Sierra Leone a year later, the same could not be said for Iraq. Blair still won\u2019t admit that Iraq missed his tests, although many others certainly do. But in talking, he did admit for the first time that \u201cthere were elements that were missing\u201d from his original doctrine. He now wanted \u201cvery strongly\u201d to add two more tests, narrowing the circumstances in which going to war is wise.</p> \n   <p>The first\u2014and most controversial\u2014is to consider \u201cif you\u2019re going into a country, where there are going to be strong, Islamist influences at play\u2026 whose very purpose is to destabilise what you\u2019re trying to do\u2026 who are prepared to kill and die in pursuit of that.\u201d This, he said, is \u201cwhat we found in Iraq and Afghanistan, what the Russians and Iranians and others found in Syria, and what the [Saudi-led] coalition forces are finding in Yemen.\u201d His use of the very specific word \u201cIslamists,\u201d when \u201cinsurgents\u201d would make the same point more generally, is telling.</p> \n   <p>Blair\u2019s second new test is public opinion at home. \u201cI think it is difficult to do this if it\u2019s going to be a long-term project, and your own country is divided about it.\u201d Especially, he added, if there is a change in government \u201cand the people who come after you have no particular interest in seeing that long-term project through.\u201d These extra tests might seem almost custom-made to acknowledge the disaster of Iraq. All he wants to say about that conflict however is that it was \u201cnot a bad or ignoble mission.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>From this account Blair seems unwilling to publicly acknowledge the implications of his two new tests. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/06/03/remembering-iraq\">The Iraq invasion did have public support in 2003,</a> but that support was shallow and did not last long, and soon the invasion was unpopular. So on the public opinion test, given what Blair says about a \u201clong-term project\u201d, Iraq would fail. And obviously it would fail on the \u201cIslamist influences\u201d test. Blair seems to be implying the UK should not have participated, even if he does not want to so explicitly.</p> \n  <p>I\u2019ve phrased it like that because, as <strong>J</strong><strong>on Davis </strong>and<strong> John Rentoul</strong> argue in their excellent new book on the Blair government, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/heroes-or-villains-9780199608850?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Heroes or Villains? The Blair Government Reconsidered, </a>Blair is treated as if he were single-handedly responsible for what happened in Iraq, when in fact George W Bush was determined to invade anyway. Davis and Rentoul explain:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In fact, the US government had already decided to invade Iraq and the decision for the British government was whether United Kingdom forces would join them. If it had decided that they should not, the invasion would have gone ahead anyway ... Nothing the British government decided would have made much difference to what happened in Iraq, or to the bloodshed that followed the invasion, or to subsequent events, such as the rise of Islamic State across the Iraqi-Syria border ...</p> \n   <p>Indeed [if the UK had not participated in the invasion] British troops would probably have been sent to Iraq as part of the UN-endorsed occupation afterwards, and the situation would have been roughly the same as it is today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5738a33e167b7c5c0f2e36ce1ecb36a5695312de\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5738a33e167b7c5c0f2e36ce1ecb36a5695312de/0_64_3380_2028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jae C.

It wasn\u2019t a glorious triumph, and even on the Tory side there is precious little evidence of MPs willing to credit her with a legacy (if Roger Gale is the best you can get when looking for a character reference, see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/17/brexit-tory-leadership-pmqs-boris-johnson-theresa-may-mcdonnell-sets-out-labours-three-strategies-for-ending-in-work-poverty-live-news?page=with:block-5d2f05418f0845f89e30ec3b#block-5d2f05418f0845f89e30ec3b\">12.25pm, </a>you\u2019re not doing well), but in the key encounter with Jeremy Corbyn, May assailed him unremittingly. You can argue that PMQs is meant to be about the PM defending her record, not the leader of the opposition defending his, but that rather misses that point that PMQs it not so much a career performance evaluation as a contest for political authority, and that means attacks on the opposition can be fair. Given the unusual circumstances, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/16/tom-watson-backs-labour-motion-auto-exclude-racism\">Labour peers taking out a newspaper advert to rubbish their own leader, </a>May\u2019s decision to go on about it was reasonable. Corbyn did not allow himself to be wholly derailed, and on air quality more than climate change, he had May in real difficulty, because she did not seem to have any defence to the points he was putting. But he was on the defensive throughout. In response to May\u2019s jibes about antisemitism Corbyn could probably have made more of the point about 60% of Tory members thinking Islam is a threat to society (it wasn\u2019t enough to raise the point - he should have challenged May to say whether she agreed with them) and the whole racism row eclipsed the arguments he was seeking to make. To the public at large it may not have been very edifying - two politicians arguing who\u2019s the more racist - but May seemed to leave her MPs quite cheered by the exchanges, whereas Corbyn didn\u2019t, and so on that metric she came out top.</p> \n  <p>In recent PMQs Corbyn has said little about the probable next Tory leader, Boris Johnson. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford has been much more willing to focus on the opponent his party will be facing in the autumn, and we saw that again today when he referenced Boris Johnson\u2019s history of using racist language in newspaper columns. But it was only a short reference, and mostly what was strange about today was about how little was said about the Tory leadership contest, or the Brexit crisis that is likely to erupt soon afterwards. Earlier, after Philip Hammond labelled some of the Brexit thinking prevalent in the Johnson camp \u201cterrifying\u201d (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/17/brexit-tory-leadership-pmqs-boris-johnson-theresa-may-mcdonnell-sets-out-labours-three-strategies-for-ending-in-work-poverty-live-news?page=with:block-5d2ee8cd8f0845f89e30ead0#block-5d2ee8cd8f0845f89e30ead0\"> 10.29am)</a>, I said this was bound to come up at PMQs.

But we also are asking ourselves more fundamental questions.</p> \n   <p>We need a structurally different economy, a social safety net of shared public service provision, and of course a financial safety net as well.</p> \n   <p>Without any one of these three elements, we will not be able to achieve the sustained eradication of poverty, the dramatic narrowing of inequality, and the transformation of people\u2019s lives that will be the central purpose of the next Labour government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McDonnell will be speaking at the launch of the Resolution Foundation\u2019s annual living standards audit.

      "bodyText": "Peers have voted by a majority of 103 for an amendment intended to stop the next prime minister being able to prorogue parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has welcomed the vote, saying he hopes it does not get overturned by the government in the Commons tomorrow. Tomorrow\u2019s vote should be close because the government lost by just one vote when MPs last debated something similar, and then only because a whip failed to vote by mistake. (See 5.03pm.) Theresa May has criticised absolutism in politics in what appeared to be a coded swipe at populist politicians such as Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has said it is \u201cterrifying\u201d that one of Boris Johnson\u2019s close allies, Jacob Rees-Mogg, believes a no-deal Brexit will boost the economy. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have traded blows in the House of Commons over antisemitism and Islamophobia, each demanding an apology for racism in their respective parties. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Thirteen Tory peers rebelled against the government and voted for the Anderson amendment, according to the division list. The Anderson amendment (see 4.50pm) has passed by 272 votes to 169 - a majority of 103. This means the bill, as now amended, could make it illegal for the government to prorogue parliament in the autumn if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland has not been restored. The government will almost certainly try to reverse this when the bill returns to the Commons tomorrow. Dominic Grieve only got his amendment passed by a single vote in the Commons last week, after a government whip forgot to vote, and Grieve lost votes on other related amendments, and so there must be a good chance of this afternoon\u2019s vote being overturned. In the House of Lords peers are now voting on an amendment to the Northern Ireland (executive formation bill) that is designed to stop a future prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. The amendment has been tabled by the crossbench peer David Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terror legislation, with support from Labour and the Lib Dems. It builds on an amendment to the bill passed in the Commons last week when MPs backed a proposal from Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European, calling for fortnightly reports from the government on progress being made towards restoring the power-sharing executive. Anderson\u2019s amendment, amendment 3, would ensure these have to be debated. This is what it says: Page 2, line 20, leave out subsection (2) and insert\u2014 \u201c(2A) The secretary of state must make arrangements for\u2014 (a) a copy of each report published under subsection (1) to be laid before each house of parliament by the end of the day on which it is published, (b) a motion in neutral terms, to the effect that the House of Commons has considered the report, to be moved in the House of Commons by a minister of the crown, and (c) a motion for the House of Lords to take note of the report to be tabled in the House of Lords and moved by a minister of the crown. (2B) The motions required under subsections (2A)(b) and (c) must be moved in the relevant house by a minister of the crown within the period of five calendar days beginning with the end of the day on which the report is laid before parliament.\u201d This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about Theresa May\u2019s speech. In the Westminster village, it is getting panned. From my colleague John Crace From the Times\u2019 Quentin Letts From the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire From my colleague Paul Johnson From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From the Independent\u2019s Ashley Cowburn From my colleague Owen Jones From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand From my colleague Jessica Elgot From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov From Good Morning Britain\u2019s Piers Morgan From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes From ConservativeHome\u2019s Mark Wallace This is from my colleague Peter Walker. Shortly before Tony Blair stood down he gave a speech on the media. It did not \u201cland\u201d happily. He said the press could be like a \u201cferal beast\u201d and, unsurprisingly, when they wrote it up the following day, the newspapers took a dim view. In some ways it was a gutless speech - he singled out the Independent for criticism, but not the Daily Mail - but some of its analysis was sound, and it was vindicated by the Leveson inquiry. Theresa May has also given a valedictory speech on a general topic, the state of politics. Her general point, that opinion in Britain and elsewhere is becoming increasingly polarised and that this is making compromise harder, was a sound one. In fact, it is one of the great truths of our time. And yet the speech as a whole was exceptionally poor, mainly for two reasons. First, as many people have been pointing out on Twitter (roundup coming soon), May refused to accept any responsibility at all for this state of affairs. As a speech, it was striking for its lack of self-awareness. You can understand why a prime minister might not want to telegraph their flaws at the start of their premiership, but with just seven days left in office to go, an element of contrition would have been welcome. It would be wrong to claim that May is wholly to blame for our Brexit deadlock (it is possible that no other PM could have found a compromise acceptable to parliament), but May herself played a part in entrenching divisions by pandering to the Brexiter right in her first few months in office, when she was laying down red lines that made subsequent compromise much harder. This was the period when Nigel Farage found it hard to fault a word she said. When she was asked to address this in the Q&amp;A, she just reacted angrily. (See 3.39pm.) The second problem with the speech, partially related to the first, was that it was almost devoid of analysis. May painted a recognisable picture of a world where opinions are increasingly divided and extreme, but had nothing to say about how we\u2019ve got here. Is it social media? Loss of faith in neoliberalism, or capitalism generally, to deliver rising prosperity? A backlash against multiculturalism? A rise in nationalism? Russian meddling? I don\u2019t know. But May does not seem to know either, and she supposedly has access to the finest minds in government. The absence of an analytic framework in the speech also meant its prescriptions were rather meaningless. We should all be a bit nicer to each other and compromise, she said. But if she had worked out the cause of the problem, she would have been better placed to argue for a solution. Q: How worried are you about what is happening in the US? How should your successors handle this relationship? May says the special relationship will remain, regardless of who is in the White House. She says the US should accept the need for multilateral organisations. And that\u2019s it. The speech is over. I will post a verdict and reaction shortly. Q: What advice do you have for your successor in terms of dealing with China? May says the UK wants good economic ties with China. But the UK will continue to express its concerns over matters like the joint declaration for Hong Kong. Q: Have you left the country and your party in a better or worse state? And you do not seem to take any responsiblity for the effects your own words have had, like talking about EU nationals as queue jumpers? May says she did accept that she should not have used the phrase about EU nationals jumping the queue. She says it is a matter of deep regret that she has not been able to get Brexit over the line. She did everything she could, including putting her own job on the line. She says the Tory party has rising membership. (That is probably largely to do with people joining over the last few months because they knew a leadership election was coming.) Q: What is your message for investors thinking about the future? Come to the UK, says May. She says investment in the UK had held up despite the Brexit negotiations. She says that is a tribute to the underlying strength of the British economy. May is now taking questions from non-journalists. Q: You set up Women2Win to get female candidates selected for the Tories. But progress has been glacial. Will you come back and help? May says she will continue to champion this cause. She says you get better decisions with greater diversity. Q: Did you play any part in the extradition of Hashem Abedi to the UK over the Manchester bombing? May says this is an important moment for the investigation. Q: Who were you referring to when you spoke about absolutism? Did you mean President Trump or Boris Johnson? May says she was making a general point. Q: Boris Johnson says the backstop is dead. He wants to sort out the border issue after the UK has left. Is this sensible? May says it will be up to her successor to decide how they proceed. She says the Belfast/Good Friday agreement contains an essential compromise. People in Northern Ireland can have Irish citizenship, and cross the border easily. That is why she thought that was important. Q: Philip Hammond said today that he is terrified of how people close to Boris Johnson think a no-deal Brexit would not harm the economy. Are you terrified to? May repeats her point about wanting a Brexit deal. Q: Do you share any responsibility for this? You are spoke about citizens of nowhere and used glib language, like referring to a red, white and blue Brexit. Is the naughtiest thing you have ever done still running through a wheat field? May says the stupidest thing she has done is answering this question. She says not all the language she has used has been perfect. But there has been a coarsening of language, she says. She says people should not ascribe bad motives to people who disagree with them. Q: To what extent do you think the Tory leadership contest has illustrated your arguments about extremism? May says she was not talking about the leadership contest. She says her speech reflected ideas she has been considering for some time. Q: Could you accept a no-deal Brexit? May says she thinks it would be best for the UK to leave the EU with a deal. May stressed the need to reclaim the middle ground. If we can do this, we can live together peacefully, she says. May says Dwight Eisenhower planned D-day from the building she is in. She quotes him saying people talk about the middle of the road as being a bad place. But it is where you can make progress, he said. The extremes are in the gutter. May says being prepared to compromise means knowing when not to compromise, and when to stand firm, as the UK did after the Salisbury poisoning attack by Russia. From MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse May says the UK is the first country trying to put forward a comprehensive set of standards for internet companies. May says compromise is needed to address the Brexit impasse. She says some people think she should have gone for a no-deal in March. Some people wanted Brexit stopped. But most people wanted Brexit done with a deal, she says. She says the problem was that politics retreated into its binary, pre-referendum positions. May says the far left wants to scrap the free market. But it is free and competitive markets that drive innovation, she says. May says Vladimir Putin claims liberalism is redundant. That is a falsehood, she says. But if we are to stand up for our values, we must rebuild support for them, she says. She calls for a politics of \u201cpragmatic conviction\u201d. May says we are living through a period of profound change. Technology is expanding opportunities, she says. But people are also feeling anxious about their prospects in the future. May says international institutions, like the UN, were also built by compromise. Only a mission from the US to Stalin persuaded the Russians to drop their demand for an all-encompassing veto. The Russians back down. And that compromise meant the UN could operate. May says it is easy to assume these international agreements will endure. But they should not be taken for granted, she says. May says the NHS was a joint effort. It was the idea of a coaltion government. The white paper proposing it was announced by a Conservative minister. Then a Labour government introduced it. When Churchill\u2019s Conservative government returned to power, it built on what had been achieved. May says this is not just a domestic problem. International politics is increasingly adversarial too, she says. She says politics is seen as a zero-sum game. This is not what politics should be about, she says. She says it is important for there to be common ground. This does not have to mean abandoning principles, she says. May says getting things done, rather than getting them said, requires qualities that have become unfashionable. One is being willing to compromise, she says. She says persuasion, team work and a willingness to make concessions are features of politics at its best. But today people are unwilling to compromise. She says our whole political discourse seems to be heading down the wrong path. There is an element of absolutism in this, she says. People are losing the ability to disagree honourably. She says the debate has descended into \u201crancour and tribal differences\u201d. May says applicants at Tory selection meetings always used to be asked if they were conviction politicians, or pragmatists. She says she never accepted the distinction. She thought politics was about implementing one\u2019s convictions. May says this could be a crucial century. Democratic politics, free speech and the rule of law have provided the nexus for progress over the last century. On that basis, today there are grounds for \u201cserious concern\u201d. Theresa May is speaking now. She says she has lived politics for 50 years, starting as an activist stuffing envelopes. In every job she has done she has been inspired by the potential of politics. Looking at the world and this country, there is a lot to be optimistic about. Extreme poverty and child mortality have been halved. People are richer and healthier than before. There is more concern for the environment. There are more women in positions of power than every before. When she was born, homosexuality was illegal. And casual bigotry has common. That has changed, she says. Robin Niblett from Chatham House is introducing the prime minister. He says the PM will take questions afterwards. Theresa May is about to give a speech on \u201cthe state of politics domestically and internationally\u201d. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Unusually, Number 10 has not given any steer at all as to what she will say. But we have been told that the speech will be quite long. Which is not necessarily very surprising. If she is determined to cover everything wrong with politics at the moment, we could be here until Friday ... In journalistic terms the Iraq war almost counts as ancient history. The invasion took place 16 years ago. But it still affects political thinking in Britain profoundly (it helps to explain Jeremy Corbyn becoming Labour leader, for example) and so it is surprising that an interview given by Tony Blair to Prospect magazine has not attracted more attention. Blair does not go as far as to admit that the decision to join the US invasion of Iraq was wrong. But in the interview he does seems to go further than he has ever done before in suggesting that, if he had his time again, he would have taken a different decision. Blair spoke to Prospect\u2019s Steve Bloomfield for a long article Bloomfield was writing about the case for liberal intervention. Bloomfield raises the Chicago speech Blair gave in 1999, in which Blair set five tests he thought should apply before a country intervenes militarily in another. Bloomfield goes on: Few speeches by a British prime minister have been as influential, so the tests are worth recapping: \u201cFirst, are we sure of our case? [\u2026] Second, have we exhausted all diplomatic options? [\u2026] Third, on the basis of a practical assessment of the situation, are there military operations we can sensibly and prudently undertake? Fourth, are we prepared for the long term? [\u2026] And finally, do we have national interests involved?\u201d Calling a question a test, however, doesn\u2019t make the answer to it any less subjective\u2014or contentious. While there was relatively little opposition to Britain\u2019s intervention in Kosovo in 1999 and in Sierra Leone a year later, the same could not be said for Iraq. Blair still won\u2019t admit that Iraq missed his tests, although many others certainly do. But in talking, he did admit for the first time that \u201cthere were elements that were missing\u201d from his original doctrine. He now wanted \u201cvery strongly\u201d to add two more tests, narrowing the circumstances in which going to war is wise. The first\u2014and most controversial\u2014is to consider \u201cif you\u2019re going into a country, where there are going to be strong, Islamist influences at play\u2026 whose very purpose is to destabilise what you\u2019re trying to do\u2026 who are prepared to kill and die in pursuit of that.\u201d This, he said, is \u201cwhat we found in Iraq and Afghanistan, what the Russians and Iranians and others found in Syria, and what the [Saudi-led] coalition forces are finding in Yemen.\u201d His use of the very specific word \u201cIslamists,\u201d when \u201cinsurgents\u201d would make the same point more generally, is telling. Blair\u2019s second new test is public opinion at home. \u201cI think it is difficult to do this if it\u2019s going to be a long-term project, and your own country is divided about it.\u201d Especially, he added, if there is a change in government \u201cand the people who come after you have no particular interest in seeing that long-term project through.\u201d These extra tests might seem almost custom-made to acknowledge the disaster of Iraq. All he wants to say about that conflict however is that it was \u201cnot a bad or ignoble mission.\u201d From this account Blair seems unwilling to publicly acknowledge the implications of his two new tests. The Iraq invasion did have public support in 2003, but that support was shallow and did not last long, and soon the invasion was unpopular. So on the public opinion test, given what Blair says about a \u201clong-term project\u201d, Iraq would fail. And obviously it would fail on the \u201cIslamist influences\u201d test. Blair seems to be implying the UK should not have participated, even if he does not want to so explicitly. I\u2019ve phrased it like that because, as Jon Davis and John Rentoul argue in their excellent new book on the Blair government, Heroes or Villains? The Blair Government Reconsidered, Blair is treated as if he were single-handedly responsible for what happened in Iraq, when in fact George W Bush was determined to invade anyway. Davis and Rentoul explain: In fact, the US government had already decided to invade Iraq and the decision for the British government was whether United Kingdom forces would join them. If it had decided that they should not, the invasion would have gone ahead anyway ... Nothing the British government decided would have made much difference to what happened in Iraq, or to the bloodshed that followed the invasion, or to subsequent events, such as the rise of Islamic State across the Iraqi-Syria border ... Indeed [if the UK had not participated in the invasion] British troops would probably have been sent to Iraq as part of the UN-endorsed occupation afterwards, and the situation would have been roughly the same as it is today. This is what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told the Press Association this morning about the advert placed by Labour peers attacking Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s record on antisemitism. Adverts in the Guardian are quite expensive ... they could have used it on a Jewish charity tackling antisemitism, for example. But that\u2019s the way they want to communicate, they\u2019ve done it. I\u2019d have rather they just picked up the phone and came and met Jeremy. This is what Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said about the antisemitism row after PMQs. I think the polling shows it is completely rampant among members of the Conservative party, who are currently choosing Britain\u2019s next prime minister, on a scale far, far, far bigger than the incidents of antisemitism in the Labour party. And I think as a matter of anti-racist commitment it\u2019s essential that that is properly dealt with and at the moment there is no sign of that taking place. This is what the Press Association has filed about PMQs exchanges between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn trashed each other\u2019s record in dealing with allegations of racism within their parties during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. May switched focus on to Labour\u2019s approach to antisemitism after Corbyn began by asking about the government\u2019s record on climate change. Labour leader pushed back with criticism of the Conservative party\u2019s response to Islamophobia and the views of some of its members. On climate change, he also claimed that at the current rate the government will not meet its 2050 net zero emissions target \u201cuntil 2099\u201d - warning at this point it will be \u201ctoo late for our planet and our children\u201d. Speaking in the Commons, Corbyn started by asking why the government had been accused of \u201ccoasting\u201d over climate change, to which the prime minister replied: \u201cThe government has a fine record on climate change, including our recent legislation on net zero emissions. \u201cBut there is an issue that needs to be addressed in this house, and before [Corbyn] stands up and parades himself as the champion of climate change or the champion of the people or the defender of equality and fairness, he needs to apologise for his failure to deal with racism in the Labour party.\u201d May held up a newspaper advertisement, telling MPs: \u201cJust today, 60 distinguished members of the Labour party have written in the newspapers \u2018the Labour party welcomes everyone ... except, it seems, Jews. This is your legacy Mr Corbyn. You still haven\u2019t opened your eyes. You still haven\u2019t told the whole truth. You still haven\u2019t accepted your responsibility. You have failed the test of leadership\u2019. \u201cApologise now.\u201d Corbyn replied: \u201cThis party was the first to introduce anti-racist legislation into law in Britain. \u201cThis party totally opposes racism in any form whatsoever. \u201cAntisemitism has no place in our society, no place in any of our parties, and no place in any of our dialogue. Neither does any other form of racism. \u201cAnd when 60% of Tory party members think Islam is a threat to Western civilisation, and the prime minister has said she will act on Islamophobia within her own party, I hope she does. \u201cI look forward to that being dealt with as we deal with any racism that occurs within our own party as well\u201d ... In his final remarks, Corbyn said: \u201cAir pollution levels breached legal limits in 37 of the 43 areas of this country. Two-thirds of our children are growing up in an area where pollution breaches legal limits. This crisis is literally suffocating our children and damaging their health. Once again, this government is dodging its responsibility, while Labour leads the way. May, in her reply, highlighted tens of thousands of new jobs linked to renewables and clean growth before warning she would not take \u201cany lectures\u201d from Labour on the issue. She went on: \u201cHe talks about dodging responsibility - the person who has been dodging his responsibility during this PMQs is [Corbyn]. \u201cThe real disgrace is his handling of racism in the Labour Party. \u201cActivists protesting, MPs leaving, staff resigning. \u201cWhat would his great heroes of Attlee, Bevan and Benn think? \u201cLook what he has done to their party, we will never let him do it to our country.\u201d These are from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh and the Daily Mirrors\u2019 Pippa Crerar on what Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman has been saying about the advert placed by Labour peers attacking Corbyn\u2019s record on antisemitism. Here is a picture of the advert. PMQs - Snap verdict: By recent standards, that went rather well for Theresa May. It wasn\u2019t a glorious triumph, and even on the Tory side there is precious little evidence of MPs willing to credit her with a legacy (if Roger Gale is the best you can get when looking for a character reference, see 12.25pm, you\u2019re not doing well), but in the key encounter with Jeremy Corbyn, May assailed him unremittingly. You can argue that PMQs is meant to be about the PM defending her record, not the leader of the opposition defending his, but that rather misses that point that PMQs it not so much a career performance evaluation as a contest for political authority, and that means attacks on the opposition can be fair. Given the unusual circumstances, Labour peers taking out a newspaper advert to rubbish their own leader, May\u2019s decision to go on about it was reasonable. Corbyn did not allow himself to be wholly derailed, and on air quality more than climate change, he had May in real difficulty, because she did not seem to have any defence to the points he was putting. But he was on the defensive throughout. In response to May\u2019s jibes about antisemitism Corbyn could probably have made more of the point about 60% of Tory members thinking Islam is a threat to society (it wasn\u2019t enough to raise the point - he should have challenged May to say whether she agreed with them) and the whole racism row eclipsed the arguments he was seeking to make. To the public at large it may not have been very edifying - two politicians arguing who\u2019s the more racist - but May seemed to leave her MPs quite cheered by the exchanges, whereas Corbyn didn\u2019t, and so on that metric she came out top. In recent PMQs Corbyn has said little about the probable next Tory leader, Boris Johnson. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford has been much more willing to focus on the opponent his party will be facing in the autumn, and we saw that again today when he referenced Boris Johnson\u2019s history of using racist language in newspaper columns. But it was only a short reference, and mostly what was strange about today was about how little was said about the Tory leadership contest, or the Brexit crisis that is likely to erupt soon afterwards. Earlier, after Philip Hammond labelled some of the Brexit thinking prevalent in the Johnson camp \u201cterrifying\u201d (see 10.29am), I said this was bound to come up at PMQs. It didn\u2019t. It is almost as if the Commons is in denial about what might happen next. Perhaps that\u2019s just as terrifying. Labour\u2019s Kerry McCarthy asks about a constituent with spinal muscular atrophy. Recently May expressed the hope that he would be able to get the drug Spinraza. But he has not had a response yet, she says. Will May ensure he gets a response? May says she will ensure that McCarthy gets a response before she leaves office. And that\u2019s it. The SNP\u2019s John McNally asks about the seafood industry in Scotland. Longer delays for exports will lead to insurance costs going up, he says. May says her Brexit deal would have protected jobs. But the SNP did not support it, she says. The SNP\u2019s Neil Gray asks about someone with learning difficulties who has had their disability benefit cut. Disability benefits have been cut four times faster than other benefits under this government, she says. May says spending on disability benefits is at a record high. And the number of disabled people in work has increased, she says. The SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman says May has no right to be proud of her record on modern slavery. She says records show, according to a BuzzFeed investigation, only 16 out of 326 victims had their applications to stay in the UK approved. May says she makes no apologies for passing the Modern Slavery Act. Her government took this seriously when others did not. Nigel Evans, a Conservative, asks what the government is doing to promote LGBT rights abroad. May says she raised this issue at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting last year. She urged countries to change their laws, and she offered them UK support with this. The SNP\u2019s Patrick Grady says the hostile environment of migrants will be May\u2019s legacy. How can she spend millions on a marketing campaign saying Britain is great when for many traders from Africa the UK is closed. May says visas are an important tool to tackle illegal immigration. Visa applications from African nationals are at their highest level since 2013, she says. The SNP\u2019s Chris Stephens asks May to intervene to stop asylum seekers being made homeless in Glasgow. May says the government takes the wellbeing of asylum seekers seriously. She says in Glasgow Serco has been providing accommodation to asylum seekers at its own expense. Those people then have to move on, she says. George Freeman, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees that Brexit should be a moonshot moment for British science. May says one of the first receptions she held at Number 10 was for Tim Peake, the astronaut. She says the UK is a global leader in science. Robert Halfon, a Conservative, says he recently met constituents who moved into Help to Buy homes build by Persimmon. The houses are shoddy, he says. He says his constituents view Persimmon as \u201ccrooks, cowboys and con artists\u201d. May says developers should be building good quality housing under this scheme, Labour\u2019s Virendra Sharma asks if May will work to ensure that the next government sticks not just to the letter of the 0.7% aid spending commitment, but its spirit too. May says she is proud of the government\u2019s aid record. And this target is now in legislation, she says. She says the Conservatives committed to maintain it in their election manifesto. Rachel Maclean, a Conservative, asks about local prostate services in her constituency. May says she will consider the point raised. Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff says rail passengers in the north asks which has been delayed the longest - the Northern Powerhouse or the next train. Does she back renationalise the railway? May says the Northern Powerhouse is there. There is a record level of funding for transport in the north. Labour\u2019s Sharon Hodgson says thousands of families will be worried about how to feed their childen over the school holiday, let alone take them on holiday. Will she ensure people who qualify for free school meals get free meals over the summer? May says a programme giving free meals and activities to children who get free school meals is being expanded this summer. Sir Roger Gale, a Conservative, says May is one of only three PMs on whose watch the world cup has been brought home. Will May allow herself the luxury of thinking history will treat her captaincy more kindly than those who have campaigned against her? May thanks Gale for his support. And she turns to the World Cup (which was not the point of Gale\u2019s question.) The Tory Daniel Kawczynski asks about a health reorganisation in his constituency. May says the government thinks clinicians should have the final say. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says May finally did the right thing this week when she criticised President Trump\u2019s racist tweets. Will she now finally condemn her own racist \u2018go home\u2019 vans? May says she said at the time that those were too blunt an instrument. But the public expect the government to deal with immigration. Blackford says the Tories were silent when May implemented a hostile environment policy for immigrants. And they were silent about Boris Johnson\u2019s racist newspaper columns. Isn\u2019t the Tory MP Guto Bebb right to criticise the party for appealing to nationalism. Scotland looks on in horror. May says the only party appealing to blatant nationalism is the SNP. Corbyn says if all emissions were counted (ie, using the Labour approach), emissions would be more than 60% higher. The government promised to take action on air pollution in poorer areas. What action has been taken? May says the government\u2019s air quality strategy is ambitious. Wonderful words, says Corbyn. But he says air pollution limits are broken in 37 out of 42 areas in this country. The Labour mayor of London is leading the way on better air quality. She says May promised action, but has not delivered. She has effectively banished onshore wind. When will this government face up and get a grip on this crisis. May says more than 400,000 jobs have been created in the renewable energy market. But she will not take any lectures when the last Labour government incentivised diesel. And Corbyn talks about dodging responsibility. But the real person dodging responsibility is Corbyn. What would Labour heroes like Attlee and Bevan think? What Corbyn is doing to Labour he must never be allowed to do to the country. Corbyn says May should look at her own record. She introduced \u201cgo home vans\u201d when she was home secretary. He says the government will not meet its zero emissions target until 2099 at the current rate of progress. Still no apology, says May. She says the government has outperformed on some of her zero emission targets. Her party is acting on climate change, she says. She is dealing with the issues that matter to people. Corbyn needs to deal with the issues that matter to her party. Corbyn says Labour passed climate change legislation. He says the government has cut measures to help renewable energy. Labour would measure total UK emissions, including what is funded abroad. Will May match that? May says her government uses the international definiton. She says last year renewable energy use hit a record level. Jeremy Corbyn also congratulates the England team, but adds some praise for the New Zealand team too. Why did the Climate Change Committee accuse the government of coasting on climate change? May says the government has a good record on climate change. Switching subject, she says Corbyn must apologise for his record on antisemitism in the Labour party. She mentions the advert placed by Labour peers. She holds it up, and quotes from it. Corbyn says Labour was the first party to pass anti-racist legislation. Antisemitism has no place in the party he says. And he says 60% of Tory members think Islam is a threat to civilisation. He hopes May will deal with Islamphobia in her party, as he will deal with racism in his party. Going back to climate change, he quotes again from the Climate Change Committee. May quotes the committee chairman praising the UK\u2019s record. She goes back to antisemitism. She says she deals with Islamophobia in her party. Any allegations are dealt with, unlike antisemitism in Labour. Corbyn can say what he wants. But last week Trevor Phillips, the former equalities commission chair, said Labour was like a textbook case of institutional racism. Sir Peter Bottomley, a Tory, asks about the a book looking at the involvement of criminals in the Olympics. And he asks about this report on the topic. May says police should investigate allegations of crime and corruption fairly. Theresa May starts by congratulating all those who she said took part in \u201ca great weekend of sport\u201d. She welcomed the England cricket team to Downing Street on Monday, she says. She says she told they they represented the best of Britain. Labour\u2019s Lilian Greenwood says Notts County, the world\u2019s oldest professional football club, is facing extinction. Will May urge the FA, the Football League and the national league to see if they can help. May says the government is not complacent. It will hold the football authorities to account. Inquiries should be made into the suitability of owners, she says. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. PMQs is starting in five minutes. The Brexit committee hearing is about to wrap up. Hilary Benn, the chairman, ends with some final questions. Q: If there is a no-deal Brexit, will EU fishermen lose the right to fish in British waters immediately? Steve Barclay says there is a difference between the legal position, and what the UK would seek to arrange. Q: Would the government ban French fishing waters from UK waters on 1 November under no-deal? Barclay says, legally, the UK would have control. But the government would try to agree a \u201ccontinuity approach\u201d. It would be in the country\u2019s interests to have reciprocal arrangements. Barclay says, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government would seek to agree a \u2018continuity approach\u2019 on fishing, allowing EU boats continued access to British waters. Q: Why should firms prepare for no-deal if Boris Johnson is saying the chances of that are just a million to one? Barclay says the legal default is no-deal. In the committee Andrea Jenkyns, the Tory Brexiter, is asking the questions now. Q: What impact do you think the appointment of Ursula von der Leyen as the new European commission president will have on the Brexit process? Barclay says Von der Leyen has been German defence minister. She has a good understanding of what the UK can contribute to Europe\u2019s security, he says. Here is the Labour MP David Lammy on Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s Telegraph article about a no-deal Brexit. (See 10.29am.) The Tory MP Jonathan Djanogly goes next? Q: Would you put the chances of a no-deal Brexit at one million to one (Boris Johnson\u2019s figure)? Barclay says the government has been doing a lot of work warning people about the prospects of no-deal. Q: You seem to be saying the chances are rather higher than one million to one. Barclay says there are 24 sitting days for the Commons in September and October. The withdrawal agreement bill is complicated, he says. He says you cannot programme business in the Lords. Q: What is your assessment of the likelihood of no-deal? Barclay says he thinks no-deal is \u201cunderpriced\u201d. Barclay says no-deal Brexit is more likely than people assume. He refuses to back Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that the chances of a no-deal Brexit are just one million to one. (Barclay is backing Johnson for the Tory leadership.) This is what Steve Barclay told MPs about his meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, at the start of today\u2019s hearing. (See 10.04am and 10.07am.) In terms of the withdrawal agreement, what I said was that the house had rejected it three times, including the third time by a significant margin; that the European election results in my view had further hardened attitudes across the house and that the text, unchanged, I did not envisage going through the house. I don\u2019t think that was a particularly controversial observation. Barclay also claimed a lot of \u201cmisleading information\u201d about his meeting had been published. The Labour MP Stephen Timms is asking questions now. Q: Would the UK lose access to EU police databases from day one under a no-deal Brexit? Barclay says that is a matter for discussion. The legal position is yes. But he says he thinks, if a no-deal looked as if it were going to happen, he thinks there would be a \u201crenewed focus\u201d on finding a solution. For example, he says the European arrest warrant system is used more by EU countries than by the UK. Barclay suggests British access to EU police and criminal databases could be maintained in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In the committee John Whittingdale, the Tory Brexiter, is asking the questions now. Q: Are Defra drawing up plans to compensate sheep farmers in the event of tariffs being imposed under a no-deal Brexit? Steve Barclay says a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of work has been done. The government is \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the potential problems. Barclay confirms car manufacturers (see 10.16am) and sheep farmers could receive compensation in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Back in the committee, Steve Barclay was asked about Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt saying any withdrawal agreement containing a Northern Ireland backstop would be unacceptable. Barclay said it was not just Johnson and Hunt saying this. He said they were reflecting the views of parliament. Turning away from the Brexit committee for a moment, the Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has written an article in today\u2019s Telegraph attacking claims that a no-deal Brexit will make the UK poorer. Here is an extract. Last week, the chancellor, Philip Hammond warned against a no-deal Brexit, suggesting it would cost the UK economy \u00a390 billion. It is disappointing to see his predictions still so heavily reliant on the Treasury\u2019s \u201cProject Fear\u201d economic model first published in November 2018 \u2013 especially when several recent models employed by economists independent of the government, notably the World Trade Model developed at Cardiff University, have found the opposite: that the total positive impact of no-deal could be in the region of about \u00a380 billion. This \u00a3170 billion discrepancy can be accounted for by examining the assumptions fed into the Treasury model, which range from the absurd to the merely dubious. The most egregious is the failure to include the annual savings from no longer paying the \u00a320 billion annual gross budget contribution to the EU. This omission tells you all you need to know about the Treasury\u2019s pessimistic mindset ... Put simply, the idea that we will be poorer in the long-term and even in the short-term after Brexit is a myth. In response Hammond has posted a tweet saying it is \u201cterrifying\u201d that someone this close to the next government (Rees-Mogg is one of Boris Johnson\u2019s leading parliamentary supporters, and could be offered a job in a Johnson government) can make these claims. We will be hearing more about this at PMQs, almost certainly. Peter Bone, a Tory Brexiter, goes next. Q: Does \u201cno-deal\u201d mean there would be no deals at all? No, says Barclay. He says there are some agreements in place that would operate in the event of no-deal. People use no-deal to mean the UK leaving without a withdrawal agreement, he says. Barclay says some side agreements with the EU would be in place in the event of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit. Q: Is the government considering buying extra roll-on, roll-off ferry capacity? Barclay says a framework is in place to enable the government to purchase extra capacity. Q: Are you talking about ferries? Yes, says Barclay. Q: Do you accept the Treasury\u2019s claim that a no-deal Brexit could cost \u00a390bn? Barclay says that figure represents a cost going up to 2035. And it does not take into account any mitigating measures the Treasury might take. Q: Would the government compensate car manufacturers from the impact of tariffs that would be imposed under no-deal? Barclay says the government has been in discussion with the car industry. He says other policy decisions would have to be taken into account. The picture is \u201cmore nuanced\u201d than Benn suggests, he says. What I\u2019m saying is we are having extensive discussions with the industry, including the prime minister this week, because it is more nuanced ... Of course there will be impact, but the future trend is into areas such as electric vehicles and there\u2019s a huge amount the government can do in those areas, it\u2019s not just what we have got in terms of the status quo. Q: But a 10% tariff is not a nuance. It is a cost. Barclay says 80% of goods would be tariff free under the new regime. But the car sector would be affected. He says the tariffs on parts being imported would not be as high as Benn implies. Q: You imply this problem can be managed. But the evidence we have had from these sectors shows they are not relaxed. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says a no-deal Brexit is not an option. Barclay says it is factually incorrect to say no-deal is not an option. It would be disruptive, he says. But there would be mitigating things the government could do. They would not be a panacea, he says. He says the government would have to look at what support it could give to the industry. Barclay suggests the government is considering compensation for the car industry to make up for the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Benn asks about a claim from the president of the National Farmers Union that \u201ca large percentage\u201d of the country\u2019s sheep would have to be slaughtered in the event of a no-deal Brexit because they could not be exported. Barclay says the government has been talking to the farming sector about this. He admits that some sectors of the economy would be damaged by a no-deal Brexit. Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the Brexit committee, asks about the Times\u2019 story. (See 10.04am.) Steve Barclay says his meeting with Michel Barnier has been misrepresented. He says he was just making the point to Barnier that the withdrawal agreement as it stands would not get through parliament. He says all members of the committee would agree with this assessment. Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. There will be a live feed here. Barclay is going to to be asked about his meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels last week. According to the Times\u2019 Bruno Waterfield, the encounter was acrimonious. Here is an extract from his story (paywall). Brussels is preparing for \u201cbrutal\u201d talks with the next prime minister after the Brexit secretary told Michel Barnier five times during a bad-tempered meeting that the withdrawal agreement was dead. Stephen Barclay left Mr Barnier, the EU\u2019s lead negotiator, astonished and dismayed in a \u201cconfrontational\u201d exchange last Tuesday. \u201cHe told Barnier that the withdrawal agreement was dead \u2014 not once but five times,\u201d a senior EU diplomat said. \u201cIf this is what is coming then we will be heading for no deal very quickly\u201d ... One senior diplomat close to the negotiations said it was the most hostile encounter in three years since the Brexit referendum, adding that Mr Barclay had seemed to \u201ctear up the previously constructive approach taken by Theresa May\u201d. \u201cIt worked like a megaphone but it has hardened attitudes,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cIt is not the smart thing to do if a new prime minister is serious about getting a withdrawal agreement across the line. I guess Barclay is applying for a job in the Johnson cabinet.\u201d There has been speculation that the pro-European Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who has announced that he is standing down at the next election because he does not like the direction in which his party is heading, might join the Liberal Democrats. Not true, he told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics this morning. These stories keep appearing. It doesn\u2019t matter how often I deny them, they keep appearing. I will not be joining the Liberal Democrats. Bebb also confirmed that, if necessary, he might be willing to vote against the government in a no confidence debate to stop a no-deal Brexit. He explained: My farming community would be devastated by a no-deal Brexit. So I\u2019ll say very clearly, I was not elected to see a quarter of all the farmers in my constituency [Aberconwy] disappear. So I have been very clear. I would not want to do it [vote against the government on a no confidence motion]. But if I have to do something of that nature in order to stop the destruction of communities in my constituency, then it might have to come to that. On the Today programme this morning Andrea Leadsom, the Brexiter former leader of the Commons who is backing Boris Johnson for the Tory leadership, said she would not support any move to prorogue parliament to stop MPs trying to block a no-deal Brexit. Johnson has not ruled out trying this strategy. Leadsom said she would not back him if he did, although she also stressed that in practice she did not think it would happen. She said: I don\u2019t think that prorogation is the right thing to do and I don\u2019t think a prime minister would choose to do that. Asked if she would support Johnson if he did try this, she replied: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe I would and I don\u2019t believe it will happen.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is giving a speech this morning setting out the three strategies Labour would use to eliminate in-work poverty in the first term of a Jeremy Corbyn government. According to the briefing sent out in advance, he will set out three strategies the party would adopt. 1) Structural changes to the economy: including industrial strategy, a network of regional public banks, expanded trade union rights, a \u00a310ph real living wage, workers on boards and public investment across the country 2) Public services free at the point of use paid for through taxation: ending austerity in existing public services, free school meals, free buses for young people, free childcare, restoring funding for public libraries, leisure centres and parks; 3) A strong social safety net: stopping the universal credit roll-out and fundamental review of our social security system, including an end to sanctions, establishing the principle of universalism and looking after each other in times of need. In his speech, McDonnell will also explain why Labour has abandoned promoting social mobility as its preferred means of addressing poverty. He will say: Behind the concept of social mobility is the belief that poverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it, leaving the others behind. I reject that completely, and want to see a society with higher living standards for everyone as well as one in which nobody lacks the means to survive or has to choose between life\u2019s essentials. A rejection of the belief that it\u2019s OK if your local factory closes, as long as you have cash transfers from the finance sector in the south east or a new warehouse opening on the edge of town paying minimum wage on its zero hour contracts. Ending poverty won\u2019t just be done in the workplace: we need to make sure the essentials of life are never denied to people because of their circumstances. So parents aren\u2019t forced to choose between feeding themselves and feeding their children or the unemployed teenager doesn\u2019t give up on job interviews because they cost \u00a35 in bus fares each time. Labour has already committed ourselves to ending sanctions and bringing work capability assessments in-house by medical professionals. But we also are asking ourselves more fundamental questions. We need a structurally different economy, a social safety net of shared public service provision, and of course a financial safety net as well. Without any one of these three elements, we will not be able to achieve the sustained eradication of poverty, the dramatic narrowing of inequality, and the transformation of people\u2019s lives that will be the central purpose of the next Labour government. McDonnell will be speaking at the launch of the Resolution Foundation\u2019s annual living standards audit. You can read the full report here, and Larry Elliott\u2019s write-up here. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech on ending in-work poverty. As Rowena Mason reports, he will promise that Labour will eliminate the \u201cmodern-day scourge\u201d of in-work poverty by the end of the party\u2019s first full term back in office. 9.45am: Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, gives evidence to the Commons transport committee 10am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Afternoon: May gives a speech on the state of politics. Late afternoon: Peers start debating the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill. They are expected to vote on a move to beef up an amendment to the bill intended to stop the next PM proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

He had returned to the backbenches as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip to search for a top job in government and was seen by many as a leader in waiting.</p> <p>Fellow senior figures in the Vote Leave campaign said they had priced in Johnson\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 that he could attract widespread condemnation for offensive gaffes and that he might struggle with detail.</p> <p>It caused concern in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters \u2013 but little shock \u2013 when four days after that visit to Cornwall, Johnson gave an interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/tories-divided-by-boris-johnsons-eu-hitler-comparison\">in which he compared the EU to Adolf Hitler</a>.</p> <p>\u201cNapoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically. The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods,\u201d Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph. Holocaust victims and war heroes stepped forward to condemn him.</p> <p>Asked about the damage from this particular comparison, Bavarian-born Stuart paused, and then replied: \u201cI have a long-standing piece of advice to politicians of all backgrounds \u2013 keep your references to the Third Reich to between 1939 and 45. They rarely listen to my advice. \u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Johnson\u2019s most controversial comments came a month earlier, when he wrote in a Daily Telegraph column that Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d heritage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/22/boris-johnson-barack-obama-kenyan-eu-referendum\">had driven him towards anti-British sentiment</a>.</p> <p>Following a plea from the then US president for the UK to stay in the EU, Johnson wrote that Obama had removed a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office \u2013 a claim which had already been debunked by the Washington Post.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d9a0df187fe5b5b227f5a6a4178e675fea0685e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9a0df187fe5b5b227f5a6a4178e675fea0685e3/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lawyer and Johnson\u2019s wife, Marina Wheeler (left), helps as the then foreign secretary boards a rowing boat with the Czech Republic\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Ivo Sramek.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson\u2019s wife, Marina Wheeler, helps as the then foreign secretary boards a rowing boat with the Czech Republic\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Ivo Sramek.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Regardless of the facts, Johnson wrote: \u201cSome said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president\u2019s ancestral dislike of the British empire \u2013 of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender.\u201d</p> <p>Did such comments upset those in Vote Leave? Not really, according to one source who worked with him during the referendum campaign. \u201cJohnson is expected to make risqu\u00e9 remarks from a bygone era. It probably helped to highlight the fact that we were ready face down our allies \u2013 not a bad position when you are arguing for sovereignty,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>A former confidante of Johnson said he was aware that he could get away with insults and borderline racist comments. \u201cThe bonhomie, the sub-PG Wodehouse schtick, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/17/when-good-tv-goes-bad-have-got-news-for-you\">Have I Got News For You</a> appearances, they have given him a protective force field.

The membership fee seems rather small for all that access. Why are we so determined to turn our backs on it?\u201d</p> <p>Disclosure of the contradictory articles changed Cameron\u2019s supporters\u2019 views on Johnson. \u201cBefore, his decision to campaign to leave was seen as an act that was at least in part rooted in principle.

Surrounded by a media scrum, the backbench MPs descended together from the infamous red Vote Leave bus \u2013 adorned with a pledge to spend \u00a3350m a week on a post-Brexit NHS \u2013 and were handed top-heavy soft vanilla scoops on thin wafer cones. As they struggled through local traders and well wishers shouting the word \u201cBoris\u201d, they both realised that the ice creams were melting on a warm spring day quicker than they could be consumed. \u201cAll I could think was \u2018this is going to start dripping everywhere but it won\u2019t look good if we throw them away\u2019,\u201d said Stuart, who was then the chair of the Vote Leave campaign. At that moment, a mature, well dressed woman walked out of the crowd and headed for Johnson. \u201cThis lady said \u2018Mr Johnson, may I eat the rest of your ice cream for you?\u2019,\u201d said Stuart. Johnson handed the ice cream over and she devoured it. Stuart, who campaigned with Tony Blair in 1997, said that kind of impromptu, giddy exchange was replicated over the six weeks of the campaign.

A Daily Telegraph newspaper columnist and former Spectator editor, Johnson was seen as a vote winner among Tory activists after retaining the mayoralty of London, traditionally a Labour-leaning city. He had returned to the backbenches as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip to search for a top job in government and was seen by many as a leader in waiting. Fellow senior figures in the Vote Leave campaign said they had priced in Johnson\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 that he could attract widespread condemnation for offensive gaffes and that he might struggle with detail. It caused concern in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters \u2013 but little shock \u2013 when four days after that visit to Cornwall, Johnson gave an interview in which he compared the EU to Adolf Hitler. \u201cNapoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically. The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods,\u201d Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph. Holocaust victims and war heroes stepped forward to condemn him. Asked about the damage from this particular comparison, Bavarian-born Stuart paused, and then replied: \u201cI have a long-standing piece of advice to politicians of all backgrounds \u2013 keep your references to the Third Reich to between 1939 and 45. They rarely listen to my advice. \u201d Perhaps Johnson\u2019s most controversial comments came a month earlier, when he wrote in a Daily Telegraph column that Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d heritage had driven him towards anti-British sentiment. Following a plea from the then US president for the UK to stay in the EU, Johnson wrote that Obama had removed a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office \u2013 a claim which had already been debunked by the Washington Post. Regardless of the facts, Johnson wrote: \u201cSome said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president\u2019s ancestral dislike of the British empire \u2013 of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender.\u201d Did such comments upset those in Vote Leave? Not really, according to one source who worked with him during the referendum campaign. \u201cJohnson is expected to make risqu\u00e9 remarks from a bygone era. It probably helped to highlight the fact that we were ready face down our allies \u2013 not a bad position when you are arguing for sovereignty,\u201d the source said. A former confidante of Johnson said he was aware that he could get away with insults and borderline racist comments. \u201cThe bonhomie, the sub-PG Wodehouse schtick, the Have I Got News For You appearances, they have given him a protective force field. Otherwise unpalatable ideas that would kill off a fledgling political career can be discussed. He knows it,\u201d the former colleague said. Johnson\u2019s decision in February 2016 to campaign against his Eton school chum and rival David Cameron and back the campaign to leave was carefully calculated with an eye on a possible future move to become prime minister, one former aide said. \u201cHe knew that either way, campaigning to leave would give him the support that a leader needs across the party\u2019s members,\u201d one Tory adviser said. Having argued in favour of reforming the EU for many years while also being critical of its impositions on UK sovereignty, Johnson drew up three separate articles for his weekly Daily Telegraph column \u2013 two arguing to leave, and another to remain in the EU. His remain article, which was later uncovered by the Sunday Times, concluded: \u201cThis is a market on our doorstep, ready for further exploitation by British firms. The membership fee seems rather small for all that access. Why are we so determined to turn our backs on it?\u201d Disclosure of the contradictory articles changed Cameron\u2019s supporters\u2019 views on Johnson. \u201cBefore, his decision to campaign to leave was seen as an act that was at least in part rooted in principle. After the remain article was uncovered, his decision was viewed as a cynical ploy to reach No 10. Grubby,\u201d said one. It was one of the leave articles that was published in the Daily Telegraph hours after Johnson had left his home in Islington, north London to declare that he was going to support exiting the EU. Johnson\u2019s decision to campaign to leave the EU rattled Cameron. The following day, the then prime minister released a statement to parliament saying \u201cI have no other agenda than what is good for my country\u201d, which was widely interpreted as a criticism of Johnson\u2019s ambition. Tensions between the two former Bullingdon Club members heightened again over the kind of relationship the UK could have with the EU after Brexit. Cameron ridiculed Johnson\u2019s recent conversion to a Canada-style Brexit model having previously been in favour of a Norway-style deal in which the UK would still pay money to the EU. \u201cThey [the Vote Leave campaign] are literally making it up as they go along,\u201d the then prime minister said. \u201cThey are rolling the dice, they are taking a risk and they are taking a risk with people\u2019s jobs, taking a risk with families\u2019 finances.\u201d One of the problems facing Cameron and the official Stronger In campaign was Johnson\u2019s untouchability in the eyes of the public. Focus groups showed that he was not judged on the same criteria as other politicians, particularly among undecided voters. According to Ryan Coetzee, the director of strategy for the campaign to remain in the EU, Johnson was judged \u201cas a celebrity, not a leader\u201d \u2013 a clever, ambitious actor. \u201cSome take him seriously, some don\u2019t but all of them discount his blunders and gaffs [sic] with \u2018But that\u2019s Boris\u2019. He\u2019s seen as fake but cleverly so,\u201d Coetzee wrote in a memo to staff in May 2016. On the morning of 24 June, after the referendum result had become clear, Cameron dramatically resigned in front of cameras in Downing Street, sparking a leadership race in which Johnson was the clear favourite. An hour later, Johnson appeared at a news conference in Vote Leave\u2019s offices across the river from the Houses of Parliament. Johnson looked pale and stunned as he attempted to reassure the markets with a sombre speech. \u201cI believe the British people have spoken up for democracy in Britain and across Europe and we can be proud of the result,\u201d he said. Those who worked with him on the campaign say he played a crucial role in the victory, a role which was very much front of house \u2013 at press conferences, campaign events and TV debates. Gisela Stuart, who partnered Johnson in ITN\u2019s EU television debate vs Amber Rudd, Angela Eagle and Nicola Sturgeon, said: \u201cOnce you had him in the room preparing for this debate he totally and utterly engaged with the task in hand. There was no hint of a prima donna.\u201d Doubts remain over whether Johnson is willing or able to involve himself in detailed discussions around policy and strategy. Insiders said that he very rarely contributed in the office, happy to leave those conversations to the likes of Michael Gove, Matthew Elliott and Dominic Cummings. Critics from his own party believe his failure to get involved in the detail reinforces suspicions that he is incapable of serious political interventions. Sir Alan Duncan, the foreign office minister and a noted critic of Johnson, told the Guardian: \u201cIt does appear that he is happiest when he is hanging on a zip wire of some sort, waving little flags, while others do the real work.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has said it is \u201cterrifying\u201d that one of Boris Johnson\u2019s close allies, Jacob Rees-Mogg, believes a no-deal Brexit will boost the economy. The chancellor, who is expected to exit the government next week, expressed his horror after Rees-Mogg used a Daily Telegraph opinion piece to dismiss the \u201cpure silliness\u201d of Treasury forecasts suggesting a \u00a390bn hit to the economy. Rees-Mogg claimed there were economic models that showed \u201cthe total positive impact of no deal could be in the region of about \u00a380bn\u201d. Hammond hit back at the argument, saying on Twitter: \u201cHappy to debate scale of negative impact of no deal on the economy \u2013 but terrifying that someone this close to a potential future government can think we\u2019d actually be better off by adding barriers to access to our largest market.\u201d Rees-Mogg told the Guardian this was part of \u201cproject fear\u201d, which he claimed had been \u201cconsistently wrong\u201d, adding that his article made clear that the \u201cbarriers to trade that the chancellor is fretting about would be against World Trade Organization rules, while he ignores the benefits of future trade deals\u201d. The clash highlights the looming problems that Johnson is likely to have as prime minister if he wins the Tory leadership contest next week. He has said he wants a deal with the EU that scraps the Northern Ireland backstop by the end of October, but if that fails, many of his Eurosceptic backers are keen to proceed to a no-deal Brexit. Hammond is one of many senior Tories on the other wing of the party who will fight hard against that outcome, with the chancellor even suggesting he could vote down his own government to stop it. Johnson has not ruled out proroguing parliament to achieve a no-deal exit but Andrea Leadsom, one of his backers, suggested she was among those who would not support that and did not believe he would go for it. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary and a supporter of Johnson, told a Commons committee on Wednesday that no-deal Brexit was \u201cunderpriced\u201d and he believes preparations needed to be ramped up. Following reports that he clashed last week with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, by telling him the EU withdrawal agreement was dead, Barclay said this was \u201cnot a controversial observation\u201d. \u201cIn terms of the withdrawal agreement, what I said was that the House had rejected it three times, including the third time by a significant margin; that the European election results in my view had further hardened attitudes across the house and that the text, unchanged, I did not envisage going through the house,\u201d he said. He said: \u201cA no-deal Brexit would be disruptive,\u201d but added: \u201cNo Brexit is the worst of those two outcomes.\u201d Barclay also revealed that the government was looking at compensating sheep farmers in the event of a no-deal Brexit, following warnings from the National Farmers\u2019 Union that this would result in shepherds being forced to slaughter their flocks because there would be no market for their meat. He said the sheep meat industry was an \u201coutlier\u201d because 97% of exports went to the EU but the government was working on intervention measures and compensation. Barclay set out his view that parliament would be asked to vote on any new deal achieved by the next prime minister, and then if that was rejected, it would be offered a choice of revoking Brexit or leaving with no deal. \u201cBut the question then will be is there a deal that is palatable to parliament and if not will parliament vote to revoke or will we leave with no deal?\u201d However, any prime minister going down that path could face a no-confidence motion first.

      "body": "<p>Ahead of the London mayoral election of May 2012, I was invited to chair a hustings at St James\u2019s Church in Piccadilly. The main attractions were Boris Johnson, seeking his second term, and his doughty detractor Ken Livingstone, alongside their good-natured warm-up acts of Jenny Jones for the Green party and Brian Paddick for the Lib Dems.</p> <p>Before we took the stage, there was a drinks reception in the rectory. Boris Johnson was holding court, but greeted me to listen to my proposed rules of engagement and graciously remembered that we shared a comment page at the Daily Telegraph at the time. What struck me was that he was softly spoken, genial and engaging.</p> <p>Then, just as we were about to take the stage, he quite deliberately mussed up his hair and adopted his public persona of Blustering Boris, hiding like the Wizard of Oz behind his larger than life caricature.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-prime-minister-tory-party-britain\">I was Boris Johnson\u2019s boss: he is utterly unfit to be prime minister | Max Hastings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I had what I hoped was a mildly witty introduction for each of the candidates. But I do remember precisely what I said when I got to Johnson: \u201cLike most Londoners, Johnson went to Eton and Oxford.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t take it well. This was l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. He scowled up the line and muttered: \u201cDid Livingstone write that for you?\u201d I got the impression he\u2019d barely listened to the others\u2019 intros and was concerned only about his own. He barely treated the debate that followed with any attention at all, looking impatiently at his watch and airily offering generalised banalities in place of answers. And when the evening concluded, he was the only participant to exchange not a word with the other contenders, nor with me as his chairman. This vignette illustrates the Johnson phenomenon in a number of ways. His phoney public image. A hint of narcissism. The magisterial self-entitlement. Cavalier about his electors.</p> <p>But note also something from that drinks party. It was the first time that Johnson and I had met in the flesh, despite having been fellow columnists on the Telegraph for two or three years. Staff rarely saw him in the office, indeed he was usually referred to as elusive. We both had to file our copy on a Sunday for the Monday edition. I would agree my line with the office after church and send a draft over by late lunchtime. On regular occasions I went to the office to work, to write or to help with the Sunday shift. Funny enough, I never ran into Johnson there; no doubt seeing important people over Sunday lunch was a more pressing concern.</p> <p>You would expect a busy politician to have to live like that. But a quick telephone call to the comment desk or the subeditors would not only have served as a professional courtesy, it would have aided planning and ultimately saved staff time. It is hard to resist the conclusion that working colleagues simply don\u2019t matter to Johnson.</p> <p>Johnson was (and is) paid handsomely by the Daily Telegraph for his columns. He was originally commissioned at an unprecedented \u00a3250,000 a year by the then acting editor of the Telegraph, John Bryant, but that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/daily-telegraph-rehires-boris-johnson-on-275000-salary\" title=\"\">risen to \u00a3275,000 </a>in recent years. What is truly breathtaking is not just the size of the fee, but it is rumoured that Johnson was originally expected to write two columns a week. Readers never got to see the second one, because in the phrase that\u2019s used by those who will absolve him of anything: \u201cThat\u2019s Boris.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/12/daily-telegraph-forced-correct-false-brexit-claim-boris-johnson\">Telegraph forced to correct false Brexit claim by Boris Johnson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All this could be ascribed to the nature of a public figure having to juggle increasing demands on his time, of which journalistic commitments are just one. But Johnson has indolent form in this regard from his time at the Spectator magazine. </p> <p>Few of us go into journalism because we\u2019re workaholics. But an editor is a marshaller of talent and a leader and is meant to inspire staff, not dump on them. This is a characteristic of Johnson that some say extended to his London mayoralty. Much of the detailed business at City Hall was conducted by a cadre of deputies, while Johnson pursued photo-opportunities on buses and bikes.</p> <p>Tim Parker, the serial turnround corporate magnate, was one such <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/18/boris-johnson-biography-tory-threats\" title=\"\">deputy who quit just weeks</a> into his appointment. Parker is known for his working maxim that when you make a career error, you should correct it as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s indolence and cavalier attitude matter because, barring a massive public imbroglio for which he would have to withdraw from the contest, he will be prime minister. There is nowhere to hide as PM.

      "bodyText": "Ahead of the London mayoral election of May 2012, I was invited to chair a hustings at St James\u2019s Church in Piccadilly. The main attractions were Boris Johnson, seeking his second term, and his doughty detractor Ken Livingstone, alongside their good-natured warm-up acts of Jenny Jones for the Green party and Brian Paddick for the Lib Dems. Before we took the stage, there was a drinks reception in the rectory. Boris Johnson was holding court, but greeted me to listen to my proposed rules of engagement and graciously remembered that we shared a comment page at the Daily Telegraph at the time. What struck me was that he was softly spoken, genial and engaging. Then, just as we were about to take the stage, he quite deliberately mussed up his hair and adopted his public persona of Blustering Boris, hiding like the Wizard of Oz behind his larger than life caricature. I had what I hoped was a mildly witty introduction for each of the candidates. But I do remember precisely what I said when I got to Johnson: \u201cLike most Londoners, Johnson went to Eton and Oxford.\u201d He didn\u2019t take it well. This was l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. He scowled up the line and muttered: \u201cDid Livingstone write that for you?\u201d I got the impression he\u2019d barely listened to the others\u2019 intros and was concerned only about his own. He barely treated the debate that followed with any attention at all, looking impatiently at his watch and airily offering generalised banalities in place of answers. And when the evening concluded, he was the only participant to exchange not a word with the other contenders, nor with me as his chairman. This vignette illustrates the Johnson phenomenon in a number of ways. His phoney public image. A hint of narcissism. The magisterial self-entitlement. Cavalier about his electors. But note also something from that drinks party. It was the first time that Johnson and I had met in the flesh, despite having been fellow columnists on the Telegraph for two or three years. Staff rarely saw him in the office, indeed he was usually referred to as elusive. We both had to file our copy on a Sunday for the Monday edition. I would agree my line with the office after church and send a draft over by late lunchtime. On regular occasions I went to the office to work, to write or to help with the Sunday shift. Funny enough, I never ran into Johnson there; no doubt seeing important people over Sunday lunch was a more pressing concern. You would expect a busy politician to have to live like that. But a quick telephone call to the comment desk or the subeditors would not only have served as a professional courtesy, it would have aided planning and ultimately saved staff time. It is hard to resist the conclusion that working colleagues simply don\u2019t matter to Johnson. Johnson was (and is) paid handsomely by the Daily Telegraph for his columns. He was originally commissioned at an unprecedented \u00a3250,000 a year by the then acting editor of the Telegraph, John Bryant, but that has risen to \u00a3275,000 in recent years. What is truly breathtaking is not just the size of the fee, but it is rumoured that Johnson was originally expected to write two columns a week. Readers never got to see the second one, because in the phrase that\u2019s used by those who will absolve him of anything: \u201cThat\u2019s Boris.\u201d All this could be ascribed to the nature of a public figure having to juggle increasing demands on his time, of which journalistic commitments are just one. But Johnson has indolent form in this regard from his time at the Spectator magazine. Few of us go into journalism because we\u2019re workaholics. But an editor is a marshaller of talent and a leader and is meant to inspire staff, not dump on them. This is a characteristic of Johnson that some say extended to his London mayoralty. Much of the detailed business at City Hall was conducted by a cadre of deputies, while Johnson pursued photo-opportunities on buses and bikes. Tim Parker, the serial turnround corporate magnate, was one such deputy who quit just weeks into his appointment. Parker is known for his working maxim that when you make a career error, you should correct it as quickly as possible. Johnson\u2019s indolence and cavalier attitude matter because, barring a massive public imbroglio for which he would have to withdraw from the contest, he will be prime minister. There is nowhere to hide as PM. Johnson will not be able to rely on his staff to cover for him, as he has in journalism and as mayor. And how will he cope with his lavish family maintenance commitments when an annual income approaching seven figures is reduced to a meagre prime minister\u2019s stipend of \u00a3150,000? At least Johnson will have somewhere to live. His artifice will be found out in highest office very quickly. When I bump into Tory friends where I live in deepest-blue Sussex and they speak of Johnson\u2019s \u201ccharisma\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d, I simply observe that they\u2019ve never worked for him. Fairly soon, the whole civil service will be working for him and, unlike the vainglorious groupies who currently prop him up, they will not carry the can for him for long. \u2022 George Pitcher was secretary for public affairs to the archbishop of Canterbury, 2010-11",
