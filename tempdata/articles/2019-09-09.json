Where next? | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The truth, as always, is more nuanced, as I learned during meetings in Brussels at the end of last week. There is real debate in the EU about Brexit. The EU\u2019s position today is subtly different to that of two weeks ago. And its position of two weeks ago subtly different to that which came before. So where is the EU currently on Brexit?</p> <p>The EU liked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/27/olly-robbins-steely-operator-fighting-on-the-brexit-frontline\" title=\"\">Olly Robbins</a>, Theresa May\u2019s Brexit negotiator. Intelligent, thoughtful, persistent and tirelessly hardworking, he was widely respected among his EU peers as someone they could do business with. They were less keen on May herself. Their misgivings were well-founded. Robbins negotiated a Brexit deal widely recognised in Europe as an excellent outcome for the UK, in light of the red lines his prime minister had drawn at the time. Yet May proved incapable of managing the domestic politics and selling his deal. This provides the context for understanding how the EU sees Johnson.</p> <p>While there is a lot in him they dislike, they welcomed the fact he is a \u201cred-blooded politician\u201d, as one adviser to an EU head of state put it to me. A breath of fresh air compared to May. The fact Brexit is inherently political for Johnson \u2013 a means to a bigger Commons majority \u2013 creates the glimmer, no matter how slight, that he may be able to get a deal over the line. This, combined with Johnson\u2019s singular focus on the backstop, and his willingness to adopt \u201ca continental line\u201d on global issues at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/26/boris-johnson-in-biarritz-what-we-learned\" title=\"\">G7 in Biarritz</a>, gave EU leaders more confidence a deal could possibly be struck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81a10d53b7ec4f261c8bbad7c946adf683c255c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81a10d53b7ec4f261c8bbad7c946adf683c255c2/0_99_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olly Robbins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The EU liked Olly Robbins, Theresa May\u2019s Brexit negotiator.
