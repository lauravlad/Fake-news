Johnson is due to explain them in a short speech with these words, which were released in advance overnight by CCHQ. Johnson will say:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The stalemate in parliament has held this country back for too long.</p> \n   <p>Instead of concentrating on your priorities, Westminster has been mired in division and deadlock. Politicians have spent so much time shouting at each other and devising ways of wriggling out of Brexit that they have neglected the issues people care about.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s time to send in the bulldozers and smash through the gridlock.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the problem with metaphors is that they can be open to multiple interpretations.

(He lives in a Tory-held constituency, where his own party is not standing.) Farage said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I know it is very rare to have an appearance from Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn but [in the BBC debate] on Friday night, [Johnson] has gone the wrong way. He has stepped back from a Canada-plus-style trade deal and he was talking about his \u2018oven-ready deal\u2019 - it\u2019s going to be put in the oven and ready before Christmas.</p> \n   <p>All I can say is that will lead to many long years of indigestion because we will be trapped inside an international treaty. We have given Michel Barnier the upper hand.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Although Farage is now claiming that Johnson has changed Brexit policy twice during the election, in truth Johnson\u2019s policy has not changed at all. The PM has negotiated a new version of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/840655/Agreement_on_the_withdrawal_of_the_United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland_from_the_European_Union_and_the_European_Atomic_Energy_Community.pdf\">the 540-page withdrawal agreement (pdf)</a>, which has been published and which would determine the form of the UK\u2019s departure from the UK. He has also published a much shorter <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/840656/Political_Declaration_setting_out_the_framework_for_the_future_relationship_between_the_European_Union_and_the_United_Kingdom.pdf\">political declaration (pdf)</a> which gives some information about the sort of trade deal with the EU that he would want to negotiate next year, although most of the crucial detail remains to be negotiated.</p> \n  <p>What is true, though, is that as the campaign has been going on, Johnson and other Tories have increasingly been suggesting that the fact that he has an \u201coven-ready\u201d withdrawal agreement ready to go (which is true) also means that his eventual UK-EU trade deal is also nearly complete (which is not true at all).</p> \n  <p>Johnson was doing this in the BBC debate on Friday and was doing it again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee6a058f08951c7479d312#block-5dee6a058f08951c7479d312\">in a campaign Q&amp;A yesterday.</a> It is not clear whether he was being deliberately misleading, or just cavalier with the truth. Partly this is happening because the term \u201cBrexit deal\u201d is ambiguous. Sometimes it is used to refer to the withdrawal agreement, and sometimes it is used to refer to the proposed post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Johnson seems to be exploiting this ambiguity for his own advantage.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"481166b93d49ba048592366e2e582e5ca1bab687\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/481166b93d49ba048592366e2e582e5ca1bab687/0_275_4269_2562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage speaking at a press conference in Westminster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage speaking at a press conference in Westminster.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-10T13:53:54.618Z\">at 1.53pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5def8e0a8f08717dc5e4aec3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-10T13:25:53.806Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Farage urges leave supporters to vote tactically</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>At a news conference in Westminster <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the Brexit party leader, urged leave voters to vote tactically at the election and back his party rather than the Conservatives.

He says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Outside of the city seats, if you are in small town midlands and north, it\u2019s abysmal out there. They don\u2019t like [Boris] Johnson, but they can\u2019t stand [Jeremy] Corbyn and they think Labour\u2019s blocked Brexit. I don\u2019t think their long-term gains for the Tory party. But I can well see them going Tory [at] this election and if Labour ever got its act together they presumably would fall back ...</p> \n   <p>I think [amongst] middle-class graduates, remainy people, Labour is probably doing well, and the Lib Dems are probably doing well, but not in big enough numbers to deny the Tories a majority.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And, at another point, he says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I just can\u2019t see how you [ie, the Tories] don\u2019t have a majority, to be honest.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He says the electoral map has turned \u201ctopsy-turvy\u201d, with both main parties likely to win in unexpected places.</strong> Labour could win Canterbury, a former Tory seat it won unexpectedly in 2017, he says. But it could lose Bolsover, a former safe Labour seat represented by Dennis Skinner. Ashworth says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The electoral map is going topsy-turvy because of Brexit, and because of Corbyn. The question is for Labour, if it gets itself a half-decent leader next time round, whether it can reverse and regain its traditional heartland seats.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ashworth says the situation for Labour is \u201cdire\u201d in its heartland seats.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>In places like Mansfield and Ashfield, it\u2019s dire for the Labour party up there, these traditional areas.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He says \u201cthe combination of Corbyn and Brexit\u201d is to blame for the \u201cawful\u201d problems Labour candidates are having in some areas.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He says Johnson\u2019s \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 message is effective</strong>.

Indeed, Ashworth insisted, his heart went out to Jack, and baby Lily (on the front of today\u2019s Mirror), and to the family of the \u201c12-year-old child waiting 57 hours - 57 hours - in an A&amp;E in Essex, for a very specialist bed\u201d. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I, like any parent, because I\u2019ve got two young children, would be furious, livid, angry, fighting like a lion for my child who had been let down after years of cutbacks in our health service. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>No, not using them for political capital at all, Ashworth insisted after it was pointed out he had tweeted Jack\u2019s picture, and Jeremy Corbyn had held it up at a rally.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Unfortunately, across the country, these are not one-off events. We have seen in this election campaign other images of elderly people literally wasting away on trolleys in corridors for hours and hours, because they simply can\u2019t get a bed. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>According to Ashworth, 600,000 people were left waiting on a trolley for a bed last year, while 17,000 beds had been cut from hospitals by the Conservatives - cuts he pledged to reverse if he became health secretary. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-10T08:43:58.321Z\">at 8.43am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5def470f8f08be0cbf46d77d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/damien-gayle\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-10T07:39:40.033Z\">7.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hi there, Damien Gayle taking over in London now, covering the morning\u2019s political developments until Andrew Sparrow\u2019s had his Weetabix. </p> \n  <p><strong>Robert Buckland, </strong>the justice secretary, was just speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, attempting more or less to explain away what political observers have described as the worst day so far for the Conservative election campaign. Asked about Johnson\u2019s fumbling response to the photo of Jack Williment-Barr sleeping on the floor of Leeds General infirmary, Buckland said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Politics and general elections, despite the best efforts of political parties, can be unpredictable, and that particularly story was one of those occasions where everybody was dealing with a very difficult situation.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The child\u2019s family want privacy, Buckland insisted. In the meantime, general elections ought to be fought \u201con the high ground, the big issues\u201d rather than \u201cwho said what to who\u201d, he chastised. Suggestions that Jack was a symbol of Tory failure to care for the National Health Service were \u201crather insulting to all the hard-working people in our NHS\u201d, Buckland said. If only the Conservatives could have a chance to implement their \u201ctargeted and structured programme\u201d, everything would be fine. </p> \n  <p>Answering for Johnson\u2019s bizarre pocketing of a television reporter\u2019s phone to avoid looking at Jack\u2019s picture, Buckland gave a kind of defence of temporary delirium: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that in all the hundreds of interviews that the prime minister has done or indeed a lot of us have done, there will come moments where you\u2019re suddenly sprung with something and it is difficult to know what it is. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He saved his strongest words for the rowdy Labour activists outside Leeds General, who Conservative press office had claimed assaulted Matt Hancock\u2019s adviser. The claims, widely reported by senior journalists briefed by senior Tory sources, were quickly disproved by a video of the incident. But, Buckland said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I saw was a very confusing scene of public disorder, people who had clearly organised themselves to come along, create trouble and mischief, the sort of disorderly conduct, I\u2019m afraid, from the left, that we have seen in this campaign.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason have our main story: My colleague, Andrew Sparrow, has put together this detailed summary of the day\u2019s events: And, since he wrote it, a major poll predicted a narrowing lead for the Tories, but suggested they could still be on course for a majority. The YouGov poll predicted a 28-seat lead for the Conservatives \u2013 down from 68 a fortnight ago. But it suggested a hung parliament was also a realistic outcome. The shadow women and equalities minister, Naz Shah, has criticised the Tories for standing by a candidate who shared a message on social media claiming Muslims play the \u201crace card\u201d and have a \u201cnasty culture\u201d The Guardian revealed on Monday that Linden Kemkaran retweeted a Twitter user last week who dismissed Islamophobia as nonsense, as well as two others who accused Shah of being \u201cnot white enough\u201d to have experienced what they described as Bradford\u2019s \u201cno-go areas\u201d. It was reported that the Tories were investigating the claims against Kemkaran, who said she \u201cdidn\u2019t and never would describe Islam or any other culture as \u2018nasty\u2019\u201d. This evening, Shah has accused the party of refusing to take decisive action. This rhetoric has serious consequences. It stokes hate and prejudice towards Muslims. Instead of apologising and making amends, Linden Kemkaran doubled down. She is not fit to be an MP. She should be suspended immediately pending a full investigation. Clearly, Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that racist Conservative candidates are \u2018out first bounce\u2019 was yet another lie. He is refusing to suspend her and, in doing so, he is condoning racism towards minorities. Perhaps this is not surprising as Johnson himself has said \u2018Islam is the problem\u2019 and suggested Muslims are not loyal to Britain. According to the Mail on Sunday\u2019s deputy political editor, this is the Tory spin on the poll: It\u2019s been noted by various Westminster correspondents that the Tories were likely to be unsettled by the previous poll, which predicted a comfortable lead and which some voters could see as a reason not to turn out. It follows, then, that they\u2019d portray any potential narrowing of the gap in this evening\u2019s as presenting a \u201cdanger\u201d their supporters must get to the polls to see off. Somewhat more interestingly, the poll suggests Thursday evening could be uncomfortable for the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the former work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith. Chingford and Wood Green has been a safe Tory seat since it was created in 1997, and was once held by Iain Duncan Smith. But with demographic changes and other local factors the comfortable advantage they had has changed. Current results now show a two-point lead for the Conservatives (47% versus Labour\u2019s 45%). In 2017, Dominic Raab won Esher and Walton with a majority of over 23,000. This constituency also voted Remain at the 2016 EU Referendum. The model shows that tactical voting is producing a shift towards the Lib Dems, with the party now on 44% and closing the gap on the Conservatives (46%). One point to note: The YouGov poll released this evening seeks to measure the likely results if the general election were held right now. Without wishing to labour a somewhat tedious and clich\u00e9d point, the campaigning is not yet over. Chris Curtis, YouGov\u2019s political research manager, has said: Our latest and final poll shows that a small Conservative majority is likely, with the Tories taking 22 more seats than in 2017 and Labour losing 31. This would be the best and worst results respectively for each party since the 80s. But the margins are extremely tight and small swings in a small number of seats, perhaps from tactical voting and a continuation of Labour\u2019s recent upward trend, means we can\u2019t currently rule out a hung parliament. As things currently stand there are 85 seats with a margin of error of 5% or less. The Tories could still be on course for a majority at Thursday\u2019s general election, but it may be smaller than was predicted a fortnight ago, according to one poll published this evening. The YouGov poll for the Times suggests the Conservatives may have the upper hand in 339 seats; enough to form a government but 20 fewer than in a similar poll published on 27 November. Labour are also predicted to win 20 more seats than before, with 231. The poll\u2019s range of possible outcomes stretches from 367 Tory seats to only 311. Anthony Wells, YouGov\u2019s director of political research, said: Based on the model we cannot rule out a hung parliament. The paper reports that the seat-by-seat analysis was based on more than 100,000 interviews conducted over the past seven days in the 632 constituencies in Great Britain and produced using a polling model that accurately predicted the outcome of the 2017 election. It predicts vote shares of 43% for the Tories and 34% for Labour and suggests the SNP could win 35 seats, the Lib Dems 12, Plaid Cymru four and both the Greens and others on one each. The Brexit party is not predicted to win a single seat. The poll does not cover the Northern Irish constituencies. O\u2019Neill also came under pressure over Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s policy of not taking their seats at Westminster. She insisted \u201cone or two Irish MPs won\u2019t make a difference\u201d, in response to criticism by Eastwood and Aiken. The latter put to O\u2019Neill that her MPs in the last parliament were often seen sitting in the coffee shops and asked: \u201cWhy not take your seats on the green benches\u201d? She said: You are pretending you can go to Westminster and stop Brexit, that is nonsense. The SDLP leader, who is running in Foyle, restated that, if elected, he would take his seat in Westminster. Long also pressed O\u2019Neill over abstentionism. O\u2019Neill responded saying her MPs will never take an oath of allegiance to the Queen. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has not taken part in this evening\u2019s BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight election debate. Lagan Valley candidate, Jeffrey Donaldson, has stood in for his party leader. Of the other four main parties in the region, Sinn F\u00e9in has been represented by its vice president Michelle O\u2019Neill, the SDLP by its leader Colum Eastwood, the UUP by its leader Steve Aiken and the Alliance party by its leader Naomi Long. The first question put to them by a member of the audience was: \u201cdo you believe Brexit makes a united Ireland more likely?\u201d. Eastwood said he believes the first thing to be dealt with is \u201cthe emergency that is Brexit\u201d, and called for a second referendum to \u201cstop this Brexit madness\u201d. Donaldson said he doesn\u2019t believe there is a threat to Northern Ireland\u2019s position within the UK, and he opposed a second referendum on Brexit. He slated \u201cpoor negotiation\u201d on behalf of the UK government and restated his party\u2019s opposition to Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed Brexit deal My message to unionists is to send a strong unionist team back to Westminster, that\u2019s what unionists want. O\u2019Neill said Brexit may make people rethink their stance on a united Ireland, if leaving the UK would mean re-entering the EU. According to Long, Brexit has \u201ccertainly made Northern Ireland less stable\u201d. She said it has brought arguments around borders back to the fore, adding: \u201cThe harder the Brexit, the more borders... the more likely people are to reconsider their position (on the constitutional question).\u201d Aiken said Johnson\u2019s deal makes Northern Ireland \u201ca place apart\u201d, and urged for the proposals to be stopped. Finally, the leaders are asked about climate change. Sturgeon says the Scottish government has already passed a bill with the most challenging climate targets in the world. \u201cWe changed our mind on reducing air passenger duty, but the government also needs to work with companies as well as encouraging individuals to make changes.\u201d Leonard sets out Labour\u2019s green industrial revolution \u2013 asked what unpopular decision he\u2019s prepared to make on climate change, he says he wants a revolution by consent. Carlaw says it\u2019s not a case of foisting things upon people \u2013 there\u2019s an international aspect in helping other countries to avoid the mistakes the UK has made. We need to manage resources better. In Greater Manchester, the prime minister is holding a rally: Going back to the audience on funding for policies, one woman tells the Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, that his claims about increased employment are really evidence of subsidised employment, because so many working people are now relying on food banks. Leonard says there is a real problem of low pay, which is why Labour is introducing a minimum wage of \u00a310 an hour for everyone over the age of 16. Sturgeon accuses Carlaw of being \u201cout of touch\u201d; his priority is passing on tax cuts to the rich, while the SNP has already introduced a higher rate of tax for high earners. Danielle from Falkirk asks the money question: How are parties going to fund their policies? Richard Leonard says Labour wants to \u201cmove forward through investment\u201d, we will borrow to invest and put burden of taxation more fairly on companies. Nicola Sturgeon says SNP priorities - and the experience they\u2019d bring to a minority government - are progressive taxation, more room for responsible borrowing while interest rates low, and stop spending on the wrong priorities. \u201cEvery other party here wants to spend \u00a3200bn on Trident renewal\u201d. Ahead of the final day of campaigning, the BBC Scotland leaders\u2019 debate \u2013 the final televised debate of this election campaign \u2013 has begun in Glasgow, with audience questions on trust in politicians and the inevitability of independence. There\u2019s also a stage set that would be more appropriate to a Derren Brown show, but not to worry. The audience immediately makes its presence felt: \u201cCan I ask Willie Rennie to stop talking over people?\u201d interjects one woman, \u201cIt\u2019s really rude.\u201d Another man says that the country has never been more divided \u201cbecause of the way YOU [the party leaders] are acting\u201d. Another woman who identifies herself as \u201cof a certain age\u201d, says that as a WASPI woman \u201cI\u2019ve been disrespected by all of you\u201d. Meanwhile, the leaders are still warming up, and sticking fairly firmly to their party lines. Asked about further devolution versus independence, Sturgeon says that Labour and the Lib Dems talk a lot about ideas like \u2018devo max\u2019 but without offering specifics. It\u2019s worth noting that Sturgeon is now a debate veteran, having appeared in many of the UK-wide debates, but this Scotland-focused one may bring more audience scrutiny of the SNP government\u2019s record at Holyrood. Carlaw challenges her: \u201cIts those public services are currently suffering because Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s first, second, third and forth priority is independence, not the economy, not your jobs.\u201d In the BBC\u2019s Scottish leaders debate, which is airing now, Nicola Sturgeon is asked about mistrust in politicians. The SNP leader says political leaders have forgotten they are \u201copponents, not enemies\u201d. The leader of the Scottish Tories, Jackson Carlaw, says we are living in a less deferential age and people no longer unquestioningly accept what politicians say. Richard Leonard, of Scottish Labour, says political leaders have been guilty of \u201ctransposing their own priorities\u201d, rather than listening to those of voters. He\u2019s asked a follow-up on Jonathan Ashworth\u2019s claim that he backs Jeremy Corbyn, which come after he was recorded speaking in less than flattering terms about his party leader. Is that not an example of the sort of thing that erodes trust? Leonard repeats Ashworth\u2019s claim he was winding up a friend. Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, says he is deeply concerned about public mistrust. My colleague, Dan Sabbagh, has put together this guide to tactical voting: The Guardian has just published its view on this Thursday\u2019s general election: Despite our misgivings, we believe that a vote for the Labour party offers the best hope for the country. A Labour-led government seems only possible with the support of parties that insist a second referendum on Europe is sacrosanct \u2013 some of whom also demand a second independence poll in Scotland. That means backing candidates who can defeat the Tories in constituencies where Labour is an also-ran \u2013 from the SNP, the Lib Dems, the Greens and Plaid Cymru to pro-European independents. Think of the electrifying impact of relieving Mr Johnson of high office and stopping the pro-Brexit Tory party in its tracks. Thursday is a fleeting opportunity to stop an unwanted national calamity \u2013 and address the reasons behind it. Voters must seize the day. We reported earlier that a group of Extinction Rebellion protesters had stuck themselves to the Tory campaign bus (see 5.16pm). After about an hour and a half, the three men have been unstuck and placed in handcuffs by police. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has been told that he retains Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s backing after a tape of a private conversation was released in which Ashworth said Labour was certain to lose the election and Corbyn was a major reason why. In the 11-minute recording Ashworth said: Outside of the city seats, if you are in small-town Midlands and north, it\u2019s abysmal out there. They don\u2019t like [Boris] Johnson, but they can\u2019t stand [Jeremy] Corbyn and they think Labour\u2019s blocked Brexit ... The electoral map is going topsy-turvy because of Brexit, and because of Corbyn. The question is for Labour, if it gets itself a half-decent leader next time round, whether it can reverse and regain its traditional heartland seats ... Johnson and CCHQ would have to massively fuck it up in the last week [to lose the election]. The recording was obtained by the anti-Labour website Guido Fawkes and posted online this morning. Ashworth immediately accepted that the tape, which seems to have been recorded early last week, was genuine. He was talking to a Tory activist who had had known for years and whom he considered a friend, he said. Ashworth initially said that his comments, which included a vague hint that Corbyn might be considered a security risk by officials in No 10, were \u201cbanter\u201d and later he expanded on this, saying that he was deliberately trying to lull the Tories into a false sense of security. He told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live (no relation to the original Politics Live at the Guardian): [My friend] was ringing me. I was talking to him. He was saying his sources at CCHQ say Labour\u2019s doing well. I\u2019m doing the old, what Alex Ferguson would do, football manager kind of thing, trying to psych him out, saying: \u2018No, you\u2019re going to win, don\u2019t worry about it,\u2019 because I know he\u2019s an activist in Canterbury, I\u2019m trying to make him complacent. If Ashworth really was engaged in a cunning attempt to mislead CCHQ, he is a better actor than people have given him credit for and clearly has potential as a double agent. (You can listen to the recording here, and decide what to think for yourself.) Notwithstanding, he apologised to Labour members anyway. And Corbyn indicated that he accepted Ashworth\u2019s explanation of what happened, telling the BBC: Jon has my full support and I\u2019m cool with Jon, we get along great. He said to me it was all about reverse psychology banter as in football supporters and the other person was saying the opposite about their party and it all got a bit out of hand. In politics, as in most walks of life, people do say disobliging things about their bosses in private from time to time and Ashworth\u2019s comments were relatively mild compared to some of the comments made about Corbyn by his MPs behind his back. In public at least, Ashworth\u2019s colleagues have been supportive. Most of them probably feel understandable sympathy for the way Ashworth appears to have been let down by long-standing friend he thought he could trust. Boris Johnson has said it is \u201cvery hard\u201d to see Brexit happening if the Tories fail to get a majority. Speaking at a Q&amp;A at a JCB factory, he said: I don\u2019t see any alternative but a working majority to deliver [Brexit] ... Nicola Sturgeon has just hired a bus with \u2018Stop Brexit\u2019 on it, so she\u2019s obviously not in favour of it. And she\u2019s the only way that Jeremy Corbyn can remain in office. So it is very hard to see how we do it without a working majority Conservative government. That\u2019s what we need to go for. Johnson has given his strongest hint yet that he is not planning to scrap HS2. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has claimed that Johnson has changed Brexit strategy within the last week, opting for a softer version. At a news conference, Farage said this explained why he would not be voting Tory in his own constituency, where the Brexit party aren\u2019t fielding a candidate. In truth, Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan has not changed, but Farage is right to say that on the campaign trail Johnson has increasingly been suggesting that fact that he has an \u201coven-ready\u201d withdrawal agreement ready to go (which is true) also means that his eventual UK-EU trade deal is also nearly complete (which is not true at all). Jo Swinson has accused Boris Johnson of showing \u201can empathy bypass\u201d in his attitude to other people, as the Liberal Democrats made a final push to persuade traditional Labour supporters to vote tactically and deny the Conservatives a majority. A medical secretary has claimed her Facebook account was hacked after it was used to post false information claiming that a photograph of an ill boy on the floor at Leeds General Infirmary was staged for political purposes. The father of Jack Merritt, who was murdered in the London Bridge terrorist attack last month, has directly criticised the prime minister for treating his son\u2019s death as a political \u201copportunity\u201d. That\u2019s all from my for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now. A complaint has been lodged with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development accusing JCB of having done nothing to protect human rights over the use of its mechanical equipment in the Palestinian occupied territories. The OECD complaint alleges that the British multinational has allowed its products to be used repeatedly to bulldoze Palestinian villages, or construct illegal settlements in alleged breach of international law. The claim was lodged on Tuesday by Lawyers for Palestinian Rights, the same day that Boris Johnson went to the JCB\u2019s factory in the Midlands of the UK to knock over a polystyrene wall. JCB family members have been a long-term funders of the Tory party. The legal charity is bringing the claim against JCB under Chapter 4 of the OECD guidelines for multinationals concerning the need to take into account human rights considerations when selling products. The group\u2019s claim states: JCB has not sought ways to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their business operations and products by virtue of the use of its machinery by Israeli authorities and private contractors, that it is linked to via a supply chain. JCB has failed to develop a human rights policy that: has been approved by its board; benefits from internal and/or external expertise; sets out the company\u2019s expectations from its staff; is publicly available; and is embedded across the business. It says JCB should \u201cimmediately suspend supply of products to Comasco (an Israeli company which is the exclusive dealer of JCB products in Israel) that could be identified as being part of the supply chain that results in demolitions or settlement-related construction, and to permanently cease supply to Comasco should it not be able to provide credible and verifiable guarantees that such products will not be involved in the violation of Palestinian human rights\u201d. Tareq Shrourou and Claire Jeffwitz of Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, said: The complaint presents credible, clear and compelling evidence that substantiates the material and prolific involvement of JCB heavy machinery products in specific demolition and displacement incidents that significantly impacts Palestinian families, including children and the elderly, and also its use in settlement-related construction. JCB\u2019s facilitating of these tightly connected policies and practices that result in human rights violations against Palestinians must cease immediately. JCB has been contacted for comment. Jeremy Corbyn has indicated that he accepts Jonathan Ashworth\u2019s claim that what he said in a private conversation with a Tory activist whom he considered an old friend was just \u201creverse psychology\u201d, intended to lull the Tories into a false sense of security. Asked about the tape (see 11.44am). Speaking to the BBC, Corbyn said: This is Guido Fawkes tapping into a private bit of banter between two old friends. I\u2019ve had a chat with Jon Ashworth; he called me straight away. He\u2019s out there campaigning for a Labour government, he\u2019s out there defending our NHS, and Jon has my full support and I\u2019m cool with Jon, we get along great. He said to me it was all about reverse psychology banter as in football supporters and the other person was saying the opposite about their party and it all got a bit out of hand. Corbyn also said that Ashworth had been a \u201cfantastic\u201d shadow health secretary and that the material was leaked to distract media attention away from stories about the state of the NHS. (The Guido Fawkes website, which leaked the material, backs Boris Johnson.) Asked if people would believe this was just banter, Corbyn said people could decide on Thursday whether they wanted to vote for a party that backed the NHS, or one that might destroy it \u201cby a thousand cuts\u201d. Asked about Ashworth\u2019s suggestion that Corbyn might be a security risk, Corbyn said his colleague was joking. He explained: Jon and I have known each other for a very long time and he was actually making some jokes, a rather odd sense of humour surrounding it, but that is him. If you know Jon Ashworth like I do, he makes jokes the whole time. Asked if Ashworth would become health secretary if Labour won the election, Corbyn said he would announce his team on Friday. Extinction Rebellion protesters, some dressed as bees, gathered around the Conservative campaign bus as it tried to leave JCB in Uttoxeter, the Press Association reports. They appear to have stuck themselves to the vehicle. Boris Johnson not on board. From MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s Q&amp;A at the JCB plant. Johnson said that it was \u201cvery hard\u201d to see Brexit happening if the Tories failed to get a working majority. Asked if he had a plan B to deliver Brexit in the event of not having a majority, he replied: I don\u2019t see any alternative but a working majority to deliver it ... Nicola Sturgeon has just hired a bus with \u2018Stop Brexit\u2019 on it, so she\u2019s obviously not in favour of it. And she\u2019s the only way that Jeremy Corbyn can remain in office. So it is very hard to see how we do it without a working majority Conservative government. That\u2019s what we need to go for. He claimed the leaked recording of Jonathan Ashworth\u2019s private conversation about Labour and Corbyn showed that Corbyn was a security threat. Describing Corbyn as a \u201cHamas-backing, IRA-supporting, antisemitism-condoning appeaser of the Kremlin\u201d, Johnson went on: If you doubt me, look at what his health spokesman said today, Jon Ashworth. He revealed that he thought his own leader is a security risk. And there is another fact Mr Ashworth mentioned which I think is even more terrifying when you look at the year ahead and the prospects for our country. Jon Ashworth made it absolutely clear that the reason Mr Corbyn is failing to persuade some people to vote for him is he is blocking Brexit \u2013 he won\u2019t get Brexit done. Don\u2019t just listen to me, look at what his health spokesman Jon Ashworth has said. He is absolutely right. See 11.44am for a summary of what Ashworth does say on the tape. There is only one reference to Corbyn as a possible security risk, and Ashworth\u2019s language is less specific than Johnson claims. Johnson gave what might be his strongest hint yet that he is not planning to scrap HS2. Asked if he would press on with it if he won the election, he said he had already set up a review, under Douglas Oakervee, to consider whether the project should continue. HS2 I think is a scheme that is running now at \u00a388bn in estimated costs, projected costs, I think it could go higher to be perfectly honest. If there is a chance to make HS2 work better, or if he [Oakervee] says it\u2019s a bad idea then obviously we will have to look very seriously at that. But I want to give you my instincts. I think I\u2019m probably the candidate at this election who has done the most to build massive infrastructure projects, I know a bit about it. I\u2019m a massive enthusiast for it. On the whole, this country is woefully under-provided for fantastic infrastructure. So whatever Doug says, whatever his team says, I\u2019m going to be temperamentally very much inclined to want to go ahead with a great national project if I can. But I\u2019m also going to want to be able to save whatever money I can, those are going to be the instincts I will use when approaching it. He rejected claims that the Conservatives were \u201chome and dry\u201d for an election victory. When asked if he accepted this, he replied: Absolutely not. This is a very close fought election and we need every vote. As I say, the only mathematical alternative to a working majority Conservative government is a real risk of another hung parliament. That\u2019s another five years of confusion, chaos, dither, delay and division. We cannot go down that route. I\u2019m sorry to say this but you remember what happened in 2017 - polls can be wrong. We need to be fighting for every vote. He said MPs would not be justifying their pay if they continued to block Brexit after the election. When an employee at the plant asked if Johnson agreed that MPs should stop getting paid if they continued to block Brexit, he replied: Let\u2019s move this thing forward ... if MPs turn up and continue to block Brexit how on Earth they can justify drawing their salaries, I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t think I would have the powers ... under any circumstances to take away salaries from MPs. I think I would be accused of anti-democratic behaviour. But I take your point very sincerely. Jo Swinson has accused Boris Johnson of showing \u201can empathy bypass\u201d in his attitude to other people, as the Liberal Democrats made a final push to persuade traditional Labour supporters to vote tactically and deny the Conservatives a majority. Speaking to the Guardian during a campaign rally in Bath, Swinson said her party could confound gradually slipping national poll ratings to spring a series of surprises in up to a dozen or so Conservative-held seats, if the anti-Tory vote coalesces. The Lib Dem leader said the task of denying Johnson a majority was all the more urgent following his much-criticised ITV interview in which the prime minister repeatedly refused to look at a photograph of Jack Williment-Barr, the four-year-old boy pictured sleeping on the floor of an overstretched A&amp;E unit in Leeds. Calling Johnson\u2019s approach astonishing, Swinson said it fitted a wider pattern of behaviour, such as over the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran, and his dismissal as \u201chumbug\u201d female MPs\u2019 concerns over inflammatory political language. She went on: It\u2019s tone deaf. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t respond to people as human beings. It\u2019s like he has had an empathy bypass. Does he care about anyone? I can only conclude that he just doesn\u2019t really care. It\u2019s a pretty damning conclusion, but that\u2019s the situation ... He\u2019s a danger to the future of this country. That\u2019s why he\u2019s prepared to say anything he thinks will work on Brexit, regardless of whether he can do it, regardless of what the consequences will be. This YouGov poll suggests people do not believe the Tory suggestion (see 3.30pm) that leaving the EU on 31 January would amount to Brexit being over. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking at a Labour event in Carlisle. He talks about the report about the UK from the UN special rapporteur on poverty. That is shaming, he says. He says he is glad the press highlighted the problems with the NHS yesterday. And he says it is extraordinary that, when Boris Johnson was asked about this, he chose to put the phone showing the picture in his pocket. The dossier from the UK-US trade talks showed that the NHS is on the table in those negotiations, he says. He saPeople have a right to know what was going on, he says, and that is why Labour published it. He says people accuse him of politicising the NHS. But setting up the NHS was a political choice, he says. And he says Aneurin Bevan said it would last as long as there were folk around to fight for it. Well, we are folk, and we will fight for it, he says. The Johnson Q&amp;A is over. He only took three questions from journalists. Q: If you are running a minority government after the election, what is your plan B for Brexit? Johnson says it is \u201cvery hard\u201d to see how they can achieve Brexit without a Conservative government with a working majority. Johnson is now taking questions from journalists. Q: Jonathan Ashworth says you are going to win. He\u2019s right, isn\u2019t he? You are home and dry. Johnson says he does not accept that. He says polls can be wrong. Remember what happened in 2017. He claims Ashworth raises serious questions about the security risk Jeremy Corbyn would pose. He claims the tape also shows Labour would block Brexit. Q: What will life be like for towns like Newcastle-under-Lyme under the Tories? Johnson says, as London mayor, he realised some parts of the capital were doing well, and others weren\u2019t. You need to invest, particularly in transport, he says. He says he is obsessed by this issue. He would focus on roads and rail. But also broadband, he says. If you are going to start a business, you need fantastic internet connections. We need full-fibre broadband, he says. Johnson says you also need to give local people the power to do things for themselves. Johnson is now taking questions from JCB employees. Q: If you win, will HS2 happen, and is it what the country needs? Johnson says HS2 is due to cost \u00a388bn. He thinks the cost will rise above \u00a3100bn. He says it is right for a new government to review it. He has commissioned a study. The report will come in after the election. If HS2 can be made to work better .... Johnson tails off. He says, if the report recommends cancelling the plans, he will consider that. He says he is \u201ctemperamentally very much inclined to want to go ahead with a great national project, if we can\u201d. But he is also temperamentally inclined to want value for money. Johnson suggests he is \u201ctemperamentally very much inclined\u201d to carry on with HS2, subject to the findings of the government review. Johnson claims the UK will benefit from Brexit. He cites being able to change animal welfare laws, being able to get rid of the tampon tax, and being able to set up free ports. He says he wants to be able to \u201clevel up\u201d. Talent is evenly distributed, he says, but opportunity isn\u2019t. Johnson says he could talk about his plans for childcare, or his plans to make the UK greener. But there is not much time left. He says we have little time. He has never known such an important election, he says. There are 48 hours to get rid of the roadblock, he says. Johnson claims that Jonathan Ashworth admitted in the private conversation leaked today that Jeremy Corbyn would be a security risk. (Ashworth\u2019s language was not that clear-cut. See 11.44am.) Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says everyone should take the opportunity to drive through the gridlock on Thursday. He claims Labour would increase taxes, to the tune of \u00a32,400 per head. (This Guardian factcheck explains why this claim is not plausible.) Javid says there will be an economic crisis within days if Labour takes power. Such will be the loss in investor confidence there will be a crisis by Christmas. Boris Johnson is due to hold a Q&amp;A with workers at the JCB plant in Staffordshire. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is doing the warm-up speech. He claims Labour\u2019s policies will guarantee an economic crisis. A reader put it to me the other day that the best way to view the Boris Johnson campaign is as an extended picture caption competition. It is tempting to agree, but Johnson\u2019s photo opportunities often end up as ready-made TV metaphors, staged on the assumption, one assumes, that the more obvious they are, the harder it will be for broadcasters to ignore them. This afternoon\u2019s (see 3.09pm) was about the most blatant yet. Johnson is due to explain them in a short speech with these words, which were released in advance overnight by CCHQ. Johnson will say: The stalemate in parliament has held this country back for too long. Instead of concentrating on your priorities, Westminster has been mired in division and deadlock. Politicians have spent so much time shouting at each other and devising ways of wriggling out of Brexit that they have neglected the issues people care about. It\u2019s time to send in the bulldozers and smash through the gridlock. But the problem with metaphors is that they can be open to multiple interpretations. To many viewers, this may not convey quite the impression Johnson intended. 1) Brexit is a destructive force. It does not make anything; it just knocks things down. 2) With Brexit, nothing is quite what it seems. These looked like proper bricks. But they were made of polystyrene. 3) After Johnson got through the Brexit \u201cgridlock\u201d he did not know where to go next and ground to a halt. 4) \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d Johnson did once promise to lie in front of a bulldozer. If you take the view that leaving the EU in January won\u2019t amount to Brexit being done, now the lie is on the front of a bulldozer. I\u2019m in Staffordshire today on the campaign trail with Boris Johnson, where the Tories are really wheeling out the visual metaphors as the campaign comes to an end. We\u2019re at a factory for JCB, the company chaired by the Conservative donor Sir Anthony Bamford. A few minutes ago we were ushered downstairs on to a vast factory floor. After a short wait, the prime minister smashed noisily through a wall of polystyrene bricks with \u201cGRIDLOCK\u201d written on it, at the wheel of a digger. He was then ushered away, as were we: we\u2019re awaiting a Q&amp;A session in a few minutes. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Oliver Milne As the Scottish party leaders prepare for their BBC Scotland debate in Glasgow this evening, both the SNP and the Scottish Tories are pushing their tactical voting messages, while the personalised campaigning against Nicola Sturgeon steps up. In her interview with the Guardian yesterday, Sturgeon noted that \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s a narrative, discussion and consideration around tactical voting in this election that I have not experienced previously\u201d. With the SNP running second in all Scottish Tory seats, she appealed to voters to lend the SNP their votes, adding: \u201cPeople understand that this election is not going to decide the issue of independence.\u201d This morning, Conservative MSPs from Labour backgrounds appealed to current Labour supporters to lend them their votes. Speaking at a campaign event in Bothwell \u2013 part of the SNP-held Lanark and Hamilton East constituency, which the Tories are very confident they can win on Thursday \u2013 Adam Tomkins, the party\u2019s constitutional affairs spokesperson, said: Until I joined the party, I\u2019d never even voted Tory. But I joined because, like so many other people in Scotland I realised that the Scottish Conservatives are the only party dedicated\u2013 come what may\u2013 to protecting Scotland\u2019s place in the United Kingdom. Everyone else runs scared of Nicola Sturgeon. But not us. The Scottish Lib Dems were likewise pushing the message of \u201cmake Nicola Sturgeon think again\u201d at their own campaign event today, underlining how confident pro-union parties are that a focus on the SNP leader herself will galvanise undecideds. My colleague Peter Walker has a judicious take on the Jonathan Ashworth tape. Earlier I said that Labour had released a lengthy dossier, based on information from NHS trusts in England, highlighting risks facing a large number of hospitals. (See 9.20am.) The party claims it shows the NHS is \u201cin crisis and on the brink\u201d. The full document is now available here, on the Labour website. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby Dave Merritt also criticised the way Boris Johnson was using Jack\u2019s death in the London Bridge terror attack to justify his law and order agenda in an article for the Guardian last week. Jeremy Corbyn attracted a large crowd when he spoke at an event in Nelson in Lancashire this morning. Here is some video. In his appearance on the BBC\u2019s Politics Live Jonathan Ashworth also apologised to the Labour party for his comments about the party being on course to lose \u2013 comments that he claimed were part of an attempt to \u201cpsych out\u201d the Tories. (See 11.44am and 12.58pm.) He said: Obviously with the benefit of hindsight I\u2019ve been too clever by half and I look like an idiot as a result of doing it. But I thought I was having a private conversation with someone who I\u2019ve always had conversations with over the years. It\u2019s obviously stupid. I apologise to Labour party members but the reason it has come out today is because the Tories don\u2019t want to be talking about the fact that we\u2019ve had a toddler lying on the floor in a hospital. Asked if he thought Labour would win on Thursday, he replied: \u201cYes.\u201d The presenter, Jo Coburn, asked: \u201cAnd you believe that?\u201d Ashworth replied: \u201cYes.\u201d When he announced his decision to stand down in Tory-held seats last month, Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claimed he was doing so because a video message posted on Twitter by Boris Johnson the previous day meant that he had changed his Brexit plans, and that he was now aiming for a \u201csuper-Canada-plus\u201d trade deal (acceptable to Farage). At his press conference today Farage claimed that Johnson had again changed his Brexit plans, and he said that as a result he would spoil his ballot paper on Thursday, instead of voting Tory. (He lives in a Tory-held constituency, where his own party is not standing.) Farage said: I know it is very rare to have an appearance from Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn but [in the BBC debate] on Friday night, [Johnson] has gone the wrong way. He has stepped back from a Canada-plus-style trade deal and he was talking about his \u2018oven-ready deal\u2019 - it\u2019s going to be put in the oven and ready before Christmas. All I can say is that will lead to many long years of indigestion because we will be trapped inside an international treaty. We have given Michel Barnier the upper hand. Although Farage is now claiming that Johnson has changed Brexit policy twice during the election, in truth Johnson\u2019s policy has not changed at all. The PM has negotiated a new version of the 540-page withdrawal agreement (pdf), which has been published and which would determine the form of the UK\u2019s departure from the UK. He has also published a much shorter political declaration (pdf) which gives some information about the sort of trade deal with the EU that he would want to negotiate next year, although most of the crucial detail remains to be negotiated. What is true, though, is that as the campaign has been going on, Johnson and other Tories have increasingly been suggesting that the fact that he has an \u201coven-ready\u201d withdrawal agreement ready to go (which is true) also means that his eventual UK-EU trade deal is also nearly complete (which is not true at all). Johnson was doing this in the BBC debate on Friday and was doing it again in a campaign Q&amp;A yesterday. It is not clear whether he was being deliberately misleading, or just cavalier with the truth. Partly this is happening because the term \u201cBrexit deal\u201d is ambiguous. Sometimes it is used to refer to the withdrawal agreement, and sometimes it is used to refer to the proposed post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Johnson seems to be exploiting this ambiguity for his own advantage. At a news conference in Westminster Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, urged leave voters to vote tactically at the election and back his party rather than the Conservatives. The Brexit party is not standing in Tory-held seats, but it does hope to win in some Labour seats where Farage thinks the Tories have no chance. He told the press conference: My appeal is to leave voters in those constituencies that have been Labour forever - and will be Labour when you wake up on Friday morning - unless you use your vote tactically and sensibly. And to leavers in those seats I say \u2018Leavers, don\u2019t waste your vote\u2019. Jonathan Ashworth is now saying that when he told his Tory activist friend that Labour was bound to lose the general election (see 11.44am), he was actually just trying to \u201cpsych out\u201d the opposition. He told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live he was speaking to Greig Baker, a Tory activist and old friend who runs a political intelligence agency. Ashworth went on: He was ringing me. I was talking to him. He was saying his sources at CCHQ say Labour\u2019s doing well. I\u2019m doing the old, what Alex Ferguson would do, football manager kind of thing, trying to psych him out, saying: \u2018No, you\u2019re going to win, don\u2019t worry about it,\u2019 because I know he\u2019s an activist in Canterbury, I\u2019m trying to make him complacent. Obviously I look a plonker now. I was a smart Alec - too clever by half. You\u2019re going to say: \u2018Well, you said this about Jeremy, you said that about the Labour party.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m deliberately throwing the Tory attack lines back at him to say this is what we\u2019re getting. Almost 200 reports were made to police about parliamentary candidate safety in less than three weeks during the election campaign, PA Media reports. Around half of the 198 reports made between 15 November and 4 December were serious enough to be treated as crimes, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) told the news agency. Most of the incidents were allegations of malicious communications online. There were also reports of criminal damage and harassment. As PA reports, there were three reports of assaults against campaign volunteers but none against candidates and the incidents were not thought to be serious. A third of reports came from campaign volunteers and staff, with the remainder coming from candidates themselves, the NPCC said. The body said it had not seen trends of abuse being directed against any one particular party. Just in case Jonathan Ashworth\u2019s day could not get any worse, he has now had an endorsement from the Tory cabinet minister Michael Gove. A colleague has just asked if Ashworth is one of the possible contenders to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the event of Labour losing the election. My reply? Until today, possibly, but probably not any more ... A false online story that the photograph of an ill boy lying on the floor of Leeds General infirmary was staged came from a hacked account, according to the medical secretary whose name was attached to the initial post. My colleague Alex Hern has the story. Here are extracts from what Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, says in the leaked tape of a conversation he had recently with a Tory activist whom he considered a longstanding friend. Ashworth has not disputed the accuracy of the tape, although he claims that he was not being sincere, that he was just engaged in \u201cbanter\u201d, and that he was just humouring an opponent. (See 11.02am.) If you listen to the tape in full, it certainly doesn\u2019t sound as if Ashworth was making it all up just to humour his friend. But perhaps he\u2019s a terrific actor. You can listen to it here and come to your own view. Here the main points Ashworth makes. Ashworth says the outlook is \u201cabysmal\u201d for Labour in some parts of the country and that he expects the party to lose the election. He repeatedly says he expects Boris Johnson to win, and he does not seem to be in any doubt about this at all. He says: Outside of the city seats, if you are in small town midlands and north, it\u2019s abysmal out there. They don\u2019t like [Boris] Johnson, but they can\u2019t stand [Jeremy] Corbyn and they think Labour\u2019s blocked Brexit. I don\u2019t think their long-term gains for the Tory party. But I can well see them going Tory [at] this election and if Labour ever got its act together they presumably would fall back ... I think [amongst] middle-class graduates, remainy people, Labour is probably doing well, and the Lib Dems are probably doing well, but not in big enough numbers to deny the Tories a majority. And, at another point, he says: I just can\u2019t see how you [ie, the Tories] don\u2019t have a majority, to be honest. He says the electoral map has turned \u201ctopsy-turvy\u201d, with both main parties likely to win in unexpected places. Labour could win Canterbury, a former Tory seat it won unexpectedly in 2017, he says. But it could lose Bolsover, a former safe Labour seat represented by Dennis Skinner. Ashworth says: The electoral map is going topsy-turvy because of Brexit, and because of Corbyn. The question is for Labour, if it gets itself a half-decent leader next time round, whether it can reverse and regain its traditional heartland seats. Ashworth says the situation for Labour is \u201cdire\u201d in its heartland seats. In places like Mansfield and Ashfield, it\u2019s dire for the Labour party up there, these traditional areas. He says \u201cthe combination of Corbyn and Brexit\u201d is to blame for the \u201cawful\u201d problems Labour candidates are having in some areas. He says Johnson\u2019s \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 message is effective. Talking about why Johnson is picking up support, Ashworth says: It\u2019s a combination of those who want Brexit, the leavers, and others, who probably voted for remain or maybe weren\u2019t that bothered, but are now just sick to death of it and want it done and put away. And they think that he\u2019ll be the person who just gets it done. He says Johnson would have to \u201cmassively fuck it up\u201d to lose. He says: Johnson and CCHQ would have to massively fuck it up in the last week [to lose the election. Ashworth declines to express confidence in how Corbyn would perform as prime minister. Asked if he would be as bad as people like his Tory friend expect, Ashworth pauses for a long time before replying \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Ashworth hints that officials in No 10 might have some security concerns about Corbyn. In response to the question about what Corbyn would be like in office, Ashworth says: On the security stuff, I worked in No 10. I think the machine will pretty quickly move to safeguard security things - I mean the civil service machine. But he also stresses that he does not expect Corbyn to become PM. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen. I can\u2019t see it happening,\u201d he says. He says Labour MPs opposed to Corbyn made a mistake in 2016 when they tried to depose him too early. Asked about what Labour MPs might do to get rid of Corbyn, he says: We fucked it up. We fucked it up in 2016 when we went too early. People like me were internally saying \u2018this isn\u2019t the right moment\u2019 but I got ignored. Ashworth suggests Corbyn could be replaced quite quickly after an election defeat. Asked how long it might take for the party to replace him, he replies: I think things can change quickly. The UK economy has stagnated in October, and also over the last quarter, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports. He says: On an annual basis, the economy only grew by 0.7% over the last year \u2013 the weakest since March 2012, the ONS says. Graeme has more on his business live blog here. Here are more quotes from what Jonathan Ashworth told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme about the tape recording of him saying Labour would lose, which was leaked to the Guido Fawkes website. (See 10.30am.) He said: We\u2019re having banter with each other \u2013 we\u2019re joking around. No, I don\u2019t mean it, because I\u2019m joking around with my mate because he\u2019s a Tory ... If you leak it to Guido Fawkes of course it makes me look like a right plonker, but its not what I mean when I\u2019m winding up a friend \u2013 I\u2019m trying to sort of pull his leg a bit. Asked if he thought Jeremy Corbyn was a threat to national security, Ashworth replied: No, of course I don\u2019t \u2026 I\u2019m joshing around with somebody who I thought was an old friend, who has now leaked it to Guido Fawkes, an old friend who I\u2019ve known for many years. He\u2019s a Tory and we\u2019ve always had a bit of banter together \u2026 I\u2019m winding him up, I\u2019m teasing him, he\u2019s been winding me up saying \u2018oh, everyone at CCHQ thinks it\u2019s going to be really close, Corbyn\u2019s going to win\u2019 and all this sort of stuff. James Cleverly, the Conservative party chair, has just put out this statement about the Ashworth tape. (See 10.30am.) He said: This is an honest and truly devastating assessment of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership by one of his most trusted election lieutenants. He admits that Labour has blocked Brexit and that is why voters \u2018can\u2019t stand Corbyn\u2019. If even Corbyn\u2019s closest political allies think he is unfit to be prime minister, why on earth should voters be expected to put their trust in him and them? Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has dismissed as \u201cbanter\u201d a tape that has been leaked to the Guido Fawkes website that shows him saying Labour will lose the election. The website, which strongly backs Boris Johnson, has released an 11-minute tape of a conversation. It\u2019s here. On the tape, which seems to have been recorded early last week, just before President Trump\u2019s visit to the UK, Ashworth can be heard repeatedly saying he does not expect Labour to win the election. He says: I just can\u2019t see it happening. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me \u2013 for sake of argument \u2013 we held Canterbury because of sort of middle-class, Guardian-reading people, but then the Tories take Bolsover off of Labour it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. The electoral map has being going topsy-turvy because of Brexit and Corbyn. In the recording Ashworth also says Jeremy Corbyn is a serious problem for Labour, hints that officials in No 10 might have security concerns about him, and argues that Corbyn\u2019s critics in the parliamentary Labour party made a mistake in 2016 because they launched the attempt to get rid of him too soon. Ashworth has just been on Victoria Derbyshire\u2019s show on the BBC. He told her that it was a recording of a conversation he had had with Greig Baker, a Tory activist whom he had considered a friend. They had travelled around the US together many years ago, he said. Ashworth said he was \u201cjoshing\u201d with Baker when he spoke about Labour losing, as you would if you were trying to reassure someone worried their football team might lose. He said: I\u2019m winding him up - I\u2019m joshing with him. It\u2019s banter ... I\u2019m joking around with my mate. Ashworth said he was disappointed he had been betrayed by someone he considered a friend, and he accepted that this had made him look foolish. It makes me look like a right plonker. He also insisted that he did not see Corbyn as a threat to national security. Jeremy Corbyn has been speaking at a Labour rally in Bolton. He told activists that they had until Thursday night \u201cto save the NHS\u201d. He said: We have now got until Thursday night to win this election. Thursday night to save the NHS. Thursday night to end child poverty in Britain. Thursday night to end homelessness in Britain. Thursday night to build the houses that we need. Thursday night to get a government you can trust that will actually represent people. So when Boris Johnson denied there was talks with the USA on a trade deal which would involve our NHS, then the documents came out in a redacted form and then the full documents came out which showed that\u2019s exactly what they had been discussing for two whole years - how to hand over our public services to American corporations to run them. As if \u00a310bn of privatisation in the NHS already is not bad enough, this would be much, much worse. We will not sell our NHS to anybody. It is simply not for sale. Jeremy Corbyn gave a longish interview to BBC Breakfast this morning. We\u2019ve quoted some of it already. (See 8.20am.) Here are some more lines. Corbyn played down suggestions that his leadership was a problem for Labour, stressing that this was not a presidential election. When it was put to him that Labour candidates weren\u2019t putting him on their leaflets because he was unpopular, he replied: It\u2019s not a presidential election, it\u2019s a parliamentary election in which we elect members of parliament. I\u2019m the leader of the Labour party and I\u2019m very proud to have that position. He said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d had the stamina to serve a full five-year term as PM. When it was put to him that, at 70, he would be the oldest prime minister to enter Downing Street for more than a century, he said: I\u2019m very healthy, very fit and very active and I\u2019ve travelled more than any other party leader in this election, I\u2019ve attended more events than any other party leader in this election, and I\u2019ve still not finished yet \u2013 we\u2019ve got another two days to go, and I\u2019ll be out on the road the whole time \u2013 right up till 10 o\u2019clock on Thursday night. He claimed the NHS would not be forced to adopt a four-day working week. Asked about Labour\u2019s plans to, over a decade, reduce the average working week to 32 hours, and whether this would be imposed on the NHS, he said: It\u2019s not going to be forced on the NHS. The whole point is that, over a period, increases in productivity will lead to lower working time hours, but it\u2019s not going to be forced on the NHS. Corbyn said the change would be funded \u201cthrough productivity in all industries and places of work\u201d. He insisted Labour\u2019s plans for the NHS were credible. When it was put to him that the Royal College of Physicians has said NHS plans in the manifestos from both main parties are not credible, Corbyn replied: Well, I disagree. Our plans are completely credible. We\u2019ve put forward a spending plan which will, I believe, give sufficient resources to the NHS, will also properly fund the maintenance issues, and of course, on a wider level, the education issues surrounding nurse training, doctor training, and the funding that goes behind that. Because we have 40,000 nurse vacancies in the NHS, we have buildings crumbling, we have very expensive deals on which some of those places were built, and we have privatisation within the NHS which doesn\u2019t fit in often with the NHS culture. Overnight the Labour party has released a dossier of evidence that it says shows the NHS is \u201cin crisis and on the brink\u201d. The information comes from board papers from NHS trusts in England. Those trusts have to classify the risks they face. Here are some examples of risks relating to staffing. In Doncaster and Bassetlaw, there is an extreme risk to staffing of registered children\u2019s nurses on two different sites, which could lead to children being harmed and delays to treatment. In Newcastle upon Tyne there is an extreme risk of a shortage of radiologists affecting breast cancer screening. In Mid-Cheshire, there are extreme risks: that a patient experiencing a cardiac event will be missed because of nursing shortages; of major harm to rheumatology patients after getting inappropriate care because of a shortage of consultants; and to dependent respiratory patients, either due to nursing shortages or because there are too few beds. At Southport and Ormskirk hospital trust, there is a catastrophic risk of inadequate staffing levels in the anaesthetic department due to burn out, sickness, annual leave or lack of sufficiently cheap agency staff. This could affect the safety of emergency, ICU and maternity departments, and could mean that A&amp;E would be closed to high-risk patients, including children. There are more details in the Labour press release. There is also a more detailed dossier, but that does not seem to be online. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: These shocking reports reveal an NHS in crisis and on the brink. It is one thing for clinicians and managers to say what needs fixing, but we need a Labour government that will crack on and do it. Here is Love Actually star Hugh Grant on the Conservative party\u2019s parody video released last night. (See 6.50am.) On the Today programme this morning Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, said Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan would take the UK into \u201cyears of negotiation\u201d. It would not amount to getting Brexit done, he claimed. I do believe that, unless we get a Brexit party voice in the House of Commons, we are not going to get a realistic Brexit because he\u2019ll push through this new EU treaty as it is. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Damien Gayle. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, has also given an interview to BBC Breakfast this morning defending Boris Johnson\u2019s actions yesterday when he tried to avoid commenting on the photograph of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr having to sleep on a hospital floor. When it was put to Buckland that the PM\u2019s response was awkward to watch, Buckland did not accept that. He said: Elections are really difficult things. Things will happen in elections, unpredictable events. I don\u2019t think he was forced into it. I think when he looked at it, the reaction was clear and unforced and natural, and the apology was forthcoming and fulsome. Jeremy Corbyn is appearing on the sofa on BBC Breakfast. The first topic of conversation is the NHS. He starts off defending the use of the image of Jack Williment-Barr to make a political point about the NHS. It\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happening in our NHS and it\u2019s obviously awful for that little boy and the family and the way that they were treated, but it does say something about our NHS that this would happen ... It\u2019s a serious issue, it\u2019s a political issue about how we fund the NHS. Jon Ashworth, the shadow health and care secretary, has defended using the picture of Jack Williment-Barr sleeping on the hospital floor, after the boy\u2019s mother reportedly wrote to the press regulator complaining about the use of her son\u2019s image. Ashworth insisted that he and Labour were not using Jack as a political football. Indeed, Ashworth insisted, his heart went out to Jack, and baby Lily (on the front of today\u2019s Mirror), and to the family of the \u201c12-year-old child waiting 57 hours - 57 hours - in an A&amp;E in Essex, for a very specialist bed\u201d. I, like any parent, because I\u2019ve got two young children, would be furious, livid, angry, fighting like a lion for my child who had been let down after years of cutbacks in our health service. No, not using them for political capital at all, Ashworth insisted after it was pointed out he had tweeted Jack\u2019s picture, and Jeremy Corbyn had held it up at a rally. Unfortunately, across the country, these are not one-off events. We have seen in this election campaign other images of elderly people literally wasting away on trolleys in corridors for hours and hours, because they simply can\u2019t get a bed. According to Ashworth, 600,000 people were left waiting on a trolley for a bed last year, while 17,000 beds had been cut from hospitals by the Conservatives - cuts he pledged to reverse if he became health secretary. Hi there, Damien Gayle taking over in London now, covering the morning\u2019s political developments until Andrew Sparrow\u2019s had his Weetabix. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, was just speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, attempting more or less to explain away what political observers have described as the worst day so far for the Conservative election campaign. Asked about Johnson\u2019s fumbling response to the photo of Jack Williment-Barr sleeping on the floor of Leeds General infirmary, Buckland said: Politics and general elections, despite the best efforts of political parties, can be unpredictable, and that particularly story was one of those occasions where everybody was dealing with a very difficult situation. The child\u2019s family want privacy, Buckland insisted. In the meantime, general elections ought to be fought \u201con the high ground, the big issues\u201d rather than \u201cwho said what to who\u201d, he chastised. Suggestions that Jack was a symbol of Tory failure to care for the National Health Service were \u201crather insulting to all the hard-working people in our NHS\u201d, Buckland said. If only the Conservatives could have a chance to implement their \u201ctargeted and structured programme\u201d, everything would be fine. Answering for Johnson\u2019s bizarre pocketing of a television reporter\u2019s phone to avoid looking at Jack\u2019s picture, Buckland gave a kind of defence of temporary delirium: I think that in all the hundreds of interviews that the prime minister has done or indeed a lot of us have done, there will come moments where you\u2019re suddenly sprung with something and it is difficult to know what it is. He saved his strongest words for the rowdy Labour activists outside Leeds General, who Conservative press office had claimed assaulted Matt Hancock\u2019s adviser. The claims, widely reported by senior journalists briefed by senior Tory sources, were quickly disproved by a video of the incident. But, Buckland said: What I saw was a very confusing scene of public disorder, people who had clearly organised themselves to come along, create trouble and mischief, the sort of disorderly conduct, I\u2019m afraid, from the left, that we have seen in this campaign. It\u2019s not a way to conduct civilised politics. People were shouting and gesticulating towards Matt Hancock and his team. So there you go. Boris Johnson has parodied what is perhaps the most famous (and most divisive) scene in Love Actually, in a video he has called Brexit, actually. It\u2019s pretty painful to watch. Awkwardly, it\u2019s also not even an original parody. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who was elected as Labour MP for Tooting, did her own version of the Love Actually scene for a campaign advertisement more than a fortnight ago. She is very unimpressed with the fact, in her words, \u201cBoris Johnson has copied my #ElectionActually video.\u201d Her version is below. There will be a flurry of campaigning today as the leaders criss-cross the country in a last-minute bid to win votes. Jeremy Corbyn, who will start his day in the north-west before travelling to Glasgow, has told the Guardian he feels confident as the election campaign enters its final days, saying he thought Labour had \u201cgot the message out\u201d across the six-week campaign. However, John Crace was at Corbyn\u2019s rally in Bristol yesterday, which he says felt less like the first gig of The Comeback Tour and more like The Long Goodbye. The day ahead Busy days all around as party leaders sprint to the finish line. Boris Johnson will start his day in the Midlands with a press conference before travelling up to north-west England in the evening. The Tory leader is expected to head to Manchester for a rally on Tuesday night, via a stop in north Wales to visit businesses. Jeremy Corbyn will start his day in north-west England at a library before visiting a primary school and a pub in the region, before heading to Glasgow. The Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson will spend the day in the south-west, canvassing in the area and attending a rally in Somerset. Nigel Farage will be in London, where he is expected to hold a Brexit party press conference. The Green party is also staying in London, where it will host an event announcing policies to help students with economic issues. Good morning, we\u2019re just two days out from the election and the Conservatives are reeling after what was probably their worst day of the campaign yesterday. The week did not get off to a great start for the prime minister. Yesterday, Johnson woke up to a photograph of a four-year-old boy being treated on a hospital floor because of a lack of beds on the front page of the Mirror, which later in the day he repeatedly refused on camera to look at, before pocketing the phone of the reporter who tried to show it to him. Marina Hyde on this episode is as brutally funny as you might expect. Then Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was dispatched to Leeds General infirmary in an effort to show that the party was taking the case seriously. Johnson\u2019s team wrongly briefing that a Tory aide was \u201cpunched\u201d outside the hospital by a leftwing activist, in what was interpreted as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the bad news day the Tories were having. The claims quickly turned out to be untrue when video footage showed that the adviser was accidentally brushed in the face and they have now been accused of \u201clying and cheating\u201d to distract attention from their bad day. Pressure will stay on the Tories today as Jo Swinson accuses Boris Johnson of putting EU citizens in the UK at risk of abuse and hate crimes through a Vote Leave-style \u201cdog whistle\u201d approach to immigration. On a campaign trip to Bath on Tuesday, a seat held by her party, Swinson will condemn the prime minister for his language towards EU citizens, such as saying that too many of them felt able to \u201ctreat the UK as if it\u2019s part of their own country\u201d. Thanks for joining us for the last days of this crazy campaign ride.",

The country\u2019s future direction, its place in the world and even its territorial integrity are all at stake, primarily because this is a decisive election for Brexit. The choice is stark. The next prime minister is going to be either Boris Johnson, who is focused on \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d whatever the consequences, or Jeremy Corbyn, who with a Labour-led government will try to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-to-slap-11bn-tax-on-oil-and-gas-firms-to-fund-green-plan\">remodel society</a> with a programme of nationalisation and public spending.</p> \n<p>Both main parties are offering heretical gambles against the tenets of mainstream thinking. Both are asking voters to join their revolts. Both have also become less pluralistic and more sectarian. Many traditional Conservative and Labour voters have been estranged from their parties. A sourly introspective and inward-looking campaign mood is further curdled by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50726500\">political misinformation</a>. There is still a deep longing for community, but how to give meaning to it without giving way to exclusion or xenophobia remains unresolved. A Tory decade of self-defeating austerity has produced average wages lower than in 2008. Tent cities and <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/uk-now-more-foodbanks-mcdonalds-21060125\">food banks</a> have become ubiquitous. Despite the existential threat of the climate emergency, the UK is not on track to meet our carbon dioxide reduction targets.</p> \n<p>A different electoral system and a more deliberative politics, allowing society\u2019s losers as well as winners to buy into political decisions, might have helped. The Guardian has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/08/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-the-government-has-failed-its-time-to-go-back-to-the-people\">urged</a> such an approach as part of a solution to Brexit. Instead, a struggle for power within both the main parties has shaped an election in which many wish they faced better choices. Britain needs modern parties to correspond to the range of people\u2019s lives and concerns.

In this era of Donald Trump, Britain\u2019s parties have sought to channel voters\u2019 indignation rather than hear their grievances. Mr Johnson uses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/campaigners-attack-boris-johnson-for-eu-nationals-remarks\">conservative social positions</a> to draw poor voters into betraying their own economic interests.

He aims to strike a future trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020; this is only possible if he agrees to the EU\u2019s terms. Yet a significant part of the Tory party craves a small-state, deregulated Britain to compete with the EU. The more regulatory divergence the government wants, the harder it will be to negotiate an ambitious deal and the longer it will take to do so. If Britain follows Mr Johnson, it will leave without a deal, which would be <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/nodeal-brexit-will-hit-uk-economy-hardest-and-make-uk-debt-skyrocket-063942612.html\">considerably worse</a> for the economy than a Corbyn-led government.</p> \n<p>Mr Corbyn has had a low-key and troubled campaign.

Labour has good ideas. But it may have overwhelmed voters with its gigantic offer. Labour\u2019s manifesto seeks to remove the market from as many aspects of life as possible and wants to curtail the power of the mega-rich. It plans to build 100,000 council homes a year.

The country would be the better for that. But Mr Corbyn\u2019s factionalism, his lack of a campaign narrative and his repeated overpromising has seen him struggle to persuade enough voters his plan is achievable. Mr Corbyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/106687/jeremy-corbyn-most-unpopular\">own unpopularity</a> could also scupper Labour in this election.

Despite our misgivings, we believe that a vote for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour party</a> offers the best hope for the country. A Labour-led government seems only possible with the support of parties that back its policy on a second referendum on Europe.

      "bodyText": "Britain has not faced a more critical election in decades than the one it faces on Thursday. The country\u2019s future direction, its place in the world and even its territorial integrity are all at stake, primarily because this is a decisive election for Brexit. The choice is stark. The next prime minister is going to be either Boris Johnson, who is focused on \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d whatever the consequences, or Jeremy Corbyn, who with a Labour-led government will try to remodel society with a programme of nationalisation and public spending. Both main parties are offering heretical gambles against the tenets of mainstream thinking. Both are asking voters to join their revolts. Both have also become less pluralistic and more sectarian. Many traditional Conservative and Labour voters have been estranged from their parties. A sourly introspective and inward-looking campaign mood is further curdled by political misinformation. There is still a deep longing for community, but how to give meaning to it without giving way to exclusion or xenophobia remains unresolved. A Tory decade of self-defeating austerity has produced average wages lower than in 2008. Tent cities and food banks have become ubiquitous. Despite the existential threat of the climate emergency, the UK is not on track to meet our carbon dioxide reduction targets. A different electoral system and a more deliberative politics, allowing society\u2019s losers as well as winners to buy into political decisions, might have helped. The Guardian has urged such an approach as part of a solution to Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson does not look like a prime minister who believes he is just about to lose the office he has coveted since boyhood. Brandishing a giant cod and joking with fishmongers, he is in his campaign comfort zone. It is the mode of the Vote Leave tour bus: eye-catching photo ops, a snappy slogan and informal stump speeches that play fast and loose with the facts about Brexit. The scene is Grimsby fish market, three days before the country will decide whether to grant Johnson another five years in power or cut him loose after just six months in No 10. The prime minister certainly appeared to be relaxed. But his advisers and many Tory MPs who remember their nightmare of 2017 are still anything but. One senior aide says he is \u201cwaking up in a cold sweat every night\u201d at the thought that a hung parliament is a very real possibility. \u201cI walked into CCHQ on election night in 2017 and was being told we were on course for a 60-seat majority. So excuse me if I\u2019m not getting overexcited yet.\u201d Their biggest fear has been the possibility of a game-changing gaffe in the last 100 hours before voters go to the polls. Johnson has been on-message ever since he stumbled over the response to floods in the north of England at the beginning of the campaign. But, right on cue, the prime minister delivers the most damaging blunder of his campaign so far, by refusing to look at a picture of a sick boy sleeping on the floor of Leeds hospital and pocketing the phone of a journalist who tried to show it to him. The moment, swiftly followed by a furore over claims that a Tory adviser had been hit which subsequently turned out to be false, has threatened to derail what had essentially been a \u201csafety-first\u201d campaign. Until now, it has followed all the hallmarks of Sir Lynton Crosby, Johnson\u2019s friend and election guru who helped with both his mayoral campaigns and the last two Tory election efforts. The Tories insist that Crosby, who won a majority for David Cameron and helped lose one for May, is not calling the shots behind the scenes. Instead, the man in charge is Isaac Levido, Crosby\u2019s 35-year-old protege. But Levido is certainly running an extremely Crosbyesque operation \u2013 one simple slogan, hammered home again and again until voters can repeat it in their sleep, combined with a boring manifesto that seeks to avoid any controversial policies. There is some relief among Tory candidates that the team in charge this time is vastly different from two years ago, when Theresa May\u2019s advisers \u2013 Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill \u2013 were at loggerheads with Crosby. Insiders say there is barely anyone over 45 in the war room at Matthew Parker Street in Westminster and consultants from the private sector rather than lifelong Tory party apparatchiks are running the show. Surrounding Levido on the \u201cpod of power\u201d in the centre of the room are Paul Stephenson, the former comms director of Vote Leave, who now runs a successful strategic consultancy, and Michael Brooks, the party\u2019s pollster. Two New Zealanders in their mid-20s \u2013 Sean Topham and Ben Guerin \u2013 are the digital strategists. Previously the subject of controversy over their work on a Facebook propaganda network when they were employed for Crosby\u2019s CTF Partners, they are talked of in reverential terms by non tech-savvy Tories. \u201cThe Kiwis\u201d, as they are known, are responsible for viral content designed to rival Labour and Momentum\u2019s slick and shareable videos. The whole group are working long days in the crowded HQ, with senior staff starting with a meeting at 5.40am and juniors doing shifts from 6am till 8pm and 8am till 10pm. Hot dinner from a local deli \u2013 lasagne, chicken hotpot, Mediterranean vegetables \u2013 is provided each evening with supermarket booze to keep them going. The consensus among Tory insiders is that the campaign is a tighter ship but also marked by a new willingness to resort to sneakier methods and disinformation. First there was the cutting of a video of Keir Starmer to falsely suggest he was clueless, then there was the decision to rebrand the Conservative HQ Twitter feed as FactcheckUK during a television debate, implying it was an independent monitoring authority. While the personnel, atmosphere and tactics in CCHQ have changed, some Tory candidates are concerned that the overarching geographical strategy has not. For all their attempts to avoid the mistakes and assumptions of 2017, Johnson\u2019s campaign is going after the very same leave voters in the north of England and Wales that May failed to woo in sufficient numbers. While Johnson has been visiting some Tory-held constituencies to shore up MP candidates in danger, such as Chingford, last held by Iain Duncan Smith, the target seats \u2013 Bishop Auckland, Darlington, Workington and Wrexham \u2013 have not been blue for the best part of a century, if ever. It has seen a trail of rightwing politicians trying to woo its Eurosceptic voters in the past decade. David Cameron came here in 2010 declaring he was going \u201call out\u201d for a win, and Nigel Farage, then of Ukip, traipsed around with a bemused Joey Essex in tow in 2015, making it into a three-way battle. Theresa May nearly visited in 2017 but was told Scunthorpe was more winnable and diverted \u2013 she later returned to give a keynote speech earlier this year pleading with MPs to back her Brexit deal. And yet the seat of Great Grimsby has so far remained resolutely Labour, having been so since 1935. At the fish market, there are a few fishmongers who suggest that the seat could be turning in the Tories\u2019 favour. One wholesaler, 39-year-old Adam Leggett, says he did not used to vote but he is now backing Johnson. He argues that \u201cBoris seems like a normal working class guy, he\u2019ll get my vote\u201d. Undeterred when reminded of the prime minister\u2019s background, he says: \u201cLike you say he went to Eton. But have any prime ministers not been to public school?

Top stories In the final week of the election campaign, the last leaders\u2019 head-to-head debate was widely judged a score draw, with Boris Johnson seen as \u201cboring but effective\u201d and Jeremy Corbyn confident and measured. But few thought it would swing the polls. As Donald Trump arrived in the UK for a Nato summit and denied that the US was remotely interested in the NHS, the Labour leader piled pressure on the prime minister over the status of the health service in any post-Brexit trade deal negotiations. Johnson, meanwhile, refused to rule out coming out of the EU on WTO terms (a no-deal Brexit) next year after the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d right to keep a no-deal outcome on the table. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, said much the same. On the EU side, the outgoing president of the European council, Donald Tusk, called Brexit \u201cone of the most spectacular mistakes\u201d in the history of the EU, and the bloc distanced itself from Johnson\u2019s rushed 11-month timetable for a post-Brexit trade deal. In a tricky week for the government, John Major backed three ex-Tory independents; the UK diplomat explaining Brexit to the US resigned because she was no longer prepared to \u201cpeddle half-truths\u201d; and a leaked Treasury document suggested the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland would be far greater than the prime minister has claimed.

That old populist template casting honest working people as being deceived by \u201cthe elite\u201d echoes down the centuries from the far right. Already hard-pressed seats suffer from 10 years of lost public jobs, investment and services, yet Johnson urges them to blame not entitled Etonians but Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/corbyn-launches-final-election-push-to-deny-tories-a-majority\" title=\"\">great betrayal</a> orchestrated from Islington by politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the economy tanks due to his Brexit blunders he will distract attention on to foreign \u201cenemies\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This old script worked for Mussolini as for Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro. It worked for Donald Trump, and, across Europe, for Silvio Berlusconi, Matteo Salvini, Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski. Never mind if the messengers are hyper-elite metropolitans or kleptocrat billionaires: the trick works because they all use the same tin-opener \u2013 gut nativist \u201cbuild the wall\u201d, us-and-them fear of foreigners. The EU stands for that foreigner in Johnson\u2019s refrain: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/uk-regions/england/north-east/news/108444/boris-johnson-embarks-blitz-labour-held-marginals\" title=\"\">End uncontrolled and unlimited immigration</a> from the EU, take back control from an unelected elite in Brussels.\u201d He tells Sky News he will no longer let EU migrants \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/boris-johnson-eu-migrants-immigration-britain-general-election-a9238941.html\" title=\"\">treat the UK as if it\u2019s part of their country</a>\u201d \u2013 a sinister threat.</p> <p>If the UK gives him a majority, let no one pretend they didn\u2019t know what he was about. The music is so familiar, we recognise these old Enoch Powell tunes. If some shrug it off as what politicians say to get elected, it\u2019s not. Powell was thrown out of his party, too out of step; yet Johnson has expelled those who won\u2019t sign up to his new Powellism.</p> <p>The short and vague Tory manifesto may make some believe that, beyond Brexit, they will act like traditional Tories. Johnson\u2019s hard-hearted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/refuses-to-look-at-picture-of-boy-forced-to-sleep-on-hospital-floor\" title=\"\">refusal to express pity</a> for a child forced to sleep on a hospital floor is just normal Toryism. But think again, for this is no laissez-faire prospectus. Turn to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/06/tories-johnson-scary-manifesto-scrutiny-safari-park\" title=\"\">the section on page 48</a>, Protect our Democracy, sinuous and dark in tone: \u201cOne of the strengths of the UK\u2019s constitution is its ability to evolve \u2013 as times have changed, so have parliament, government and the judiciary.\u201d What kind of \u201cevolution\u201d? One that suits Tory electoral interests: gerrymandering boundaries, rejecting proportional representation and making it harder for non-Tories to vote. Poorer renters and students on the move, those without passports or driving licences, will be deterred by needing ID at polling stations. Curbing postal votes harms Labour voters most. Expats will get the vote, but long-resident tax-paying EU citizens are denied.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the threat: \u201cAfter Brexit we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution,\u201d the manifesto says, to \u201cupdate the Human Rights Act and administrative law to ensure that there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government\u201d. That \u201cupdating\u201d means leaving the European convention on human rights, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2017/feb/19/letters-arts-in-schools-need-defending\" title=\"\">us alone with Belarus</a>. Johnson, free from those restrictions, will unpick \u201cthe relationship between the government, parliament and the courts; the functioning of the royal prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary people\u201d. Judicial review, the citizen\u2019s guarantee against overmighty government, will be stopped from being \u201cabused to conduct politics by another means\u201d.</p> <p>Be very afraid, as Johnson takes revenge on the legal system, on remainers, on human rights and on any democratic aggravations that stand in his way. We saw how fast his people moved to threaten to \u201creview\u201d Channel 4\u2019s licence when it empty-chaired him for refusing its climate debate. Ofcom backed C4: what price will it pay?</p> <p>The BBC expects the worst after Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/boris-johnson-looking-at-abolishing-tv-licence-fee-for-bbc\" title=\"\">assault yesterday on the licence fee</a>. His constitutional review is a dire prospect from the man who illegally shut down parliament for five weeks. Reviewing \u201cthe functioning of the royal prerogative\u201d would be to grant himself more of those arbitrary powers.</p> <p>The Queen is useless as protection because she is unelected \u2013 elected presidents with written constitutions defend against government diktat \u2013 so she can only uphold whatever an elected parliament ordains. And expect no restraint from within his party. Johnson expelled all defenders of rights: instead we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/03/dominic-raab-harry-dunn-anne-sacoolas-foreign-office\" title=\"\">Dominic Raab</a>, Priti Patel, Liz Truss \u2013 his cabinet of horrors \u2013 with every MP blood-sworn to him personally.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/09/wins-tories-future-boris-johnson-victory-conservatism\">Whoever wins this week, the Tories should worry about their future | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some think the failure of Corbyn to instantly expel all leftist purveyors of antisemitic filth would normally be a reason to deny Labour a vote. But these are not normal times. Behind the jovial bluster, Johnson is the greatest threat seen in our lifetimes. When the economy tanks due to his Brexit blunders he will do what the far right always does, distracting attention on to foreign \u201cenemies\u201d, using crude racism and attacks on \u201celite\u201d judges, civil servants or any upholder of rights.</p> <p>Every Labour campaign is labelled by Tories as a national \u201cdanger\u201d \u2013 even Tony Blair in 1997 faced \u201cNew Labour, New Danger\u201d posters. There was no \u201cdanger\u201d but much hope in John McDonnell\u2019s \u201cfirst 100 days\u201d plan set out yesterday: the only risk is to the wealth of those who did spectacularly well in this stagnant decade. However, there is no chance of a Labour majority, or of imposing reckless legislation without consultation as majority governments do. Far better, in plural societies, for a minority government to work with progressive parties, obliged to consult and agree.</p> <p>The real bone-chilling danger comes from the impulsive, dictatorial, egotistical, absolute power of Boris Johnson unchained. But if <em>every</em> anti-Johnson, anti-Brexiter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/08/observer-view-on-general-election-and-who-to-vote-for\" title=\"\">votes tactically against him</a>, he can still be stopped.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is ending his despicable campaign with a \u201cblitz\u201d through Labour seats from Grimsby to Wrexham. Listen with fear to his message: he has distilled it down to pure Faragism, reprising the spirit of Vote Leave\u2019s \u201cbreaking point\u201d poster and \u201c70m Turks\u201d. His party\u2019s veins flow with Brexit party poison. In erstwhile Labour-land, Brexit is the tin-opener that gives Conservatives a chance, not with dog-whistle but foghorn. That old populist template casting honest working people as being deceived by \u201cthe elite\u201d echoes down the centuries from the far right. Already hard-pressed seats suffer from 10 years of lost public jobs, investment and services, yet Johnson urges them to blame not entitled Etonians but Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u201cgreat betrayal orchestrated from Islington by politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes\u201d. This old script worked for Mussolini as for Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro. It worked for Donald Trump, and, across Europe, for Silvio Berlusconi, Matteo Salvini, Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski. Never mind if the messengers are hyper-elite metropolitans or kleptocrat billionaires: the trick works because they all use the same tin-opener \u2013 gut nativist \u201cbuild the wall\u201d, us-and-them fear of foreigners. The EU stands for that foreigner in Johnson\u2019s refrain: \u201cEnd uncontrolled and unlimited immigration from the EU, take back control from an unelected elite in Brussels.\u201d He tells Sky News he will no longer let EU migrants \u201ctreat the UK as if it\u2019s part of their country\u201d \u2013 a sinister threat. If the UK gives him a majority, let no one pretend they didn\u2019t know what he was about. The music is so familiar, we recognise these old Enoch Powell tunes. If some shrug it off as what politicians say to get elected, it\u2019s not. Powell was thrown out of his party, too out of step; yet Johnson has expelled those who won\u2019t sign up to his new Powellism. The short and vague Tory manifesto may make some believe that, beyond Brexit, they will act like traditional Tories. Johnson\u2019s hard-hearted refusal to express pity for a child forced to sleep on a hospital floor is just normal Toryism. But think again, for this is no laissez-faire prospectus. Turn to the section on page 48, Protect our Democracy, sinuous and dark in tone: \u201cOne of the strengths of the UK\u2019s constitution is its ability to evolve \u2013 as times have changed, so have parliament, government and the judiciary.\u201d What kind of \u201cevolution\u201d? One that suits Tory electoral interests: gerrymandering boundaries, rejecting proportional representation and making it harder for non-Tories to vote. Poorer renters and students on the move, those without passports or driving licences, will be deterred by needing ID at polling stations. Curbing postal votes harms Labour voters most. Expats will get the vote, but long-resident tax-paying EU citizens are denied. Here\u2019s the threat: \u201cAfter Brexit we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution,\u201d the manifesto says, to \u201cupdate the Human Rights Act and administrative law to ensure that there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government\u201d. That \u201cupdating\u201d means leaving the European convention on human rights, us alone with Belarus. Johnson, free from those restrictions, will unpick \u201cthe relationship between the government, parliament and the courts; the functioning of the royal prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary people\u201d. Judicial review, the citizen\u2019s guarantee against overmighty government, will be stopped from being \u201cabused to conduct politics by another means\u201d. Be very afraid, as Johnson takes revenge on the legal system, on remainers, on human rights and on any democratic aggravations that stand in his way. We saw how fast his people moved to threaten to \u201creview\u201d Channel 4\u2019s licence when it empty-chaired him for refusing its climate debate. Ofcom backed C4: what price will it pay? The BBC expects the worst after Johnson\u2019s assault yesterday on the licence fee. His constitutional review is a dire prospect from the man who illegally shut down parliament for five weeks. Reviewing \u201cthe functioning of the royal prerogative\u201d would be to grant himself more of those arbitrary powers. The Queen is useless as protection because she is unelected \u2013 elected presidents with written constitutions defend against government diktat \u2013 so she can only uphold whatever an elected parliament ordains. And expect no restraint from within his party. Johnson expelled all defenders of rights: instead we have Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Liz Truss \u2013 his cabinet of horrors \u2013 with every MP blood-sworn to him personally. Some think the failure of Corbyn to instantly expel all leftist purveyors of antisemitic filth would normally be a reason to deny Labour a vote. But these are not normal times. Behind the jovial bluster, Johnson is the greatest threat seen in our lifetimes. When the economy tanks due to his Brexit blunders he will do what the far right always does, distracting attention on to foreign \u201cenemies\u201d, using crude racism and attacks on \u201celite\u201d judges, civil servants or any upholder of rights. Every Labour campaign is labelled by Tories as a national \u201cdanger\u201d \u2013 even Tony Blair in 1997 faced \u201cNew Labour, New Danger\u201d posters. There was no \u201cdanger\u201d but much hope in John McDonnell\u2019s \u201cfirst 100 days\u201d plan set out yesterday: the only risk is to the wealth of those who did spectacularly well in this stagnant decade. However, there is no chance of a Labour majority, or of imposing reckless legislation without consultation as majority governments do. Far better, in plural societies, for a minority government to work with progressive parties, obliged to consult and agree. The real bone-chilling danger comes from the impulsive, dictatorial, egotistical, absolute power of Boris Johnson unchained. But if every anti-Johnson, anti-Brexiter votes tactically against him, he can still be stopped. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

Race \u2013 as a technology of power for the management of human differences, whose ultimate aim is the maintenance of global white supremacy \u2013 continues to exist despite formal opposition to racism. But this definition of race is lost in views of racism that see it as a personal, moral failing and not a structural condition that determines the life chances of those racialised as black, as migrant, Muslim, Roma and so on, for no other reason than that they are not white. It is easier to point the finger at \u201cthe racists\u201d, be it antisemites in the Labour party or \u201cignorant\u201d Brexit voters, than to deal with the fact that white people do not face state-sanctioned harm in the same way. White people\u2019s life expectancy is higher; we are less likely to be arrested or incarcerated; we can move more freely; we have more economic and educational opportunities; and we are less at risk of mental illness. Paradoxically, 10 years of austerity in the UK may have narrowed the gap between black and white poor people \u2013 even though hopes of solidarity between communities ravaged by cuts have been badly damaged by the elite obsession with the \u201cleft behind\u201d white working class. The white compunction to define what racism is, and especially what it is not, is a form of racist violence. It should be a basic principle that those who face racism should be permitted to define their own oppression. In these elections, the volume of commentary about racism from those whom it will never affect, is understandably viewed with cynicism by Muslim people facing two decades of over-policing, black people for whom the daily degradation of anti-blackness is compounded by the scandal of the Windrush deportations \u2013 and by Jews such as myself who know that unconditional solidarity is rare when there\u2019s not an electoral motivation. To really stamp out racism, we need to begin with a commitment to deepening our racial literacy, and for a majority white society to depersonalise its reaction to racism. It\u2019s literally not about you. \u2022 Alana Lentin is an associate professor in cultural and social analysis at Western Sydney University",
