Tomorrow is set to be another incredible day potentially bearing a number of surprises.</p> <p><strong>Here the key developments at a glance</strong>:</p> <ul> <li><strong>At least 16 proposals</strong> <strong>have been submitted by MPs for votes in the Commons tomorrow</strong>. Whether the parties will whip for or against some of them remains largely unclear at this point, though Labour is likely to whip for its own proposal - a close economic relationship with he EU in the shape of a comprehensive customs union, with a UK say on future trade deals<strong>, </strong>an idea EU law currently doesn\u2019t allow and repeatedly has ruled out.</li> <li>Labour MP Emily Thornberry has hinted that <strong>Labour might support a \u201cconfirmatory public ballot\u201d</strong>, which the Kyle-Wilson amendment calls for, regardless of which deal is passed. <br></li> <li><strong>Proposals tabled include a UK-EU customs union, a second referendum, EFTA, \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d, and no-Brexit via the revoking of article 50</strong><br></li> </ul> <ul> <li>It is likely that various so-called <strong>\u201cunicorn\u201d proposals</strong>, <strong>motions and amendments that won\u2019t be workable, will nevertheless attract much support</strong>. The Prime Minister has not committed to honouring successfully passed proposals, and might simply press on with a third meaningful vote on her twice-rejected deal. <br></li> </ul> <ul> <li>The Brexiteer and chair of the European Research Group<strong> Jacob Rees-Mogg has confirmed that he would now back Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal. The DUP has reiterated that it will reject it </strong>if it comes back for another vote<strong>. </strong><br></li> <li><strong>Borins Johnson has indicated that he might vote for the deal if the PM quits</strong>. <br></li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.

We will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and work with parliament to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union.</p> <p>It remains the government\u2019s firm policy not to revoke article 50.

However, close to three quarters of the electorate took part in the 2016 referendum, trusting that the result would be respected. This government wrote to every household prior to the referendum, promising that the outcome of the referendum would be implemented. 17.4 million people then voted to leave the European Union, providing the biggest democratic mandate for any course of action ever directed at UK government.</p> <p>British people cast their votes once again in the 2017 general election where over 80% of those who voted, voted for parties, including the opposition, who committed in their manifestos to upholding the result of the referendum.</p> <p>This government stands by this commitment.</p> <p>Revoking article 50 would break the promises made by government to the British people, disrespect the clear instruction from a democratic vote, and in turn, reduce confidence in our democracy. As the prime minister has said, failing to deliver Brexit would cause \u201cpotentially irreparable damage to public trust\u201d, and it is imperative that people can trust their government to respect their votes and deliver the best outcome for them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-26T18:58:46.853Z\">at 6.58pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c9a6b6fe4b0a127cdabd3d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-26T18:15:47.119Z\">6.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A motion that Conservative MP <strong>Nick Boles</strong> will table tomorrow has appeared.

If their 80 MPs refuse to participate, the House might be unable to demonstrate a majority for any option. E.g. if something wins out 300 to 250 in the end, those 300 votes are clearly not an actual majority of MPs.<br>Such an approach might serve their goal of steering things towards a no deal as much as they can.

That leaves only three choices: out on 12 April, ask for a long extension very quickly, or revoke article 50 very quickly.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>Good question. There is not much time. Under the article 50 extension agreed by the EU last week, if the PM\u2019s deal does not pass this week, the UK has until 12 April to come up with a new plan or face no deal.</p> <p>Could the indicative vote process produce an answer before 12 April. In theory, yes, although there is no guarantee that it will?</p> <p>And would any softer Brexit automatically involve a longer extension? Not necessarily. If the Commons, and then the government, were to agree a Norway-style Brexit, that could be facilitated through changes to the political declaration that would be drafted very quickly. The withdrawal agreement would not need to change. So it is possible that the Commons could vote before 12 April, and it is possible that the EU could then reactivate its offer of an extension until 22 May.</p> <p>But there are a lot of ifs in this proposition.

It happens quite often these days, when opposition day motions get passed. (In the past the government always used to contest these, but now it often abstains, and chooses to take no notice.) The issue of contempt only comes into play if the government ignores a motion specifically requiring it to do something, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/04/mps-demand-for-brexit-legal-advice-too-vague-says-geoffrey-cox\">the motion calling for Brexit legal advice to be published.</a></p> <p>But, as part of the indicative votes process, a motion could be passed requiring the government to respond. Ministers would be in contempt if they ignored that, but that might just lead to a motion being passed finding the government in contempt that would have no automatic practical impact. To force the government to comply with indicative votes, Oliver Letwin and his colleagues would probably need to pass legislation.</p> <p><strong><em>Who would benefit most from a general election?</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/127333347\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101440791\" title=\"View HistoryOfRob\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/101440791\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for HistoryOfRob\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101440791\" title=\"View HistoryOfRob\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">HistoryOfRob</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/127333347\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">26 March 2019 10:17am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Hi Andrew,<br>Say Parliament decides to rally around a Labour customs union soft Brexit and May decides that this isn't acceptable to the Conservative Party and we end up with No Deal and an election - who would come off better?

Because the idea of voting against it in the hope of getting no deal is clearly now not going to happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hancock ignored the fact that MPs last night actually voted against an amendment tabled by the Labour MP Dame Margaret Beckett designed to ensure that MPs could block a no-deal Brexit. It said, if the UK were seven days away from no deal, there would have to be a vote in the Commons either approving no deal or calling for an article 50 extension.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/25/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-statement-to-mps-as-calls-for-her-resignation-continue-live-news?page=with:block-5c995722e4b0a127cdabcae4#block-5c995722e4b0a127cdabcae4\"> It was rejected by a majority of three.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Hancock said the government might ignore the result of the indicative votes process. </strong>He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Clearly we have got to listen to what the Commons says\u2026 but we can\u2019t pre-commit to following whatever the Commons votes for because they might vote for something completely impractical, they might vote for two things that are incompatible, or vote for nothing at all.

      "bodyText": "I am wrapping this up now. Tomorrow is set to be another incredible day potentially bearing a number of surprises. Here the key developments at a glance: At least 16 proposals have been submitted by MPs for votes in the Commons tomorrow. Whether the parties will whip for or against some of them remains largely unclear at this point, though Labour is likely to whip for its own proposal - a close economic relationship with he EU in the shape of a comprehensive customs union, with a UK say on future trade deals, an idea EU law currently doesn\u2019t allow and repeatedly has ruled out. Labour MP Emily Thornberry has hinted that Labour might support a \u201cconfirmatory public ballot\u201d, which the Kyle-Wilson amendment calls for, regardless of which deal is passed. Proposals tabled include a UK-EU customs union, a second referendum, EFTA, \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d, and no-Brexit via the revoking of article 50 It is likely that various so-called \u201cunicorn\u201d proposals, motions and amendments that won\u2019t be workable, will nevertheless attract much support. The Prime Minister has not committed to honouring successfully passed proposals, and might simply press on with a third meaningful vote on her twice-rejected deal. The Brexiteer and chair of the European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg has confirmed that he would now back Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal. The DUP has reiterated that it will reject it if it comes back for another vote. Borins Johnson has indicated that he might vote for the deal if the PM quits. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for following. The Sun\u2019s political editor, Tom Newton-Dunn, reports that loyalist ministers have urged the PM to suspend all Conservative MPs who won\u2019t vote for her deal, which would be a \u201cnuclear move\u201d, he writes. Jacob Rees-Mogg has written an article in the Daily Mail, confirming that he intends to back May\u2019s deal. He writes: I apologise for changing my mind. Theresa May\u2019s deal is a bad one, it does not deliver on the promises made in the Tory Party manifesto and its negotiation was a failure of statesmanship. A \u00a339 billion bill for nothing, a minimum of 21 months of vassalage, the continued involvement of the European court and, worst of all, a backstop with no end date. Yet, I am now willing to support it if the Democratic Unionist Party does, and by doing so will be accused of infirmity of purpose by some and treachery by others. Labour MP Danielle Rowley has told Emily Maitlis on BBC Newsnight that she believes whipping MPs tomorrow would mean simply that Labour is sticking to its values. Update from the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley: This from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar: Although Boris Johnson indicated earlier that he would consider voting for May\u2019s deal if the PM stands down, his language has become gentler, much like the remarks of Ian Duncan Smith earlier at a Brexit discussion hosted by the Times, and those of Jacob Rees-Mogg this morning. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg describes his choice of words as \u201cnot v subtle code\u201d. My colleagues Rowena Mason and Peter Walker have written a story on the escalating infighting within the Conservative party. According to one Brexit-backing Tory MP they spoke to, \u201ceveryone is turning on each other.\u201d The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said in an interview with Channel 4 that Labour hadn\u2019t made up their minds yet regarding whipping arrangements, but that the party \u201cwill be making sure\u201d that a number of motions tabled for tomorrow will \u201cremain in play\u201d until Monday, when motions will have been narrowed down to just a few. Asked whether Labour would support a Norway-style Brexit, also called \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d, Thornberry said it was \u201cnot entirely in line\u201d with Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit, and that the party \u201cwould have some reservations about it\u201d. \u201cAnd then there is the amended Kyle-Wilson amendment as well,\u201d Thornberry added, but refused to confirm whether Labour would whip to support a confirmatory referendum. Labour appears to be backing the Kyle-Wilson amendment tomorrow, which would mean support for a confirmatory second referendum, according to Sky\u2019s political editor Faisal Islam. This is the alternative Brexit plan tabled by the Labour party for tomorrow\u2019s indicative votes in Parliament. The plan includes: \u00b7 a comprehensive customs union with the EU, with a UK say on future trade deals; \u00b7 close alignment with the single market underpinned by shared institutions and obligations; \u00b7 dynamic alignment on rights and protections; \u00b7 commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation; and \u00b7 clear agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases. Here Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s statement: \u201cThe government\u2019s approach to the Brexit negotiations has been an abject failure and this House must now come together to find a way forward. Labour\u2019s credible alternative plan can be negotiated with the EU and bring people together, whether they voted leave or remain. I urge MPs across the House to support our motion, deliver on the referendum result and negotiate a plan to protect manufacturing and jobs, guarantee rights and end the chaos that the government is inflicting on our country. The full text of Labour\u2019s motion reads: leave out from \u201cHouse\u201d to end and add: \u201crequires ministers to: (a) negotiate changes to the draft Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration so as to secure: (i) a permanent customs union with the EU; (ii) close alignment with the single market underpinned by shared institutions and obligations; (iii) dynamic alignment on rights and protections; (iv) commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation; (v) agreement on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases; and (b) introduce primary legislation to give statutory status to the objectives set out in subsection (a).\u201d The Independent\u2019s John Rentoul shares the government\u2019s concern that unworkable or unrealistic proposals could get large amounts of votes tomorrow. Jeremy Corbyn is considering to support a Norway-style soft Brexit proposal, a motion tabled by the Labour MPs Stephen Kinnock and Lucy Powell, and signed by several Tories, including Robert Halfon. Here the full story by my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot. This is the no-Brexit proposal that was earlier submitted for the Commons votes tomorrow: And the sponsors: Times RedBox editor Matt Chorley has tweeted that arch-Brexiter and ERG member Ian Duncan Smith just told a Times Plus audience this: Negotiating trade deals seems to be a rather lucrative endeavour. Read my colleague Rupert Neate\u2019s fascinating story on a multi-million dollar penthouse the government has bought for a civil servant who is tasked with signing post-Brexit trade deals. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn just tabled a motion seeking to include a customs union in the withdrawal deal. A unicorn, as the EU has repeatedly stated it won\u2019t reopen the deal. This from my colleague Heather Stewart: This just in from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston, who predicts the DUP and most Brexiters will vote for the Malthouse amendment tomorrow, still unimpressed by the fact the EU has repeatedly refused to budge on the backstop issue. The Labour MP Gareth Snell has tabled a motion aimed at negotiating \u201ca new UK-EU customs union\u201d for when the UK has left the bloc. Snell defied the Labour whip yesterday and voted for the Beckett amendment, which narrowly failed by 314 votes to 311. Earlier, Snell suggested he does not believe the indicative votes will be very constructive. My colleague Rajeev Syal has written a brilliant explainer for tomorrow\u2019s indicative votes in parliament. The Conservative peer and Times columnist Daniel Finkelstein just hypothesised at a Brexit-themed Times event that the Tories never thought Euroscepticism could lead to leave winning the referendum. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has written a piece on tomorrow\u2019s votes in the Commons, saying a source told her \u201c19 ministers are ready to quit\u201d if the PM does not allow free votes. Boris Johnson is still talking, it seems, and starts to sound a bit like a Game of Thrones script: Some photoshop editing Joseph Stalin might have been proud of has just happened on the Instagram account of the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, who has edited the Welsh Conservative MP Alun Cairns out of the shot. Liz Truss MP left him in, as the Times\u2019s Sam Coates points out with relish: The \u201cBoris Live\u201d event is seemingly still ongoing. The Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope says Johnson just \u201chinted\u201d that Theresa May should resign. Chuka Umunna MP, the spokesman of the fledgling Independent Group, has just announced that the group\u2019s 11 members will support a cross-party amendment calling for a \u201cconfirmatory public vote\u201d tabled by Margaret Beckett. Boris Johnson\u2019s remarks are coming from an event the Telegraph is hosting. This is from its audio producer Theodora Louloudis: This rather subtle from the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges: This from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar on the Boris matter: Boris Johnson appears to just have indicated his support for May\u2019s deal if a third meaningful vote goes ahead, in what people on Twitter are describing as \u201cBoris\u2019s Judas moment\u201d. Isn\u2019t it great to have Marina Hyde predict practically everything? This from The Daily Telegraph\u2019s Tim Stanley: Conor McGinn, the Labour MP for St Helens North, has published a statement about his hopes for tomorrow\u2019s session in the Commons. He seems to be saying that he might support a second referendum of some sort \u201cwhatever parliament decides\u201d and appears to emphasise that in doing so, he is fulfilling his representative duty as an MP, representing leave- and remain-voting constituents. An excerpt below: The prime minister has shown that she is unwilling to listen, so now parliament has taken control. Tomorrow night, MPs will undertake a series of indicative votes stating their preferred options to try and find a way forward. I hope we can find a consensus. But I am increasingly of the view that whatever parliament decides, or if it can\u2019t agree, we may still need to go back to the people for a final say. Finally, it is my job to represent everyone in St Helens North. Not just leave voters, not just remain voters, not just those who voted for me or the Labour party, but everyone. I will keep doing that as best I can over the coming critical days and weeks. My colleague Marina Hyde has written a piece on the effects of the indicative votes on the ERG, predicting that its members are about to turn on each other. Here is an excerpt: Inevitably, then, the Brexit ultras are turning on each other, with Arron Banks\u2019s Leave.EU outfit furiously reminding Rees-Mogg that he recently said the deal made the UK a \u201cslave state\u201d. It does make you wonder whether Rees-Mogg really knows what a \u201cslave state\u201d historically is. Then again, perhaps he does, as the ERG were informally nicknaming themselves the Grand Wizards on Monday night. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, is this for real?\u201d inquired George Osborne on Twitter. \u201cNo it\u2019s not,\u201d shot back Steve Baker. Read it in full here: The government has responded to the \u201cRevoke article 50 and remain in the EU\u201d petition and has announced that it will debate it in Westminster on Monday. The petition has so far garnered more than 5.7m signatures. Here is the full text of the response by the Department for Exiting the European Union: This government will not revoke article 50. We will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and work with parliament to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union. It remains the government\u2019s firm policy not to revoke article 50. We will honour the outcome of the 2016 referendum and work to deliver an exit which benefits everyone, whether they voted to leave or to remain. Revoking article 50, and thereby remaining in the European Union, would undermine both our democracy and the trust that millions of voters have placed in government. The government acknowledges the considerable number of people who have signed this petition. However, close to three quarters of the electorate took part in the 2016 referendum, trusting that the result would be respected. This government wrote to every household prior to the referendum, promising that the outcome of the referendum would be implemented. 17.4 million people then voted to leave the European Union, providing the biggest democratic mandate for any course of action ever directed at UK government. British people cast their votes once again in the 2017 general election where over 80% of those who voted, voted for parties, including the opposition, who committed in their manifestos to upholding the result of the referendum. This government stands by this commitment. Revoking article 50 would break the promises made by government to the British people, disrespect the clear instruction from a democratic vote, and in turn, reduce confidence in our democracy. As the prime minister has said, failing to deliver Brexit would cause \u201cpotentially irreparable damage to public trust\u201d, and it is imperative that people can trust their government to respect their votes and deliver the best outcome for them. A motion that Conservative MP Nick Boles will table tomorrow has appeared. Here the full text from the Telegraph\u2019s Anna Mikhailova, for those who fancy a headache: This from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam: The letter of the ERG to the PM, signed by Sir Bill Cash MP, David Jones MP, Suella Braverman MP and Michael Tomlinson MP is, over the course of three pages, expressing concern that May is \u201cunlawfully seeking to extend the UK\u2019s membership of the EU\u201d by having agreed to abandon the original exit date of 29 March with the EU. Oh dear. James Forsyth, political editor of The Spectator, has just suggested that May\u2019s hopes for a successful third \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on her withdrawal deal might not be dead yet. Jonathan Isaby, editor at Brexit Central, just tweeted however that the ERG appears to have thrown another spanner in the works: Paul Brand, political correspondent at ITV News, has provided a handy summary of what the indicative votes in the Commons are expected to look like tomorrow: Although Jacob Rees-Mogg seems to have come out in favour of May\u2019s deal after all, haunted by the prospect of no Brexit, some pundits remain sceptical about the nature of his remarks earlier. Here the take of Alex Barker, the Financial Times\u2019 Brussels bureau chief: Hello everyone. As my colleague Andrew Sparrow has explained in great detail below, parliament\u2019s Brexit tug of war has entered the next round ahead of tomorrow\u2019s session in the Commons, where MPs will be having indicative votes on where this nation is headed. More details regarding how these votes might look like can be expected tonight - such as the proposals that might be tabled and indications on which way the parties might whip tomorrow. It certainly never gets boring on this isle. Theresa May still hopes to bring her Brexit deal back to parliament for a third meaningful vote this week, after the leading Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was reluctantly considering supporting it. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, has said that accepting a one-year Brexit delay would be better than agreeing to back May\u2019s deal. (See 2.38pm.) His stance puts him at odds with Tory Brexiters like Rees-Mogg, who fear a substantial delay would lead to Brexit being shelved. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has warned MPs that the Easter recess will be cut short so that they can work \u201cflat out\u201d on Brexit. (See 1.58pm.) MPs backing the Letwin indicative votes plan have published details of how they expect the debate to be run tomorrow, and revealed that they also plan to take control of the Commons business on Monday next week. (See 4.12pm.) Two ministers who resigned from the government on Monday night to back moves for parliament to take control of the Brexit process have said MPs are likely now to move towards a softer deal or a referendum. Only 7% of the public believe the government has handled the Brexit negotiations well, according to research. Downing Street aides directly asked hard-Brexit Conservatives at Chequers on Sunday whether Theresa May\u2019s resignation as prime minister would be enough to get them to endorse finally the exit deal struck with the European Union, it has emerged. The head of the senior civil servants\u2019 union has called for direct rule to be imposed in Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is taking over now. The Tory Brexiter Daniel Kawczynski, a member of the European Research Group, which represents Conservatives pushing for a harder Brexit, has said a \u201ctrickle\u201d of ERG members supporting the Theresa May\u2019s deal on Tuesday has become a \u201cflow\u201d. He said: I addressed the ERG last night, as did some of my other fellow Tory MPs, and we basically said to them the time has come now to back the prime minister\u2019s deal. The prime minister\u2019s deal turns out to be the least worst option out of all the options which parliament are now putting forward. We were very concerned about aspects of it but frankly it\u2019s a dream compared to a full blown customs union, another referendum or a single market agreement with the European Union that doesn\u2019t fulfil what our constituents voted for. I think when we debated this issue last night, it was six of one and half a dozen of the other when it came to the speakers, both for and against. There is definitely a palpable shift. It was a trickle, now it\u2019s a flow. We Brexiteers are playing with fire, and we could get very, very burnt if this deal doesn\u2019t get through. This is from the Institute for Government\u2019s Joe Marshall on the business motion for tomorrow\u2019s indicative votes debate. (See 4.12pm.) The next meaningful vote on Theresa May\u2019s deal could take place on Friday, the Financial Times\u2019 George Parker reports. Here is the business of the house motion tabled for tomorrow (ie, the motion that will determine how the indicative votes process is run). And this is what it means. MPs will debate the various indicative vote proposals from 3pm at the latest until 7pm. Before that, up to one hour has been set aside for a debate on the business motion (ie, the process). John Bercow, the Speaker, will select which proposals get put to a vote. At 7pm MPs will vote on the proposals on paper, saying yes or no to all of the various proposals. They will have half an hour to vote. Although they will be voting on paper, it will not be a secret ballot, and votes will be recorded. After 7.30pm MPs will debate the statutory instrument changing the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act. That could take up to 90 minutes, and there will be a vote at the end. At some point in the evening \u2013 probably not before 8.30pm, possibly after the SI division at 9.15pm \u2013 the Speaker will announce the results. Monday 1 April will be set aside for another indicative votes debate (presumably the run-off between the most popular options). In other words, for a second day the government will lose control of the Commons timetable. Some more answers to questions from readers. When will the votes take place? Ministers would still like to be able to hold another meaningful vote on Thursday, but that will not happen unless something persuades Number 10 it has a chance of winning \u2013 and the latest DUP statement suggests that moment is still a long way off. (See 2.38pm.) And the vote on the statutory instrument changing the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act will take place in the Commons tomorrow, probably at around 7pm. There will also be a vote in the Lords before the end of the week. If the SI is voted down, will the UK leave the EU on Friday? No. Under international law, because of the agreement with the EU, Brexit day has been postponed until 12 April. But the SI is required because otherwise large chunks UK law will detach from the EU on Friday night, while the UK remains a member, creating potentially all manner of legal confusion. What will happen tomorrow? We don\u2019t know for sure yet, but... 1) Yes, those are the four main options. And, on second preferences, you would expect one option to get a majority \u2013 although that might not happen if MPs refuse to give second preferences. 2) Yes, this is the sort of thing we expect. See 9.30am. 3) Brexiters argue that anything that would keep the UK in the single market or the customs union contradicts what people thought they were voting for in 2016. 4) No, because the ERG know that there is more support for a softer Brexit than for no deal. Could the ERG try to obstruct tomorrow\u2019s votes by abstaining? They could, although I have not heard any suggestion that they will. Equally the government could try to same tactic to delegitimise the result. It would be like boycotting an election that you know you might lose. At the morning lobby briefing I asked the prime minister\u2019s spokesman if this was something the government might try. He said he had not heard that suggestion, but said Theresa May told MPs yesterday she wanted to engage with the process (implying she would not be going for a boycott strategy.) How would MPs behind the Letwin amendment legislate to force the government to comply? Earlier in the Brexit process the MPs Nick Boles and Yvette Cooper came up with a plan to force the PM to extend article 50 by getting MPs to vote for an amendment allowing them to take control of the Commons agenda on a given day, and then using that day to pass a bill requiring the PM to extend article 50. Once a bill becomes law, it is binding, unlike a normal Commons motion. But the Boles/Cooper plan was never tried. There is a theory that Oliver Letwin and his allies could try the same thing to make indicative votes binding. But it is not clear how this would work. Even if the MPs commandeered the Commons timetable again, and put a bill through the Commons in a day, it would still have to pass the Lords, where it could easily be held up. What Conservative manifesto commitments have already been abandoned? Quite a few. There is a list here. This is from the FT\u2019s Laura Hughes. To be fair, Sammy Wilson (who is actually the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman), wasn\u2019t actually saying there should be a one-year Brexit extension; he was just saying that would be better than the PM\u2019s deal. (See 2.38pm.) Nadhim Zahawi, the leave-voting children\u2019s minister, has told the BBC that he thinks the government will have to offer a free vote during the indicative votes process tomorrow. He said: I suspect it must be because if the will of parliament is to have free votes, indicative votes, then that will be it. Brexiters like Jacob Rees-Mogg are opposed to a long extension to article 50 because they fear that could lead to no Brexit. \u201cIf we remain, we will never leave,\u201d he said last week. But his allies in the DUP seem to take a different view. In an article in the Daily Telegraph (paywall), which seems to have been written in response to Rees-Mogg today hinting that he will back Theresa May\u2019s deal (see 10.36am), Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, says he would be happy with a one-year delay. He says: There are some colleagues who I admire greatly and who have stood firmly with us in defending Northern Ireland who now take the view that the withdrawal agreement, even though it is a rotten deal, is better than losing Brexit. To them I say that, if the deal goes through, we have lost our right to leave the EU. If we sign up to it, we give away our right to leave to the whim and dictates of the EU. That is not Brexit. Even if we are forced into a one-year extension, we at least would have a say on the things which affect us during that time and would have the right to unilaterally decide to leave at the end of that one-year period through the simple decision of not applying for a further extension. Surely this is a better strategy than volunteering to be locked into the prison of the withdrawal deal with the cell door key in the pocket of Michel Barnier? Besides, the fact remains that Brexit can only be lost if the government decides to abandon pursuing negotiations to leave the EU. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just dropped a strong hint in the Commons that the Easter recess will be cancelled, or at least shortened. She told MPs: I have announced the dates for Easter recess. But, as is always the case, recess dates are announced subject to the progress of business. We will need time in the house either to find a way forward or to pass the Withdrawal Agreement bill, and I think the country will rightly expect parliament to be working flat out in either scenario. So further announcements on future recess dates will be announced in due course in the usual way. The Easter recess was due to start on Thursday 4 April, and run until Tuesday 23 April. Here is some more on cabinet. This is from the Times\u2019s Sam Coates. And this is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. Suella Braverman, the Conservative former Brexit minister, is speaking this afternoon at a Bruges Group event. My colleague Peter Walker is there, and he says, unlike her Brexiter colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg, she does not sound as if she is minded to abandon her opposition to the PM\u2019s Brexit deal. The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart asks Leadsom to confirm that, if MPs vote for a new approach to Brexit, the government will respect that decision. Leadsom says at this stage we do not know what options will be voted on tomorrow, let alone which will be passed. And she says any options passed by the Commons will have to be \u201cnegotiatible\u201d with the EU. And the amount of time they would take would be a factor, she says. She also says MPs will have to consider whether any plans are consistent with party manifestos. Leadsom tells MPs that the statutory instrument being voted on tomorrow features two dates, depending on whether or not Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal gets passed. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, is making a business statement. She says the first business of the Commons tomorrow will be the indicative votes process. After that, MPs will vote on the statutory instrument changing Brexit date in the EU Withdrawal Act. Theresa May has often spoken about how she would like to heal the divisions created by Brexit. In one respect, she has achieved her wish. Today NatCen, the social research organisation, has released some new research looking at public perceptions of the Brexit process and it turns out that remainers and leavers are united in thinking it is going badly. The full report is here (pdf). In a commentary on the What UK Thinks website, the polling expert John Curtice says people have got more negative about the process the longer it has gone on. He says: The longer the Brexit process has gone on, the more critical and pessimistic voters have become. This trend is in evidence, above all, among those who voted in June 2016 to leave the EU. Indeed, leave voters have emerged from the process almost as critical of its handling and of the outcome as those who voted to remain. Many voters lacked confidence in the government\u2019s handling of Brexit from the beginning. Back in February 2017, shortly after the prime minister\u2019s Lancaster House speech in which she set out her vision of how Brexit should proceed and not long before the UK gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU, only 29% felt that the UK government was handling Brexit well, while as many as 41% reckoned it was doing so badly. However, much of the criticism came from those who voted remain. Among those who actually voted to leave the EU, rather more felt the government was handling Brexit well (42%) than believed it was doing so badly (27%). But now, two years later, there is almost a consensus that the government has been handling Brexit badly. Among voters as whole, just 7% believe that the government has handled Brexit well, while 81% reckon it has done so badly. The 85% of remain voters who now think Brexit has been handled badly are joined in that view by 80% of leave supporters. Indeed, just how profound the loss of confidence among leave voters has been is indicated by the fact that they are now as critical of the UK government\u2019s handling of Brexit as they are of the EU\u2019s role in the negotiations. One of the problems, he says, is that \u201cthe kind of deal that many voters wanted to emerge was never going to be on offer\u201d. According to Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam, Curtice has also said that public opinion has shifted to such an extent that it is now longer obvious that leaving represents the majority view of the public. I\u2019m back from the Downing Street lobby briefing, but it wasn\u2019t a very fruitful trip. There was a long discussion on the votes last night at cabinet, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said, but he had almost nothing to say about the substance of what was said, and would not say how the government would engage with the indicatives votes process, or even whether government MPs will get a free vote. The spokesman also refused to say whether the government would schedule another meaningful vote on the PM\u2019s Brexit deal this week. The government would only timetable a vote when it thought it had \u201ca realistic prospect of success\u201d, he said. There are lots of good questions BTL. Here are some I think I can answer helpfully. Why are the European Research Group so influential? Because they represent up to around 80 Tory MPs (they don\u2019t release precise membership numbers, and some MPs are more fully aligned with them than others anyway) and Theresa May needs their support to win votes. All political parties are coalitions, and all party leaders need to take account of what their MPs. What makes the ERG unusual is that they are particularly well organised; they run an effective press operation, and they operate an informal ERG whip. They are also extremely committed to their cause. Or fanatical, as their critics would claim. Does parliament have to approve a decision to hold European elections? For the European elections to take place, returning officers would have to publish notice of the poll by 12 April, and the government would have to name the date of the poll by order (ie, by a piece of secondary legislation that would normally get approved without a division.) That is why the EU has only agreed an extension until 12 April, unless the withdrawal agreement gets passed. It will not allow the UK to extend beyond that point unless it agrees to participate in the elections. Could the EU negotiate with parliament instead of Theresa May? No. It has to negotiate with a prime minister and a government. It cannot negotiate with Oliver Letwin, or John Bercow, or Yvette Cooper, not least because they cannot sign international agreements on behalf of the UK state. Is there enough time for parliament to find a plan B? Good question. There is not much time. Under the article 50 extension agreed by the EU last week, if the PM\u2019s deal does not pass this week, the UK has until 12 April to come up with a new plan or face no deal. Could the indicative vote process produce an answer before 12 April. In theory, yes, although there is no guarantee that it will? And would any softer Brexit automatically involve a longer extension? Not necessarily. If the Commons, and then the government, were to agree a Norway-style Brexit, that could be facilitated through changes to the political declaration that would be drafted very quickly. The withdrawal agreement would not need to change. So it is possible that the Commons could vote before 12 April, and it is possible that the EU could then reactivate its offer of an extension until 22 May. But there are a lot of ifs in this proposition. Despite what Jacob Rees-Mogg is saying (see 10.36am), no deal by accident must remain a possibility. Could the government be held in contempt of parliament if it ignores the indicative votes? The government cannot be held in contempt of parliament just for ignoring a motion passed by parliament. It happens quite often these days, when opposition day motions get passed. (In the past the government always used to contest these, but now it often abstains, and chooses to take no notice.) The issue of contempt only comes into play if the government ignores a motion specifically requiring it to do something, such as the motion calling for Brexit legal advice to be published. But, as part of the indicative votes process, a motion could be passed requiring the government to respond. Ministers would be in contempt if they ignored that, but that might just lead to a motion being passed finding the government in contempt that would have no automatic practical impact. To force the government to comply with indicative votes, Oliver Letwin and his colleagues would probably need to pass legislation. Who would benefit most from a general election? This is a very good question which I have included not because I know the answer \u2013 I\u2019m not sure anyone does \u2013 but because HistoryOfRob frames it well, and it is a query preoccupying a lot of people at Westminster. My assumption would be that, if no deal really is a disaster, the government will get the blame. Some polling supports that. But, given the large number of people who favour no deal, who can be sure? I\u2019m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 12.30pm. The Tory Brexiter John Baron has said he thinks a general election is becoming more likely. He explained: A snap general election is becoming more likely. Whatever the outcome of the votes on Wednesday, the numbers inside the current remain-dominated House of Commons will not change. It may be that an election is necessary to redress the balance in favour of MPs willing to implement the referendum result, for history suggests it is unwise for any parliament to distance itself from the people. The events of the next few weeks will be critical. A no-deal Brexit would put up to 80,000 jobs in Ireland at risk, a new report by the government\u2019s department of finance and the Economic &amp; Social Research Institute has found. It found deep and damaging impact of a crash-out caused by the impact of tariffs on exports and other barriers to trade with the UK, Ireland\u2019s second largest export market. The study finds that GDP in Ireland 10 years after Brexit will be around 2.6% lower in a deal scenario, 4.8% lower in a no-deal scenario (a bare bones deal with a managed period of adjustment) and 5% lower in what it describes as a \u201cdisorderly no-deal\u201d scenario. Adele Bergin, lead author of the report, said: The impact of each Brexit scenario is considerable and will have negative effects throughout the economy on the household sector, the labour market, firms and the public finances. However, the negative impact on Irish output in the long run in the deal scenario is approximately half that of the no-deal scenario. The report\u2019s assessment was guided by the conclusions of 15 different reports on the impact of Brexit on the British economy and Irish economy. The report found that in each scenario some of the negatives would be offset by increased by relocation of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland such as banks and other financial services. It cites studies that have shown that the UK could lose around a quarter of its FDI in no deal Brexit. This is from Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti. And this is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. Michael Fabricant, the Tory Brexiter who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal in the first two meaningful votes, says he agrees with Jacob Rees-Mogg about MPs having to decide between May\u2019s deal and no Brexit. (See 10.12am.) Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, is due to make a business statement at 12.30pm. Presumably this will cover the topic of indicative votes. Here are some more quotes from Jacob Rees-Mogg in his ConservativeHome podcast explaining why he thinks MPs will face a choice between Theresa May\u2019s deal and no Brexit. (See 10.12am.) Rees-Mogg, the chair of the ERG, said it was \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d to see the UK leaving the EU without a deal because of opposition from government and parliament. He explained: From a Eurosceptic point of view, from the point of view of somebody in my position, as one of the minority of MPs who really want to leave, we have to recognise that what we want and what we can deliver is not necessarily the same because of our lack of numbers. The ERG and other Eurosceptics in parliament cannot win any vote on our own ... The prime minister does not want to leave without a deal. And the cabinet does not want to leave without a deal. And if parliament does not want to leave without a deal, it is therefore very, very difficult to see who you get to leaving without a deal, even though that is the law of the land. He said that Number 10 could have chosen to leave the EU without a deal, but that the opportunity to do so had now been lost. I think Downing Street has lost the opportunity to leave without a deal. I think that was a mistake. It seemed last week as if Downing Street was going to take that opportunity, and that would have been on 29 March, on Friday, at 11 o\u2019clock at night, and it has now been pushed into the long grass. And why do I think that was an error? Well, the legal position was leaving. It was what people voted for, effectively. It was what the government was pretty clear would happen. The prime minister said 100 times or more from the dispatch box that we would leave on 29 March. So I think there\u2019s a feeling that political trust is not what it ought to be. Is the European Research Group, which represents up to around 80 Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit and which has led opposition to Theresa May\u2019s deal in the Conservative party, running up the white flag? Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG chair, has tweeted this, promoting his latest ConservativeHome podcast (or \u201cMoggcast\u201d, as they call it.) Rees-Mogg told the podcast: The prime minister will not deliver a no-deal Brexit. Asked if that meant the options were now \u201cdeal or potentially no Brexit\u201d, he said: That, I think, becomes the choice eventually. Whether we are there yet is another matter, but I have always thought that no deal is better than Mrs May\u2019s deal, but Mrs May\u2019s deal is better than not leaving at all. He added that \u201cleaving the European Union, even leaving it inadequately and having work to do afterwards is better than not leaving at all\u201d. Brexit may now need to be viewed as \u201ca process rather than an event\u201d, he said. It was, he said, a \u201cprocess of unravelling and diverging which will take time\u201d. It is worth stressing, of course, that the ERG is divided over tactics and, although Rees-Mogg might be gearing up to vote for May\u2019s deal, some of his ERG colleagues are likely to oppose it to the bitter end. Last night the government claimed that allowing MPs to take charge of the Commons timetable would set a \u201cdangerous, unpredictable precedent\u201d. But, in an interesting Twitter thread, Holger Hestermeyer, an academic, points out that it is quite normal in other countries for parliament, not the executive, to decide what it debates. His thread starts here. While parliament might be deadlocked by Brexit, other political imperatives have not disappeared, and some MPs are trying to make sure they are not forgotten. On Tuesday the Green MP Caroline Lucas and Labour MP Clive Lewis are publishing a private member\u2019s bill for a so-called Green New Deal, intended to introduce a radical, decade-long shift to move to low-carbon energy, with wider environmental protections. The idea has been in the news recently due to efforts by Democrat congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others to push it in the US. But the concept has been around for longer \u2013 Lucas co-founded a UK group dedicated to the idea 10 years ago. Taking its name from Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal of the 1930s, the Green New Deal would similarly seek to boost prosperity through government spending and intervention, in this case in areas such as more sustainable energy, homes and transport. This is, Lucas and Lewis say, the first bill to reach the UK parliament, and they hope to gain some cross-party support. Lucas said: \u201cWe need to do what is required of us \u2013 not simply what is seen as politically possible.\u201d Alistair Burt, who resigned as a Foreign Office minister so that he could vote for the Letwin amendment last night, has issued a statement explaining his decision. Here is an extract. Despite the best and determined efforts of the prime minister, her agreement with the EU continues to be rejected by parliament. We are running out of time for an alternative, and the risk of leaving without a deal, and continuing serious and disruptive uncertainty is affecting the UK profoundly. Parliament should seek urgently to resolve the situation by considering alternatives freely, without the instruction of party whips, and government should adopt any feasible outcome as its own in order to progress matters. I did not believe the government was prepared to do that, so had to vote to ensure this happens. Richard Harrington, who resigned as a business minister yesterday so he could vote for the Letwin amendment, told the Today programme this morning that the government should have held some sort of indicative votes process much earlier. He said: It\u2019s absurd that now we are in a position of political impasse and parliament hasn\u2019t actually talked about it on the floor of the House of Commons. That\u2019s what I call a democratic deficit. And parliament has got to talk about it. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, has welcomes the result of last night\u2019s Commons vote. Verhofstadt and other MEPs have for a long time been urging the UK to develop a cross-party approach to Brexit. Their stance reflects that fact that, in most continental countries, cross-party cooperation is much more common, and seen as much more desirable, than it is in the UK, where first-past-the-post and the adversarial nature of the House of Commons makes it a rarity. Steve Brine, who resigned as a health minister last night to vote for the Letwin amendment, told the Today programme this morning that he thought the prospect of the Commons taking control of the Brexit process could persuade some Tory Brexiters to back Theresa May\u2019s deal. He explained: Maybe what last night will do is focus some minds ... Those on my side who don\u2019t like the deal, maybe they will realise that the House of Commons is prepared to act. And, anything from here, as far as they are concerned, gets softer in terms of Brexit. Brine also said that, if the Commons could not come up with a way forward, then \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d, including a referendum and revoking article 50. On the Today programme this morning Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee and a supporter of the Letwin amendment passed last night, said that he thought the indicative votes debate tomorrow would have to be followed by another next Monday. He explained: The first time round it will just be \u2018here are the propositions\u2019 and you vote for as many as you would like. And then we will see the results from Wednesday night. The motion that we will move tomorrow suggests that we go through a similar process next Monday. There will obviously be discussions between MPs looking at the results of what has happened on Wednesday night. Which are the most popular options? We may then change the system for next week as we are trying to narrow it down. Last week Theresa May suffered the indignity of seeing the EU take control of the article 50 extension process. And last night she suffered a further blow, as MPs voted to start a process that could see them seizing control of the Brexit process. In practice the amendment tabled by Sir Oliver Letwin just involves MPs taking control of the Commons timetable tomorrow afternoon, when in fact it is normally the government that decides what gets debated, but that is the start of a process that could go much further. (Or perhaps not. See here for more. At this stage no one knows.) Here is our overnight story. This morning Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was on the Today programme responding for the government. He made two important points. Hancock said a no-deal Brexit won\u2019t be allowed by the Commons. He explained: If anything, yesterday in the House of Commons demonstrated that the option of no deal simply won\u2019t be allowed by the Commons and the best way through this impasse is the one deal that has been negotiated with the EU, that can be delivered quickly now ... The Commons is now absolutely clear it won\u2019t allow [a no deal] and will legislate against if necessary. And that means that the options are narrowing and that demonstrates that if you want to deliver on the result of the referendum \u2013 and I think we must \u2013 and in a way that supports the economy and keeps the stability for people\u2019s jobs, then vote for the prime minister\u2019s deal. Because the idea of voting against it in the hope of getting no deal is clearly now not going to happen. Hancock ignored the fact that MPs last night actually voted against an amendment tabled by the Labour MP Dame Margaret Beckett designed to ensure that MPs could block a no-deal Brexit. It said, if the UK were seven days away from no deal, there would have to be a vote in the Commons either approving no deal or calling for an article 50 extension. It was rejected by a majority of three. Hancock said the government might ignore the result of the indicative votes process. He explained: Clearly we have got to listen to what the Commons says\u2026 but we can\u2019t pre-commit to following whatever the Commons votes for because they might vote for something completely impractical, they might vote for two things that are incompatible, or vote for nothing at all. We cannot say \u2013 absolutely, whatever they pass. If the Commons voted for the sun to rise in the West, the government would not be able to implement that. This whole debate has been characterised by people coming in with ideas which we now call unicorns in the political debate. This Hancock argument is also open to challenge. It ignores the fact that the government backed the Brady amendment, approving the deal subject to the backstop being replaced with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, even though many people dismissed that as a \u201cunicorn\u201d. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 1pm: Suella Braverman, the former Brexit minister, and Sir Christopher Chope, another Tory Brexiter, speak at a Bruges group event. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I finish, at around 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "After another humiliating defeat for Theresa May\u2019s government on Monday, parliament will attempt to end the Brexit deadlock on Wednesday with a series of indicative votes on alternative proposals. The schedule itself will be subject to change, but here is what to expect if you wish to keep an eye on proceedings. Which Brexit proposals will MPs vote on? John Bercow selected eight motions to be voted on after several indicative vote proposals were handed in to parliament\u2019s tables office by Tuesday night. The eight chosen by the Speaker include one proposing to leave without a deal on 12 April, one that could see article 50 revoked, one suggesting UK membership of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) and European Economic Area (EEA) and a second referendum confirming any Brexit deal. When will the parliamentary process start and end? After a debate on the various proposals, MPs are expected to start voting at 7pm and the results should come in between 8.30pm and 10pm. How will MPs physically vote? Before 7pm, \u201cballot papers\u201d will be made available in the division lobbies next to the Commons chamber. Unlike most parliamentary votes, which are cast by walking through a lobby, MPs will vote by putting crosses next to \u201caye\u201d or \u201cnoe\u201d for each proposal. MPs will be able to vote for as many of the proposals as they wish to support. How each MP has voted will be published later that night. How will they debate the proposals? Bercow is not expected to hold different debates on each motion. Instead, MPs will be allowed to make points about any of the proposals. Is parliament \u2018taking back control\u2019? Parliament took over proceedings after a business motion to allow indicative votes was passed by 331 to 287 votes. MPs will debate the various indicative vote proposals from 3pm at the latest until 7pm. Will the government or the opposition whip for or against the various motions? The government has given MPs a free vote on the motions but Cabinet will abstain. Labour will whip to support motions on customs union and confirmatory public vote and will recommend Labour MPs back Tory MP Nick Boles\u2019 Common Market 2.0. Will we know the will of parliament by the end of Wednesday? Who knows? Parliament could end up supporting contradictory motions, or with no overall majority for any of the motions. What will MPs do while their votes are being counted? There is the small matter of officially delaying Brexit. The government will lead a debate on a legal order that needs to be passed to delay the UK\u2019s scheduled departure on Friday 29 March. This is expected to pass with ease. Is that the end of the process? No. Under Letwin\u2019s proposals, parliament will next have control of its own agenda on Monday 1 April. That could be used to order the government to pursue a particular course of action. The government has until 12 April to propose a different way forward to the EU if it cannot get May\u2019s deal through parliament.",

Nothing of the sort. What Mrs May was doing was telling it as it is about the present parliament, and my regret is that she, and other pro-Brexit MPs, haven\u2019t done it sooner.</p> <p>The fact is that from the day after the referendum, which was the biggest people\u2019s vote in all our history, remain MPs, who are the majority in parliament, have done everything in their power to defy, change, block, frustrate, and finally to sabotage, the outcome of that vote. What we have all witnessed since June 2016 is a historic struggle between people and parliament. Parliament has come to represent its MPs and them only \u2013 their power, their status, their interests, their self-conceit and arrogance.</p> <p>But 23 June 2016 was the people\u2019s D-day; it was the day when the people of the UK took an almighty historic decision, but one the majority of MPs did not want. And those MPs have done everything in their power since, using every device, to get it overturned.</p> <p>As it is looking now, they are about to succeed in keeping the UK in the EU. But there will be other issues. Immense, almost incredible inventions and developments have occurred in how people can now communicate directly with each other; and they will outstrip the powers of media and government.<br><strong>Michael Knowles</strong><br><em>Congleton, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Theresa May is right that the process of indicative votes could yield \u201ccontradictory outcomes or no outcome at all\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/25/theresa-may-maintains-carry-on-regardless-brexit-strategy\" title=\"\">What next?

      "bodyText": "It is the referendum that has paralysed parliament: presented as the mandate of the people, it reduces members from representatives to delegates, fearful of \u201cdishonouring\u201d it. So far this has been the main reason given for not revoking article 50. Leaving aside whether it was flawed, by interference or misinformation, it was absurd to embark on it without putting before the people any clear indication of what our future relationship with Europe would be, or the difficulties of unpicking the years of our membership. In the indicative vote process (MPs vote to seize control of Brexit from May, 26 March), which surely needs a single transferable vote or similar, some will support revoking article 50 out of conviction that what we currently have is the best deal, and that we should use our membership to work for mutually beneficial reform. Others, however, can honourably support it not as \u201coutcome\u201d but as \u201cprocess\u201d \u2013 a chance to reboot, with the timescale in our own hands. After the proper debate which we should have had at the start of the process, we could then re-trigger article 50, or have a second referendum based on the knowledge of the situation we find ourselves in more than three years on. That, surely, would respect the will of the people in a responsible fashion. Michael Ainsworth Bolton \u2022 Polly Toynbee attacks Theresa May\u2019s public No 10 speech last Wednesday, saying it had \u201cbrutishly insulted\u201d parliament and that the prime minister was attempting to speak to the people \u201cover MPs\u2019 heads\u201d (The Tories are no longer a party, and Theresa May must know it, 26 March). Nothing of the sort. What Mrs May was doing was telling it as it is about the present parliament, and my regret is that she, and other pro-Brexit MPs, haven\u2019t done it sooner. The fact is that from the day after the referendum, which was the biggest people\u2019s vote in all our history, remain MPs, who are the majority in parliament, have done everything in their power to defy, change, block, frustrate, and finally to sabotage, the outcome of that vote. What we have all witnessed since June 2016 is a historic struggle between people and parliament. Parliament has come to represent its MPs and them only \u2013 their power, their status, their interests, their self-conceit and arrogance. But 23 June 2016 was the people\u2019s D-day; it was the day when the people of the UK took an almighty historic decision, but one the majority of MPs did not want. And those MPs have done everything in their power since, using every device, to get it overturned. As it is looking now, they are about to succeed in keeping the UK in the EU. But there will be other issues. Immense, almost incredible inventions and developments have occurred in how people can now communicate directly with each other; and they will outstrip the powers of media and government. Michael Knowles Congleton, Cheshire \u2022 Theresa May is right that the process of indicative votes could yield \u201ccontradictory outcomes or no outcome at all\u201d (What next? Coup evaporates for the day, but vote for Letwin plan piles confusion onto uncertainty, 26 March). She has form on her side. In 2003, parliament voted yes/no on five options to reform the House of Lords \u2013 and there was a majority against every proposal, so no reform. But it ain\u2019t necessarily so. Preference voting would avoid this. Also, making use of second and third preferences leads to a better-informed result.

Wednesday\u2019s will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/25/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-statement-to-mps-as-calls-for-her-resignation-continue-live-news?page=with:block-5c98aa20e4b0e8eadf783b6a#block-5c98aa20e4b0e8eadf783b6a\">the ninth big Brexit debate this year</a>, and the first where supposedly the Commons is \u201ctaking back control\u201d. Sir Oliver Letwin wants MPs to vote on paper, not in the division lobbies, on a wide range of Brexit options. But there are many reasons why this might not have quite the dramatic impact Cash fears. Here are six.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>1) MPs have not yet been promised free votes on all, or even some, of the measures, but unless that happens the voting could end up just being a re-run of what has happened in normal votes on Brexit amendments.</strong> Some government ministers have said there is no point having indicative votes without giving MPs a free vote, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> sounds less keen. Speaking for Labour, Sir Keir Starmer implied this afternoon that Labour MPs would get free votes on some propositions but not others.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) There is no guarantee yet that there will be a majority for any plan - although Letwin may opt for a voting system that eliminates unpopular options until one is left as the winner.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>3) The government would not be obliged to accept any plan deemed most popular with MPs, and in fact May strongly hinted this afternoon that she would reject what many expect might emerge as the most widely-supported idea - staying in a customs union with the EU. </strong>(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/25/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-statement-to-mps-as-calls-for-her-resignation-continue-live-news?page=with:block-5c9902a7e4b0a127cdabc790#block-5c9902a7e4b0a127cdabc790\">5.32pm.)</a> Motions passed by the Commons are not binding on the government, and it is very hard for the legislature to force a PM to do something she does not want to do.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) MPs may well use Wednesday\u2019s debate to pass another motion freeing up more time for indicative votes at a later stage.</strong> In other words, the process could become self-perpetuating. This would worry ministers much more, particularly if it led to MPs trying to free up time to allow the Commons to pass legislation. But that could lead to ministers seeking a way of trying to retaliate to sabotage the Letwin process.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) It is not obvious that all options will be on the ballot anyway.</strong>Interestingly one of the most high-profile supporters of a second referendum, Owen Smith, said in the debate this plan should be excluded at this stage. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/25/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-statement-to-mps-as-calls-for-her-resignation-continue-live-news?page=with:block-5c994712e4b0a127cdabca75#block-5c994712e4b0a127cdabca75\"> 9.19pm.)</a></p> \n  <p><strong>6) The prospect of MPs trying to push May towards a softer Brexit could possibly help her, by persuading Tory Brexiters to back her plan in a vote on Thursday to prevent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> being watered down. </strong>There is no guarantee that this will happen, but it is not impossible.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c9978a6e4b0a127cdabcbc3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-26T00:57:49.379Z\">12.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sky\u2019s <strong>Lewis Goodall</strong> seems chirpy: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1110338085957574657\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019m going to bed and finally having a day off tomorrow.

Sir Oliver Letwin wants MPs to vote on paper, not in the division lobbies, on a wide range of Brexit options. But there are many reasons why this might not have quite the dramatic impact Cash fears. Here are six.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>1) MPs have not yet been promised free votes on all, or even some, of the measures, but unless that happens the voting could end up just being a re-run of what has happened in normal votes on Brexit amendments.</strong> Some government ministers have said there is no point having indicative votes without giving MPs a free vote, but Theresa May sounds less keen. Speaking for Labour, Sir Keir Starmer implied this afternoon that Labour MPs would get free votes on some propositions but not others.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) There is no guarantee yet that there will be a majority for any plan - although Letwin may opt for a voting system that eliminates unpopular options until one is left as the winner.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>3) The government would not be obliged to accept any plan deemed most popular with MPs, and in fact May strongly hinted this afternoon that she would reject what many expect might emerge as the most widely-supported idea - staying in a customs union with the EU. </strong>(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/25/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-statement-to-mps-as-calls-for-her-resignation-continue-live-news?page=with:block-5c9902a7e4b0a127cdabc790#block-5c9902a7e4b0a127cdabc790\">5.32pm.)</a> Motions passed by the Commons are not binding on the government, and it is very hard for the legislature to force a PM to do something she does not want to do.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) MPs may well use Wednesday\u2019s debate to pass another motion freeing up more time for indicative votes at a later stage.</strong> In other words, the process could become self-perpetuating. This would worry ministers much more, particularly if it led to MPs trying to free up time to allow the Commons to pass legislation. But that could lead to ministers seeking a way of trying to retaliate to sabotage the Letwin process.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) It is not obvious that all options will be on the ballot anyway.</strong> Interestingly one of the most high-profile supporters of a second referendum, Owen Smith, said in the debate this plan should be excluded at this stage. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/25/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-statement-to-mps-as-calls-for-her-resignation-continue-live-news?page=with:block-5c994712e4b0a127cdabca75#block-5c994712e4b0a127cdabca75\"> 9.19pm.)</a></p> \n  <p><strong>6) The prospect of MPs trying to push May towards a softer Brexit could possibly help her, by persuading Tory Brexiters to back her plan in a vote on Thursday to prevent Brexit being watered down. </strong>There is no guarantee that this will happen, but it is not impossible.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> \n  <p>My colleague Jedidaja Otte is now taking over.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-25T23:58:42.761Z\">at 11.58pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c995f87e4b0a127cdabcb0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-25T23:12:17.548Z\">11.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>These are from Hannah White, deputy director of the<strong> Institute for Government.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DrHannahWhite/status/1110314526719856645\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I can see that for Government tonight\u2019s vote represents uncomfortable loss of control over Commons time but it\u2019s NOT ACTUALLY UNCOMMON for other groups of MPs to determine what is on the order paper (on opposition days, backbench business days, estimates days)... <a href=\"https://t.co/YTYnh4phkC\">https://t.co/YTYnh4phkC</a></p>\u2014 Hannah White (@DrHannahWhite) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrHannahWhite/status/1110314526719856645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 25, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DrHannahWhite/status/1110314529278156800\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">... what is unusual here is that the Government has lost control of the scheduling of ON WHICH DAY non-govt members get to choose the business.

It hasn\u2019t been a great success. She angered the DUP by suggesting the politicians in Northern Ireland were to blame for article 50 being extended, she disappointed MPs hoping that she was genuinely committed to indicative votes, and some of what she said about the possibility of a long Brexit delay seemed to contradict what she was saying last week. </p> \n  <p>Oh, and she also had to issue what was effectively a non-apology apology.</p> \n  <p>On the plus side, unless I missed it, no Conservative called for her to resign. Given that there were stories in yesterday\u2019s Sunday papers claiming a Tory coup was already underway, that probably counts as an achievement.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May said she did not yet have the support to win a third meaningful vote.</strong> But she implied she was hoping that would change by the end of the week. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Speaker, I continue to believe that the right path forward is for the United Kingdom to leave the EU as soon as possible with a deal, now on 22nd May.</p> \n   <p>But it is with great regret that I have had to conclude that as things stand, there is still not sufficient support in the house to bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote. I continue to have discussions with colleagues across the house to build support, so that we can bring the vote forward this week, and guarantee Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May implied that she decided to delay Brexit primarily because the absence of an executive in Northern Ireland meant it was not ready for a no-deal Brexit.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And I requested a short extension to the article 50 process to 30th June. I regret having to do so. I wanted to deliver Brexit on 29th March. But I am conscious of my duties as prime minister to all parts of our United Kingdom and of the damage to that union leaving without a deal could do when one part of it is without devolved government and unable therefore to prepare properly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is not an argument that May has made in public before. The DUP is to a large extent to blame for the fact that Northern Ireland does not have a power-sharing executive (although it claims it\u2019s the fault of Sinn F\u00e9in), and DUP MPs like <strong>Nigel Dodds</strong> (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/25/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-statement-to-mps-as-calls-for-her-resignation-continue-live-news?page=with:block-5c98fc07e4b0a127cdabc727#block-5c98fc07e4b0a127cdabc727\">4.07pm) </a>and <strong>Sammy Wilson</strong> (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/25/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-statement-to-mps-as-calls-for-her-resignation-continue-live-news?page=with:block-5c99022fe4b0a127cdabc78c#block-5c99022fe4b0a127cdabc78c\"> 4.32pm)</a> responded angrily.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She claimed that passing the Letwin amendment tonight would unbalance \u201cour democratic institutions\u201d.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The amendment in the name of [Oliver Letwin] seeks to provide for this process by taking control of the order paper.

Here are the two key lines.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Theresa May is considering asking MPs to vote on the withdrawal agreement separately from the political declaration, Labour has revealed.</strong> Until now May has treated them both as a package, and MPs have been asked to vote on both together (eg, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-03-12/debates/5F35A04D-1C6E-4D7D-87B6-C06EE8AEE3F5/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Act\">in the motion for MV2).</a> But <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/03/21/european-council-art-50-conclusions-21-march-2019/\">the EU summit communique issued last week</a> said that, for the UK to get Brexit extended until 22 May, MPs just had to pass the withdrawal agreement. The EU statement did not mention the political declaration in the context of a vote this week. This is significant because there is little in the withdrawal agreement (which focuses on the transition, the \u00a339bn payment and the backstop) that Labour objects to; most of Labour\u2019s objections to May\u2019s deal relate to the political declaration. The Labour statement does not explain why Corbyn refused to separate the two issues. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn told May she should abandon the third meaningful votes.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Corbyn was joined at the meeting by Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip. May was supported by Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Julian Smith, the government chief whip.</p> \n  <p>The Labour team came away with the clear impression that the government would not be bound by any decision of parliament in indicative votes. That is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/25/government-could-ignore-indicative-brexit-votes-says-liam-fox\">what <strong>Liam Fox,</strong> the international trade secretary, suggested this morning too.</a></p> \n  <p><em>UPDATE: </em>A government source later rejected Corbyn\u2019s claim about May wanting to split the vote on the withdrawal agreement from the vote on the political declaration.

There are also amendments ordering or instructing the government to do certain things, implying the government would be in contempt of parliament if it ignored them.</p> \n  <p>In reality, though, it is very hard for the Commons to force the executive to do something it does not want to do.

Doubtless readers of his \u00a3275,000-a-year Daily Telegraph column would have liked to have read about what happened, but he did not mention it <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/03/24/theresa-may-chicken-bottled-brexit-way-forward-come-eu-now/\">in the article (paywall)</a> he managed to file yesterday, presumably after his deliberations with the PM.</p> \n  <p>Instead Johnson used it to deliver what sounds like an ultimatum.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On every side we are being frightened with false fire. It seems to be that there are two ways forward. If she really wants her deal to go through parliament, the PM could still set out convincing proofs of how the next phase of the negotiations \u2013 when all the key questions are to be settled \u2013 will be different from the first. How will we be able to take back control of our laws? Will we really do free trade deals? And can we really go on with a negotiating team that has so resoundingly failed? </p> \n   <p>If she cannot give that evidence of change \u2013 she should drop the deal, and go back to Brussels, and simply set out the terms that so many on both sides \u2013 remainers and leavers \u2013 now believe are sensible. </p> \n   <p>Extend the implementation period to the end of 2021 if necessary; use it to negotiate a free trade deal; pay the fee; but come out of the EU now \u2013 without the backstop. It is time for the PM to channel the spirit of Moses in Exodus, and say to Pharaoh in Brussels \u2013 LET MY PEOPLE GO.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s second proposal, that the UK should effectively request a transition without the backstop (the old Malthouse plan, part two - remember that?), is almost certainly a non-starter, because the EU has ruled it out repeatedly.</p> \n  <p>But his first proposal, that May should \u201cset out convincing proofs of how the next phase of the negotiations ... will be different from the first\u201d, seems a coded reference to May announcing her own resignation. He seems to be hinting that a promise to quit from May could persuade Tory Brexiters to back her deal.</p> \n  <p>Not surprisingly, the Telegraph\u2019s take on Johnson\u2019s column is rather different.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1109940772399386624\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am not sure that Chequers summit between <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theresa_may</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a> went as well as she might have hoped <a href=\"https://t.co/DmWrZ4I8SK\">pic.twitter.com/DmWrZ4I8SK</a></p>\u2014 Robert Peston (@Peston) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1109940772399386624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 24, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c98aa20e4b0e8eadf783b6a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-25T11:01:11.188Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Guide to all the Brexit debates so far</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Even those of us who follow Brexit closely are beginning to lose track of quite how many debates on the topic there have been, and what they have all been about. So here is a summary.</p> \n  <p>This is a list of all the key votes this year, either on the deal or on what happens next.</p> \n  <p>There have been two categories of debate. The main ones have been so-called meaningful votes (MV) on the deal, that decide whether or not the deal gets passed.

But, frankly, you must all be getting fed up of those by now, so let\u2019s just move on.</p> \n  <p>This morning Theresa May is chairing cabinet, before addressing MPs this afternoon ahead of a vote that may well see MPs voting to \u201ctake control\u201d of the Brexit process. Quite how the rest of the week is going to pan out remains to be seen, but here are some of the things that may (or may not) get resolved before the end of the week.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Will MPs get indicative votes on the way forward?</strong> Almost certainly, yes, is the answer, but we don\u2019t know if that will be under a process directed by the government, or under a process directed by the House of Commons following the passing of a backbench amendment tonight. And we don\u2019t know how long that process will take, and whether it will produce a majority for anything.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) Will May bring her own deal back to the Commons for a vote? </strong>At the end of last week her colleagues were assuming the vote would be on Tuesday, but that plan seems to have been shelved and now it is not clear whether the vote will even happen at all.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Will May back plans to move towards a softer Brexit, assuming MPs push for this, or will she firm up planning for a no deal?</strong> If she chooses the former option, Brexiters in her party will erupt. If the latter, pro-European ministers may resign en masse. Given May\u2019s history of zig-zagging between the two strategies, it is hard to know where she will go. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/13/brexit-mps-to-vote-on-leaving-the-eu-with-no-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5c897961e4b0cf92e5a5691f#block-5c897961e4b0cf92e5a5691f\">Almost two weeks ago she seemed to take no deal off the table.</a> A week later, she did a U-turn and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/20/brexit-latest-news-letter-article-50-extension-pmqs-theresa-may-bends-to-pressure-from-tory-brexiters-and-rules-out-asking-for-long-article-extension-politics-live?page=with:block-5c91f9cbe4b0480f6c022577#block-5c91f9cbe4b0480f6c022577\">ruled out a long article 50 extension instead.</a></p> \n  <p><strong>4) Will she announce plans to stand down - possibly in return of Tory Brexiters agreeing to back her deal, or possibly in a more chaotic manner if her position becomes unsustainable?</strong></p> \n  <p>Certainly, the pressure on her is not easing up.

      "bodyText": "MPs vote to begin \u2018indicative votes\u2019 on Brexit As not much has happened in the past hour, I\u2019m going to close the blog by republishing my colleague Andrew Sparrow\u2019s excellent snap analysis for those who missed it an hour or so ago. Thanks and goodnight. If Sir Bill Cash is to be believed, MPs have tonight voted to begin a process that will lead to a \u201cconstitutional revolution\u201d. (See 10.59am.) It is impossible to predict quite where this will end up, but Cash\u2019s claim seem hyperbolic. MPs have voted to have more votes on Brexit. Wednesday\u2019s will be the ninth big Brexit debate this year, and the first where supposedly the Commons is \u201ctaking back control\u201d. Sir Oliver Letwin wants MPs to vote on paper, not in the division lobbies, on a wide range of Brexit options. But there are many reasons why this might not have quite the dramatic impact Cash fears. Here are six. 1) MPs have not yet been promised free votes on all, or even some, of the measures, but unless that happens the voting could end up just being a re-run of what has happened in normal votes on Brexit amendments. Some government ministers have said there is no point having indicative votes without giving MPs a free vote, but Theresa May sounds less keen. Speaking for Labour, Sir Keir Starmer implied this afternoon that Labour MPs would get free votes on some propositions but not others. 2) There is no guarantee yet that there will be a majority for any plan - although Letwin may opt for a voting system that eliminates unpopular options until one is left as the winner. 3) The government would not be obliged to accept any plan deemed most popular with MPs, and in fact May strongly hinted this afternoon that she would reject what many expect might emerge as the most widely-supported idea - staying in a customs union with the EU. (See 5.32pm.) Motions passed by the Commons are not binding on the government, and it is very hard for the legislature to force a PM to do something she does not want to do. 4) MPs may well use Wednesday\u2019s debate to pass another motion freeing up more time for indicative votes at a later stage. In other words, the process could become self-perpetuating. This would worry ministers much more, particularly if it led to MPs trying to free up time to allow the Commons to pass legislation. But that could lead to ministers seeking a way of trying to retaliate to sabotage the Letwin process. 5) It is not obvious that all options will be on the ballot anyway.Interestingly one of the most high-profile supporters of a second referendum, Owen Smith, said in the debate this plan should be excluded at this stage. (See 9.19pm.) 6) The prospect of MPs trying to push May towards a softer Brexit could possibly help her, by persuading Tory Brexiters to back her plan in a vote on Thursday to prevent Brexit being watered down. There is no guarantee that this will happen, but it is not impossible. Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall seems chirpy: And on this note, I\u2019m wrapping up. Thanks for tuning in, good night. Here a rather eerie observation from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar: My colleagues Heather Stewart, Jessica Elgot and Rowena Mason have written a superb analysis of tonight\u2019s events. Here an excerpt: Controlling the parliamentary timetable is usually a key power of the sitting government, but MPs have been drawing up plans to step in after May repeatedly declined to change course, despite her deal being roundly rejected on two occasions. Defending the move, the Tory rebel Dominic Grieve said parliament had been \u201cprevented from doing its ordinary job\u201d by the \u201cstraitjacket\u201d imposed by the government. \u201cSeeing that the government has run into the sand, and has had its deal rejected, we have got to find an alternative,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be nothing that is forbidden to be discussed.\u201d Read the full story here. Arron Banks, the co-founder of the Leave.EU campaign, meanwhile seems to have come to the conclusion that Remain is better than May\u2019s deal. In the eyes of Conservative MP Nick Boles, the night has been a resounding success for parliamentary democracy. Twitter is flooded with projections for what might happen on Wednesday. This from the Daily Mail\u2019s deputy political editor John Stevens: Various MPs are already busy sharpening their knives. One does wonder what the ERG will think of the \u201ccompromise\u201d mentioned here. Commenting on tonight\u2019s votes in the Commons and the resignations of three ministers, Guto Bebb MP, leading supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, said: The scale of the Government\u2019s defeat and the principled resignations of ministers Richard Harrington, Alistair Burt and Steve Brine tonight are more nails in the coffin of a Brexit deal that very few in the country or Parliament have ever wanted. The Prime Minister has now lost control of this process. What is needed now in this national emergency is not more posturing or playing roulette with people\u2019s lives but to give Parliament the time and space needed to work out what Brexit means, as well as begin preparing for important democratic elections to the European Parliament. When it becomes clear that any form of Brexit will let down everyone - no matter how they voted in 2016 - MPs will decide the only way out of this crisis is to hand the final decision back to the British people. While some see a parliamentary revolution in tonight\u2019s passing of the Letwin amendment, others are more concerned about the potentially now more likely prospect of a general election, now that the Government has lost even more control, and MPs in favour of a soft Brexit or a second referendum will have a day on the decks next Wednesday. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg seems convinced that this is now increasingly possible, and writes: Tonight could be the official start of a journey to a softer Brexit led by a majority in Parliament, Brexiteers beginning to back down in earnest, or the start of the next stage of a standoff between the government and Parliament that could only end with a \u2018democratic event\u2019 - code in Whitehall for what you and me would normally call an election. Full story below. Henry Newman, director of Open Europe, seems to agree. Evening everyone, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Andrew Sparrow and will be rounding up some reactions to this zinger of a night in the Commons. Insults were hurled, birthday songs were sung and a whole host of things did not quite go as planned - in particular for Ed Vaizey MP, who apparently got his amendments confused. If Sir Bill Cash is to be believed, MPs have tonight voted to begin a process that will lead to a \u201cconstitutional revolution\u201d. (See 10.59am.) It is impossible to predict quite where this will end up, but Cash\u2019s claim seem hyperbolic. MPs have voted to have more votes on Brexit. Wednesday\u2019s will be the ninth big Brexit debate this year, and the first where supposedly the Commons is \u201ctaking back control\u201d. Sir Oliver Letwin wants MPs to vote on paper, not in the division lobbies, on a wide range of Brexit options. But there are many reasons why this might not have quite the dramatic impact Cash fears. Here are six. 1) MPs have not yet been promised free votes on all, or even some, of the measures, but unless that happens the voting could end up just being a re-run of what has happened in normal votes on Brexit amendments. Some government ministers have said there is no point having indicative votes without giving MPs a free vote, but Theresa May sounds less keen. Speaking for Labour, Sir Keir Starmer implied this afternoon that Labour MPs would get free votes on some propositions but not others. 2) There is no guarantee yet that there will be a majority for any plan - although Letwin may opt for a voting system that eliminates unpopular options until one is left as the winner. 3) The government would not be obliged to accept any plan deemed most popular with MPs, and in fact May strongly hinted this afternoon that she would reject what many expect might emerge as the most widely-supported idea - staying in a customs union with the EU. (See 5.32pm.) Motions passed by the Commons are not binding on the government, and it is very hard for the legislature to force a PM to do something she does not want to do. 4) MPs may well use Wednesday\u2019s debate to pass another motion freeing up more time for indicative votes at a later stage. In other words, the process could become self-perpetuating. This would worry ministers much more, particularly if it led to MPs trying to free up time to allow the Commons to pass legislation. But that could lead to ministers seeking a way of trying to retaliate to sabotage the Letwin process. 5) It is not obvious that all options will be on the ballot anyway. Interestingly one of the most high-profile supporters of a second referendum, Owen Smith, said in the debate this plan should be excluded at this stage. (See 9.19pm.) 6) The prospect of MPs trying to push May towards a softer Brexit could possibly help her, by persuading Tory Brexiters to back her plan in a vote on Thursday to prevent Brexit being watered down. There is no guarantee that this will happen, but it is not impossible. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Jedidaja Otte is now taking over. These are from Hannah White, deputy director of the Institute for Government. Here is the full text of what Jeremy Corbyn said in his point of order a moment ago. Mr Speaker, I would like to congratulate the house for taking control. The government\u2019s approach has been an abject failure and this house must now find a solution. So I pay tribute to [Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn] and others, who have worked to achieve tonight\u2019s result. The government must take this process seriously. We do not know what the house will decide on Wednesday. But I know there are many members of this house who have been working for alternative solutions, and we must debate those to find a consensus. And this house must also consider whether any deal should be put to the people for a confirmatory vote. Where this government has failed, this house must, and I believe will, succeed. The SNP\u2019s Angus MacNeil asks, if the Commons cannot reach a decision on Wednesday, whether more time will be allowed for the indicative votes process. Bercow urges him to take things one step at a time. The Tory Brexiter Sir Bill Cash says that what has been agreed by the Commons is \u201ca constitutional revolution\u201d and that the house will will live to regret it. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, asks Bercow if he will set up a committee to ensure that the indicative votes process runs smoothly on Wednesday. Bercow says Oliver Letwin will take charge of the process, and he says he is sure Letwin will want to ensure it runs properly. Patrick McLoughlin, the Conservative former chief whip, says Bercow recently sent a letter to MPs saying they should treat each other with respect. Was Bercow following that in what he said about Greg Hands? Bercow says, if he caused offence, he is happy to apologise. He did not think Hands would mind, he says. Jeremy Corbyn makes a point of order to praise the house for taking control. Where the government has failed, the house must succeed, he says. The Tory Brexiter David Davies says Sir Oliver Letwin has now installed himself as a jobbing prime minister. How can he be held to account? John Bercow, the speaker, tries to quell the noise. He urges the Tory MP Greg Hands to be quiet, saying Hands was once a whip, and not a very good one. That provokes even more jeering. The main motion has now been passed by 327 votes to 300 - a majority of 27. That just reinforces the Letwin vote, because the main motion is now basically the Letwin amendment. Here is an Institute for Government explainer on indicative votes. The government has issued this response to the defeat on Letwin. A spokesman for the Brexit department said: It is disappointing to see this amendment pass, as the government made a clear commitment to provide a process to find a majority in parliament for a way forward this week. This amendment instead upends the balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous, unpredictable precedent for the future. While it is now up to parliament to set out next steps in respect of this amendment, the government will continue to call for realism \u2013 any options considered must be deliverable in negotiations with the EU. Parliament should take account of how long these negotiations would take, and if they\u2019d require a longer extension which would mean holding European parliamentary elections. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston MPs are now voting on the main motion, as amended. Essentially this is a rerun of the vote on Letwin. MPs have voted down the Beckett amendment by 314 votes to 311 - a majority of three. And here is the full list of MPs who voted against Letwin. They include eight Labour MPs. Thirty Conservative MPs voted for the Letwin amendment. Here is the full list. The full list of MPs who voted for Letwin is here. Here is Graeme Cowie, a Commons library clerk specialising in Brexit, on the Beckett amendment. As well as Richard Harrington, the Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt and the health minister Steve Brine have also resigned because they voted for the Letwin amendment, government sources have confirmed. MPs are now voting on Dame Margaret Beckett\u2019s amendment. Here is the full text. At end, add \u201cand orders that, in the event that the UK comes within seven calendar days of leaving the European Union without a deal, the government must make arrangements within two sitting days, or if this house has been adjourned for more than four days to arrange for the House to be recalled under standing order no. 13 (Earlier meeting of the House in certain circumstances) for this purpose, for a minister of the crown to move a motion on whether this house approves the UK leaving the EU without a deal and on whether the UK government should be required to request an extension of the period in article 50(3) of the treaty on European Union in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit and to give time for parliament to determine a different approach.\u201d MPs have backed the Letwin amendment by 329 votes to 302 - a majority of 27. That is a much bigger margin of victory than many people were expecting. Here is Harrington\u2019s resignation letter. According to Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh, the Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt, another pro-European, is also voting for the Letwin amendment. The government has confirmed that Richard Harrington has resigned as business minister. He will be voting for the amendment. Harrington has been on the verge of leaving the government for some weeks now. Recently he effectively challenged the PM to sack him, as he praised the Airbus boss for describing the government\u2019s handling of Brexit as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. Here is the text of the Letwin amendment. At end, add \u201cand, given the need for the house to debate and vote on alternative ways forward, with a view to the government putting forward a plan for the house to debate and vote on, orders that \u2013 (a) Standing order no. 14(1) (which provides that government business shall have precedence at every sitting save as provided in that order) shall not apply on Wednesday 27 March; (b) precedence on that day shall be given to a motion relating to the business of the house in connection with matters relating to the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union other than any business of the house motion relating to the consideration by the house of a motion under Section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, and then to motions relating to that withdrawal and the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union other than any motion moved under Section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018; (c) if more than one motion related to the business of the house is tabled, the speaker shall decide which motion shall have precedence; d) the speaker shall interrupt proceedings on any business before the business of the house motion having precedence at 2.00 pm on Wednesday 27 March and call a member to move that motion; (e) debate on that motion may continue until 3.00 pm on Wednesday 27 March at which time the speaker shall put the questions necessary to dispose of proceedings on the motion including the questions on amendments selected by the speaker which may then be moved; (f) when those proceedings have been concluded, the speaker shall call a member to move one of the other motions having precedence; (g) any proceedings interrupted or superseded by this order or an order arising from the business of the house motion may be resumed or (as the case may be) entered upon and proceeded with after the moment of interruption on Wednesday 27 March.\u201d The debate is over. Labour decides not to move its amendment. That means MPs go straight on to the Letwin amendment, which is being voted on now. This means, if the government does get defeated on Letwin, the result will get onto the 10 o\u2019clock news. Richard Harrington, the pro-European business minister, has resigned, the BBC says. Barclay says, if MPs do not pass the withdrawal agreement this week, they risk a longer article 50 extension. But, if MPs vote for the deal, the UK can be out of the EU within weeks, he says. Ken Clarke, the pro-European, asks Barclay when the government will schedule its own indicative votes process. Barclay says these questions were addressed at the start of the debate. He says Labour criticised the government for not committing to definitely accepting the results of the indicative votes process. But Sir Keir Starmer said Labour would not automatically accept the results either, he says. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is winding up for the government now. He says the central question at stake is, who controls the order paper? He says the government has promised its own version of indicative votes. The SNP\u2019s Stephen Gethins intervenes. Will Barclay be voting for the case he is making in his speech? (Two weeks ago Barclay defended the government motion saying article 50 should be extended at the despatch box, and then voted against it in a free vote.) Barclay says defends his speech in the debate two weeks ago, saying he criticised amendments that he voted against. Sir Oliver Letwin says, if the government objects to the amendment coming from a backbencher, it could adopt it itself. Barclay says David Lidington addressed this argument earlier. Chapman says indicative votes should not include unacceptable options, like no deal, or \u201cunicorns\u201d, like the Brady amendment. Jenny Chapman, the shadow Brexit minister, is now winding up for the opposition. She says different MPs have different views on how indicative votes could be carried out. She says the Labour amendment and the Letwin amendment both avoid being prescriptive on this point. From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall The SNP\u2019s Tommy Sheppard is speaking now. He says ministers complain that the Letwin amendment would alter the balance of power between the executive and the legislature. That is exactly what it should be passed, he says. In the debate Owen Smith is speaking now. He says he made the case for a second referendum when he challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership unsuccessfully in 2016. Speaking in favour of the Lewin amendment, he says he is worried that, if there are indicative votes, the government will try to \u201cbamboozle\u201d MPs by offering them a whole smorgasbord of options, including a second referendum. But that would be \u201ctricksy\u201d and \u201cdeceitful\u201d, he says, because a second referendum is a process matter, not an eventual outcome. He says he hopes the speaker would not allow this. In a fraught meeting of Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group tonight, the group\u2019s chair Jacob Rees-Mogg told supporters he would back the prime minister\u2019s deal if May could secure the support of the DUP. Inside the room however, the loudest thumping on the desk came after an emotional speech by the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson railing against the deal, saying it could see Northern Ireland separated from Great Britain under the terms of the backstop. MPs leaving the room were in anxious disagreement about the path ahead. \u201cWe have got to make them see sense and see that we could lose Brexit forever if we vote this down,\u201d one MP said. Another said they did not feel now was the moment to cave. \u201cIf we give in now, we will never know what we could have achieved,\u201d another said. \u201cI am appalled by it all and disgusted and the British people are never going to forgive us.\u201d Nick Boles, one of the Conservative MPs who has backed the Letwin amendment, says he was not impressed by David Lidington\u2019s offer at the start of the debate of an alternative government procedure. (See 6.10pm.) Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is urging MPs to back the Letwin amendment. This is what the Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke thinks about the prospect of pro-European ministers resigning to vote for the Letwin amendment. At various stages in the Brexit process there have been reports about pro-European ministers threatening to resign en masse if they don\u2019t get some concession from the government. Those threats have always been withdrawn - normally (but not always) after Number 10 shifted a bit towards what the pro-Europeans wanted. According to ITV\u2019s Robert Peston, something similar seems to be happening again. Steve Baker, one of the Tory Brexiter invited to Chequers yesterday, says he and his colleagues are not calling themselves \u201cGrand Wizards\u201d. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, who revealed the use of the nickname (see 7.44pm), says it was never intended to be derogatory. This is from the Conservative MP Damian Collins, who says he will vote for the Letwin amendment tonight. Collins was not one of the 15 Tories who defied the whip to vote for the Hilary Benn indicative votes amendment two weeks ago. This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. A government source has denied Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s claim that Theresa May suggested splitting the vote on the withdrawal agreement from the vote on the political declaration when they met at lunchtime earlier. (See 3.06pm.) The source said it was simply being explained to Labour side that the EU summit conclusions published last week - which could see article 50 extended to May 22 - referred only to the withdrawal agreement. \u201cIt was a clarification that came up in the course of a wider conversation,\u201d the source said. The source said that in order to satisfy the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, the Commons \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d had to cover both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy is speaking in the debate now. The government must rule out no deal, she says. Asked why by someone on the government side, she says she recently spoke to a constituent whose son is on a waiting list for an EU medical trial. She says she was desperately worried about how a no-deal Brexit could stop her son being included. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. George Osborne, the Tory former chancellor and now Evening Standard editor, is among the many on Twitter pointing out that the most senior Tory Brexiters have, according to one report (see 7.44pm), acquired a nickname used by the leaders of the Ku Klux Klan. Back in the debate Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, says Lidington\u2019s argument against the Letwin amendment was \u201chopelessly confused\u201d. Lidington said the government was opposed to the amendment offering an indicative votes process, but the government was also saying it would do the same if the Letwin amendment failed. This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European, is speaking now. He says his is the second name on the Letwin amendment. But, unlike Letwin, he wants a second referendum, he says. He says he thinks Brexit is a mistake of historic proportions. He says he also disagrees with Letwin on May\u2019s deal. Grieve says he thinks it will deliver a third-rate outcome. If MPs could vote against it by a majority of 230, that suggests a fundamental error has been made, he says. He says there has been a tendency to close debate down on the grounds that MPs must honour the result of the referendum. He says he has been an MP for long enough to have heard this case before. In the New Labour era, when Tony Blair had a huge majority, some people even suggested there was no need for second reading votes on bills. Bills should just go through on the nod, it was said. But, Grieve says, in a democracy you should never close down debate. He says the mess we are in is at least in part due to the way debate has been closed down. One of the tendencies that has crept in throughout the whole of this debate ever since the referendum result came out has been a tendency to close down debate on the basis that it is not proper to pursue it because the referendum result must act as a diktat which prevents such debate taking place. You cannot have a working democracy where you close down debate ... To argue that the referendum result imposes a permanency which cannot be challenged is, in my judgment, entirely wrong and when I look at the mess into which we\u2019ve got ourselves, it does appear to me to be at least in part the consequence of pushing this argument and thereby preventing democratic process working. Grieve says excessive respect for the 2016 referendum result has stopped MPs debating Brexit options properly. He says he thinks the Commons has an exceptional capacity to find solutions. But a straightjacket has been imposed on what is acceptable in debate. Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty says marches and petitions are part of that too. Grieve agrees. He says he was at the march on Saturday, and the good humour of the crowd was striking. He says that compares with the \u201crabidity\u201d of some Brexiters. Beckett says, since Theresa May said in her statement earlier that \u201cunless this house agrees to it, no deal will not happen\u201d (see 5.32pm), she thought the government would accept her amendment. But it has not agreed to do so, she says. Dame Margaret Beckett, the Labour former foreign secretary, is speaking in the debate now. She says her amendment will ensure the UK does not leave the EU unless MPs vote for it. You can read all the amendments in full, including Beckett\u2019s, on the order paper (pdf). Back in the debate Sir Nicholas Soames, the Conservative former minister, is speaking now. He says he will vote for the Letwin amendment. But he stresses that he has voted for Brexit more often than some of the high-profile Brexiter rebels who have voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal. He says he is \u201ctruly distraught\u201d at what Brexit has done to the country. Parliament should now do its duty, and bring these matters to a conclusion, he says. Talking of the rebel Brexiters invited to Chequers yesterday (Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Steve Baker, Dominic Raab, David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith), the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg says apparently people are calling them the \u201cGrand Wizards\u201d. They have been meeting, she says. Obviously you would never expect Kuenssberg to name her source, but anyone familiar with the work of Boris Johnson will know that he is very fond of the \u201cnailing jelly to the wall\u201d metaphor. The SNP\u2019s Stephen Gethins is speaking in the debate now. He says Theresa May invited a small, elitist group of Brexiters to Chequers yesterday, all of whom have prompted a project that has failed. Anna Soubry, the former Conservative who defected to the Independent Group, says many Conservative MPs are facing their constituency annual general meeting at the moment. They are more worried about what their local activists think than about the national interest. Gethins says Soubry knows the Conservative party better than he does. The Guardian has just published an article by Michael Heseltine, the former Conservative deputy prime minister, which reads like a version of the speech he gave at the People\u2019s Vote march on Saturday. Here is the article. Here is an extract. As I told marchers at last Saturday\u2019s demonstration in London, I dismiss with contempt the image of us as an island wrapped in a union jack, glorying in the famous phrase that captured, for so many, Winston Churchill\u2019s spirit of defiance in 1940: \u201cVery well, alone\u201d. I was there. I saw our army evacuated, our cities bombed, our convoys sunk. Churchill did everything in his power to end this isolation. Alone was never Churchill\u2019s hope or wish: it was his fear ... Margaret Thatcher would have been appalled to see Britain excluded from the top table. Theresa May dashed across the Channel last week, only to be excluded from a meeting of our former partners, and presented with a take-it-or-leave-it offer. That is what the Brexiteers have done to our country: a national humiliation, made in Britain, made by Brexit. And here is the full speech. Letwin says MPs should allow themselves a couple of days to do what should have been done over a couple of years. He says he thinks it would make sense to start by allowing MPs who support various options, like a people\u2019s vote, or Norway plus, or whatever. He says the Speaker has a lot of experience at choosing amendments that have support in the house for debate. He says he is opposed to revoking article 50, but he accepts it is a serious option. My colleague Jessica Elgot says some supporters of a second referendum are arguing that this should not be an option in indicative votes, because that is a process option not an outcome option. Letwin says he thinks he will have to press his amendment to a vote tonight. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, intervenes. He asks what system would be used to decide what system MPs can agree on. He says he thinks the single transferrable vote system would be best. Letwin says this could be discussed on Wednesday. But he says he thinks it would be best for MPs to vote on all options at the same time, voting on paper, so the Commons can determine which ideas have a lot of support, and which don\u2019t. He says that would deal with the problems that might arise if people vote sequentially. After that, there could be further votes, he says. This is from the Press Association\u2019s Richard Wheeler. Letwin says he is surprised to find himself in the role of rebel. He always used to be a very loyal MP, he says. And he says, although he voted remain, he thinks the result of the referendum should be honoured. In the past he has tried to bring Tory backbenchers together, he says. He also says he has voted for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, and will continue to do so. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative who has tabled the key indicative votes amendment, is speaking now. He says people have said that his amendment would overturn an ancient constitutional principle. But he says the principle that government business takes precedence in Commons business only dates back to 1906. (Letwin\u2019s amendment would suspend this rule for a day, on Wednesday, so as to allow the start of the indicative votes process.) Starmer says he used to say the PM was surviving by the week. Then he said she was surviving by the day. Now she is surviving by the hour, he says. He ends by urging MPs to back the Letwin amendment so they can take back control. This is from Iain Anderson, a Brexit-watcher, PR professional and former Tory adviser. In a very close division, 310 votes might not be enough. Two weeks ago the Hilary Benn amendment, also calling for an indicative votes process, was defeated by 314 votes to 312. Here is the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on where we are with the Letwin vote tonight. See 6.18pm for more on this aspect. Back in the debate Ken Clarke, the pro-European, asks Starmer if Labour will allow its MPs a free vote during the indicative votes process. He says this is what happened in 1972 when the government passed the legislation taking the UK into Europe. Starmer says, if the Letwin amendment is passed, Labour will decide what it will do. But the party does not know what the options might be. If one option were to be a no-deal Brexit, of course Labour would whip against it, he says. And he says, if MPs backed that, Labour would still not support it. Starmer says Labour MPs will not necessarily be given a free vote on all indicative vote options. About half an hour ago Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European, mentioned reports saying the cabinet has been taking Brexit decisions based on what is best for the Conservative party, not what is best for the country. (See 6pm.) The Times columnist Rachel Sylvester has just published a column (paywall) with more on this charge. Here is an extract. I am told that the minutes of the cabinet meeting contain at least five references to the Tories\u2019 narrow political concerns. According to the official account, written by Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, ministers discussed how the government is \u201ccommitted to delivering Brexit \u2014 not to do so would be damaging to the Conservative party\u201d. And in a clear sign of the political nature of the discussion chaired by the prime minister, the minutes end with the words: \u201cThe Conservative party wants to stay in government and get councillors elected. The arguments in parliament could jeopardise that.\u201d It is extremely unusual for such language to creep into a civil service note \u2014 partisan debates are supposed to be limited to special political cabinet meetings from which officials are excluded. In fact the tone of the minutes was so extraordinary that the issue was raised at this morning\u2019s cabinet meeting by ministers who stressed the importance of governing in the national rather than the party interest. This was, however, part of a pattern. One Whitehall source says: \u201cIn recent weeks there have been an increasing number of mentions in cabinet minutes about how Brexit has to be delivered for the sake of the Conservative party. That will be damning when the public inquiry into Brexit happens. The civil service are now finding ways of ensuring that the political decisions that are being taken will one day be fully understood.\u201d Starmer says he thinks the government will lose the debate on the Letwin amendment tonight. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is now responding for Labour. He says the government\u2019s position seems to be that it sort of sees the case for indicative votes, but disagrees with them too. Turning to the Labour amendment, he says Labour is not criticising anything in the withdrawal agreement. He says he hopes this means Labour now supports the withdrawal agreement. Lidington is now talking about the statutory instrument laid by the government today changing the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act to take account of the fact that Brexit has been delayed. He says the SI contains two alternative new dates, to reflect what was agreed in Brussels last week. Sir Oliver Letwin intervenes. He says, if the government\u2019s only objection to the amendment is that it is not a government one, ministers could have accepted it as a government amendment. He tells Lidington he could just offer to adopt the amendment, and hold the same debate on Wednesday, in the same way. Lidington says he cannot offer more on that now. But Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, may be able to say more when he winds up the debate, Lidington says. Sarah Newton, the Conservative who resigned as a minister earlier this month so she could vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit, tells Lidington it would be easier just to accept the Letwin amendment. Lidington says the Letwin amendment would disrupt the balance between the legislature and the executive. Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting says Lidington cannot persuade MPs not to vote for Letwin, on the grounds that something similar will be available, without being able to say when the debate will be, for how long it will last, and what will be on the order paper. Ken Clarke says, given what Lidington has just announced, the government is promising what Letwin proposes. So why don\u2019t they just agree to set aside Wednesday for indicative votes. Lidington says, until the Letwin amendment is put to a vote, the government won\u2019t know if Wednesday is available. Lidington says, if the Letwin amendment is defeated, the government will set aside time for a debate later this week intended to allow MPs to find a way forward. Following consultation, further time might be set aside for further debates he says. But if the Letwin amendment is carried, Wednesday will be set aside for this process, he says. Asked if the government will allow free votes, Lidington says it is too early to say. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, asks if the government is committing to indicative votes this week. Lidington says, if the Letwin amendment gets defeated, the government will set aside time for a debate this week. Labour\u2019s Liz Kendall ask, if Letwin falls and the government holds a debate, whether the government will choose the options for debate. Lidington says the government will not choose the options. But the government will not be silent either. This is from Nick Boles, one of the Conservative MPs backing the Letwin amendment. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, says he thinks the case for revoking article 50 is getting stronger. He says he is concerned by reports that the cabinet has been influenced by what is best for the Conservative party, not what is best by the country. Lidington says the PM has always been guided by the national interest. He says abiding by the result of the 2016 referendum is in the national interest. The BBC\u2019s Norman Smith thinks we could get the third meaningful vote on Thursday. The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart describes Lidington as \u201cthe putative prime minister\u201d. He is the second MP to joke about the weekend newspaper stories saying Lidington was being lined up as a caretaker prime minister. He could not do a worse job than May, Wishart says. He asks Lidington if he accepts revoking article 50 is an option. Lidington says he does not accept that. He says the march and the petition show some people have a strong desire to remain. But you cannot ignore the views of the 17.4m people who voted leave, he says. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, is now opening the Brexit debate. It is next steps six, or NS6. If you want reminding what all the others were, there is a summary here. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he has selected three amendments for the Brexit debate. 1) Labour\u2019s amendment. This calls on the government \u201cto provide sufficient parliamentary time this week for this house to find a majority for a different approach\u201d. 2) Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment. This calls for Commons business on Wednesday to be set aside for a series of indicative votes. It does not specify what options will be voted on, or how the votes will take place. 3) Dame Margaret Beckett\u2019s amendment. This says that if the UK is seven calendar days from leaving without a deal, the house should be recalled to consider a motion on whether or not MPs approve such a move. Theresa May\u2019s statement is now over. On a point of order, Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle asks what would be the point of indicative votes given May has said she will not abide by the results. John Bercow, the Speaker, says that is an \u201cextremely important point\u201d. But he cannot rule on it now, he says. Here are the main points from what Theresa May said in her opening statement, and in her responses to MPs. It hasn\u2019t been a great success. She angered the DUP by suggesting the politicians in Northern Ireland were to blame for article 50 being extended, she disappointed MPs hoping that she was genuinely committed to indicative votes, and some of what she said about the possibility of a long Brexit delay seemed to contradict what she was saying last week. Oh, and she also had to issue what was effectively a non-apology apology. On the plus side, unless I missed it, no Conservative called for her to resign. Given that there were stories in yesterday\u2019s Sunday papers claiming a Tory coup was already underway, that probably counts as an achievement. Here are the main points. May said she did not yet have the support to win a third meaningful vote. But she implied she was hoping that would change by the end of the week. She said: Mr Speaker, I continue to believe that the right path forward is for the United Kingdom to leave the EU as soon as possible with a deal, now on 22nd May. But it is with great regret that I have had to conclude that as things stand, there is still not sufficient support in the house to bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote. I continue to have discussions with colleagues across the house to build support, so that we can bring the vote forward this week, and guarantee Brexit. May implied that she decided to delay Brexit primarily because the absence of an executive in Northern Ireland meant it was not ready for a no-deal Brexit. She said: And I requested a short extension to the article 50 process to 30th June. I regret having to do so. I wanted to deliver Brexit on 29th March. But I am conscious of my duties as prime minister to all parts of our United Kingdom and of the damage to that union leaving without a deal could do when one part of it is without devolved government and unable therefore to prepare properly. This is not an argument that May has made in public before. The DUP is to a large extent to blame for the fact that Northern Ireland does not have a power-sharing executive (although it claims it\u2019s the fault of Sinn F\u00e9in), and DUP MPs like Nigel Dodds (see 4.07pm) and Sammy Wilson (see 4.32pm) responded angrily. She claimed that passing the Letwin amendment tonight would unbalance \u201cour democratic institutions\u201d. She said: The amendment in the name of [Oliver Letwin] seeks to provide for this process by taking control of the order paper. I continue to believe doing so would be an unwelcome precedent to set, which would overturn the balance of our democratic institutions. So the government will oppose this amendment this evening. She said she was \u201csceptical\u201d about whether an indicative votes process could deliver a solution to Brexit and she refused to commit to accepting any outcome indicative votes might produce. The government is committed to trying to find a consensus in parliament if May\u2019s deal does not get passed, although it has not given details of how it will do this yet and it has generally not been referring to \u201cindicative votes\u201d. May said the commitment still stood. But she went on: I must confess that I am sceptical about such a process of indicative votes. When we have tried this kind of thing in the past, it has produced contradictory outcomes or no outcome at all. There is a further risk when it comes to Brexit, as the UK is only one half of the equation and the votes could lead to an outcome that is unnegotiable with the EU. No government could give a blank cheque to commit to an outcome without knowing what it is. So I cannot commit the government to delivering the outcome of any votes held by this house. But I do commit to engaging constructively with this process. She implied she would reject calls for the UK to stay in the customs union (see 4.04pm) and calls for a second referendum (4.42pm) even if MPs backed them in indicative votes. She implied that a lengthy article 50 extension was still an option. This was a prospect she seemed to rule out last Wednesday. But today she said: The bottom line remains, if the house does not approve the withdrawal agreement this week, and is not prepared to countenance leaving without a deal we will have to seek a longer extension. This would entail the UK having to hold European elections. And it would mean that we will not have been able to guarantee Brexit. She also described this option as a \u201cslow Brexit\u201d. She claimed in her opening statement that a no-deal Brexit would only happen if MPs vote for it. She said: We must confront the reality of the hard choices before us. Unless this house agrees to it, no deal will not happen. But, when pressed on this, she refused to confirm that a no-deal Brexit would only happen if MPs voted for it (see 5pm), and she insisted she was not taking no deal off the table. (See 4.30pm.) She sought to repair the damage done to her relations with MPs by her speech last week, in which she blamed them for blocking Brexit, by saying she respected people who disagreed with her. She said: Mr Speaker, this is the first chance I have had to address the House since my remarks last Wednesday evening. I expressed my frustration with our collective failure to take a decision, but I know that many members across this house are frustrated too. We all have difficult jobs to do. People on all sides of the debate hold passionate views and I respect those differences. I would also like to thank all of those colleagues that have supported the deal so far, and those that have taken the time to meet with me to discuss their concerns. Later, in the face of further criticism over what she said, she said she \u201cregrets\u201d the impression she gave. (See 5.18pm.) She refused to confirm that she intends to lead the next stage of the Brexit negotiations. (See 5.21pm.) She said MPs would vote on the statutory instrument changing the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act on Wednesday. The SNP\u2019s Lisa Cameron asks if May intends to lead the next phase of the Brexit negotiations. May says she has always said there is a job to be done, and she intends to carry on doing it. May refuses to confirm that she intends to lead the next stage of the Brexit negotiations. May says it was never her intention for her speech last week to be seen as an attack on MPs and she says she \u201cregrets\u201d if it is seen like that. Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips says this is all about a psychodrama in the Conservative party. She says May constantly disappoints her. As just an observer, it doesn\u2019t seem very constructive to me at all, but what did seem constructive was all the meetings she had over the weekend and the people, sorry, men, she invited to those meetings. What comes out this morning shows without any doubt to anyone any more if anyone even had any left, this is just some psychodrama in the Tory party. And every time I think the prime minister does actually have a duty, she totally disappoints me. This is about whether [Boris Johnson] can become the prime minister and it\u2019s writ for all to see. This has got to end. If we have indicative votes and we come up with a new way for the political declaration, how can [the PM] guarantee any of that will happen, because it won\u2019t be her? Labour\u2019s Paula Sheriff says she asked May last week to dial down the hate. But May responded with a \u201cdespicable\u201d speech attacking MPs. What will May do now to dial down the hate? May says in her speech last week she was expressing her frustration. She says, after their conversation, she took action to ensure some of the things Sheriff mentioned were investigated. May says she will take care about the language she uses. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, says he welcomes the line in May\u2019s statement saying, unless the Commons agrees, no deal will not happen. Does that mean there will only be a no-deal Brexit if MPs vote for it? May says MPs must back her deal if they want to avoid no deal. The Tory Brexiter Martin Vickers asks May for an assurance that she will not agree a further, long extension of article 50. May says she wants the UK to leave the EU soon. She says a long extension would involve the UK having to participate in the European elections. Constituents would find that unacceptable, she says. May says MPs will vote on the the statutory instrument changing the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act on Wednesday. Chris Leslie, the Independent Group MP, asks May if she is saying she will reject a confirmatory vote if that is what MPs vote for in indicative votes. May says people want a confirmatory vote to have remain on the ballot paper. So it would be a second referendum, she says. And that means it would defy what people voted for in the referendum. May suggests she would refuse to accept a plan for a referendum if MPs back it in indicative votes. Here is the full text of Theresa May\u2019s opening statement. Labour\u2019s Seema Malhotra asks if May is willing to shift her red lines in response to how MPs vote in indicative votes. May says she has aready set out her position on this. The DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson says all of the government\u2019s no-deal planning applies to Northern Ireland. He accuses May in her statement (see 3.36pm) of using Northern Ireland as an excuse for delaying Brexit. Crispin Blunt, the Tory Brexiter, says what May said in her statement about MPs voting against no deal torpedoes her deal. He says it is the most shameful surrender by the UK since Singapore in 1942. May says she is not taking no deal off the table. Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty asks why it is acceptable for May to call three votes on her deal, but for the public to be denied a second vote. May says the Commons has to implement the results of the referendum. Rachel Maclean, a Conservative, asks May to confirm that the government will not hold European elections. People would find that hard to understand. May says she agrees. But she says the only way to be sure of avoiding that is to pass her deal. May says some MPs want her to say what she will do on 11 April if her deal is not passed. And others want her to say she will do whatever MPs ask. The two arguments are not consistent, she says. Sarah Newton, who resigned as disabilities minister earlier this month to vote against no deal, asks if May can say any more about how she will let MPs find a way forward. May says David Lidington will address this in his speech at the start of the debate later. But she says any plan must accept the EU\u2019s unwillingness to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden asks if May regrets what she said about MPs in her speech last week. May says she was trying to make the point that it is the moment for parliament to decide. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, asks May to back away from the Tory manifesto. He says it only came out half way through the campaign. And she dropped one idea in it (the so-called \u201cdementia tax\u201d) very quickly. May says, if Clarke were still a minister, he would not agree to any plan produced by parliament. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves asks May to confirm that, if she does not get her deal passed by 12 April, she will seek a longer extension of article 50. May says she cannot say that she will accept anything that comes up in parliament. All MPs have a duty to deliver on the manifestos on which they were elected, she says. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says May told MPs from the despatch box on 108 occasions that the UK would leave the EU on 29 March. Now the chancellor has opened the door to a second referendum. Has she told him that she does not accept this idea? May says she has not changed her mind on this. She believes MPs must accept the result of the first referendum. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, says May seems to be arguing for the first time that the UK needs extra time to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Why? And he says Leo Varadkar and Michel Barnier have both said there would be no border checks in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Why did May agree to it in the first place? May says, when you look at the detail of what the EU has said, it is clear that EU law says checks would need to be applied. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP, asks if May is ruling out negotiating the UK joining a customs union with the EU. May says there are a number of questions that MPs need to address. What rules would the UK abide by? Would it have to abide by state aid rules? Would it have to accept free movement? She says her manifesto ruled out a customs union. She thinks it is very important for the UK to be able to strike its own trade deals. May suggests she would not accept customs union membership even if MPs were to vote in favour. Theresa Villiers, the Tory Brexiter, asks what would happen at the Irish border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. May says a statement issued by the EU today says that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, all EU laws would have to be complied with. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, the chair of the Brexit committee, says if May does not hold a vote this week, the UK will either have to leave the EU on 12 April, or apply for another extension. What will she do? May says she did say there is not enough support for another meaningful vote at the moment. But she still hopes to get that support, she says. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says people are embarrassed by this government. He asks if May will respect the will of parliament and reject no deal. May says Blackford should accept that the people of Scotland voted to remain in the UK. She says votes in the Commons count. But so do the votes of the 17.4m people who voted to leave the EU. May is responding to Corbyn. She says she gave Corbyn an advance text of her statement. In it, she says she cannot commit to accept the result of anything decided in indicative votes. She says no MP can commit to accepting something that contradicts the manifesto on which they were elected. And MPs have a duty to respect the result of the referendum, she says. Referring to the fact that \u201ca number of people\u201d marched on Saturday, May says Corbyn\u2019s deputy, Tom Watson, went on the march. Corbyn normally goes on marches himself. But he did not on Saturday. Perhaps he was involved but not present, she says. Jeremy Corbyn says the government\u2019s approach to Brexit has become \u201ca national embarrassment\u201d. He says last week\u2019s EU summit was another negotiating failure for May. He says she requested a short extension of article 50, even though David Lidington said that would be \u201creckless\u201d. He says it was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d for May to pit parliament against the people in her speech last week. People are frustrated, he says. He says it is no surprise that people marched against the government. Even leavers are frustrated, he says. He says May\u2019s deal is dead. He says May has united the CBI and the TUC against her deal. He says it is time for parliament to take control. That is why Labour will back the Letwin amendment. He says the speaker said there would have to be significant changes for a third meaningful vote. But there are no significant changes, she says. He says May should not block attempts by MPs to find an alternative way forward. Will May accept any decision by MPs? He says Labour would support a public vote to block no deal or a chaotic Tory deal. It is time for parliament to work together on a plan B, he says. May says this is her first address to MPs since her speech on Wednesday last week, when she blamed them for blocking Brexit. She says she was expressing her frustrations. She says she knows MPs are doing their jobs, and she respects the fact that people have strong views on both sides. May says the government is opposed to the Letwin amendment. She says the government remains committed to trying to see if a Commons consensus can be reached if her deal is not passed. But she says she is \u201csceptical\u201d of this process. In the past when this procedure has been tried, it has produced contradictory conclusions, or no conclusions at all. May says she is \u201csceptical\u201d about whether allowing MPs indicative votes will produce a decision. Theresa May is now making her Commons statement on Brexit and last week\u2019s EU summit. She starts by referring to her letter to Donald Tusk requesting a short article 50 extension. She says she wanted the UK to be able to leave the EU on 29 March. But she says she was conscious of the need to protect the union, and of the damage that a no-deal Brexit could do in Northern Ireland, where there is no executive able to take steps to minimise the risk. She sums up the offer from the EU. She says the government has today laid the statutory instrument changing Brexit date. Brexit date has already changed under international law, she says. She says if MPs fail to pass the statutory instrument, that will create legal uncertainty. But it won\u2019t change the internationally-recognised Brexit date. May says she does not yet have enough support to win a third meaningful vote. I asked Labour why Jeremy Corbyn was opposed to splitting the votes on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. (See 3.06pm.) A party source said Labour would not back something giving \u201czero clarity\u201d about the future, which is why it wants its changes to the political declaration written into law. Andy Shaw, a reader, has got an even more specific answer. He is right. The relevant part of the act is here. And Politics.co.uk\u2019s Ian Dunt is good on this too. This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. Two more questions from BTL. This was raised at the Number 10 lobby briefing and, although the prime minister\u2019s spokesman did not say exactly what was said about the march and the petition, he did not give the impression that a lot of time was spent discussing them, or that they are having much impact on the government\u2019s thinking. The spokesman accepted that there were \u201cstrongly-held views\u201d on Brexit on both sides. But he said the PM\u2019s view was that the country had staged a \u201cvery large democratic exercise\u201d and voted to leave, and that MPs had to honour this. The EU offer is less blunt than that. Read what Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said late on Thursday night (my bold text.) In the first scenario, that is, if the withdrawal agreement is passed by the House of Commons next week, the European Council agrees to an extension until the 22nd of May. In the second scenario, that is, if the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the House of Commons next week, the European Council agrees to an extension until the 12th of April, while expecting the United Kingdom to indicate a way forward. What this means in practice is that, until that date, all options will remain open, and the cliff-edge date will be delayed. The UK government will still have a choice of a deal, no-deal, a long extension or revoking article 50. This implies that if the UK were to pass the deal next week, and then request an extension of article 50 from 12 April until 22 May, that might be feasible. The Labour party has just released this statement about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s meeting with Theresa May at lunchtime. A spokesman said: Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May met for over an hour in parliament and had a frank and comprehensive exchange of views. Jeremy Corbyn made clear there was no basis for bringing back the meaningful vote on Theresa May\u2019s deal for a third time. The Labour leader did not accept the prime minister\u2019s suggestion that the withdrawal agreement could be separated from the political declaration. This is more revealing than these meeting read-out statements often are. Here are the two key lines. Theresa May is considering asking MPs to vote on the withdrawal agreement separately from the political declaration, Labour has revealed. Until now May has treated them both as a package, and MPs have been asked to vote on both together (eg, in the motion for MV2). But the EU summit communique issued last week said that, for the UK to get Brexit extended until 22 May, MPs just had to pass the withdrawal agreement. The EU statement did not mention the political declaration in the context of a vote this week. This is significant because there is little in the withdrawal agreement (which focuses on the transition, the \u00a339bn payment and the backstop) that Labour objects to; most of Labour\u2019s objections to May\u2019s deal relate to the political declaration. The Labour statement does not explain why Corbyn refused to separate the two issues. Corbyn told May she should abandon the third meaningful votes. Corbyn was joined at the meeting by Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip. May was supported by Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Julian Smith, the government chief whip. The Labour team came away with the clear impression that the government would not be bound by any decision of parliament in indicative votes. That is what Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, suggested this morning too. UPDATE: A government source later rejected Corbyn\u2019s claim about May wanting to split the vote on the withdrawal agreement from the vote on the political declaration. See 8.51pm. Here is the Financial Times\u2019 political editor, George Parker, on the choice facing Theresa May. Last month George Eustice resigned as fisheries minister because he was opposed to Theresa May\u2019s willingness to contemplate extending article 50. He is seen as a relative hardliner on Brexiter - he once stood as a Ukip candidate - but in an interview with Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett this morning he said he favoured the Norway option. He explained: The right settlement is somewhere in the space of what\u2019s called the Norway option. It\u2019s the European free trade association. The UK actually invented it in 1959, and we built a coalition of countries, including Norway, but in those days also Austria, Portugal and Sweden and others too. And I think we should rely on existing legal rights under what\u2019s called the EEA treaty, that\u2019s the European Economic Area, like Norway \u2013 but leave the European Union as soon as we can, and effectively become an Efta state, an Efta member instead. That gives us a close economic tie with the European Union - but gives us our independence back. Eustice also said he thought a majority of MPs would \u201cget behind a variant of the Norway option\u201d. (But would Efta want the UK as a member? On Friday the prime minister of Iceland, one of the Efta countries, didn\u2019t sound too keen.) James Forsyth and Katy Balls have a useful cabinet write-up at the Spectator. Here\u2019s an extract. May also appears to be moving more firmly towards ruling out no deal. One minister says that it is the \u2018the first time she has said it so definitively\u2019. This minister says that \u2018it is the issue of the union seems to be what has really convinced her\u2019 of this. On the World at One the housing minister Kit Malthouse dismissed the Letwin plan for indicative votes on Brexit, echoing what Number 10 said about it earlier. (See 1.28pm.) Matlhouse said: I hope members across the house realise that it has significantly detrimental constitutional implications and will vote it down so that we can continue with an orderly, iterative process of reaching consensus across the house rather than a kind of X Factor. From a reader BTL It\u2019s not a silly question at all, but it is one that I answered here last week. Here is some on what happened at cabinet this morning. From the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand From the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford From the Times\u2019 Sam Coates I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. Here are the key points. Number 10 refused to say when the next meaningful vote on Theresa May\u2019s deal would be held. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said it remained the case \u201cthat we will only bring the vote back if we believe that we are in a position to win it\u201d. The spokesman said that the Letwin amendment being debated tonight (see 9.38am) would unbalance the constitution. Asked what the PM thought of the move, the spokesman said: She has said that tying the government\u2019s hands in this way by seeking to commandeer the order paper would have far-reaching implications for the way that the UK is governed and the balance of powers and responsibilities in our democratic institutions. Ministers did not urge May to consider offering to resign at this morning\u2019s cabinet, the spokesman said. Yesterday one report claimed that 11 cabinet ministers wanted May to make way for another leader and that \u201cthe plotters\u201d were planning \u201cto confront May at a cabinet meeting\u201d today. Today the spokesman would not comment on suggestions that her critics did not have the courage of her convictions. Theresa May has spoken to Arlene Foster, the DUP leader. But the DUP has not lifted its opposition to the PM\u2019s deal, the BBC reports. Here is some more from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand on cabinet. I\u2019m just off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 1pm. This is from the BBC Laura Kuenssberg. The cabinet has decided to press ahead with the third vote on Theresa May\u2019s deal tomorrow, ITV\u2019s Paul Brand reports. UPDATE: But it is not confirmed, Number 10 says. John Whittingdale, the Tory Brexiter, has just told BBC News that a lot of his Brexiter colleagues would have \u201cmore confidence\u201d in voting for Theresa May\u2019s deal if they knew she was standing down as PM. This morning\u2019s cabinet is over. Ministers declined to respond to any questions from reporters when leaving Downing Street, the Press Association reports. Readers have posed a whole series of procedural questions BTL. Here are some I hope I can helpfully answer. Why would offering to resign help May get her deal through the Commons? The next phase of the Brexit negotiations will probably end up being longer, more fraught and more important than negotiating the withdrawal, because it will determine the future trade relationship, and Brexiters want a true believer in charge, not someone who voted remain like May. Given that most MPs expect May to be forced out quite soon anyway, an offer to resign may seem to have little merit. But prime ministers often cling on longer than their colleagues, or the commentariat expects, and comments by MPs like Boris Johnson (see 11.26am) suggest a move like this might be a difference - particularly if MPs fear the alternative would be Oliver Letwin or Hilary Benn running Brexit. When will the statutory instrument changing Brexit day be put to a vote? And can it be amended? To delay Brexit until 12 April, the government will have to pass a statutory instrument changing the day of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act. That will have to take place this week, although we have not been told when, yet. The SI cannot be amended, and there is no serious risk of the government losing. Can parliament really bind the hands of the government? Talk of parliament \u201ctaking back control\u201d is journalistic shorthand. The Oliver Letwin amendment would involve the government losing control of what gets debated in the Commons on Wednesday, but any vote for a Brexit plan B would not be binding on the government. At one point Yvette Cooper had an alternative plan for parliament taking back control, involving MPs passing a bill requiring the PM to extend article 50. There are also amendments ordering or instructing the government to do certain things, implying the government would be in contempt of parliament if it ignored them. In reality, though, it is very hard for the Commons to force the executive to do something it does not want to do. For more on this, see the first answer here, and the third answer here Does the withdrawal agreement make a Norway-style Brexit impossible? To make reporting simpler, journalists refer to Theresa May\u2019s deal, but it is important to remember that it comprises two parts: the withdrawal agreement, and the political declaration. Tory critics of the plan are particularly unhappy with the WA, because it includes the backstop. Labour is more unhappy with the PD, because it does not include remaining in the customs union. But the PD is relatively elastic, and with minor changes (that the EU would consent to) it could accommodate a Common Market 2.0 Brexit. How likely is another confidence vote? Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely to call another confidence vote until he thinks there is a chance of getting some Tories, or the DUP, to vote against the government. In the past a handful of pro-European Tories have hinted that they might vote against the government in a confidence motion to prevent a no-deal Brexit, but at least two of those (Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston) have now left the party anyway. There has also been speculation about hardline Brexiters voting with Labour to prevent a soft Brexit, but this might not be logical because it could just result in an election and a Labour government that would pursue a softer Brexit anway. Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, was one of the Brexiters invited to Chequers yesterday for talks with Theresa May about how she might get her deal through parliament. Doubtless readers of his \u00a3275,000-a-year Daily Telegraph column would have liked to have read about what happened, but he did not mention it in the article (paywall) he managed to file yesterday, presumably after his deliberations with the PM. Instead Johnson used it to deliver what sounds like an ultimatum. On every side we are being frightened with false fire. It seems to be that there are two ways forward. If she really wants her deal to go through parliament, the PM could still set out convincing proofs of how the next phase of the negotiations \u2013 when all the key questions are to be settled \u2013 will be different from the first. How will we be able to take back control of our laws? Will we really do free trade deals? And can we really go on with a negotiating team that has so resoundingly failed? If she cannot give that evidence of change \u2013 she should drop the deal, and go back to Brussels, and simply set out the terms that so many on both sides \u2013 remainers and leavers \u2013 now believe are sensible. Extend the implementation period to the end of 2021 if necessary; use it to negotiate a free trade deal; pay the fee; but come out of the EU now \u2013 without the backstop. It is time for the PM to channel the spirit of Moses in Exodus, and say to Pharaoh in Brussels \u2013 LET MY PEOPLE GO. Johnson\u2019s second proposal, that the UK should effectively request a transition without the backstop (the old Malthouse plan, part two - remember that?), is almost certainly a non-starter, because the EU has ruled it out repeatedly. But his first proposal, that May should \u201cset out convincing proofs of how the next phase of the negotiations ... will be different from the first\u201d, seems a coded reference to May announcing her own resignation. He seems to be hinting that a promise to quit from May could persuade Tory Brexiters to back her deal. Not surprisingly, the Telegraph\u2019s take on Johnson\u2019s column is rather different. Even those of us who follow Brexit closely are beginning to lose track of quite how many debates on the topic there have been, and what they have all been about. So here is a summary. This is a list of all the key votes this year, either on the deal or on what happens next. There have been two categories of debate. The main ones have been so-called meaningful votes (MV) on the deal, that decide whether or not the deal gets passed. But there have also been a series of so-called next steps (NS) debates about what happens next, or plan B. Some of these NS debates have taken place under the auspices of the EU Withdrawal Act, which in section 13 directs what must happen in parliament if the withdrawal agreement gets voted down, but others have taken place following promises by the prime minister. Tonight\u2019s debate will be the sixth next steps debate (NS6). Here are the others. MV1- Tuesday 15 January: This was the night Theresa May suffered the biggest government defeat in the era of democratic politics when MPs voted down her Brexit deal for the first time, by a majority of 230. Some 118 Conservatives voted against. NS1 - Tuesday 29 January: May managed to salvage a victory, but only by getting Tory MPs to unite behind the Brady amendment, which said her deal would only be acceptable if the backstop were \u201creplaced\u201d by \u201calternative arrangements\u201d. As well as effectively having to vote against her own deal, May was also defeated when MPs passed the Spelman amendment, ruling out no deal. Some 17 Tories defied the whip to back it. NS2 - Thursday 14 February: May suffered a surprise defeat when what was meant to be non-controversial motion just restating the NS1 result got voted down, by a majority of 45, because hardline Brexiters in the European Research Group did not want to be seen to be endorsing the Spelman result. The vote had little practical effect, but it was humiliating for May, whose defeat was decided entirely by a whipping decision taken by the ERG. NS3 - Wednesday 27 February: Unusually May was on the winning side, as Tory and Labour MPs united to support a backbench amendment committing the government to allowing a vote on extending article 50 if it lost MV2. But it was an amendment tabled by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, underwriting a verbal promise only made by May to stop pro-European ministers resigning en masse. MV2 - Tuesday 12 March: This was the second vote on the deal, taking place after a late-night rush by May to Strasbourg the night before to firm up new assurances with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president. But legal advice from Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, saying the legal risk of being stuck in the backstop remained \u201cunchanged\u201d, torpedoed any hope of victory, and the deal was voted down by a majority of 149, with 75 Tory MPs voting against. NS4 - Wednesday 13 March: This was the debate on ruling out a no-deal Brexit. But the government motion only ruled out no deal on 29 March, and May was defeated twice as MPs voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit for good. Some 17 Tories defied the whip and voted against any no deal in the final vote, with another 29 Tories abstaining, including four cabinet ministers. NS5 - Thursday 14 March: This was the debate where MPs approved, by a majority of 211, a government motion approving an article 50 extension until 30 June if MPs backed May\u2019s deal. Unusually for a Brexit debate, May did not lose a single vote, after the Benn amendment saying parliament should take control was defeated by a majority of two, and a second referendum amendment was rejected by a majority of 249. Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, has also been tweeting about the European commission\u2019s press notice about a no-deal Brexit. (See 10.10am.) The EU is ready for a no-deal Brexit, she is implying. This is from Daniel Ferrie, press spokesman for Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, flagging up a news release issued by the European commission saying it is \u201cincreasingly likely that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a deal on 12 April\u201d. Liam Fox has indicated the government could ignore MPs\u2019 views from indicative Brexit votes this week if parliament\u2019s stated choice goes against the Conservative manifesto, insisting the real choice is still between Theresa May\u2019s deal and no deal, my colleague Peter Walker reports. Katie Perrior, who worked in Number 10 as Theresa May\u2019s director of communications before the 2017 general election, has joined those saying she should announce her resignation. Writing for the Times, Perrior said: Maybe it\u2019s time to stop finding scapegoats and admit that Theresa May and her lack of leadership has made a bad situation worse. With great sadness, it\u2019s time for her to swap her departure date in return for the deal. It\u2019s the least she can do. Yesterday there were reports that cabinet ministers were being invited to spend the hour before cabinet in a reading room looking at papers about the government\u2019s plans for indicative votes. But the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford says that idea has been shelved. You can read all the amendments for this evening\u2019s Brexit debate on the Commons order paper (pdf). The main cross-party indicative votes one has been tabled by Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister. In an interview on the Today programme he said that any votes would be advisory rather than binding on the government and that it could take several rounds of voting to find a majority for any option - if one gets found at all. Asked if it was possible that all options were rejected, he said: Of course I have to accept that. I can\u2019t predict what parliament will do. Good morning. It has become customary at this point on a Monday for me to type out some spiel about how this is the decisive week for Brexit. But, frankly, you must all be getting fed up of those by now, so let\u2019s just move on. This morning Theresa May is chairing cabinet, before addressing MPs this afternoon ahead of a vote that may well see MPs voting to \u201ctake control\u201d of the Brexit process. Quite how the rest of the week is going to pan out remains to be seen, but here are some of the things that may (or may not) get resolved before the end of the week. 1) Will MPs get indicative votes on the way forward? Almost certainly, yes, is the answer, but we don\u2019t know if that will be under a process directed by the government, or under a process directed by the House of Commons following the passing of a backbench amendment tonight. And we don\u2019t know how long that process will take, and whether it will produce a majority for anything. 2) Will May bring her own deal back to the Commons for a vote? At the end of last week her colleagues were assuming the vote would be on Tuesday, but that plan seems to have been shelved and now it is not clear whether the vote will even happen at all. 3) Will May back plans to move towards a softer Brexit, assuming MPs push for this, or will she firm up planning for a no deal? If she chooses the former option, Brexiters in her party will erupt. If the latter, pro-European ministers may resign en masse. Given May\u2019s history of zig-zagging between the two strategies, it is hard to know where she will go. Almost two weeks ago she seemed to take no deal off the table. A week later, she did a U-turn and ruled out a long article 50 extension instead. 4) Will she announce plans to stand down - possibly in return of Tory Brexiters agreeing to back her deal, or possibly in a more chaotic manner if her position becomes unsustainable? Certainly, the pressure on her is not easing up. Here is today\u2019s Sun splash. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Theresa May chairs a cabinet meeting. 12.30pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 3.30pm: May gives a statement to MPs about Brexit and last week\u2019s EU summit. After 5pm: MPs begin the latest Brexit debate. At 10pm they are due to vote on an amendment calling for parliament to take control of the Brexit process.
