The prime minister was challenged on Friday on subjects as varied as crime, Brexit, the abandoned London garden bridge project and the number of children he has fathered. Following a relatively low-key start to the Conservative general election campaign, which has mainly involved Johnson being shepherded around carefully stage-managed events, he endured a one-hour grilling from BBC Radio 5 Live listeners, among other engagements. Johnson appeared uncomfortable on several occasions \u2013 not least when, during an interview on BBC One\u2019s Breakfast programme, he was asked how families across the country could relate to him. He eventually answered: \u201cI have not the faintest idea.\u201d Responding to a Radio 5 Live caller who asked about policies to tackle knife crime, Johnson said an increase in stop-and-search operations when he was London mayor between 2008 and 2016 had allowed 11,000 knives to be taken off the streets. However, this was a total that included weapons seized through means other than stop and search. He also repeated other questionable claims about crime when he was mayor, ones made repeatedly during the Tory leadership race, including that he had consistently reduced the number of murders in London to fewer than 100 a year. When the presenter, Rachel Burden, pointed out that this was wrong \u2013 it happened once during Johnson\u2019s eight years as mayor, with 94 murders in 2014, rising above 100 the next year \u2013 the PM stuck by his claim, saying: \u201cNo. Fewer than 100 for several years running.\u201d On another legacy of his time as mayor, Johnson tried to avoid blame for the cancelled garden bridge project, with losses of more than \u00a350m, saying this was the fault of his Labour successor, Sadiq Khan, for cancelling the scheme.

On Brexit, Johnson repeated his regular complaint that parliament had blocked his deal \u2013 in fact MPs supported the second reading but sought more time to scrutinise it \u2013 and that there would be no checks or paperwork for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK.

And some were merely political attack lines, if none the more accurate for that. Speaking later at a campaign event in Oldham, Greater Manchester, Johnson said Jeremy Corbyn \u201cactually thinks home ownership is a bad idea\u201d, not a view the Labour leader appears to have expressed. He also accused Corbyn of wanting to disband the armed forces, when the furthest Corbyn seems to have gone on this was a generalised wish for more countries to be able to act like Costa Rica and have no army. After his series of media interviews, Johnson travelled to Lancashire, where he unveiled his party\u2019s battlebus in the Labour safe-seat of Oldham West and Royton. He gave a stump speech to a group of party activists in front of the vehicle \u2013 adorned with the slogan: \u201cGet Brexit done, unleash Britain\u2019s potential\u201d \u2013 in a warehouse of the parcel delivery company DPD, which has been criticised in recent years for its couriers\u2019 working conditions. \u201cYou may ask: \u2018Why do we need a bus? Why do we need an election?\u2019 Well, the answer is that parliament is unfortunately paralysed,\u201d said Johnson. He likened parliament to \u201ca blocked artery at the heart of the British body politic\u201d and said that passing his Brexit deal would be like an angioplasty, \u201cunblocking the system and getting us back on our feet\u201d. The Tory party will on Saturday urge people to \u201cvote blue, go green\u201d, pledging a new \u00a3500m fund to protect the world\u2019s oceans and to triple tree-planting rates. \u201cThere is nothing more Conservative than protecting our environment and these measures sit alongside our world-leading commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,\u201d Johnson was set to say. Five questionable assertions Claim: Johnson said that as London mayor he reduced the murder rate to below 100 \u201cseveral years running\u201d. Fact: It was just one year: 2014. Claim: It was \u201cJeremy Corbyn and the Labour party\u201d who were responsible for delaying Brexit beyond 31 October. Fact: Johnson was obliged to seek a new date because of a law drawn up by backbenchers led by the Tory MP Oliver Letwin \u2013 although this was backed by Labour. Claim: The massive losses from the doomed London garden bridge were not his fault. Fact: As mayor of London, Johnson relentlessly pushed the project, despite repeated warnings about its viability. He has yet to fully explain his role in losses totalling more than \u00a350m. Claim: There will be no paperwork for Northern Irish firms exporting goods to the rest of the UK. Fact: This is not what Johnson\u2019s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has said. Claim: Labour, if elected, would have two referendums in 2020 \u2013 on Brexit and Scottish independence. Fact: Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly ruled out a second Scottish independence vote in the first period of government.",

But at the same time, Corbyn\u2019s team knows its path to power may well lie in persuading Sturgeon\u2019s party to support Labour as a minority administration \u2013 and Corbyn himself is instinctively keen on self-determination for small states. Corbyn appeared to suggest his party would not accept another independence referendum in the first term of a Labour government this week \u2013 but aides later clarified his position to say it would not be in the first year or two. Expect this part of the manifesto to have been pored over intensely. Tax and spend John McDonnell has said he will publish a \u201cgrey book\u201d alongside Labour\u2019s manifesto, setting out his costings for the party\u2019s policies and how they will be paid for. He has already said he would raise the top rate of tax to 50p for workers earning more than \u00a3150,000 a year, repeating a 2017 plan; and announced a new tax on media giants to pay for Labour\u2019s broadband plan \u2013 but there may well be more tax changes to come. Labour will be keen to counter the perception, pushed hard by the Conservatives this week, that ordinary taxpayers will end up footing the bill. But it will also want to avoid thinktanks such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies picking holes in its plans.",

This week\u2019s video \u2013 an unblinking 11-second performance in which he threatens to tell Southampton about NHS investment with the uneasy air of someone being forced to recount his kind treatment at the hands of his captors \u2013 is still dwarfed by last week\u2019s attempt (Hancock, in the blustering dawn cold, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s Yorkshire, it\u2019s before seven in the morning, it\u2019s raining ... and we\u2019re ready to go!\u201d, like a failed Top Gear presenter open audition reel), but I think we\u2019ll have plenty more efforts from him before 12 December looms. Mike Gapes \u2013 the man with the defeated air of someone who has been turned away from a city centre Laser Quest because \u201cyou can\u2019t play on your own here, mate, that\u2019s weird\u201d \u2013 has released his campaign poster this week, which is basically just a red and yellow Labour campaign poster with a small disclaimer at the bottom to remind voters that he defected to the party now known as \u201cThe Independent Group For Change\u201d, remember, and also a bizarrely heartbreaking call to arms in the top right corner, reading: \u201cIt will really help me if you display this poster in your window. Thank you.\u201d I don\u2019t know why, but the polite, thin, desperation of this actually makes me weepingly sad. Gapes, politely asking that you display his campaign poster in your window, thanks, for as long as it takes for someone to report him for misrepresentation to the Electoral Commission and he sadly has to go round all the shops and houses in Ilford, and ask that they take them down. \u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant",

      "body": "<p>Few chance encounters have had a greater political impact than Gordon Brown\u2019s fateful meeting with Gillian Duffy on an April morning in Rochdale in 2010. When the then prime minister was caught on a hot mic calling the Labour-voting pensioner a \u201cbigoted woman\u201d \u2013 after she cornered him with complaints about immigrants \u201cflocking\u201d into Britain \u2013 it did not just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-bigotgate-marina-hyde\" title=\"\">sink his floundering campaign</a>. It set the tone for the way immigration would become the most toxic issue in British politics for the decade to come.</p> <p>When New Labour came to power in 1997, just 3% of the public cited immigration as a key issue. By the time of the EU referendum in 2016, that figure was 48%. During those intervening years, the issue came to dominate and distort British politics \u2013 exactly according to the script established by Bigotgate. Brown\u2019s gaffe both consolidated and gave credence to a political coding that would shape everything that came after: the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the Windrush scandal, the EU referendum and the revival of Britain\u2019s far right \u2013 deploying a narrative in which sneering, out-of-touch, big-city politicians who favour foreigners and open borders are hopelessly oblivious to the struggles and the so-called \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d of ordinary working people (who, in this scenario, are always white).</p> <p>The Labour movement still bears the battlescars of Bigotgate, as divisions over immigration cut across party factions. With the Labour party about to release its election manifesto, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/mccluskey-tells-corbyn-defy-calls-extend-freedom-of-movement\" title=\"\">an outburst against free movement</a> of migrants from the leader of Unite the Union, the party\u2019s biggest affiliate, threatens to thwart efforts to move to a more progressive position on the issue.</p> <p>By the time Brown took his ill-fated walkabout in 2010, immigration was already polling as a top concern, overtaking the NHS and only topped by the economy for a few years following the 2008 crash. By then, politicians and the media had shaped a venomous narrative around the volume of new arrivals to the UK, the identity of those coming and why they did so.</p> <p>For more than 30 years, the UK has been at the forefront of a neoliberal economic globalisation that deregulated markets and pared back the state \u2013 deepening the global economic inequalities that produce labour immigration. In the UK, local manufacturing-based economies that supported entire communities were shut down or shipped out. Across the global south, structural adjustment programmes imposed by the west as loan conditions were collapsing national economies. But these harsh economic realities did not appear in our media\u2019s fearmongering accounts of a \u201ctide\u201d of migrants \u201cflooding\u201d into soft-touch Britain on supposedly spurious grounds and overwhelming the country.</p> <p>Just as communities were exposed to the shocks of an unrestrained free market and a shrinking state, they were simultaneously bombarded with stories about \u201cSlovak spongers\u201d and cheating Czechs. Politicians of all stripes fell in line, producing hostile rhetoric and policies in response \u2013 and defining the issue as a reflection of supposed concerns over the exact number of arrivals, the \u201cpace of change\u201d in local communities and the need to exert control over migration. This was the catalyst for David Cameron\u2019s foolish 2010 election pledge to introduce a target figure for \u201cnet migration\u201d \u2013 which the Conservative party failed to meet, again and again, only enflaming public resentment and mistrust over the issue (this impossible target underpinned the Conservative\u2019s hostile environment policy and produced the Windrush scandal).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7cd9236976442770661f2dc2267793c7124026ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cd9236976442770661f2dc2267793c7124026ef/0_0_3000_1944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bigotgate: Gordon Brown talking with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bigotgate: Gordon Brown talking with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the run-up to the EU referendum, called by Cameron to block the popularity of Ukip and silence Tory Eurosceptics, the leave campaign repeated the idea that it was Labour\u2019s policy to increase immigration that had made it a burning issue in British politics. More specifically, the blame was focused on a commitment made in 2004 by Tony Blair as prime minister. In a 2015 BBC documentary called The Truth About Immigration, the presenter Nick Robinson talked of immigration in the UK as an issue that \u201cadds up to an awful lot of change and that\u2019s led to an awful lot of anxiety\u201d. He identified the source of all this worry: \u201cA single decision taken without much thought in Downing Street, to allow immigration from new members of the EU from eastern Europe.\u201d That decision by the Labour government would, Robinson said, likely be debated by historians in 50 years\u2019 time as the \u201cmost significant taken since the second world war\u201d.</p> <p>According to this analysis \u2013 which was widespread across the media \u2013 what created the problem was the arrival of immigrants in larger numbers, not the way immigration was depicted, described, debated or demonised.</p> <p>But what if this narrative is the wrong way around? Perhaps it wasn\u2019t immigration itself that was such a defining issue of those 20 years \u2013 but rather, the way political parties and journalists discussed it and the policies implemented in response. The big assumption is that it was a foregone conclusion that there would be hostility to immigration, which in turn would become politically explosive in the UK. While Britain has always received migrants with initial suspicion, it was not inevitable that the issue would become so damaging or derail our politics so comprehensively.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By the 1990s, conflict across the world began to drive migration. Responding to the earliest of the 1980s arrivals, parts of the British media labelled Tamils fleeing Sri Lanka as \u201cbogus\u201d asylum seekers. This term was adopted by politicians to cast suspicion on asylum seekers and focus anxiety about immigration on fair play and the abuse of British generosity.</p> <p>During this period, Conservative and Labour ministers presented their asylum policies in this fashion, premised on preserving the integrity of the system. The Conservatives in power during the early 90s ramped up rhetoric against \u201cfloods\u201d of asylum seekers, even though Germany then had the highest numbers of asylum seekers in Europe. Tory legislation sought to hasten the \u201crapid rejection of a large number of unfounded claims\u201d, which would \u201cplay a major part in deterring further abuse of the process\u201d, in the words of Kenneth Baker, the Conservative home secretary between 1990 and 1992.</p> <p>By the time Labour came to power in 1997, newspapers were routinely scaremongering about the new arrivals: that year the Daily Mail ran a story about a \u201cflood of bogus asylum-seekers swamping Dover\u201d while the Independent warned: \u201cGypsies invade Dover hoping for a handout.\u201d The actual numbers were tiny. <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/asylum_factfile_feb05_1344.pdf\" title=\"\">There were</a> 32,500 overall asylum claims in 1997, with 81% refused asylum. In the decade to 2000, the UK accepted 1.9% of asylum claims from Sri Lanka; in France that figure was 73.6%.</p> <p>The Labour government scrapped the rules barring spouses of British citizens from joining them in the UK and removed restrictions discriminating against homosexual and other long-term relationships. But things did not continue in this hopeful vein. The 1999 Asylum Act formalised the use of detention centres as a routine administrative measure rather than an exception, and also replaced cash benefits for asylum seekers with vouchers, since cash benefits were, in the words of Labour\u2019s home secretary Jack Straw, \u201ca major pull factor that encourage fraudulent claims\u201d. </p> <p>At the same time, the asylum dispersal system sent claimants, without a choice, into deprived parts of the country. This created the perception of a burden to be shared, while cutting newcomers off from legal and translation services. As resentment grew, asylum seekers faced harassment and physical attacks in areas where the media and politicians whipped up fury at their arrival. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a253018c518a3d8628f9e0f9a7cbc8dc0151d2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a253018c518a3d8628f9e0f9a7cbc8dc0151d2e/56_0_1613_968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Straw (right) in 2000, then the home secretary, watches as a stowaway is helped down from a lorry at Dover docks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Straw (right) in 2000, then the home secretary, watches as a stowaway is helped down from a lorry at Dover docks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 2002, asylum claims \u2013 most of which were coming from Iraq at that time \u2013 had peaked at just over 80,000 (it has not gone higher since), although Britain did not rank in the top 10 receiving countries in Europe in the number of claims per population. Still, Tony Blair pledged to halve the number of asylum seekers in the UK by September that year. Labour\u2019s commitment to such reductions indicated they were prepared to believe that at least half of all claims were not valid. In 1998, at the height of media hysteria against Roma arrivals, Straw <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/victory-for-the-gypsy-family-that-britain-branded-as-scroungers-1158726.html\" title=\"\">had claimed</a> that not one of their asylum cases had been recognised as genuine. In 2001, the Home Office had sent immigration officers to Prague\u2019s Ruzyne airport to discourage mostly Roma asylum claimants from boarding planes to Britain. Three years later, the law lords ruled that this practice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/10/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices\" title=\"\">amounted to</a> \u201cinherent and systematic\u201d racism.</p> <p>In 2001, then home secretary David Blunkett wanted to force asylum claimants to carry ID cards. A year later, Labour proposed the children of asylum seekers should be taught separately, saying they were \u201cswamping\u201d classrooms. Both plans faced massive opposition and were dropped. The 2002 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act limited access to legal aid and removed benefits from those claiming asylum later than three days after arrival. The act also removed the right to work while awaiting a claim \u2013 employment was considered another \u201cpull\u201d factor. And the 2004 Asylum and Immigration Act removed benefits from families whose asylum cases had been rejected: trying to \u201cstarve them out\u201d as the Labour MP David Winnick <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmhaff/uc692-ix/uc69202.htm\" title=\"\">protested</a> at the time.</p> <p>The Labour leadership held that, if the system could be shown to be fair, hostility to asylum seekers would diminish. Barbara Roche, Labour minister for immigration for two years until 2001, stands by this formulation: \u201cIf you aren\u2019t rigorous about keeping asylum as what it\u2019s for, you lose the concept,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel passionately about protecting it. So yes, there were some things that were made tougher.\u201d</p> <p>The trouble is that foregrounding \u201cfairness\u201d fuels public assumptions that immigration is somehow unfair or deceitful. Immigration lawyers describe a system premised on disbelief and a tendency to view migrants from wealthy white nations more favourably. As former barrister Frances Webber chronicles in her book, Borderline Justice, asylum seekers during that period were routinely assumed to be lying. In 2000, one asylum seeker was sent a letter from the Home Office stating: \u201cThe secretary of state believes your claim to be a pile of pants.\u201d</p> <p>Advisers of the time insist Labour had no need to make policy to placate tabloid readers. One top strategist for Blair says: \u201cA government with a 150 seat majority is making the weather.\u201d But a Home Office special adviser from that time says half of each day\u2019s media cuttings were about asylum seekers. \u201cThere would be pictures of people trying to get on to lorries and trains and cutting fences \u2026 it was incredibly intense, you were under constant scrutiny, always in court, always assailed by forces from all sides.\u201d None of that, he notes, made for an environment conducive to rational policy-making.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By this stage, little about the conversation on immigration was rational. In 2003, the Sun ran a front page fake news story under the headline Swan Bake, in which it claimed eastern Europeans were barbecuing swans pulled out of an east London park (following complaints, the paper did not apologise, even though there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/dec/10/sun.pressandpublishing\" title=\"\">no evidence</a> to support this assertion). In a 31-day period in 2003, the Daily Express ran 22 front page stories on the subject.</p> <p>In both policy focus and language used, Labour had added to this mounting impression of migrants and refugees as \u201csneaking into the UK\u201d, \u201ccheating\u201d the system and \u201cliving off benefits\u201d. Advisers of the time acknowledge that a negative view of asylum was seeping more widely into hostility to all migrants. The hope, according to one home office adviser, was that \u201cif people saw we were dealing with abuse but also improving the channels for legal migration, we could get public trust back\u201d.</p> <p>But this is not how public sentiment works. \u201cAs we found out after 2004, that wasn\u2019t the case \u2013 they simply moved on to Eastern Europeans [arrivals from new EU member states] as a focus of concern,\u201d the adviser said. Charting the rising number of race-hate attacks around that time in cities from Stoke to Plymouth and Peterborough, <a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/news/the-new-geographies-of-racism-peterborough/\">IRR reports in 2012</a> show that migrants who were not asylum seekers, as well as black and ethnic minority British people, often faced hostilities exacerbated by asylum dispersal, tough political rhetoric and media scaremongering. </p> <p>By 2004, 26% of the population saw the number of immigrants and asylum seekers coming into the country as the <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/today_uk_import/YG-Archives-pol-dTel-GenPolIssues-041217.pdf\" title=\"\">third most important</a> voting issue, after public services and law and order. That same year, with cross-party support, Labour opened the borders to migrants from eastern Europe\u2019s A8 countries: the Czech republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. To this day, this is cast as a supposed mistake, with former and current Labour MPs lining up to apologise for it. In 2012, Labour leader Ed Miliband said immigration was \u201cone of the areas we got wrong\u201d and spoke of \u201clocal talent\u201d being \u201clocked out of opportunity\u201d. And in 2013, Straw, the former home secretary, described it as a \u201cspectacular mistake\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ahead of the A8 accession, a government report predicted that up to 13,000 additional migrants would arrive annually from those states. It was way off: in 2005, 129,000 migrants from the A8 entered the UK. </p> <p>It was later painted as a crisis, but in truth, the British economy needed even those unexpected numbers. David Blunkett tried at the time to explain that migrants would in any case be coming to Britain in high numbers and it was better to have them in the labour market legally, paying tax. Study after study has showed that EU migration, in particular from A8 countries, produced a net economic gain for the UK. <a href=\"http://ftp.iza.org/dp3695.pdf\" title=\"\">According to one</a> authored by economists Helen Lawton and Danny Blanchflower in 2008: \u201cThe fact that the UK opened its borders to a flow of highly skilled, motivated, educated, low cost mobile workers upon EU-enlargement was a stroke of genius, for which the UK government should be given credit.\u201d </p> <p>Although the economy was booming through the 90s and early 00s, it was finance- and debt-fuelled and not equally enjoyed across the population. The social geographer Danny Dorling has dubbed Blair \u201cthe king of inequality\u201d, observing that Labour from 1997 to 2010 presided over a period during which inequalities in income, health and wealth actually rose. </p> <p>Don Flynn, the former director of the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, says: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that a group of politicians had taken their eye off the ball and immigrants had come through. It was that the immigration was the product of the type of economy created after the 1980s, with 80% of people working in a service industry of one sort or another, where the fastest areas of economic growth were London and the south-east, where a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week economy needed flexible workers doing antisocial hours in precarious, zero-hours, relatively low-paid jobs. And natives were going to do their level best to avoid those.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While Labour in 2004 had underestimated the number of arrivals from new EU member states, the tabloids wildly overestimated those figures. On the eve of accession, columnists in the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph respectively predicted that 4 million and 4.4 million migrants would come to Britain. Channeling this alarmism, the Conservatives under Michael Howard (the son of a Jewish refugee from Romania) ran campaign billboards during the 2005 proclaiming: \u201cIt\u2019s not racist to impose limits on immigration \u2026 Are you thinking what we\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p> <p>As new arrivals settled outside of big cities, tensions over asylum dispersal and scaremongering over jobs and resources boiled over into racially motivated attacks. By 2006, some of the country\u2019s most neglected areas were targeted by the British National party, which made gains in that year\u2019s local elections.</p> <p>At the same time, the idea that multiculturalism had failed \u2013 which had been percolating on the far-right \u2013 now spilled into the mainstream. The suggestion was that the left\u2019s supposed promotion of diversity had failed to foster integration and disadvantaged the white working class. It set the tone for the BBC\u2019s White Season, a documentary series that came out in 2008 and asked: \u201cIs white working class Britain becoming invisible?\u201d Trevor Phillips, then head of the equalities and human rights commission, echoed this sentiment when he said that the white working-class would need help in the economic recession, noting: \u201cThe colour of disadvantage isn\u2019t black or brown. It is white.\u201d By this reckoning \u201cwhite working-class\u201d was a minority, or protected group, that had hitherto been overlooked.</p> <p>Describing loss and disadvantage in these cultural terms gave rightwing attackers a way to claim multiculturalism in itself licensed an indifference to rising immigration and a clampdown on discussion of the subject. It all dovetailed into the accusation that Labour had abandoned its working-class heartlands.</p> <p>Labour politicians were also feeding this debate, concurring that they had not listened to \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d over migration. Earlier in 2009, MPs had claimed that the \u201cpace of change\u201d was too fast, or that, in the words of the home secretary at the time, Jacqui Smith, the \u201ccultural and emotional impact\u201d had not been properly understood. That same year, the immigration minister Phil Woolas said there was a need to find jobs for the \u201cindigenous population\u201d. Communities secretary Hazel Blears said: \u201cWhite working-class people living on estates sometimes just don\u2019t feel anyone is listening or speaking up for them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e93bde216bfdf5afb1541fd4d240e8c22ae7b0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e93bde216bfdf5afb1541fd4d240e8c22ae7b0f/385_0_3047_1829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite the Union (centre) and delegates at the Labour party conference in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite the Union (centre) and delegates at the Labour party conference in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In January that year, a government report found that the white working-class felt ignored over immigration. Those in deprived areas, without much direct experience of immigration, felt \u201ca real and perceived sense of unfairness\u201d over the issue, coupled with a reluctance to speak out for fear of being branded as racist. Looking back now, it is striking that this report gives equal footing to \u201creal\u201d and \u201cperceived\u201d concerns \u2013 the idea that a sense of unfairness, not borne out by fact and misattributed to migrants, should be politically heeded. Four years after the Conservatives were criticised for using it on election campaign billboards, Gordon Brown said in a speech in November 2009 that it was \u201cnot racist\u201d to talk about immigration.</p> <p>Blue Labour \u2013 a faction positing that the party\u2019s social and economic liberalism had led to a drop in working-class support and pushing social conservatism as the solution \u2013 emerged in 2009. A substantial number of the 4m votes Labour lost between 1997 and 2005 were from its working-class base. But some factions in the party explored other elements, such as economic alienation and New Labour\u2019s disconnected, managerial style of politics. Diane Abbott says: \u201cWe moved post-Thatcher to this post-industrial society and [New Labour] really didn\u2019t have a strategy to deal with it,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were being affected economically, seeing their lives and communities shattered \u2026 and we didn\u2019t help, we didn\u2019t have an alternative.\u201d</p> <p>Labour lost the 2010 election and saw the Conservatives and Lib Dems form a coalition government. In opposition, Brown was not allowed to forget \u201cBigotgate\u201d, and Labour was hounded by the accusation that it had shut down a conversation about immigration \u2013 even while the subject was self-evidently dominating politics. This charge was coming not just from the Conservatives, but also from inside the party. Standing as candidate for party leadership in 2010, Andy Burnham claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s still an ambivalence among some in Labour about discussing immigration.\u201d Both these themes dominated the 2015 election. One adviser to Ed Miliband, Brown\u2019s successor as Labour leader, recalls the overwhelming media narrative of Labour as a party that \u201ccrashed the economy, opened the floodgates to immigration, was led by someone who looked nerdy and stabbed his brother in the back\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe spent five years being shit-scared,\u201d says one of Miliband\u2019s key advisers. \u201cIf we had the time again, I would force Ed to do a speech on the fallacy of blaming immigration for the reality of austerity cuts.\u201d Instead, Labour produced nebulous pledges over a caring NHS and higher wages for working families. One of those \u2013 \u201cControls on immigration\u201d \u2013 ended up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/29/diane-abbott-labour-immigration-controls-mugs-shameful\" title=\"\">a party promotional mug</a>, a dismal sign of a rightward shift in slogan form.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In March this year, an Ipsos Mori poll showed the public was more positive than negative over the impact of immigration on Britain. One in five said they had become less negative on the subject. When asked why, 51% said it was because discussions in the past few years had highlighted how much migrants contribute to the UK. This is an encouraging shift for those who have long argued that, had the left in British politics articulated a robust defence of immigration, this could have detoxified the public narrative.</p> <p>Records of parliamentary debates show objections \u2013 roundly ignored \u2013 to New Labour\u2019s hostile and punitive immigration policies dating back to when it took office in 1997, often raised by then backbenchers Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn. Bill Morris, then secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union (the precursor to Unite), spearheaded a campaign against asylum vouchers, which led to them being scrapped in 2001, albeit to resurface in 2006. And in 2003, a Trade Union Congress report argued that the \u201cblurring by media and governments of the distinction between refused asylum seekers, illegal working, illegal entry and criminal activity such as trafficking\u201d was feeding a general suspicion around all migrants.</p> <p>In the early years of Blair\u2019s government, it was riding high on a historic victory, while the prime minister enjoyed extraordinary popularity, support from the Sun and the Daily Mail. Abbott, among others, views this period as a missed opportunity to reset the terms of the debate. \u201cTony Blair could have used his considerable persuasion in middle England to make a different case about the role of immigration and what causes asylum seekers,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was in a very good position to change the conversation.\u201d</p> <p>But New Labour did not want to go against public sentiment. \u201cThere was a sense of real public hostility,\u201d recalls a special adviser to the Home Office at the time. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t just turn around and say to people: \u2018Your hostility is misplaced and wrong.\u2019\u201d This exact same instinct is raised by one of Miliband\u2019s advisers from 2010 to 2015: \u201cYou can\u2019t have your first sentence [to the public] being \u2018You\u2019re wrong about the thing that you\u2019re thinking, the thing that you\u2019re worried about.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Political scientists Anthony Geddes and Jonathan Tonge have written of a \u201cratcheting effect\u201d whereby tough words and policy on immigration gives it more salience, creating, in turn, a public hunger for tougher words and policy. As Abbott puts it: \u201cIf the Labour party is banging on about immigration, our people feel legitimised in banging on about immigration. If we turn their attention to other things, they stop feeling as though it is the most terrible thing affecting their lives.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9444ba0bd11c0811036200d33adb6c4d65ec8142\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9444ba0bd11c0811036200d33adb6c4d65ec8142/507_106_4732_2839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn Labour leader\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Labour under Corbyn has changed the debate on austerity, wealth redistribution and renationalisation ... but has hardly rushed to steer a similar shift on immigration.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That politicians and tabloids are no longer \u201cbanging on\u201d about immigration \u2013 certainly not at the fever pitch of the years prior to the EU referendum \u2013 may partly explain why immigration has dropped in prominence as a public concern: it now ranks just below the environment as the sixth biggest issue of the December general election. Brexit, which tops this same YouGov poll from last week, may for some be acting as a proxy for immigration. But perhaps the Windrush scandal has also had an impact, as well as staff shortages across health and social care, hospitality and farming. Labour\u2019s own internal polling shows little public disagreement with the statement that: \u201cPoliticians blame immigrants or people on benefits to distract from their own failures.\u201d</p> <p>While Labour under Corbyn has changed the frame of debate on austerity, wealth redistribution and renationalisation, it has hardly rushed to steer a similar shift on immigration. A rare window to do so opened amid the public outrage over the Windrush scandal, where a generation of British citizens were caught in the government\u2019s hostile environment dragnet, resulting in deportations and denied access to housing and healthcare. Amid a discussion that was unusually sympathetic, Labour MPs often ending up reinforcing stereotypes over \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants \u2013 cementing the idea of a system that had failed to filter properly, rather than widening the frame to explore how an entire process was premised on suspicion and prejudice.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the leadership\u2019s strong credentials on immigration \u2013 earned over decades of showing up to support various cases and causes \u2013 has been dented by Labour\u2019s pledge to end free movement. Grassroots dismay over this went beyond the need to defend an important principle, as the party was seen as closing off terrain that should have been used to make the pro-migration arguments that had been so lacking during the New Labour years. Triangulating over Brexit, the party has shown it is streaked with the same political reluctance over immigration that has long plagued Labour. Even elements that support the Corbyn project have misdirected a need to represent the working class into language that fuels populist-right frames of hostility to immigration. That much was clear in the recent intervention by the Unite leader, Len McCluskey, urging the party not to back free movement. This in turn prompted an exasperated backlash from campaigners and senior Labour figures alike, with one noting that McCluskey was \u201cpart of a backward-looking, small-c conservative nostalgia-tripping wing of the labour movement that wants \u2018trade union rights for British workers\u2019\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/01/dizzying-maze-uk-immigration-system-hostile-environment\">'A dizzying maze': how the UK immigration system is geared to reject</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the party prepares to launch its manifesto, campaigners are watching to see whether the immigration motion passed at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton in September, including a commitment to freedom of movement, will be honoured. Labour\u2019s readiness to put the idea of EU citizens having full voting rights to parliament just weeks ago suggests this part of the motion could be adopted as policy. Last week, Corbyn said that free movement \u201cenriches the lives of all of us\u201d, crucially shifting into language that goes beyond economic contribution. \u201cI want to make sure all those European Union nationals do remain here, can come here, will stay here and we will be happy to work with them as indeed many British people have made their homes in other parts of Europe,\u201d he said.

But the party\u2019s own history on immigration suggests that it may take time to embed significant changes in rhetoric and policy. Even with a leadership that is theoretically supportive, there are likely to be wobbles along the way. </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Few chance encounters have had a greater political impact than Gordon Brown\u2019s fateful meeting with Gillian Duffy on an April morning in Rochdale in 2010. When the then prime minister was caught on a hot mic calling the Labour-voting pensioner a \u201cbigoted woman\u201d \u2013 after she cornered him with complaints about immigrants \u201cflocking\u201d into Britain \u2013 it did not just sink his floundering campaign. It set the tone for the way immigration would become the most toxic issue in British politics for the decade to come. When New Labour came to power in 1997, just 3% of the public cited immigration as a key issue. By the time of the EU referendum in 2016, that figure was 48%. During those intervening years, the issue came to dominate and distort British politics \u2013 exactly according to the script established by Bigotgate. Brown\u2019s gaffe both consolidated and gave credence to a political coding that would shape everything that came after: the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the Windrush scandal, the EU referendum and the revival of Britain\u2019s far right \u2013 deploying a narrative in which sneering, out-of-touch, big-city politicians who favour foreigners and open borders are hopelessly oblivious to the struggles and the so-called \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d of ordinary working people (who, in this scenario, are always white). The Labour movement still bears the battlescars of Bigotgate, as divisions over immigration cut across party factions. With the Labour party about to release its election manifesto, an outburst against free movement of migrants from the leader of Unite the Union, the party\u2019s biggest affiliate, threatens to thwart efforts to move to a more progressive position on the issue. By the time Brown took his ill-fated walkabout in 2010, immigration was already polling as a top concern, overtaking the NHS and only topped by the economy for a few years following the 2008 crash. By then, politicians and the media had shaped a venomous narrative around the volume of new arrivals to the UK, the identity of those coming and why they did so. For more than 30 years, the UK has been at the forefront of a neoliberal economic globalisation that deregulated markets and pared back the state \u2013 deepening the global economic inequalities that produce labour immigration. In the UK, local manufacturing-based economies that supported entire communities were shut down or shipped out. Across the global south, structural adjustment programmes imposed by the west as loan conditions were collapsing national economies. But these harsh economic realities did not appear in our media\u2019s fearmongering accounts of a \u201ctide\u201d of migrants \u201cflooding\u201d into soft-touch Britain on supposedly spurious grounds and overwhelming the country. Just as communities were exposed to the shocks of an unrestrained free market and a shrinking state, they were simultaneously bombarded with stories about \u201cSlovak spongers\u201d and cheating Czechs. Politicians of all stripes fell in line, producing hostile rhetoric and policies in response \u2013 and defining the issue as a reflection of supposed concerns over the exact number of arrivals, the \u201cpace of change\u201d in local communities and the need to exert control over migration. This was the catalyst for David Cameron\u2019s foolish 2010 election pledge to introduce a target figure for \u201cnet migration\u201d \u2013 which the Conservative party failed to meet, again and again, only enflaming public resentment and mistrust over the issue (this impossible target underpinned the Conservative\u2019s hostile environment policy and produced the Windrush scandal). In the run-up to the EU referendum, called by Cameron to block the popularity of Ukip and silence Tory Eurosceptics, the leave campaign repeated the idea that it was Labour\u2019s policy to increase immigration that had made it a burning issue in British politics. More specifically, the blame was focused on a commitment made in 2004 by Tony Blair as prime minister. In a 2015 BBC documentary called The Truth About Immigration, the presenter Nick Robinson talked of immigration in the UK as an issue that \u201cadds up to an awful lot of change and that\u2019s led to an awful lot of anxiety\u201d. He identified the source of all this worry: \u201cA single decision taken without much thought in Downing Street, to allow immigration from new members of the EU from eastern Europe.\u201d That decision by the Labour government would, Robinson said, likely be debated by historians in 50 years\u2019 time as the \u201cmost significant taken since the second world war\u201d. According to this analysis \u2013 which was widespread across the media \u2013 what created the problem was the arrival of immigrants in larger numbers, not the way immigration was depicted, described, debated or demonised. But what if this narrative is the wrong way around? Perhaps it wasn\u2019t immigration itself that was such a defining issue of those 20 years \u2013 but rather, the way political parties and journalists discussed it and the policies implemented in response. The big assumption is that it was a foregone conclusion that there would be hostility to immigration, which in turn would become politically explosive in the UK. While Britain has always received migrants with initial suspicion, it was not inevitable that the issue would become so damaging or derail our politics so comprehensively. * * * By the 1990s, conflict across the world began to drive migration. Responding to the earliest of the 1980s arrivals, parts of the British media labelled Tamils fleeing Sri Lanka as \u201cbogus\u201d asylum seekers. This term was adopted by politicians to cast suspicion on asylum seekers and focus anxiety about immigration on fair play and the abuse of British generosity. During this period, Conservative and Labour ministers presented their asylum policies in this fashion, premised on preserving the integrity of the system. The Conservatives in power during the early 90s ramped up rhetoric against \u201cfloods\u201d of asylum seekers, even though Germany then had the highest numbers of asylum seekers in Europe. Tory legislation sought to hasten the \u201crapid rejection of a large number of unfounded claims\u201d, which would \u201cplay a major part in deterring further abuse of the process\u201d, in the words of Kenneth Baker, the Conservative home secretary between 1990 and 1992. By the time Labour came to power in 1997, newspapers were routinely scaremongering about the new arrivals: that year the Daily Mail ran a story about a \u201cflood of bogus asylum-seekers swamping Dover\u201d while the Independent warned: \u201cGypsies invade Dover hoping for a handout.\u201d The actual numbers were tiny. There were 32,500 overall asylum claims in 1997, with 81% refused asylum. In the decade to 2000, the UK accepted 1.9% of asylum claims from Sri Lanka; in France that figure was 73.6%. The Labour government scrapped the rules barring spouses of British citizens from joining them in the UK and removed restrictions discriminating against homosexual and other long-term relationships. But things did not continue in this hopeful vein. The 1999 Asylum Act formalised the use of detention centres as a routine administrative measure rather than an exception, and also replaced cash benefits for asylum seekers with vouchers, since cash benefits were, in the words of Labour\u2019s home secretary Jack Straw, \u201ca major pull factor that encourage fraudulent claims\u201d. At the same time, the asylum dispersal system sent claimants, without a choice, into deprived parts of the country. This created the perception of a burden to be shared, while cutting newcomers off from legal and translation services. As resentment grew, asylum seekers faced harassment and physical attacks in areas where the media and politicians whipped up fury at their arrival. By 2002, asylum claims \u2013 most of which were coming from Iraq at that time \u2013 had peaked at just over 80,000 (it has not gone higher since), although Britain did not rank in the top 10 receiving countries in Europe in the number of claims per population. Still, Tony Blair pledged to halve the number of asylum seekers in the UK by September that year. Labour\u2019s commitment to such reductions indicated they were prepared to believe that at least half of all claims were not valid. In 1998, at the height of media hysteria against Roma arrivals, Straw had claimed that not one of their asylum cases had been recognised as genuine. In 2001, the Home Office had sent immigration officers to Prague\u2019s Ruzyne airport to discourage mostly Roma asylum claimants from boarding planes to Britain. Three years later, the law lords ruled that this practice amounted to \u201cinherent and systematic\u201d racism. In 2001, then home secretary David Blunkett wanted to force asylum claimants to carry ID cards. A year later, Labour proposed the children of asylum seekers should be taught separately, saying they were \u201cswamping\u201d classrooms. Both plans faced massive opposition and were dropped. The 2002 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act limited access to legal aid and removed benefits from those claiming asylum later than three days after arrival. The act also removed the right to work while awaiting a claim \u2013 employment was considered another \u201cpull\u201d factor. And the 2004 Asylum and Immigration Act removed benefits from families whose asylum cases had been rejected: trying to \u201cstarve them out\u201d as the Labour MP David Winnick protested at the time. The Labour leadership held that, if the system could be shown to be fair, hostility to asylum seekers would diminish. Barbara Roche, Labour minister for immigration for two years until 2001, stands by this formulation: \u201cIf you aren\u2019t rigorous about keeping asylum as what it\u2019s for, you lose the concept,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel passionately about protecting it. So yes, there were some things that were made tougher.\u201d The trouble is that foregrounding \u201cfairness\u201d fuels public assumptions that immigration is somehow unfair or deceitful. Immigration lawyers describe a system premised on disbelief and a tendency to view migrants from wealthy white nations more favourably. As former barrister Frances Webber chronicles in her book, Borderline Justice, asylum seekers during that period were routinely assumed to be lying. In 2000, one asylum seeker was sent a letter from the Home Office stating: \u201cThe secretary of state believes your claim to be a pile of pants.\u201d Advisers of the time insist Labour had no need to make policy to placate tabloid readers. One top strategist for Blair says: \u201cA government with a 150 seat majority is making the weather.\u201d But a Home Office special adviser from that time says half of each day\u2019s media cuttings were about asylum seekers. \u201cThere would be pictures of people trying to get on to lorries and trains and cutting fences \u2026 it was incredibly intense, you were under constant scrutiny, always in court, always assailed by forces from all sides.\u201d None of that, he notes, made for an environment conducive to rational policy-making. * * * By this stage, little about the conversation on immigration was rational. In 2003, the Sun ran a front page fake news story under the headline Swan Bake, in which it claimed eastern Europeans were barbecuing swans pulled out of an east London park (following complaints, the paper did not apologise, even though there was no evidence to support this assertion). In a 31-day period in 2003, the Daily Express ran 22 front page stories on the subject. In both policy focus and language used, Labour had added to this mounting impression of migrants and refugees as \u201csneaking into the UK\u201d, \u201ccheating\u201d the system and \u201cliving off benefits\u201d. Advisers of the time acknowledge that a negative view of asylum was seeping more widely into hostility to all migrants. The hope, according to one home office adviser, was that \u201cif people saw we were dealing with abuse but also improving the channels for legal migration, we could get public trust back\u201d. But this is not how public sentiment works. \u201cAs we found out after 2004, that wasn\u2019t the case \u2013 they simply moved on to Eastern Europeans [arrivals from new EU member states] as a focus of concern,\u201d the adviser said. Charting the rising number of race-hate attacks around that time in cities from Stoke to Plymouth and Peterborough, IRR reports in 2012 show that migrants who were not asylum seekers, as well as black and ethnic minority British people, often faced hostilities exacerbated by asylum dispersal, tough political rhetoric and media scaremongering. By 2004, 26% of the population saw the number of immigrants and asylum seekers coming into the country as the third most important voting issue, after public services and law and order. That same year, with cross-party support, Labour opened the borders to migrants from eastern Europe\u2019s A8 countries: the Czech republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. To this day, this is cast as a supposed mistake, with former and current Labour MPs lining up to apologise for it. In 2012, Labour leader Ed Miliband said immigration was \u201cone of the areas we got wrong\u201d and spoke of \u201clocal talent\u201d being \u201clocked out of opportunity\u201d. And in 2013, Straw, the former home secretary, described it as a \u201cspectacular mistake\u201d. Ahead of the A8 accession, a government report predicted that up to 13,000 additional migrants would arrive annually from those states. It was way off: in 2005, 129,000 migrants from the A8 entered the UK. It was later painted as a crisis, but in truth, the British economy needed even those unexpected numbers. David Blunkett tried at the time to explain that migrants would in any case be coming to Britain in high numbers and it was better to have them in the labour market legally, paying tax. Study after study has showed that EU migration, in particular from A8 countries, produced a net economic gain for the UK. According to one authored by economists Helen Lawton and Danny Blanchflower in 2008: \u201cThe fact that the UK opened its borders to a flow of highly skilled, motivated, educated, low cost mobile workers upon EU-enlargement was a stroke of genius, for which the UK government should be given credit.\u201d Although the economy was booming through the 90s and early 00s, it was finance- and debt-fuelled and not equally enjoyed across the population. The social geographer Danny Dorling has dubbed Blair \u201cthe king of inequality\u201d, observing that Labour from 1997 to 2010 presided over a period during which inequalities in income, health and wealth actually rose. Don Flynn, the former director of the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, says: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that a group of politicians had taken their eye off the ball and immigrants had come through. It was that the immigration was the product of the type of economy created after the 1980s, with 80% of people working in a service industry of one sort or another, where the fastest areas of economic growth were London and the south-east, where a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week economy needed flexible workers doing antisocial hours in precarious, zero-hours, relatively low-paid jobs. And natives were going to do their level best to avoid those.\u201d * * * While Labour in 2004 had underestimated the number of arrivals from new EU member states, the tabloids wildly overestimated those figures. On the eve of accession, columnists in the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph respectively predicted that 4 million and 4.4 million migrants would come to Britain. Channeling this alarmism, the Conservatives under Michael Howard (the son of a Jewish refugee from Romania) ran campaign billboards during the 2005 proclaiming: \u201cIt\u2019s not racist to impose limits on immigration \u2026 Are you thinking what we\u2019re thinking?\u201d As new arrivals settled outside of big cities, tensions over asylum dispersal and scaremongering over jobs and resources boiled over into racially motivated attacks. By 2006, some of the country\u2019s most neglected areas were targeted by the British National party, which made gains in that year\u2019s local elections. At the same time, the idea that multiculturalism had failed \u2013 which had been percolating on the far-right \u2013 now spilled into the mainstream. The suggestion was that the left\u2019s supposed promotion of diversity had failed to foster integration and disadvantaged the white working class. It set the tone for the BBC\u2019s White Season, a documentary series that came out in 2008 and asked: \u201cIs white working class Britain becoming invisible?\u201d Trevor Phillips, then head of the equalities and human rights commission, echoed this sentiment when he said that the white working-class would need help in the economic recession, noting: \u201cThe colour of disadvantage isn\u2019t black or brown. It is white.\u201d By this reckoning \u201cwhite working-class\u201d was a minority, or protected group, that had hitherto been overlooked. Describing loss and disadvantage in these cultural terms gave rightwing attackers a way to claim multiculturalism in itself licensed an indifference to rising immigration and a clampdown on discussion of the subject. It all dovetailed into the accusation that Labour had abandoned its working-class heartlands. Labour politicians were also feeding this debate, concurring that they had not listened to \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d over migration. Earlier in 2009, MPs had claimed that the \u201cpace of change\u201d was too fast, or that, in the words of the home secretary at the time, Jacqui Smith, the \u201ccultural and emotional impact\u201d had not been properly understood. That same year, the immigration minister Phil Woolas said there was a need to find jobs for the \u201cindigenous population\u201d. Communities secretary Hazel Blears said: \u201cWhite working-class people living on estates sometimes just don\u2019t feel anyone is listening or speaking up for them.\u201d In January that year, a government report found that the white working-class felt ignored over immigration. Those in deprived areas, without much direct experience of immigration, felt \u201ca real and perceived sense of unfairness\u201d over the issue, coupled with a reluctance to speak out for fear of being branded as racist. Looking back now, it is striking that this report gives equal footing to \u201creal\u201d and \u201cperceived\u201d concerns \u2013 the idea that a sense of unfairness, not borne out by fact and misattributed to migrants, should be politically heeded. Four years after the Conservatives were criticised for using it on election campaign billboards, Gordon Brown said in a speech in November 2009 that it was \u201cnot racist\u201d to talk about immigration. Blue Labour \u2013 a faction positing that the party\u2019s social and economic liberalism had led to a drop in working-class support and pushing social conservatism as the solution \u2013 emerged in 2009. A substantial number of the 4m votes Labour lost between 1997 and 2005 were from its working-class base. But some factions in the party explored other elements, such as economic alienation and New Labour\u2019s disconnected, managerial style of politics. Diane Abbott says: \u201cWe moved post-Thatcher to this post-industrial society and [New Labour] really didn\u2019t have a strategy to deal with it,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were being affected economically, seeing their lives and communities shattered \u2026 and we didn\u2019t help, we didn\u2019t have an alternative.\u201d Labour lost the 2010 election and saw the Conservatives and Lib Dems form a coalition government. In opposition, Brown was not allowed to forget \u201cBigotgate\u201d, and Labour was hounded by the accusation that it had shut down a conversation about immigration \u2013 even while the subject was self-evidently dominating politics. This charge was coming not just from the Conservatives, but also from inside the party. Standing as candidate for party leadership in 2010, Andy Burnham claimed: \u201cThere\u2019s still an ambivalence among some in Labour about discussing immigration.\u201d Both these themes dominated the 2015 election. One adviser to Ed Miliband, Brown\u2019s successor as Labour leader, recalls the overwhelming media narrative of Labour as a party that \u201ccrashed the economy, opened the floodgates to immigration, was led by someone who looked nerdy and stabbed his brother in the back\u201d. \u201cWe spent five years being shit-scared,\u201d says one of Miliband\u2019s key advisers. \u201cIf we had the time again, I would force Ed to do a speech on the fallacy of blaming immigration for the reality of austerity cuts.\u201d Instead, Labour produced nebulous pledges over a caring NHS and higher wages for working families. One of those \u2013 \u201cControls on immigration\u201d \u2013 ended up on a party promotional mug, a dismal sign of a rightward shift in slogan form. * * * In March this year, an Ipsos Mori poll showed the public was more positive than negative over the impact of immigration on Britain. One in five said they had become less negative on the subject. When asked why, 51% said it was because discussions in the past few years had highlighted how much migrants contribute to the UK. This is an encouraging shift for those who have long argued that, had the left in British politics articulated a robust defence of immigration, this could have detoxified the public narrative. Records of parliamentary debates show objections \u2013 roundly ignored \u2013 to New Labour\u2019s hostile and punitive immigration policies dating back to when it took office in 1997, often raised by then backbenchers Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn. Bill Morris, then secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union (the precursor to Unite), spearheaded a campaign against asylum vouchers, which led to them being scrapped in 2001, albeit to resurface in 2006. And in 2003, a Trade Union Congress report argued that the \u201cblurring by media and governments of the distinction between refused asylum seekers, illegal working, illegal entry and criminal activity such as trafficking\u201d was feeding a general suspicion around all migrants. In the early years of Blair\u2019s government, it was riding high on a historic victory, while the prime minister enjoyed extraordinary popularity, support from the Sun and the Daily Mail. Abbott, among others, views this period as a missed opportunity to reset the terms of the debate. \u201cTony Blair could have used his considerable persuasion in middle England to make a different case about the role of immigration and what causes asylum seekers,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was in a very good position to change the conversation.\u201d But New Labour did not want to go against public sentiment. \u201cThere was a sense of real public hostility,\u201d recalls a special adviser to the Home Office at the time. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t just turn around and say to people: \u2018Your hostility is misplaced and wrong.\u2019\u201d This exact same instinct is raised by one of Miliband\u2019s advisers from 2010 to 2015: \u201cYou can\u2019t have your first sentence [to the public] being \u2018You\u2019re wrong about the thing that you\u2019re thinking, the thing that you\u2019re worried about.\u2019\u201d Political scientists Anthony Geddes and Jonathan Tonge have written of a \u201cratcheting effect\u201d whereby tough words and policy on immigration gives it more salience, creating, in turn, a public hunger for tougher words and policy. As Abbott puts it: \u201cIf the Labour party is banging on about immigration, our people feel legitimised in banging on about immigration. If we turn their attention to other things, they stop feeling as though it is the most terrible thing affecting their lives.\u201d That politicians and tabloids are no longer \u201cbanging on\u201d about immigration \u2013 certainly not at the fever pitch of the years prior to the EU referendum \u2013 may partly explain why immigration has dropped in prominence as a public concern: it now ranks just below the environment as the sixth biggest issue of the December general election. Brexit, which tops this same YouGov poll from last week, may for some be acting as a proxy for immigration. But perhaps the Windrush scandal has also had an impact, as well as staff shortages across health and social care, hospitality and farming. Labour\u2019s own internal polling shows little public disagreement with the statement that: \u201cPoliticians blame immigrants or people on benefits to distract from their own failures.\u201d While Labour under Corbyn has changed the frame of debate on austerity, wealth redistribution and renationalisation, it has hardly rushed to steer a similar shift on immigration. A rare window to do so opened amid the public outrage over the Windrush scandal, where a generation of British citizens were caught in the government\u2019s hostile environment dragnet, resulting in deportations and denied access to housing and healthcare. Amid a discussion that was unusually sympathetic, Labour MPs often ending up reinforcing stereotypes over \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants \u2013 cementing the idea of a system that had failed to filter properly, rather than widening the frame to explore how an entire process was premised on suspicion and prejudice. Meanwhile, the leadership\u2019s strong credentials on immigration \u2013 earned over decades of showing up to support various cases and causes \u2013 has been dented by Labour\u2019s pledge to end free movement. Grassroots dismay over this went beyond the need to defend an important principle, as the party was seen as closing off terrain that should have been used to make the pro-migration arguments that had been so lacking during the New Labour years. Triangulating over Brexit, the party has shown it is streaked with the same political reluctance over immigration that has long plagued Labour. Even elements that support the Corbyn project have misdirected a need to represent the working class into language that fuels populist-right frames of hostility to immigration. That much was clear in the recent intervention by the Unite leader, Len McCluskey, urging the party not to back free movement. This in turn prompted an exasperated backlash from campaigners and senior Labour figures alike, with one noting that McCluskey was \u201cpart of a backward-looking, small-c conservative nostalgia-tripping wing of the labour movement that wants \u2018trade union rights for British workers\u2019\u201d. As the party prepares to launch its manifesto, campaigners are watching to see whether the immigration motion passed at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Brighton in September, including a commitment to freedom of movement, will be honoured. Labour\u2019s readiness to put the idea of EU citizens having full voting rights to parliament just weeks ago suggests this part of the motion could be adopted as policy. Last week, Corbyn said that free movement \u201cenriches the lives of all of us\u201d, crucially shifting into language that goes beyond economic contribution. \u201cI want to make sure all those European Union nationals do remain here, can come here, will stay here and we will be happy to work with them as indeed many British people have made their homes in other parts of Europe,\u201d he said. The latest YouGov polling shows 67% support for the retention of reciprocal free movement rights post-Brexit, something that Labour is now likely to commit to. A source close to the leadership says the shift is down to \u201ca lot of hard work internally and pressure from the membership\u201d, adding that a softening of public attitudes to immigration and the Windrush scandal have both had an impact on MPs who might previously have hesitated over pro-migration policies. But the party\u2019s own history on immigration suggests that it may take time to embed significant changes in rhetoric and policy. Even with a leadership that is theoretically supportive, there are likely to be wobbles along the way. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

Yet, a decade after the global financial crisis, the British economy remains weak and unbalanced.

      "bodyText": "Many people want this election to be about whether Brexit will solve or exacerbate the problems the UK faces. But most of these problems were born inside the UK\u2019s borders, and long predate the Brexit referendum. This week\u2019s growth figures showed a 0.3% rise in GDP in the last quarter, removing the immediate threat of a UK recession. Yet, a decade after the global financial crisis, the British economy remains weak and unbalanced. Economic growth remains highly dependent on consumption fuelled by private debt, rather than investment. The financial sector has largely retreated from funding the real economy, and today more than 80% of its revenue is channelled into the finance, insurance and real estate (\u201cfire\u201d) sectors. The business sector has the lowest investment growth in the G7. Real wages have stagnated \u2013 in part due to the weak bargaining power of trade unions \u2013 and productivity growth has stalled. Beyond this, a decade of austerity has eroded the social fabric of the country. The symptoms on the streets are clear to see, from a record-level number of homeless people to soaring knife crime. Local authorities have had their budgets cut by unprecedented amounts. After-school clubs, youth centres, public libraries, policing and mental health budgets have all been cut, affecting the most vulnerable people in society. And on top of all of this, the country, like the rest of the planet, faces a climate emergency that puts the entire economy at risk. What is required to tackle these problems? The task for the next government is to identify policies that stimulate investment-led growth \u2013 which can be steered towards tackling the key challenges of our age \u2013 rather than private, debt-fuelled, consumption-led growth. This means reforming finance to make it more useful to businesses that want to innovate; making bold state investments in new areas such as the green economy; and creating a taxation system that rewards businesses that invest in the long term rather than those that siphon value out of the economy. It means investing in measures that improve work conditions, support training and promote wellbeing. This must include well\u2011funded education, mental health services and other social infrastructures. All these changes should have a green direction across consumption, production and distribution: we need to move away from \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects and think about \u201cgreen transition\u201d projects. There is nothing about Brexit that will automatically help solve these problems. Given that leaving the EU will probably reduce the size of Britain\u2019s economy, investment may indeed fall. The TUC has asked for assurances that a post-Brexit UK will not begin a race to the bottom on pay and conditions. But no real assurance has been received. Refreshingly, the electoral debate this time is not about putting the country\u2019s finances in order \u2013 something Keynes insisted only households should do, not governments. Both parties are laying out plans for spending and investment to get the UK out of the current mess. But whether this turns into a real transformation of the economy depends on whether the policies have coherence and provide a path towards greater public and private investment. Labour has for a long time been arguing that austerity was wrong. Previously, however, the party did not have a strong enough narrative on what to invest in and how to drive growth. Now it has: the Green New Deal. Inspired by the plans of US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Labour is presenting a plan for a greener economy, and a more inclusive one. The party\u2019s proposals include investing \u00a3150bn over the next five years in a \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to pay for school upgrades, hospitals and social care facilities \u2013 and, alongside this, a \u00a3250bn \u201cgreen transformation fund\u201d over 10 years in projects to improve sustainability \u2013 such as energy and transport, and insulating existing homes. The Conservatives say they too will invest \u2013 in schools, police, the \u201cbiggest programme of NHS investment in a generation\u201d, and free ports. Even though this shopping list has little coherence, it represents a significant U-turn after a near-decade of austerity. The Tories could learn from the way their former business secretary, Greg Clark, started to think about industrial renewal. He developed a strategy focused on key societal challenges: the future of mobility; clean growth; an ageing society; and the data economy. The aim was noble: to create an investment-led, innovation-driven green economy. It was a good start, and I am proud that at the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose we were able to help devise an industrial strategy designed to address these challenges. But, regardless of who wins the election, there is an urgent need to enhance capabilities within the public sector. In recent decades the state\u2019s capacity has been drastically hollowed out, and key public functions have been outsourced to management consultants and parasitic companies. This has become all too clear with Brexit: without sufficient in-house expertise, the Department for Exiting the EU is now spending millions on private lawyers and consultants. If we are to transform our economy on the scale that is required we must urgently rebuild public sector institutions, and increase their capacity to think and act big. The public sector has to be allowed to get its hands dirty again, instead of handing difficult tasks to consultancies. The country will not prosper without a serious economic plan. A decade has been lost between cruel austerity and a misinformed debate about Brexit. The solution is clear: invest in innovation; invest in people; invest in communities; and make sure there is green economic growth in the UK. Brexit will make this harder, but even more necessary. \u2022 Professor Mariana Mazzucato is the founding director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose",

They say it is complete fake news.\u201d</p> <p>It was fake. That\u2019s not a partisan point. That figure was arrived at by taking all of Labour\u2019s conference pledges \u2013 aspirations that may not even appear in their manifesto \u2013 and calculated on the assumption they all would be implemented on day one. Later in the programme, in an interview with the chancellor, Sajid Javid, Marr said the figures amounted to: \u201cBogus numbers and dodgy accounting.\u201d</p> <p>But by then the agenda had been set. For the rest of the day you could either decry Labour\u2019s \u00a31tn folly, deny its \u00a31trn folly, contest its \u00a31trn folly or explain its \u00a31trn folly.

But this is not the product of genius messaging; it\u2019s the gift of loyal stenographers.</p> <p>This bias has nothing to do with Corbyn in particular. The media savaged Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband before him. Tony Blair had an easier ride because, according to his No 10 staffer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/feb/24/revealed-deal-between-murdoch-blair\" title=\"\">Lance Price</a>, Blair believed he had an unspoken deal with Rupert Murdoch that \u201cif [Rupert] Murdoch were left to pursue his business interests in peace, he would give Labour a fair wind\u201d. It\u2019s a deal we are all still paying for.</p> <p>But in this, as in so many things, Corbyn has proved a lightning rod. His election as Labour leader has laid bare what was only partially visible during the attacks on Miliband and Brown. Failing to accept him as the legitimate leader of the opposition, the rightwing press fear his premiership as they have feared no other Labour leader before. Over the next few weeks this will likely get worse, particularly if Labour continues to edge up in the polls, as the media class grow ever more shrill and desperate.</p> <p>It is the challenge of the left not simply to bemoan the power of the rightwing press, but to circumnavigate it. It is a bit like complaining about the right being better funded, or wealthy people buying access. It\u2019s incontestable but it\u2019s not going to change any time soon. It is as baked into the analysis of the system as privilege is baked into the system itself.</p> <p>Yet there are a few reasons to be hopeful. \u201cFreedom of the press,\u201d wrote the early 20th century American journalist AJ Liebling, \u201cis guaranteed only to those who own one.\u201d Since those who owned them were, by definition wealthy, those were the interests they represented. But new technology and social media have lowered the barriers of publication and distribution and <a href=\"https://mediatel.co.uk/newsline/2017/06/14/the-decline-of-murdochs-influence/\" title=\"\">created space for new voices</a> to emerge and be heard. Some have proved incredibly effective. Meanwhile, grassroots campaigning has also created the capacity to challenge preconceptions on the doorstep through canvassing.</p> <p>In the last election, virtually the entire media class rounded on Labour, only to see its vote share and seat count go up. We can\u2019t say those attacks had no impact, since we don\u2019t know how well Labour would have done otherwise. But we do know that, just because the media team up with their natural allies in the Conservatives, it needn\u2019t mean the Tories get to romp home.</p> <p>\u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The media savaged Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband before him. Tony Blair had an easier ride because, according to his No 10 staffer Lance Price, Blair believed he had an unspoken deal with Rupert Murdoch that \u201cif [Rupert] Murdoch were left to pursue his business interests in peace, he would give Labour a fair wind\u201d. It\u2019s a deal we are all still paying for. But in this, as in so many things, Corbyn has proved a lightning rod. His election as Labour leader has laid bare what was only partially visible during the attacks on Miliband and Brown. Failing to accept him as the legitimate leader of the opposition, the rightwing press fear his premiership as they have feared no other Labour leader before. Over the next few weeks this will likely get worse, particularly if Labour continues to edge up in the polls, as the media class grow ever more shrill and desperate. It is the challenge of the left not simply to bemoan the power of the rightwing press, but to circumnavigate it. It is a bit like complaining about the right being better funded, or wealthy people buying access. It\u2019s incontestable but it\u2019s not going to change any time soon. It is as baked into the analysis of the system as privilege is baked into the system itself. Yet there are a few reasons to be hopeful. \u201cFreedom of the press,\u201d wrote the early 20th century American journalist AJ Liebling, \u201cis guaranteed only to those who own one.\u201d Since those who owned them were, by definition wealthy, those were the interests they represented. But new technology and social media have lowered the barriers of publication and distribution and created space for new voices to emerge and be heard. Some have proved incredibly effective. Meanwhile, grassroots campaigning has also created the capacity to challenge preconceptions on the doorstep through canvassing. In the last election, virtually the entire media class rounded on Labour, only to see its vote share and seat count go up. We can\u2019t say those attacks had no impact, since we don\u2019t know how well Labour would have done otherwise. But we do know that, just because the media team up with their natural allies in the Conservatives, it needn\u2019t mean the Tories get to romp home. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist",
