I don\u2019t understand why, over a week since he was detained, there is no rudimentary information on what happened, why he was picked up, what he was found with. Surely if that was available that would be relatively easy to release.\u201d</p> <p>He said the family have had no contact with Vladimir Zherebenkov, the lawyer assigned to represent his brother, and is unsure how he came to be hired, as the US embassy only recommends English-speaking lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s our understanding that he doesn\u2019t speak English, which is a little bit of surprise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Paul Whelan speaks so little Russian that when US diplomats visited him on Wednesday he did not have his glasses, his brother said. He had not known how to ask for them in Russian and guards were not allowed to talk to him in English.</p> <p>The family have set up an account which will allow Whelan to buy basics like toilet roll and razors in prison but, because of the Orthodox Christmas holiday, they have not been able to transfer funds.</p> <p>David Whelan said he had been unaware of his brother\u2019s interest in Russia. \u201cWhen we meet at my folks\u2019 house or when we email, Russia never comes up, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s banging on about it all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know I would have called him a Russophile.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Whelan had been in contact with Russians with military backgrounds through the social media website Vkontakte, but his brother said he saw nothing unusual in that.</p> <p>\u201cWithout the context of him sitting in a Russian jail, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s really that odd,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that he is on social media in touch with people with similar backgrounds, I don\u2019t find particularly surprising.\u201d</p>",

David Whelan told the Guardian his family have not been given any details of what his brother is alleged to have done.

David Whelan welcomed remarks in support of his brother by the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Friday, particularly his warning to Russia not to use its prisoner as a geopolitical pawn. \u201cI think Paul is perhaps a pawn in some larger scheme,\u201d David Whelan said. \u201cI think he was definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I think the question then becomes whether it is worth trying to dig into what the rationale is for why he was picked up.\u201d He pointed to the coincidence that a domain name his brother once used, paulnwhelan.com, was purchased in November by an anonymous buyer using a Hong Kong IP address. \u201cWho would be buying paulnwhelan.com right out of the blue in the middle of November 2018, six weeks before the Russians pick Paul up for spying,\u201d David Whelan said. \u201cSo you have so many dots you can\u2019t possibly connect without more details.\u201d He said he did not know what to make of allegations published in the Russian media outlet, Rosbalt, that his brother had cultivated contacts from the Russian defence and security services for a decade, and had been arrested in his hotel room with a USB drive containing classified information. \u201cI think it\u2019s difficult to know whether it\u2019s accurate or not,\u201d he said. \u201cI would feel more confident if it had come from the Russian government in an official statement. I don\u2019t understand why, over a week since he was detained, there is no rudimentary information on what happened, why he was picked up, what he was found with. Surely if that was available that would be relatively easy to release.\u201d He said the family have had no contact with Vladimir Zherebenkov, the lawyer assigned to represent his brother, and is unsure how he came to be hired, as the US embassy only recommends English-speaking lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s our understanding that he doesn\u2019t speak English, which is a little bit of surprise,\u201d he said. Paul Whelan speaks so little Russian that when US diplomats visited him on Wednesday he did not have his glasses, his brother said. He had not known how to ask for them in Russian and guards were not allowed to talk to him in English. The family have set up an account which will allow Whelan to buy basics like toilet roll and razors in prison but, because of the Orthodox Christmas holiday, they have not been able to transfer funds. David Whelan said he had been unaware of his brother\u2019s interest in Russia. \u201cWhen we meet at my folks\u2019 house or when we email, Russia never comes up, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s banging on about it all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know I would have called him a Russophile.\u201d Paul Whelan had been in contact with Russians with military backgrounds through the social media website Vkontakte, but his brother said he saw nothing unusual in that. \u201cWithout the context of him sitting in a Russian jail, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s really that odd,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that he is on social media in touch with people with similar backgrounds, I don\u2019t find particularly surprising.\u201d",

Nonetheless Liverpool have just sold Dominic Solanke to Bournemouth and allowed Nathaniel Clyne to join the same club on loan in recognition of the fact that players in their peak years need to be playing. \u201cFootball is a business and we received a good offer for Dominic but you also have to think about people and their situations,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cHaving people in reserve is a great option for a manager but Nat Clyne, for instance, is at that age where he has to be playing. He asked me if he could go and I thought about it and said yes, because no one wants to block a career. You can always keep hold of a player but keeping him in the right shape and level of confidence is not so easy if he is not playing many games. Nat was out for a while injured and, when he came back, the situation had moved on. It\u2019s a shame but that\u2019s football; it\u2019s the way things are.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Thousands of Labour members have demanded their party oppose Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and back a second referendum over EU membership. The call comes before a key party gathering which will be held amid warnings that some are already ending their membership over the issue.</p> <p>The pressure emerges as the biggest Brexit poll conducted since the referendum suggests support for Labour would fall significantly should it back or allow its MPs to back a Brexit agreement. More than 5,000 Labour members and supporters have contacted the party before its policy meeting of senior figures this week. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s national policy forum, which includes trade union bosses, senior party officials and shadow cabinet ministers, meets on Wednesday. Officials will offer testimony that local members are quitting over the party\u2019s refusal to oppose Brexit.</p> <p>One submission, from the chair of Devizes Labour party, warns that members are resigning and threatening to resign \u201cbecause of Labour\u2019s reluctance to take a more proactive role in the campaign to force a people\u2019s vote on this issue\u201d. She warns: \u201cIf Labour now fails us on this there is likely to be a mass exodus of the activists we need to fight for Labour in nearby winnable constituencies.\u201d</p> <p>Activists point to the biggest ever Brexit poll, which shows that Labour\u2019s support would collapse at the next election if it eventually backed a Brexit deal or handed its MPs freedom to vote on such a deal. The YouGov poll of 25,000 voters for the People\u2019s Vote campaign found that Labour\u2019s support would then slump to 26% of the vote \u2013 lower than the 27.6% secured by Michael Foot in the party\u2019s disastrous 1983 election. Labour is currently committed to voting against May\u2019s deal, but has stopped short of opposing Brexit under different terms.</p> <p>The poll, conducted over the Christmas break, suggested there was a majority in favour of a second referendum and against Brexit. Voters would prefer that they, rather than MPs, are given the final say by 53% to 47%, excluding those who said they did not know. It found that 54% back staying in the EU, while 46% back leaving, excluding those who did not know.</p> <p>A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cAs unanimously agreed at conference, if Theresa May\u2019s botched Brexit deal is voted down in parliament then a general election should be called. In line with the policy agreed at conference, if the Conservatives block a general election then we will keep all options on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote.\u201d</p> <p>There is huge pressure on Jeremy Corbyn and the PM as MPs prepare to return after the Christmas break, with the crucial vote on May\u2019s deal scheduled for a week on Tuesday. Some insiders are already expecting a further delay to the vote. Under one plan, MPs would pass an amendment suggesting the deal will only pass with further legal guarantees from the EU about the so-called \u201cIrish backstop\u201d \u2013 which would keep the Irish border open but could tether Britain to the EU\u2019s customs union. It comes after a concerted push from some cabinet ministers to show Brussels what sort of compromise would be required to secure parliamentary support. Downing Street sources insisted last night that the vote on the Brexit deal would go ahead next week.</p> <p>It has also emerged that Tory party members are favouring leading Brexiters as their preferred candidates to replace May. Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Davis are top of the party\u2019s grassroots list. The next leader is likely to take the lead role in negotiating Britain\u2019s long-term trading relationship with the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/public-vote-poll-zip/giv-3902JkId2etBtUl2/\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/public-vote-poll-zip/giv-3902JkId2etBtUl2/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The cluster of Brexiters at the top of members\u2019 wishlist is the latest sign of pressure May faces from the right.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of Labour members have demanded their party oppose Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and back a second referendum over EU membership. The call comes before a key party gathering which will be held amid warnings that some are already ending their membership over the issue. The pressure emerges as the biggest Brexit poll conducted since the referendum suggests support for Labour would fall significantly should it back or allow its MPs to back a Brexit agreement. More than 5,000 Labour members and supporters have contacted the party before its policy meeting of senior figures this week. Labour\u2019s national policy forum, which includes trade union bosses, senior party officials and shadow cabinet ministers, meets on Wednesday. Officials will offer testimony that local members are quitting over the party\u2019s refusal to oppose Brexit. One submission, from the chair of Devizes Labour party, warns that members are resigning and threatening to resign \u201cbecause of Labour\u2019s reluctance to take a more proactive role in the campaign to force a people\u2019s vote on this issue\u201d. She warns: \u201cIf Labour now fails us on this there is likely to be a mass exodus of the activists we need to fight for Labour in nearby winnable constituencies.\u201d Activists point to the biggest ever Brexit poll, which shows that Labour\u2019s support would collapse at the next election if it eventually backed a Brexit deal or handed its MPs freedom to vote on such a deal. The YouGov poll of 25,000 voters for the People\u2019s Vote campaign found that Labour\u2019s support would then slump to 26% of the vote \u2013 lower than the 27.6% secured by Michael Foot in the party\u2019s disastrous 1983 election. Labour is currently committed to voting against May\u2019s deal, but has stopped short of opposing Brexit under different terms. The poll, conducted over the Christmas break, suggested there was a majority in favour of a second referendum and against Brexit. Voters would prefer that they, rather than MPs, are given the final say by 53% to 47%, excluding those who said they did not know. It found that 54% back staying in the EU, while 46% back leaving, excluding those who did not know. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cAs unanimously agreed at conference, if Theresa May\u2019s botched Brexit deal is voted down in parliament then a general election should be called. In line with the policy agreed at conference, if the Conservatives block a general election then we will keep all options on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote.\u201d There is huge pressure on Jeremy Corbyn and the PM as MPs prepare to return after the Christmas break, with the crucial vote on May\u2019s deal scheduled for a week on Tuesday. Some insiders are already expecting a further delay to the vote. Under one plan, MPs would pass an amendment suggesting the deal will only pass with further legal guarantees from the EU about the so-called \u201cIrish backstop\u201d \u2013 which would keep the Irish border open but could tether Britain to the EU\u2019s customs union. It comes after a concerted push from some cabinet ministers to show Brussels what sort of compromise would be required to secure parliamentary support. Downing Street sources insisted last night that the vote on the Brexit deal would go ahead next week. It has also emerged that Tory party members are favouring leading Brexiters as their preferred candidates to replace May. Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Davis are top of the party\u2019s grassroots list. The next leader is likely to take the lead role in negotiating Britain\u2019s long-term trading relationship with the EU. The cluster of Brexiters at the top of members\u2019 wishlist is the latest sign of pressure May faces from the right. After May pledged not to fight the next election as leader, Tory members were asked to name their preferred successor by the Party Members Project, run by Queen Mary University, London, and Sussex University. Johnson, who has been a leading critic of May\u2019s deal since quitting as foreign secretary, topped the poll with 20%. Rees-Mogg, the leader of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs, trailed in second on 15%, while Davis, who quit as Brexit secretary last year, scored 8%. However, 12% said they did not know who should be the next leader, so the field could yet open up should May manage to hold on for some time and new figures emerge as contenders. Worryingly for Remain supporters, home secretary Sajid Javid was the only figure who originally backed staying in the EU, among the top five names in the members\u2019 wishlist. Meanwhile, May has warned MPs of the risks they are taking with democracy and the livelihoods of their constituents by seeking either a second referendum or \u201ctheir particular vision\u201d of Brexit. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the PM was also critical of Labour\u2019s approach under Corbyn, saying it was based on a \u201ccynical tissue of incoherence, designed to avoid difficult decisions\u201d. In a message that appeared aimed at winning opposition support for her deal, she said that \u201cMPs of every party will face the same question when the division bell rings. It is a question of profound significance for our democracy and for our constituents. \u201cThe only way to both honour the result of the referendum and protect jobs and security is by backing the deal that is on the table.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Family members of Jazmine Barnes called on the local community to help catch her killer on Saturday, six days after the seven-year-old was shot dead in an apparently random murder her family believe is a hate crime. The Harris county sheriff\u2019s office has said it is working on a number of leads. It has released grainy images of a red pickup truck captured by a CCTV camera as well as a sketch of the suspect, thought to be a thin white male in his 30s or 40s. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find him no matter what corner we have to turn, no matter what rock we have to look under,\u201d Jazmine\u2019s mother, LaPorsha Washington, told a crowd of about 500 people at a rally, her voice cracking with emotion. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find you, man. \u201cShe was only seven. She was only seven.\u201d Other family members expressed thanks for the outpouring of support and appealed to the suspect to turn himself in. Part memorial, part call to action, the event was held in the parking lot of a Walmart close to the scene of the shooting. Some people carried balloons, flowers or teddy bears. Amid a heavy police presence, armed activists mingled with bikers and gun-control advocates. \u201cWhen you sit in your living room and you see this stuff on TV day after day after day, you take on it like it\u2019s your own family member. And for a little child? Come on,\u201d said Alma Thompson, 67, who has five daughters and was carrying a placard that said \u201cstop the killing\u201d. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democratic congresswoman from Houston, said federal resources including the FBI were being deployed to help local law enforcement. \u201cThe heat is on and the heat is up,\u201d she said. A spokesman for the Harris county sheriff said there were no fresh updates on the case as of Saturday afternoon. Washington was driving with her four daughters to get coffee about 15 miles east of downtown Houston at roughly 6.30am last Sunday when a gunman in a pickup truck pulled up and opened fire. Washington, 30, was shot in the arm. Jazmine, who loved music and wanted to be a teacher when she grew up, was shot in the head. The family is black. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything wrong to this man,\u201d Washington told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThis is something that I believe was a hate crime.\u201d The case has attracted national attention. The civil rights lawyer S Lee Merritt, who is representing the Barnes family, and the activist and writer Shaun King have raised a $100,000 reward for information leading to the suspect\u2019s capture. As of Saturday afternoon a GoFundMe page had raised more than $67,000 for the family. \u201cA white male who was a complete stranger to them decides to target their family,\u201d Merritt said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cWe do believe that it was racially motivated in part because our nation at this moment is a highly racially charged society. We\u2019ve seen a rise in hate crimes [according to FBI data] \u2026 this particular area of Houston is known for a racial element.\u201d Deric Muhammad, a local activist, suggested a possible link with another shooting that took place a couple of miles away in August 2017, when two black passengers were injured by a white man in a pickup truck. They survived but the attacker has not been caught. DeAndre Hopkins, of the Houston Texans NFL team, pledged his $29,000 pay cheque from a playoff game to help with funeral costs. \u201cWhen I see Jazmine Barnes\u2019 face, I see my own daughter,\u201d the wide receiver said in a tweet. \u201cOn Saturday I will be playing in your honor, Jazmine\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A group of state-run nurseries in London are to be given air filtration systems as concern grows about the impact of the UK\u2019s toxic air on some of the capital\u2019s youngest and most vulnerable residents. Five nurseries have been selected for the purifiers in the first wave, with 20 nurseries being audited to measure the extent of toddlers\u2019 exposure to the potentially deadly particles from vehicles. The move follows a report earlier this year for the mayor of London which found that air pollution was worse inside school buildings than in the surrounding streets, with potentially stark consequences for children\u2019s health and cognitive ability. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who is rolling out the filtration systems and audits, said it was unacceptable that a generation of youngsters were having their health and ability to learn affected by air that was dangerous to breathe. \u201cIt is completely inexcusable that the youngest and most vulnerable in our city face a daily threat to their health from the toxic air they breathe,\u201d Khan told the Guardian. \u201cThis ongoing threat to public health from polluted air outdoors and indoors must be addressed.\u201d There is growing concern about air pollution in and around schools and the long-term impact on children\u2019s health. Earlier this year the Guardian reported that primaries across the country were trying to ban the school run to reduce pollution, while others have managed to close down roads outside their schools at the beginning and end of the day. The paper also found that a growing number were installing air purifiers in an effort to protect children from the worst effects of air pollution. It reported on one school which found that particulate pollution exceeded WHO guidelines in every classroom, with two more than three times over the limit. The new nursery audits will target sources of indoor and outdoor pollution, with five of the 20 nurseries trialling new air filtration systems to test their effectiveness at reducing indoor pollution. The audits will focus on reducing NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 \u2013 the most dangerous particulate \u2013 as research shows children exposed to these smaller pollution particles and gases are more likely to grow up with lung problems and develop asthma. The UK has the worst level of asthma in Europe and there were a record number of deaths from the condition last year. Air pollution, which is linked to 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, can also cause a range of debilitating lifelong conditions from heart disease and strokes to dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s. Dr Simon Lenton, a representative of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the very young were particularly at risk. \u201cInfants and children are more vulnerable as their lungs and brains are still developing,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren and infants spend many hours in nursery or at school and it is imperative we know what air pollutants they are exposed to and then take action to ensure the air they breathe is as pure as possible.\u201d The new nursery audits follow similar schemes for primary schools in London earlier this year, which led to some schools taking action to close roads, upgrade their boilers, tackle engine idling and promote car sharing. Khan said: \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing measures to reduce pollution being introduced at the primary schools where we\u2019ve delivered audits.

The Gunners bring plenty to the table: the 1930 Graf Zeppelin final, Charlie George, 1979\u2019s five-minute spectacular, Andy Linighan\u2019s late, late winner, Ray Parlour, Vieira\u2019s penalty, Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey. A list as impressive as it\u2019s long. But Blackpool have the Matthews final, and nobody\u2019s trumping that.</p> <p><strong>This match is a repeat of the 1953 Charity Shield, and neither club is currently the force it was back then.</strong> Blackpool were coming off the back of that famous final, holders of the cup, while Arsenal were the reigning league champions. Nowadays Arsenal are well off the pace at the top of the Premier League, while Blackpool languish in mid-table all the way down in League One. The chances of the Seasiders causing a shock is therefore low, but tonight\u2019s hosts will take succour from their performance at the Emirates in the League Cup a couple of months ago, when they were an offside decision away from staging a two-goal comeback against their illustrious hosts. Another performance like that tonight, and it\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>5.30pm.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Unai Emery tells BT Sport that he\u2019s very happy with his young team. And that\u2019s pretty much that, on a night that\u2019s raised the profile of Joe Willock and Tony Adams\u2019 tailor. Night night everyone! Blackpool boss Terry McPhillips talks! \u201cWe didn\u2019t quite have the quality to hurt them tonight. We had some good play in both halves, and I think they know they\u2019ve been in a game. And I thought the last goal was offside. But we\u2019ve played Arsenal home and away and given it a good go. My players are honest, and keep going, and want to do well. We had more of a go here, and that leaves gaps. But I\u2019m proud of the lads. In the end, they\u2019re a top team. We move on now to Portsmouth.\u201d Meanwhile at Selhurst Park, Crystal Palace left it late to see off Grimsby Town. Ed Aarons is your man for this one. At Ashton Gate, Bristol City saw off Huddersfield. Does this really count as a shock? Stuart James has the verdict. And now for the late kick-offs elsewhere. Louise Taylor was at St James\u2019 Park to witness a salvage job by Matt Ritchie. Andy Hunter was our man at Bloomfield Road. Here\u2019s his take on a breezy night for Arsenal. A very happy Joe Willock speaks to BT Sport. \u201cIt was a good night for me. But not just for me, for the team. We dug deep, the second half wasn\u2019t as easy. I thought I had a hat-trick but the linesman took it away from me. But that\u2019s how football is sometimes! I\u2019m preparing myself everyday, competing with the best players in the world in training. It\u2019s the best thing I can do, and I will try to make sure I\u2019ll get in the team.\u201d There were four other late kick-offs in the FA Cup. Here are the results, with Huddersfield and Norwich both coming a cropper against teams from lower divisions. Bristol City 1-0 Huddersfield Town Crystal Palace 1-0 Grimsby Town Newcastle United 1-1 Blackburn Rovers Norwich City 0-1 Portsmouth The 13-time FA Cup winners are into the fourth round. Joe Willock, the 19-year-old midfielder, was their two-goal hero. Blackpool never seriously threatened a shock, but dug in well after a shaky start, staying in the game until late on. 90 min: Blackpool push forward looking for a consolation, but nearly concede a fourth instead. Arsenal break upfield, Ramsey is sent clear by Elneny. But Mafoumbi reads the danger, sliding out of his area and putting a stop to Ramsey\u2019s gallop. 88 min: Jenkinson has a little burst down the right but can\u2019t get a cross in. No matter. 87 min: Bola bursts down the left and finds Pritchard in the middle. But Pritchard can\u2019t control and fails to get a shot away. 85 min: Iwobi is sent romping into acres down the left. He should feed Lacazette, free in the middle, but goes for goal instead, and slams a shot straight down Mafoumbi\u2019s throat. It\u2019s his last act of the night; he\u2019s replaced by the 17-year-old Saka. 84 min: Both teams make a change. Arsenal send on Medley for Kolasinac, while Davies replaces Gnanduillet for Blackpool. Lacazette swans in from the right wing. He slips the ball left for Ramsey, who enters the box down the channel. He toe-punts towards the bottom right. Mafoumbi saves well, but the ball breaks to Iwobi, who slots home at the far post. Iwobi was a touch offside when Ramsey took his shot, but the flag didn\u2019t go up. There\u2019s no VAR here tonight; that would have been chalked off if the technology was in situ. 80 min: Willock gets the ball in the Blackpool net for a third time. But he\u2019s not celebrating his hat-trick, because Kolasinac, who had teed him up for a tap-in with a ball from the left, was found offside by Lacazette earlier in the move. 79 min: Iwobi and Lacazette combine down the inside-left channel and make it into the Blackpool area. But it\u2019s all too intricate, especially when Willock arrives on the scene to completely clutter up the place. Blackpool clear. 78 min: Iwobi nearly slips Lacazette clear with a cute pass down the middle, but his radar\u2019s just a little bit off. Nice try, though. Lacazette tries to keep the move going with some determined work down the left, but his flash across the face of goal doesn\u2019t go anywhere near a dark-blue-and-purple shirt. 76 min: The tempo of this game has dropped, which will suit Arsenal just fine. 74 min: The corner\u2019s taken, and it\u2019s a waste of time. 73 min: Nottingham with a long throw out on the right. Arsenal deal with it easily and Ramsey breaks up the other end. He strokes a pass down the right for Maitland-Niles, who earns Arsenal\u2019s sixth corner of the evening. Before the corner, there\u2019s a bit of silly buggers between O\u2019Connor and Lacazette, forcing the referee to remind both players that they\u2019re grown men. 71 min: The substitute keeper still hasn\u2019t got his hands warm, because the corner\u2019s worked to Kolasinac, 25 yards out, and the resulting shot clears the Blackpool Tower. 70 min: Arsenal play it short instead, Maitland-Niles earning a corner. So that\u2019ll be the first thing Mafoumbi has to deal with. 69 min: A very disappointed Howard trudges off the pitch. He\u2019ll be replaced by Mafoumbi, who takes his own sweet time getting onto the field. His first job, once he eventually clocks in, will be to face a long Arsenal throw from the right flank. 68 min: Howard is down, and it looks as though Blackpool will have to change their keeper. It looks as though he\u2019s pulled a muscle while taking a goal kick. 66 min: Willock, on the hat-trick hunt, dribbles into the Blackpool box from the left. He\u2019s got options inside, but wants to shoot, understandably so. His effort is blocked, and falls to Elneny, who sends a shot wide from the edge of the box. 65 min: Lacazette comes on for Nketiah, who on another night might have had a hat-trick. Then there\u2019s another corner for Blackpool down the right; O\u2019Connor eyebrows this one wide left from close range. The home side really have had their chances. 63 min: More slapstick nonsense in the Arsenal box, as Pritchard\u2019s right-wing cross balloons up off Elneny, then Sokratis, and falls from high towards Feeney, on the left-hand edge of the six-yard box. But O\u2019Connor gets in the way of his own man, and Feeney ends up fresh-airing it. Peter Chelsom would approve, one suspects. 62 min: Pritchard comes on for Taylor, and immediately wastes a corner that\u2019d been won by Delfouneso down the right. 60 min: Lichtsteiner passes back to Cech, who slips in the slapstick style while attempting to change his feet. He just about gets away with it, the ball somehow eluding the lurking Guy. He whacks clear, blowing out his cheeks, with a sweat on. 58 min: A nice period of Blackpool possession. They push Arsenal back, and back, and back. Then Bola bursts into a gap down the left, sent clear by Spearing. Bola pulls the ball back across goal. Nottingham races in from the right, leans back, and blooters a first-time shot miles over the bar. Blackpool have had their chances. 56 min: Delfouneso sails past Kolasinac in the midfield, and is dragged back in the cynical style. It\u2019s the first yellow card of a match that\u2019s been played in good spirit. 54 min: Blackpool pass it around the back for a bit. Then Guy, last man, is nearly stripped of possession by Willock, who had Nketiah in close attendance. Guy just about gets away with it, but for a split second a third goal looked on the cards. 52 min: A nice spin by Spearing down the Blackpool right. He dinks forward towards Delfouneso, who doesn\u2019t really bother going for the ball, much to the home support\u2019s irritation. But he knew full well he was a yard offside, and chose to save his energy. 51 min: A corner out on the left for Arsenal. They play it short. Iwobi draws a couple of tangerine shirts and slips the ball to Ramsey, who shoots from a tight angle. It\u2019s deflected out for another corner, this one leading to nothing much. 49 min: Iwobi breezes down the left wing, a ball-glued-to-boot burst that Stanley Matthews would have approved of. He beats four men. The resulting cross isn\u2019t up to Stan standards, though. Blackpool go up the other end, Gnanduillet dragging a poor shot wide left from the edge of the box. 47 min: Iwobi spins into space and is brought to an unceremonious halt by Guy. No booking, surprisingly, but it\u2019s a free kick to Arsenal 30 yards out. Elneny takes. Sokratis wins a header but doesn\u2019t get any goalward purchase on it. Delfouneso creams it away. And we\u2019re off again! Blackpool get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. Half-time entertainment. A paean to the seaside town of Blackpool, and its glorious showbiz tradition, directed by local auteur Peter Chelsom. There\u2019s enough time for Nketiah to bring down a long ball down the middle, and bobble a shot towards the bottom right. He should have scored, but Howard tips round the post. And that\u2019s that for the half. Willock has two goals; Nketiah should have had a hat-trick. Arsenal are cruising in some style, like you would in a Ford Mustang Escort. 45 min: Delfouneso cuts in from the right and has a blast. It\u2019s blocked, but rebounds to Spearing. The Blackpool captain thinks about shooting but instead spreads the play back to the right for Nottingham, who fires witlessly into a forest of players. Arsenal clear. 43 min: Arsenal stroke it about the back again. Blackpool, once bitten, don\u2019t bother pressing. 41 min: Replays suggest Iwobi did touch the ball with his arm. O\u2019Connor was complaining, but nobody else, and the referee\u2019s assistant saw nowt. 39 min: A suggestion that Iwobi might have brought that Jenkinson pass down with his arm, the ball rearing up off his knee. But the referee didn\u2019t see much wrong. It was a really clever move by Arsenal, who teased Blackpool into the press before breaking up the other end in ruthless fashion. This is a fine goal. Arsenal pass the ball around at the back awhile, drawing Blackpool onto them. They beat the press easily. Jenkinson sends a long pass down the right for Iwobi, who brings the ball down and slips it back to Jenkinson on the overlap. Jenkinson fires it low towards Nketiah by the near post; he flicks it further across the face of goal, and Willock arrives at the far post to bundle home. 35 min: Spearing sets Feeney away down the left with a lovely wedged pass. He\u2019s got Gnanduillet and Delfouneso in the middle, with no defender in sight! For a second it looks as though Arsenal are in a world of trouble, but the flag goes up for offside. It\u2019s the correct decision, though Blackpool aren\u2019t particularly happy about it. 33 min: A long throw into the Arsenal box from the right. Cech flaps instead of punching, and the ball\u2019s at the livewire Feeney\u2019s feet, just to the left of the D. Feeney looks to curl one into the bottom right, but doesn\u2019t set it out far enough, and it\u2019s an easy gather for Cech this time. 31 min: Blackpool push Arsenal back a bit, Nottingham probing down the right, Feeney down the left. Arsenal hold their shape. Blackpool are slowly working their way back into this match, though. The Gunners will be desirous of another goal to settle their inexperienced team down. 29 min: Taylor curls the free kick into the Arsenal box. Gnanduillet meets it, clear, six yards out! But he heads weakly, straight at Cech ... and it turns out he was a fair distance offside anyway. Even so, he should have planted that one past Cech; a poor miss. 28 min: A long throw down the left. Iwobi shoves Feeney in the back. Free kick in a dangerous position. 26 min: One corner leads to another, and that second one\u2019s easily headed clear by Spearing. Arsenal come back at Blackpool, Iwobi making a little space for himself down the inside-left channel, then dragging a low shot across goal and wide of the right-hand post. 25 min: Feeney makes good down the left and loops to the far post. There\u2019s a mild melee. Gnanduillet nearly gets a header in. Sokratis eventually clears. Arsenal go up the other end, Willock winning a corner with a burst down the left. 23 min: Taylor nearly gets on the end of Delfouenso\u2019s cross from the right, but can\u2019t get his feet sorted. This is an impressive response by Blackpool, who were threatening to capitulate for a few minutes back there. As it is, having hung on, they\u2019re now asking a couple of questions. 22 min: Delfouneso finds a bit of space down the right. He bombs down the wing and there\u2019s folk in the middle waiting for service. But he shoots from a tight angle instead, and it\u2019s easily fielded by Cech. 21 min: Gnanduillet holds the ball up well, before bringing Bola into the action down the left. There\u2019s a brief skirmish in the Arsenal box before the ball is cleared. As bad as Blackpool have been in defence, they\u2019ve asked a couple of questions down the other end, and should take heart accordingly. 18 min: Arsenal should probably have four goals already. But it\u2019s a thin line between 0-4 and 1-1 ... erm, well, y\u2019know ... and here Taylor spins by the right-hand edge of the Arsenal D, and sees his shot deflect and threaten to creep into the bottom left. Cech does well to gather at full stretch. That half-chance was set up by a lovely crossfield ball from Bola on the left to Delfouneso on the right. 16 min: Ramsey, deep on the right, finds Nketiah in the Blackpool box with a perfectly judged floating pass. Nketiah has gone too early, and though he chests down well, with a view to getting a shot away, it\u2019s all in vain as the flag goes up for offside. 15 min: Spearing spreads the play by sending Feeney racing down the left. Feeney earns a corner, which becomes Blackpool\u2019s second set-piece non-event of the match. 14 min: Blackpool are all over the shop here. Iwobi sends a looping cross from the left wing to the far post. Jenkinson should score from close range, but opts to head back across goal instead, allowing O\u2019Connor to hack clear. 13 min: Willock tears down the left, sits down O\u2019Conner, and nearly finds Nketiah in the middle. Then the livewire Maitland-Niles is sent clear through the centre by Iwobi, but the flag goes up for offside. Ramsey looks for the top right with the free kick. The ball twangs off the right-hand post, via a deflection off Sterling in the wall, and sails across the face of goal. Willock, six yards out, stoops and heads into the empty net. Howard had no chance to react! And it\u2019s fair to say that had been coming. 10 min: Nketiah hasn\u2019t let those early misses get to him, and he dribbles stylishly down the inside-left. He\u2019s brought down by Nottingham, just outside the area. Ramsey steps up to take the free kick, and ... 9 min: Ramsey sits deep again, and carves Blackpool open with another fine long pass down the middle. The impressive Maitland-Niles can\u2019t quite take the ball down while in full flight. 7 min: Well, this match could, probably should, already be Blackpool 1-2 Arsenal. Jenkinson flicks a cute pass down the right to release Maitland-Niles, who immediately squares for Nketiah. The 19-year-old striker slices his shot wide left from six yards. Another poor miss from the young man. But he\u2019s getting into the right places. 6 min: Cech plucks the corner from the clouds. Really not sure what Lichtsteiner was doing back there. 5 min: Gnanduillet dribbles with purpose down the inside-left channel. And into the area. Lichtsteiner backs off, and keeps backing off, allowing the tall Blackpool striker to Ormondroyd his way towards the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. He gets a shot away, and Cech does well to smother. Corner. 3 min: Ramsey, quarterbacking from deep, finds Maitland-Niles on the edge of the Blackpool area. Maitland-Niles cushions a first-time pass left for Nketiah, who slams a shot into the side netting. He shouldn\u2019t just have done better; one on one with Howard, he should have scored. 2 min: A slightly eerie atmosphere in this famous but empty old stadium. Arsenal songs echoing around, pinging off the walls. And we\u2019re off! Arsenal get the ball rolling. But possession\u2019s soon lost. Gnanduillet beats Elneny to the ball down the left and sends Feeney scampering free. But Feeney\u2019s a mile offside. Still, a promising start for the hosts. The teams are out! Blackpool, led out by 2012 finalist Jay Spearing, take to the field in their famous tangerine shirts. Arsenal are in their second-choice blue and purple. There are around 5,000 Arsenal fans here, and they\u2019ll greatly outnumber the home support, on account of the ongoing Oyston-out boycott. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! A late change to the Arsenal team. Laurent Koscielny has injured his back in the warm-up, so Carl Jenkinson steps in at right back, Stephan Lichtsteiner moving into the centre. Meanwhile Unai Emery has a quick word with BT Sport: \u201cWe want to win. This competition we use so many different players because it\u2019s a good area to take responsibility. It\u2019s a good test. It\u2019s a big match.\u201d Corrections and clarifications dept. So it would appear that this is a Ford Mustang ... ... and the thing wheelspinning about Blackpool, demanding the removal of the Oystons in a made-in-Dagenham stylee, is a Ford Escort Mexico. Thanks to Colin Young and Craig McEwan for the heads up. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like calling a Hillman Imp a Bentley,\u201d adds JG. Fashion watch. In the BT Sport studio, Arsenal legend Tony Adams is sporting a powder-blue velvet three-piece suit. A powder-blue velvet three-piece suit! It\u2019s a strong look, and to be fair he carries it off magnificently. To these untrained eyes, it\u2019s a handsome combination. Where\u2019s Hadley Freeman when you need her? In lieu of expert analysis, we\u2019ll have to make do with Gary Lineker instead. Pre-match demonstration II. A tangerine Ford Mustang makes its point as it makes its way past Bloomfield Road. Also, who\u2019s this good boy? He doesn\u2019t love the Oystons. But he loves you! A wet nose and a shiny coat. Such a good boy. Pre-match demonstration. Blackpool make one change to the team that lost 1-0 at home to Sunderland last week. Michael Nottingham comes in at the back for Ben Heneghan. Arsenal make six changes to the side that beat Fulham 4-1 on Tuesday. Bernd Leno, Shkodran Mustafi, Matteo Guendouzi, Grant Xhaka, Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang step down, allowing Petr Cech, Stefan Lichtsteiner, Mohamed Elneny, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Willock and Eddie Nketiah to take their place. Blackpool: Howard, Nottingham, Daniels, O\u2019Connor, Bola, Spearing, Guy, Taylor, Feeney, Delfouneso, Gnanduillet. Subs: Mafoumbi, Anderton, Bunney, McLaughlin, Pritchard, O\u2019Sullivan, Davies. Arsenal: Cech, Lichtsteiner, Koscielny, Sokratis, Kolasinac, Elneny, Ramsey, Maitland-Niles, Willock, Iwobi, Nketiah. Subs: Martinez, Jenkinson, Medley, Torreira, Guendouzi, Saka, Lacazette. Arsenal have won the FA Cup a record 13 times; Blackpool just the once. Even so, you could argue that these respective contributions to the competition\u2019s legacy are six and half-a-dozen. The Gunners bring plenty to the table: the 1930 Graf Zeppelin final, Charlie George, 1979\u2019s five-minute spectacular, Andy Linighan\u2019s late, late winner, Ray Parlour, Vieira\u2019s penalty, Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey. A list as impressive as it\u2019s long. But Blackpool have the Matthews final, and nobody\u2019s trumping that. This match is a repeat of the 1953 Charity Shield, and neither club is currently the force it was back then. Blackpool were coming off the back of that famous final, holders of the cup, while Arsenal were the reigning league champions. Nowadays Arsenal are well off the pace at the top of the Premier League, while Blackpool languish in mid-table all the way down in League One. The chances of the Seasiders causing a shock is therefore low, but tonight\u2019s hosts will take succour from their performance at the Emirates in the League Cup a couple of months ago, when they were an offside decision away from staging a two-goal comeback against their illustrious hosts. Another performance like that tonight, and it\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm.",

      "bodyText": "With less than two minutes on the clock Michael Jolley looked up at the heavens and shook his head in disbelief. The Grimsby manager had just seen his defender Andrew Fox dismissed \u2013 with a little help from the video assistant referee \u2013 for a poor tackle on Andros Townsend and faced the prospect of playing almost the entire match against Premier League opposition with 10 men. But having been to the wilderness of the National League and back since they last visited Selhurst Park in 2003, Grimsby are made of stern stuff and it took until the 86th minute for their resolve finally to be broken, by the substitute Jordan Ayew\u2019s header from Jeffrey Schlupp\u2019s free-kick. For Jolley, the former investment banker who began his coaching career at Palace\u2019s academy, it was a cruel way to lose but he will be extremely proud of the way his side stuck to their task after such an early setback, with James McKeown making a string of excellent saves to frustrate the hosts. \u201cThe result is incredibly disappointing but we were applauded off the pitch by the Palace supporters which says everything about our performance,\u201d said Jolley. \u201cIt was a mammoth task with 10 men and we almost got there. The players delivered a performance that Grimsby can be proud of.\u201d This was the first time these sides had met in the FA Cup since Grimsby beat a non-league Palace team 1-0 in 1908 and the presence of almost 6,000 visiting supporters who had made the trip from Lincolnshire certainly gave the tie extra spice. The home manager, Roy Hodgson,, who embraced warmly with his opposite number before kick-off, to his credit, kept his word by naming a strong side \u2013 albeit with nine changes from their win at Wolves on Wednesday \u2013 including Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha in attack. Grimsby, who came into the match having seen their four-match winning streak end at home against Mansfield on New Year\u2019s Day, were looking to reach the fourth round for the first time in 19 years but saw their chances seemingly evaporate inside the opening 100 seconds. Townsend was going nowhere when he received the ball just inside the opposition\u2019s half but an over-exuberant lunge by Fox caught the forward on the shin. At first the referee, Martin Atkinson, allowed play to continue before booking the transgressor when the ball went out of play. It was only then that he received the signal from the VAR and upgraded the punishment to a red card, with one Grimsby fan showing his frustration by throwing something on to the pitch as Fox departed. Suddenly the size of their task had increased exponentially. Yet despite Alexander S\u00f8rloth spurning two golden opportunities as Palace piled on the pressure, Grimsby somehow navigated their way to the half-hour mark and even had a sniff of goal when their top scorer, Wes Thomas, almost found a way through from Elliot Embleton\u2019s pass. They had McKeown to thank, after he reacted brilliantly to tip Martin Kelly\u2019s drive on to the post before Palace\u2019s left-back Pape Souar\u00e9 limped off following a heavy challenge. And, despite Palace mustering 14 shots in total, the visitors made it to the break unscathed, if not at full strength. The theme was no different in the second half as the hosts continued to press forward but their struggles highlighted the recurring issues for Hodgson\u2019s side in front of goal. After Kelly was once again denied by McKeown, and Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 hit the post with a header, the ineffective S\u00f8rloth was replaced by Connor Wickham, while Ayew, who scored his first goal for the club in the victory over Wolves, was introduced soon afterwards. Even then Grimsby could have snatched the win as they took advantage of Palace\u2019s lack of cutting edge to push forward in the last 10 minutes, although Wayne Hennessey was never really seriously tested on his return to the side. But then came the second sucker punch for Jolley and his brave team. \u201cIt was attritional,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cWe\u2019d had a few chances before we finally scored the goal but you have to give a lot of credit to Grimsby, having lost a player so early on.\u201d",

Upset shaped only the back-drop to the cup tie, not the contest itself, as the 19-year-old Joe Willock scored twice to confirm Premier League superiority.</p> <p>Willock, the England Under\u201120 midfielder making only his third senior start of the season, gave Arsenal a comfortable interval advantage before Alex Iwobi sealed victory late on. Blackpool had their moments and staged a second-half recovery but were always chasing an insurmountable gulf in quality. \u201cArsenal were just too good for us on the night,\u201d Terry McPhillips, the Blackpool manager, had to concede.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/fa-cup-third-round-roundup\">FA Cup: Accrington pile misery on Ipswich, Brighton win at Bournemouth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Arsenal\u2019s goalscoring teenage midfielder this was a night to savour. For the League One club, in contrast, what should have been a showpiece occasion was sullied by the toxic ownership of Owen Oyston. Only two sides of Bloomfield Road were occupied by outnumbered Blackpool supporters as the fans\u2019 boycott of home games held firm. Some gathered as usual outside the main reception in protest, while Arsenal\u2019s arrival was delayed by the bus-top dissenter outside their team hotel in Preston.</p> <p>The interruption had no impact on the Arsenal performance, and likewise the late withdrawal from the starting lineup of Laurent Koscielny with a back problem. \u201cThere was no change for us,\u201d said Emery of the delay. \u201cWe prepared as usual and I am proud of our work today. We had big commitment, good concentration, we were competitive and we imposed our quality little by little.\u201d</p> <p>Emery\u2019s changed team were immediately in control and could have been two goals ahead before taking the lead in the 11th minute. Eddie Nketiah had two clear openings but the 19-year\u2011old dragged a poor finish wide when sent clear by Ainsley Maitland-Niles and was also off-target when connecting with a low cross from Carl Jenkinson, Koscielny\u2019s replacement, at full stretch.</p> <p>Despite their command, Arsenal were defensively vulnerable and Petr Cech saved well from Armand Gnanduillet when the powerful forward burst through a crowded penalty area. The visitors, however, took a merited lead after Nketiah, a quick and dangerous presence, was fouled yards outside the Blackpool area. Aaron Ramsey\u2019s resulting free-kick struck the inside of Mark Howard\u2019s post via a slight deflection off the Blackpool wall and Willock reacted quickest to head home the rebound. The teenager made it three goals in three senior appearances this season before the interval.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db583f636c1828ef46dc9633a7f00879303f34fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db583f636c1828ef46dc9633a7f00879303f34fb/208_578_1401_841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Blackpool fan sits on top of the Arsenal team bus, preventing it from leaving their hotel on time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Blackpool fan sits on top of the Arsenal team bus, preventing it from leaving their hotel on time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @MrMoonUK/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jenkinson broke down the right wing and exchanged passes with Iwobi, who appeared to handle in the buildup. Nketiah met his low cross at the near post but was unable to convert. His shot squirmed across goal for Willock who, arriving unmarked at the back post, squeezed his finish past the despairing lunges of Michael Nottingham and Howard. It should have been three before half-time but the Blackpool goalkeeper produced a fine save to deny Nketiah from close range.</p> <p>The young striker may have lacked a clinical touch but his tireless effort and intelligent movement earned him strong backing from the 5,218 travelling supporters. There were also chants of \u201cAaron Ramsey, we want you to stay\u201d, with the Wales international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/03/juventus-aaron-ramsey-confident-signing-arsenal\" title=\"\">seemingly headed for Juventus</a> when his contract expires this summer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about each match,\u201d said Emery when asked about a possible U-turn on Ramsey\u2019s contract offer.

His cross evaded everyone inside the penalty area but fell perfectly for fellow full-back Nottingham who, unmarked and with time to pick his spot, side-footed over Cech\u2019s crossbar.

      "bodyText": "Unai Emery\u2019s first taste of the FA Cup began with a disgruntled Blackpool fan sitting on top of the Arsenal team coach but ended with a comfortable journey into the fourth round. Upset shaped only the back-drop to the cup tie, not the contest itself, as the 19-year-old Joe Willock scored twice to confirm Premier League superiority. Willock, the England Under\u201120 midfielder making only his third senior start of the season, gave Arsenal a comfortable interval advantage before Alex Iwobi sealed victory late on. Blackpool had their moments and staged a second-half recovery but were always chasing an insurmountable gulf in quality. \u201cArsenal were just too good for us on the night,\u201d Terry McPhillips, the Blackpool manager, had to concede. For Arsenal\u2019s goalscoring teenage midfielder this was a night to savour. For the League One club, in contrast, what should have been a showpiece occasion was sullied by the toxic ownership of Owen Oyston. Only two sides of Bloomfield Road were occupied by outnumbered Blackpool supporters as the fans\u2019 boycott of home games held firm. Some gathered as usual outside the main reception in protest, while Arsenal\u2019s arrival was delayed by the bus-top dissenter outside their team hotel in Preston. The interruption had no impact on the Arsenal performance, and likewise the late withdrawal from the starting lineup of Laurent Koscielny with a back problem. \u201cThere was no change for us,\u201d said Emery of the delay. \u201cWe prepared as usual and I am proud of our work today. We had big commitment, good concentration, we were competitive and we imposed our quality little by little.\u201d Emery\u2019s changed team were immediately in control and could have been two goals ahead before taking the lead in the 11th minute. Eddie Nketiah had two clear openings but the 19-year\u2011old dragged a poor finish wide when sent clear by Ainsley Maitland-Niles and was also off-target when connecting with a low cross from Carl Jenkinson, Koscielny\u2019s replacement, at full stretch. Despite their command, Arsenal were defensively vulnerable and Petr Cech saved well from Armand Gnanduillet when the powerful forward burst through a crowded penalty area. The visitors, however, took a merited lead after Nketiah, a quick and dangerous presence, was fouled yards outside the Blackpool area. Aaron Ramsey\u2019s resulting free-kick struck the inside of Mark Howard\u2019s post via a slight deflection off the Blackpool wall and Willock reacted quickest to head home the rebound. The teenager made it three goals in three senior appearances this season before the interval. Jenkinson broke down the right wing and exchanged passes with Iwobi, who appeared to handle in the buildup. Nketiah met his low cross at the near post but was unable to convert. His shot squirmed across goal for Willock who, arriving unmarked at the back post, squeezed his finish past the despairing lunges of Michael Nottingham and Howard. It should have been three before half-time but the Blackpool goalkeeper produced a fine save to deny Nketiah from close range. The young striker may have lacked a clinical touch but his tireless effort and intelligent movement earned him strong backing from the 5,218 travelling supporters. There were also chants of \u201cAaron Ramsey, we want you to stay\u201d, with the Wales international seemingly headed for Juventus when his contract expires this summer. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about each match,\u201d said Emery when asked about a possible U-turn on Ramsey\u2019s contract offer. The Arsenal manager did confirm he wanted a central defender and a winger \u2013 possibly Barcelona\u2019s Denis Su\u00e1rez \u2013 in this transfer window. Blackpool improved as an attacking unit in the second half and should have reduced the deficit when their captain, the former Liverpool midfielder Jay Spearing, released Marc Bola down the left. His cross evaded everyone inside the penalty area but fell perfectly for fellow full-back Nottingham who, unmarked and with time to pick his spot, side-footed over Cech\u2019s crossbar. Gnanduillet then almost capitalised on a slip by the Arsenal keeper, while Liam Feeney produced an air-shot when shaping to volley home and Paudie O\u2019Connor headed well wide from a corner. Blackpool were made to pay for their profligacy. Willock was denied a memorable hat-trick by a legitimate offside call against Sead Kolasinac. Moments later the substitute goalkeeper Christoffer Mafoumbi, on for the injured Howard, saved well from Ramsey\u2019s angled drive but the rebound fell for Iwobi to convert with ease.",

For all the complaining that came from many sections of Australian football when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/08/graham-arnold-socceroos-coach-after-2018-world-cup-bert-van-marwijk\">Graham Arnold was confirmed as the new Socceroos</a> head coach before the 2018 World Cup, on the field Arnold\u2019s side has yet to miss a beat.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/04/revenge-and-an-old-adversary-await-socceroos-in-tricky-asian-cup-group\">Australia\u2019s 2019 Asian Cup defence gets under way</a> this weekend in Al Aim against Jordan, his record post-Russia is played four for three convincing wins and a draw. Undefeated, with 13 goals scored and only one conceded. Three clean sheets secured, five debuts handed out and ten different goal-scorers. Not too shabby.</p> <p>Sure, some perspective is needed and the likes of Kuwait, Lebanon and Oman are not exactly ripping up trees in world football. The only notable opponent of pedigree in the past four fixtures was South Korea in Brisbane, which ended in a 1-1 draw in a game where the Socceroos dominated. But Arnold\u2019s men can only play whoever is in front of them. And so far they have met each challenge well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/04/revenge-and-an-old-adversary-await-socceroos-in-tricky-asian-cup-group\">Revenge and an old adversary await Socceroos in tricky Asian Cup group</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arnie has faced a mixture of bad luck and chance in his first six months in charge of the national team. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/03/lack-of-proven-goalscorer-hinders-australias-chances-of-retaining-asian-cup\">Skipper Mile Jedinak retired and injury has robbed</a> him of both arguably his best player \u2013 Aaron Mooy \u2013 and his most exciting young attacking talent \u2013 Daniel Arzani \u2013 for the Asian Cup. It appears likely that a hamstring complaint will deny him Mathew Leckie too.</p> <p>But the 55-year-old has got on with the job and spent little time complaining. Mark Milligan was handed the captaincy and Scottish winger Martin Boyle was quickly brought into the fold. The Hibernian forward\u2019s electric first cap, which featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/20/martin-boyle-states-socceroos-case-with-brace-as-tim-cahill-bids-farewell\">two goals and an assist against Lebanon, delighted the faithful</a>. Some even ventured hopefully that \u201cthe next Tim Cahill\u201d had finally arrived.</p> <p>Midfielder James Jeggo and winger Awer Mabil have also been introduced to add some pace and youth into the Socceroos set up. The result is that the Australian team looks relatively different to the one that struggled in Russia.</p> <p>Yes, the 4-3-3 formation remains \u2013 that breaks into a 4-2-3-1 at times \u2013 and the tactics are largely similar, but many of the personnel are fresh. The Socceroos will still rely heavily on the likes of Mat Ryan, Trent Sainsbury, Mark Milligan, Aziz Behich, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/28/socceroos-boss-denies-tom-rogic-is-unhappy-after-club-v-country-row\">Tom Rogic</a> and Robbie Kruse.</p> <p>An intensive rehab regime has ensured that Andrew Nabbout\u2019s shoulder was repaired and he made the squad, while Tom Juric and Cahill were jettisoned. It is Arnold\u2019s mantra that it is not the strikers\u2019 sole job but every player\u2019s to ensure goals are scored, from all across the pitch. At this point Arnold\u2019s Jurgen Klopp-inspired Liverpool-esque model is working.</p> <p>But the phoney war ends now. Jordan, Syria and Palestine shouldn\u2019t present too stern an opposition in Group B, apart from the odd banana skin, but Korea, Japan, Iran and Saudi Arabia will in the later stages. Anything but a semi-final appearance for Arnold and the Socceroos will be branded a failure. No slip-ups will be tolerated.</p> <p>There\u2019s no denying Arnold is a starkly different operator compared to both of his predecessors. Van Marwijk\u2019s time was exceptionally brief and his mission circumspect. Ange Postecoglou was bolder tactically and grander in vision, but remained a more aloof character, both to his players and with the media.</p> <p>In contrast, the former Sydney FC boss is more hands-on and approachable.

      "bodyText": "So far, so good. For all the complaining that came from many sections of Australian football when Graham Arnold was confirmed as the new Socceroos head coach before the 2018 World Cup, on the field Arnold\u2019s side has yet to miss a beat. As Australia\u2019s 2019 Asian Cup defence gets under way this weekend in Al Aim against Jordan, his record post-Russia is played four for three convincing wins and a draw. Undefeated, with 13 goals scored and only one conceded. Three clean sheets secured, five debuts handed out and ten different goal-scorers. Not too shabby. Sure, some perspective is needed and the likes of Kuwait, Lebanon and Oman are not exactly ripping up trees in world football. The only notable opponent of pedigree in the past four fixtures was South Korea in Brisbane, which ended in a 1-1 draw in a game where the Socceroos dominated. But Arnold\u2019s men can only play whoever is in front of them. And so far they have met each challenge well. Arnie has faced a mixture of bad luck and chance in his first six months in charge of the national team. Skipper Mile Jedinak retired and injury has robbed him of both arguably his best player \u2013 Aaron Mooy \u2013 and his most exciting young attacking talent \u2013 Daniel Arzani \u2013 for the Asian Cup. It appears likely that a hamstring complaint will deny him Mathew Leckie too. But the 55-year-old has got on with the job and spent little time complaining. Mark Milligan was handed the captaincy and Scottish winger Martin Boyle was quickly brought into the fold. The Hibernian forward\u2019s electric first cap, which featured two goals and an assist against Lebanon, delighted the faithful. Some even ventured hopefully that \u201cthe next Tim Cahill\u201d had finally arrived. Midfielder James Jeggo and winger Awer Mabil have also been introduced to add some pace and youth into the Socceroos set up. The result is that the Australian team looks relatively different to the one that struggled in Russia. Yes, the 4-3-3 formation remains \u2013 that breaks into a 4-2-3-1 at times \u2013 and the tactics are largely similar, but many of the personnel are fresh. The Socceroos will still rely heavily on the likes of Mat Ryan, Trent Sainsbury, Mark Milligan, Aziz Behich, Tom Rogic and Robbie Kruse. An intensive rehab regime has ensured that Andrew Nabbout\u2019s shoulder was repaired and he made the squad, while Tom Juric and Cahill were jettisoned. It is Arnold\u2019s mantra that it is not the strikers\u2019 sole job but every player\u2019s to ensure goals are scored, from all across the pitch. At this point Arnold\u2019s Jurgen Klopp-inspired Liverpool-esque model is working. But the phoney war ends now. Jordan, Syria and Palestine shouldn\u2019t present too stern an opposition in Group B, apart from the odd banana skin, but Korea, Japan, Iran and Saudi Arabia will in the later stages. Anything but a semi-final appearance for Arnold and the Socceroos will be branded a failure. No slip-ups will be tolerated. There\u2019s no denying Arnold is a starkly different operator compared to both of his predecessors. Van Marwijk\u2019s time was exceptionally brief and his mission circumspect. Ange Postecoglou was bolder tactically and grander in vision, but remained a more aloof character, both to his players and with the media. In contrast, the former Sydney FC boss is more hands-on and approachable. Arnold already has a strong bond with many of his players. He has coached nine of them before, five of whom he gave their professional debuts in club football. One, Sainsbury, is his son-in-law. Only a handful of the current Socceroos squad has not been coached before or against in the A-League by him. Arnold\u2019s personal manner has been embraced by both those familiar and unfamiliar. \u201cHe is very hands-on in his style of management,\u201d Jackson Irvine says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s responding well to it\u2026 I\u2019d never worked with Arnie before. The Kuwait camp was the first time we had met. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations since, he\u2019s come to watch me play in England and he\u2019s been really great with me.

I\u2019ve enjoyed it.\u201d Ryan was given his first taste of professional football by Arnold in 2010 at Central Coast Mariners as a teenager. \u201cAnge and Arnie are two different types of managers at the end of the day, they\u2019re going to have different styles.

Had he been fit to square off against Ford this may well have been a classic with which to begin the year.</p> <p>As it was, it was lively enough, with Leicester on to the board early with a Ford penalty. The England fly-half was instrumental in their opening try too, floating a pass to Jonah Holmes who released May outside him on the right for a simple finish. Gloucester could not get a foothold and Leicester added another penalty midway through the half.</p> <p>Billy Twelvetrees got Gloucester up and running with a penalty but while they grew into the match, their offloading game helping to make yards, Cipriani\u2019s eye for the killer pass was notable by its absence. \u201cDanny has X-Factor and skill he can bring,\u201d said Ackermann. \u201cWe have to have faith in the whole group though. When you lose you can be quick to point out individuals but I felt we can be much better.\u201d</p> <p>They finished the half the stronger, another Twelvetrees penalty bringing them to within seven at the break, but Leicester were over with what felt like the decisive score four minutes into the second half. Ford fizzed a pass to Matt Toomua, whose delightful inside ball to Holmes created the gap for the Wales full-back to cruise over. Ford converted for a 14-point lead.</p> <p>It proved to be one of Toomua\u2019s last acts, as he made way for Kyle Eastmond, who made an immediate impact on his return from suspension. His flicked pass \u2013 a skill borrowed from his league days \u2013 to Ben Youngs on the right was a delight, the scrum-half giving May a clear run to the line for his second.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/05/exeter-bristol-premiership-rugby-match-report\">Sean Lonsdale try helps Exeter Chiefs return to the top of Premiership</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To keep Leicester honest \u2013 and maybe to temper optimism in this, the most inconsistent of seasons \u2013 Gloucester hit back immediately with their openside flanker, Gareth Evans, picking off a loose Ford pass and showing enough pace to reach the line.

      "bodyText": "At this time of year, fresh starts can quickly become false dawns, so Leicester\u2019s bonus point win must be treated with caution, but we saw the Tigers at least bare their teeth. It was their second win in 11 matches and was fully deserved, with two tries from Jonny May against his former club proving decisive against a Gloucester side whose season has plateaued. Leicester\u2019s spirit was summed up by Dan Cole, out of the England picture but at his combative best, with George Ford again the architect of their stylish attack. Defensively, as was the case last time out at Bath, there were significant improvements, and they climb to sixth in the table. It helps too when May is on hand to finish his ninth and 10th tries of the season. \u201cJonny is world-class and he is always going to be up for it against his old club,\u201d said the Leicester coach, Geordan Murphy, who all but confirmed Phil Blake is returning to the club in a coaching capacity. \u201cGuys tend to have a little point to prove playing against their mates.\u201d Gloucester were outgunned at the breakdown and badly missed the direction Danny Cipriani provides from fly-half. Gloucester will now turn their attentions to the last two rounds of Europe \u2013 they are in with a shout of reaching the knockout stages as they head to Munster on Friday \u2013 and their coach, Johan Ackermann, revealed Cipriani could be in contention to return. Had he been fit to square off against Ford this may well have been a classic with which to begin the year. As it was, it was lively enough, with Leicester on to the board early with a Ford penalty. The England fly-half was instrumental in their opening try too, floating a pass to Jonah Holmes who released May outside him on the right for a simple finish. Gloucester could not get a foothold and Leicester added another penalty midway through the half. Billy Twelvetrees got Gloucester up and running with a penalty but while they grew into the match, their offloading game helping to make yards, Cipriani\u2019s eye for the killer pass was notable by its absence. \u201cDanny has X-Factor and skill he can bring,\u201d said Ackermann. \u201cWe have to have faith in the whole group though. When you lose you can be quick to point out individuals but I felt we can be much better.\u201d They finished the half the stronger, another Twelvetrees penalty bringing them to within seven at the break, but Leicester were over with what felt like the decisive score four minutes into the second half. Ford fizzed a pass to Matt Toomua, whose delightful inside ball to Holmes created the gap for the Wales full-back to cruise over. Ford converted for a 14-point lead. It proved to be one of Toomua\u2019s last acts, as he made way for Kyle Eastmond, who made an immediate impact on his return from suspension. His flicked pass \u2013 a skill borrowed from his league days \u2013 to Ben Youngs on the right was a delight, the scrum-half giving May a clear run to the line for his second. To keep Leicester honest \u2013 and maybe to temper optimism in this, the most inconsistent of seasons \u2013 Gloucester hit back immediately with their openside flanker, Gareth Evans, picking off a loose Ford pass and showing enough pace to reach the line. Twelvetrees converted and landed a subsequent penalty soon after to reduce the gap to 11. Ford\u2019s clever show and go to create the space and splash over the line put the game to bed and while Jordan Olowofela\u2019s late try was harshly disallowed, it was an afternoon when Leicester could have few complaints. \u201cAt the start of the year it\u2019s a pretty positive picture to show,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t changed a huge amount, we haven\u2019t gone to the pub or gone paintballing, we\u2019ve just been working hard.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Wide-eyed foreigners long ago concluded that masochism was <em>le vice anglais</em>. Impressed by the volume of Victorian spanking pornography, the Italian critic <a href=\"https://storyofoblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/sir-stephen-the-english-vice/\" title=\"\">Mario Praz</a> wrote in the 1930s: \u201cIt seems to be an assured fact that sexual flagellation has been practised in England with greater frequency than elsewhere.\u201d Or as a successful lawyer once declared on the theme: \u201cMost people probably think S&amp;M \u2013 spanking, bondage, whipping, role play like doctors and nurses, sheikhs and harems, guards and prisoners \u2013 is harmless and private and even funny.\u201d</p> <p>The late Christopher Hitchens, who claimed with pride that Margaret Thatcher once \u201csmote me on the rear with a rolled-up parliamentary order paper\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/books/review/Genzlinger-t.html\" title=\"\">explained it thus</a>: \u201cThere is almost no English surname, however ancient and dignified, that cannot be instantly improved by the prefix \u2018Spanker\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The values of the spanker have triumphed. As long as adults consent, most believe no one should complain. Less harmless, private or funny, is the more dominant (in all senses of the word) national trait of proclaiming the cleansing power of suffering as long as the suffering is endured by others. \u201cSado-monetarism\u201d, as my colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamkeegan\" title=\"\">Bill Keegan</a> called it in the 1980s, as Margaret Thatcher and Geoffrey Howe cut government spending and whacked up interest rates at the height of a recession. The millions who lost their jobs in Scotland and Wales, the Midlands and the north of England were not consenting adults as they were not on the whole Tory voters.</p> <p>The story today\u2019s right tells about Thatcher reflects none of this asymmetry of suffering. She was the outsider, it runs, who defied the experts; in her case, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2013/04/09/how-mrs-thatcher-smashed-the-keynesian-consensus\" title=\"\">364 economists wrote to the <em>Times</em></a> in 1981 to warn, quite accurately, that her policies would \u201cdeepen the depression, erode the industrial base of our economy and threaten its social and political stability\u201d.</p> <p>She went on to prove the pain was really a pleasure by conquering inflation, destroying the unions and restoring British greatness. The essential question of who received the pain and who escaped it is forgotten, assuming that today\u2019s Thatcher admirers registered it in the first place.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The referendum was yet another symptom of how the old overrule the young in the modern west.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The same regions that suffered most in the 1980s will be hit hardest by Brexit. You could say that Wales, the north and the Midlands consented to sado-Brexitism when they voted to leave in 2016. Yet the right did not promise them a spanking in the referendum. On the contrary, it gained their consent on a false promise that leaving the EU would bring prosperity and restore lost greatness. As the government bulk buys fridges to store essential medicines, bulk buys ferries to transport food, as Liam Fox\u2019s promised trade deals vanish, as investment evaporates and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a90765c-0ce6-11e9-acdc-4d9976f1533b\" title=\"\">consumer confidence falls,</a> the promises of 2016 are being blown away like dust before a storm. In their place comes the imagery of suffering that must be endured for the sake of a brighter future.</p> <p>Just as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s far left, like its communist predecessors, lives off the fantasy that a crisis of capitalism will propel the people to socialism, so the Brexit right believes that suffering is essential to restore national independence from a menacing Europe.</p> <p>The Second World War was the essential moment in the formation of English national identity.

      "bodyText": "Wide-eyed foreigners long ago concluded that masochism was le vice anglais. Impressed by the volume of Victorian spanking pornography, the Italian critic Mario Praz wrote in the 1930s: \u201cIt seems to be an assured fact that sexual flagellation has been practised in England with greater frequency than elsewhere.\u201d Or as a successful lawyer once declared on the theme: \u201cMost people probably think S&amp;M \u2013 spanking, bondage, whipping, role play like doctors and nurses, sheikhs and harems, guards and prisoners \u2013 is harmless and private and even funny.\u201d The late Christopher Hitchens, who claimed with pride that Margaret Thatcher once \u201csmote me on the rear with a rolled-up parliamentary order paper\u201d, explained it thus: \u201cThere is almost no English surname, however ancient and dignified, that cannot be instantly improved by the prefix \u2018Spanker\u2019.\u201d The values of the spanker have triumphed. As long as adults consent, most believe no one should complain. Less harmless, private or funny, is the more dominant (in all senses of the word) national trait of proclaiming the cleansing power of suffering as long as the suffering is endured by others. \u201cSado-monetarism\u201d, as my colleague Bill Keegan called it in the 1980s, as Margaret Thatcher and Geoffrey Howe cut government spending and whacked up interest rates at the height of a recession. The millions who lost their jobs in Scotland and Wales, the Midlands and the north of England were not consenting adults as they were not on the whole Tory voters. The story today\u2019s right tells about Thatcher reflects none of this asymmetry of suffering. She was the outsider, it runs, who defied the experts; in her case, 364 economists wrote to the Times in 1981 to warn, quite accurately, that her policies would \u201cdeepen the depression, erode the industrial base of our economy and threaten its social and political stability\u201d. She went on to prove the pain was really a pleasure by conquering inflation, destroying the unions and restoring British greatness. The essential question of who received the pain and who escaped it is forgotten, assuming that today\u2019s Thatcher admirers registered it in the first place. The same regions that suffered most in the 1980s will be hit hardest by Brexit. You could say that Wales, the north and the Midlands consented to sado-Brexitism when they voted to leave in 2016. Yet the right did not promise them a spanking in the referendum. On the contrary, it gained their consent on a false promise that leaving the EU would bring prosperity and restore lost greatness. As the government bulk buys fridges to store essential medicines, bulk buys ferries to transport food, as Liam Fox\u2019s promised trade deals vanish, as investment evaporates and consumer confidence falls, the promises of 2016 are being blown away like dust before a storm. In their place comes the imagery of suffering that must be endured for the sake of a brighter future. Just as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s far left, like its communist predecessors, lives off the fantasy that a crisis of capitalism will propel the people to socialism, so the Brexit right believes that suffering is essential to restore national independence from a menacing Europe. The Second World War was the essential moment in the formation of English national identity. It is far more important than the legacy of empire and dreams of imperial greatness, however much they may animate Boris Johnson and his followers. I don\u2019t believe anyone can begin to understand Britain without grasping that we were the only major European country not to be invaded by Hitler or Stalin and never to have experienced communism or fascism. The urgent need for postwar co-operation was never felt. Its absence alone explains the astonishing nonchalance with which 17.4 million people took the risk of leaving the EU.

They were teaching it at Oxford and they weren\u2019t teaching witchcraft so I thought, maybe there\u2019s something to it; I studied it there. For me, it works \u2013 maybe for other people it doesn\u2019t.

I turned my memories into comedy and delivered it to my mentor, Alan Rickman \u2013 he would listen and say, this is so great, keep going, write how you think. So it was out of the darkness that light came in. I think I would have ended up\u2026 maybe I wouldn\u2019t have ended up. Maybe I would have killed myself. But I learned to take something that\u2019s painful and flip it \u2013 then people listen and acknowledge it, so at least you get it out of your system; part of the problem with trauma is that it\u2019s in your head and you can\u2019t get it out.</p> <p><strong>You did a famous </strong><strong>BBC</strong><strong> series </strong><strong><em>Ruby Wax Meets\u2026</em></strong><strong> in which you interviewed celebrities. </strong><strong>How does it feel being</strong><strong> interviewed yourself?</strong><br>I like the sense of freefall it brings. I think I pay attention to the other person and respect them. You have to respect the person doing the interview whereas a lot of people don\u2019t \u2013 especially when I interviewed Donald Trump. He thought I was an idiot so I became an idiot. He frightened me and it\u2019s my default that when I\u2019m treated like an idiot, I don\u2019t make sense any more \u2013 but if I had stayed steady and mindful, I could have gotten a lot more out of him. So I learned from being an interviewer how to be interviewed.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?</strong><br>My favourite book now is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Patrick-Melrose-Novels-Mothers/dp/1250069602\" title=\"\"><em>The Complete Patrick Melrose Novels </em></a>by Edward St Aubyn. That\u2019s my dream book. You\u2019re rooting for a guy who\u2019s beyond the gutter but also a genius. I love characters that are dark and funny \u2013 my favourite combination. I love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/09/fiction.reviews\" title=\"\"><em>The Corrections</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview26\" title=\"\"><em>Revolutionary Road</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/23/philip-roth-obituary\" title=\"\">Philip Roth</a>.</p> <p><strong>What book would you recommend to people?</strong></p> <p><em>The Sellout </em>by Paul Beatty \u2013 he can write black American street slang; he makes genius and hilarious observations, and tells the story of the American dream gone wrong the way Tom Wolfe does. He\u2019s taken a show that I saw in my childhood called <em>Our Gang </em>\u2013 there was a black kid in it and they would cover him in tar and torture him \u2013 it\u2019s horrifying. Paul Beatty is writing about the American justice system gone completely wrong. It\u2019s taking bigotry and turning it inside out.</p> <p><strong>How do you organise your books?</strong><br>In order of their height.</p> <p><strong>What do you read for sheer pleasure?</strong><br>I really like science books, and read a lot of them while researching <em>How to Be Human.</em></p> <p><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?</strong><br>I couldn\u2019t read as a child because my house was so noisy and distracting. I could only look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/dr-seuss\" title=\"\">Dr Seuss </a>because it was as crazy as my house. I watched a lot of TV \u2013 Jack Benny, Dick van Dyke, Jerry Lewis, Joan Rivers. I only got smart in my late 50s. I wish I did read more as a child but I couldn\u2019t focus. I would hear my mother screaming, as she had hysteria.</p> <p><strong>You write in your new book that you first became fascinated by mental illness aged around 13</strong><strong>.</strong><br>I still have a library book out from Evanston high school that should have been returned in the 60s called <em>This is Mental Illness.</em> Maybe I had an inkling that my mother wasn\u2019t like other mothers. When you\u2019re a kid you tend to think that\u2019s how everybody lives, but I must have sensed that something wasn\u2019t right especially when I saw other kids\u2019 mothers and they were so loving. My mum handed me her rage. But after researching my genealogy during <em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em> I can\u2019t blame my parents any more \u2013 I feel sorry for them.</p> <p><strong>What are you working on next?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m working on another book, which will either be called <em>How to Save the World</em> or <em>To the Future With Love.</em></p> <p><strong>What is the process of writing a book like for you?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m both illiterate and dyslexic and I have to stare at the words for ages. At first it\u2019s just a splattering of pain, and then some time after my 15th edit it starts to sculpt into something really funny. The process is horrific \u2013 it\u2019s like drawing from an open wound. Only toward the end when I make myself laugh, I think, oh this is good. When it meets the audience it\u2019s a total pleasure.</p> <p>\u2022 How to Be Human: The Manual is published by Penguin (\u00a38.99).

I couldn\u2019t read as a child because my house was so noisy and distracting. I could only look at Dr Seuss because it was as crazy as my house. I watched a lot of TV \u2013 Jack Benny, Dick van Dyke, Jerry Lewis, Joan Rivers. I only got smart in my late 50s. I wish I did read more as a child but I couldn\u2019t focus. I would hear my mother screaming, as she had hysteria. You write in your new book that you first became fascinated by mental illness aged around 13. I still have a library book out from Evanston high school that should have been returned in the 60s called This is Mental Illness. Maybe I had an inkling that my mother wasn\u2019t like other mothers. When you\u2019re a kid you tend to think that\u2019s how everybody lives, but I must have sensed that something wasn\u2019t right especially when I saw other kids\u2019 mothers and they were so loving. My mum handed me her rage. But after researching my genealogy during Who Do You Think You Are? I can\u2019t blame my parents any more \u2013 I feel sorry for them. What are you working on next? I\u2019m working on another book, which will either be called How to Save the World or To the Future With Love. What is the process of writing a book like for you? I\u2019m both illiterate and dyslexic and I have to stare at the words for ages. At first it\u2019s just a splattering of pain, and then some time after my 15th edit it starts to sculpt into something really funny. The process is horrific \u2013 it\u2019s like drawing from an open wound. Only toward the end when I make myself laugh, I think, oh this is good. When it meets the audience it\u2019s a total pleasure. \u2022 How to Be Human: The Manual is published by Penguin (\u00a38.99).

      "bodyText": "Part 2. Lost to the series The purpose of the weekly Observer Picture Archive series, as described in part one of this article, is to rediscover commissioned and published photography that would otherwise languish in our library. Republished online with the original text, sometimes with additional images from the shoot, the intention is to create a searchable record of the work of some brilliant 20th century newspaper photographers. When I started the task of going through the old issues of the Observer, I already had some favourites in mind and was looking forward to finding them and sharing them with the readers. But it wasn\u2019t always that simple \u2013 I can find no trace of some I hoped to include in print. Michael Peto\u2019s Foggy day in Dundee (which you can buy as a gicl\u00e9e print from our partner theprintspace) is a case in point. I haven\u2019t been able to find it in any 1959 edition. Maybe it wasn\u2019t taken on assignment. Maybe it was but didn\u2019t make the cut. Maybe the story didn\u2019t stand up and was spiked or maybe it was moved downpage and didn\u2019t carry a photograph. It happens still.

      "body": "<p>Theresa May is facing a growing clamour among senior Tories to resist cutting university tuition fees, with warnings that it would dent social mobility, benefit the wealthy and put some institutions out of business.</p> <p>Justine Greening, the former education secretary, and former university ministers Jo Johnson and David Willetts spoke out amid mounting expectations that a review of higher education could back a cut to the maximum fees of \u00a39,250 a year for some courses. All warned against a headline cut in fees.</p> <p>May is also being warned privately she will never be able to secure support for a cut in fees in the Commons. It comes as some universities sound the alarm about their finances, with competition for students increasing and the threat of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/04/universities-raise-alarm-over-no-deal-brexit-and-eu-student-enrolment\" title=\"\">causing further uncertainty</a>.</p> <p>A review of higher education funding, by the former broker Philip Augar, <a href=\"https://wonkhe.com/blogs/taking-is-too-easy-leaks-from-the-augar-review/\" title=\"\">is due to report early this year</a> and is believed to be considering a cut in maximum fees on some courses from \u00a39,250 to \u00a36,500. Such a move would see the Treasury asked to pay billions more to ensure universities were not left out of pocket. It has also been suggested that the review could back an increase in fees for some courses that lead to higher earnings. </p> <p>May is said to have been keen on a cut to improve her party\u2019s prospects among young voters, but there is concern on the Tory benches about such a move, which many see as a doomed attempt to compete with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s pledge to abolish fees. </p> <p>Greening said the last thing universities needed was a \u201ccack-handed fees reform that means we go backward on social mobility and access\u201d.</p> <p>Johnson said a fees cut would see universities \u201conce again competing for limited amounts of public money against politically more powerful areas\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is clearly right and progressive that people who go on to earn a graduate post and salary should make a contribution to the cost of their courses. Lowering fees would benefit the highest-earning graduates only, who are the ones most likely to repay in full.</p> <p>\u201cIt would also make it harder for universities to widen participation. Additional fee income allowed them to spend more on outreach programmes to schools, bursaries, fee waivers, and so on. Some of that money could be better spent, but it has played a part in what has been an extraordinary story of widening participation in higher education over the last decade. To go back to the old model will send that engine of social mobility straight into reverse.\u201d</p> <p>Willetts, a Tory peer, said there was no evidence the Treasury would be prepared to \u201cshell out billions more\u201d on higher education and warned that a fees cut was not the right way to win over young voters. \u201cThe fear with Augar is the advisers around the prime minister will nab the fee cut, but universities are left uncompensated. That would be disastrous for universities and, above all, students.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faf2788c48286b7c8abbc8f7d4471288203a1035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/faf2788c48286b7c8abbc8f7d4471288203a1035/0_0_3500_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justine Greening warns of \u2018cack-handed fees reform that means we go backward on social mobility and access to university\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justine Greening warns of \u2018cack-handed fees reform that means we go backward on social mobility and access to university\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mirzoeff/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He added: \u201cThere seems to be a view in No 10 that too many people go to university. As soon as you start reducing the numbers, it is the people from poorer backgrounds who lose out. For all those reasons, this would be bad for social mobility, which I know Damian Hinds [the education secretary] is committed to.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street has also been warned that, with Tory concerns and a wafer-thin majority reliant on the Democratic Unionist party, a fee cut would not get through the Commons. Labour wants all fees abolished. </p> <p>Another senior Tory said the move to cut fees amounted to an attempt \u201cto enact Ed Miliband\u2019s policy [of a fee reduction] on the cheap\u201d, adding: \u201cIt will shrink the universities sector. What MP is going to vote for a policy that does that at a time when we need to be championing \u2018Global Britain\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Chris Hale, Universities UK policy director, said: \u201cCutting university fees would create a significant and serious funding gap. As speculation of a fee cap grows, numerous concerns remain unaddressed, including whether government will cover the funding shortfall and whether any new funding sources could be guaranteed in the long term.</p> <p>\u201cUnless this is addressed, we risk returning to a time when university places were capped and courses were underfunded. That would be to the serious detriment of social mobility and it would stop universities from investing in world class facilities.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is facing a growing clamour among senior Tories to resist cutting university tuition fees, with warnings that it would dent social mobility, benefit the wealthy and put some institutions out of business. Justine Greening, the former education secretary, and former university ministers Jo Johnson and David Willetts spoke out amid mounting expectations that a review of higher education could back a cut to the maximum fees of \u00a39,250 a year for some courses. All warned against a headline cut in fees. May is also being warned privately she will never be able to secure support for a cut in fees in the Commons. It comes as some universities sound the alarm about their finances, with competition for students increasing and the threat of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit causing further uncertainty. A review of higher education funding, by the former broker Philip Augar, is due to report early this year and is believed to be considering a cut in maximum fees on some courses from \u00a39,250 to \u00a36,500. Such a move would see the Treasury asked to pay billions more to ensure universities were not left out of pocket. It has also been suggested that the review could back an increase in fees for some courses that lead to higher earnings. May is said to have been keen on a cut to improve her party\u2019s prospects among young voters, but there is concern on the Tory benches about such a move, which many see as a doomed attempt to compete with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s pledge to abolish fees. Greening said the last thing universities needed was a \u201ccack-handed fees reform that means we go backward on social mobility and access\u201d. Johnson said a fees cut would see universities \u201conce again competing for limited amounts of public money against politically more powerful areas\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is clearly right and progressive that people who go on to earn a graduate post and salary should make a contribution to the cost of their courses. Lowering fees would benefit the highest-earning graduates only, who are the ones most likely to repay in full. \u201cIt would also make it harder for universities to widen participation. Additional fee income allowed them to spend more on outreach programmes to schools, bursaries, fee waivers, and so on. Some of that money could be better spent, but it has played a part in what has been an extraordinary story of widening participation in higher education over the last decade. To go back to the old model will send that engine of social mobility straight into reverse.\u201d Willetts, a Tory peer, said there was no evidence the Treasury would be prepared to \u201cshell out billions more\u201d on higher education and warned that a fees cut was not the right way to win over young voters. \u201cThe fear with Augar is the advisers around the prime minister will nab the fee cut, but universities are left uncompensated. That would be disastrous for universities and, above all, students.\u201d He added: \u201cThere seems to be a view in No 10 that too many people go to university. As soon as you start reducing the numbers, it is the people from poorer backgrounds who lose out. For all those reasons, this would be bad for social mobility, which I know Damian Hinds [the education secretary] is committed to.\u201d Downing Street has also been warned that, with Tory concerns and a wafer-thin majority reliant on the Democratic Unionist party, a fee cut would not get through the Commons. Labour wants all fees abolished. Another senior Tory said the move to cut fees amounted to an attempt \u201cto enact Ed Miliband\u2019s policy [of a fee reduction] on the cheap\u201d, adding: \u201cIt will shrink the universities sector. What MP is going to vote for a policy that does that at a time when we need to be championing \u2018Global Britain\u2019?\u201d Chris Hale, Universities UK policy director, said: \u201cCutting university fees would create a significant and serious funding gap. As speculation of a fee cap grows, numerous concerns remain unaddressed, including whether government will cover the funding shortfall and whether any new funding sources could be guaranteed in the long term. \u201cUnless this is addressed, we risk returning to a time when university places were capped and courses were underfunded. That would be to the serious detriment of social mobility and it would stop universities from investing in world class facilities.\u201d",

It is a sorry state of affairs for the oldest national competition in world football, a result of the Football Association\u2019s whopping new six-year \u00a3820m deal with overseas rights holders, one that the governing body says will benefit the grassroots game. Every one of the 32 third-round ties strewn across this weekend will be screened worldwide, which is brilliant in terms of a global reach, for those fans in the Middle East plugged into Brentford v Oxford and Bolton v Walsall, but perhaps not quite so great for the traditionalists of this world. And while it is saddening, we need not be totally downbeat for there are still some seemingly cracking ties on this afternoon\u2019s menu, including Lincoln\u2019s trip to Goodison Park and Nottingham Forest at Chelsea, in what will be Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s final game for the club. The focus is already on under-pressure Stoke manager Gary Rowett, who takes his side to Shrewsbury this afternoon, but will sharpen should his team slip-up. By the time we hit 3pm, seven ties will be nearing conclusion, with another 10 teams rocking up at stadiums across the country ready to do battle in the late kick-offs this evening.</p> <p><strong>FA Cup third-round fixtures, all 3pm (GMT):</strong> <br>Accrington v Ipswich Town, Aston Villa v Swansea City, Bolton Wanderers v Walsall, Brentford v Oxford United, Chelsea v Nottingham Forest, Derby County v Southampton, Everton v Lincoln City, Fleetwood Town v AFC Wimbledon, Gillingham v Cardiff City, Middlesbrough v Peterborough United</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/03/fa-cup-third-round-magic-gone-saturday-kick-offs-wembley\">Decline of Saturday spectacle shows the FA Cup is not what it used to be | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

The League One side survive eight minutes of second-half stoppage time to clinch victory. Few Cardiff players did themselves any favours at Priestfield, with Gillingham prospering following Elliott List\u2019s winner, after a mistake by Cardiff goalkeeper Alex Smithies. For the first time in 15 years, the Gills are in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Frank Lampard\u2019s side earn a third-round replay, after fighting back from two goals down to earn a draw. Nathan Redmond scored twice for Saints before Derby rallied to force a replay that both teams could really do without. It was not a cakewalk, but Marco Silva\u2019s side are through. Cesc F\u00e0bregas is in floods of tears at the final whistle. That looks to be a goodbye to England as well as Chelsea. The holders cruise into the fourth round. Callum Hudson-Odoi did himself no harm. And that\u2019s surely the winner! Josh Magennis hits a second-half hat-trick. Now, there is a sentence you will scarcely hear \u2013 if ever again. Bolton are cruising into the fourth round. Ashley Fletcher joins the party at the Riverside. 85 min: Maurizio Sarri makes his final change. On comes N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. Cesc F\u00e0bregas bows out of Chelsea and, presumably, England for the last time. Ooooo! Elliott List, the former Crystal Palace youngster, scores his sixth of the season and Neil Warnock\u2019s side are in grave danger of being on the receiving end of a good ole\u2019 Cup upset. Goalfest at Bolton! From bad to worse for Dean Smith\u2019s Villa. Jay Fulton adds a third. 76 min: Morata is replaced by Cesar Azpilicueta as Chelsea look to close the game out at Stamford Bridge. Meanwhile, for buildup to Blackpool v Arsenal and team news, look no further: Can you smell that? The sweet scent of an FA Cup upset. Ched Evans levels things up from the spot. Wally Downes\u2019s side had steamrollered into a 2-0 lead but two goals in two minutes restore parity. Joey Barton\u2019s team are not going quietly. 71 min: Jack Colback is shown a yellow card for a cynical challenge on Ross Barkley inside the Chelsea half. Meanwhile, a new low for Bolton: the attendance at what is now affectionately known as the University of Bolton Stadium is just 5,506, the lowest ever post-war FA Cup third round crowd at Bolton. Britt Assombalonga gets his second and that\u2019s surely job done. Another own goal at Bolton, and a sixth goal in 10 minutes. 65 min: Fancy a Chelsea stat, via Opta? Callum Hudson-Odoi is the first teenager to assist two goals in a single competitive fixture for Chelsea since Scott Sinclair (v Leicester in 2007). Meanwhile, Jonathan Kodjia has gone close for Aston Villa against Swansea, but they still trail by two goals and Mohamed Elyounoussi should have helped Southampton re-gain their lead, but his header is tame and, instead, the Derby keeper Kelle Roos gobbles it up. Jon Guthrie puts the ball into his own net as Bolton score three goals in five minutes. At half-time, an upset seemed to be brewing. That feels like game over at the Riverside, as Lewis Wing adds a third. Meanwhile, Charlton go close through Darren Pratley. It\u2019s 1-1 at the Valley, against Sunderland. Josh Magennis pokes Bolton in front for the first time. Can they hold on? Things were looking so rosy for Saints too. A superb striker by Tom Lawrence, one of Frank Lampard\u2019s star performers this season. Clayton Donaldson grabs an equaliser for Phil Parkinson\u2019s beleaguered side. Like London buses, etc. A brilliant header by the Spaniard and another fine assist by Callum Hudson-Odoi who is doing a good job of staking a claim for a regular starting berth. Moments before Morata had a missed an absolute sitter, of course. Jack Marriott pull one back, with his 10th goal of the season. George Friend doubles Boro\u2019s lead in the north-east. It had been coming. \u00c1lvaro Morata strikes at Stamford Bridge. Wonderful wing play by Callum Hudson-Odoi, the 18-year-old, to set up Morata for his eighth of the season. It was a nice instinctive one-touch finish by the Spaniard. Earlier on Forest fans were giving it \u201cYou\u2019re just a shit Daryl Murphy\u201d. That\u2019s them told. Nathan Dyer scores his first goal for 11 months. Nathan Redmond scores his \u2013 and Saints\u2019 \u2013 second of the afternoon. It\u2019s another effort from distance, and this one is a corker too. Charlie Austin lays the ball off and Redmond waltzes towards the edge of the box, where he jinks inside and bends an effort into the far corner. It is only the second time in his career that he has weighed in with two goals in the same game. A beautiful strike, and his fourth goal in five games; he has been rejuvenated under Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. Breakthrough at the Riverside. Forget about kick-offs being strewn over four days, and tuck into this gallery for that that warm and fuzzy FA Cup kind of feeling: Some essential half-time reading: Accrington 0-0 Ipswich Aston Villa 0-1 Swansea Bolton 0-1 Walsall Chelsea 0-0 Nottingham Forest Derby 0-1 Southampton Everton 2-1 Lincoln Fleetwood 0-1 AFC Wimbledon Gillingham 0-0 Cardiff Middlesbrough 0-0 Peterborough 44 min: Loftus-Cheek looked close to tears as he headed down the tunnel. After having to be so patient for his chance, this was not the afternoon he had planned. He had been limping before being forced off. Just when there was a sniff of regular game-time, with a lot of big games ahead, he is forced off. 41 min: Eden Hazard is on for Ruben Loftus-Cheek at Stamford Bridge. Loftus-Cheek was fouled for the missed penalty and it appears the England midfielder has a back problem. Not the rest Mr Sarri had planned for Hazard. Meanwhile, Ross Barkley is shown a yellow card for bringing down Joao Carvalho on halfway. 35 min: A couple of half-chances for Peterborough up at Middlesbrough. Tony Pulis could do without defeat to the League One side. Siriki Dembele dropped an effort just wide of a post before Ivan Toney\u2019s header sailed over the bar. Elsewhere, Lovre Kalinic, on debut, does well to scramble Connor Roberts\u2019 effort round the post at Villa Park, where Swansea lead 1-0. In League Two, Colin Calderwood\u2019s Cambridge lead Stevenage. 30 min: Luke Steele saves Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s penalty! The Spaniard, captaining Chelsea on his final appearance for the club makes a hash of things from 12 yards. It is a poor spot-kick, with Steele saving low down to his right-hand side. It was a stuttered run-up by F\u00e0bregas (why do so many players do those?) and half of the Forest team poured into the box before the midfielder had even shot at goal. That was not how F\u00e0bregas envisaged bowing out. Michael Bostwick pulls a goal back for the League Two side. Meanwhile, Chelsea have a penalty at Stamford Bridge, with Fox fouling Loftus-Cheek. Michael O\u2019Connor\u2019s free kick is headed at Jordon Pickford by Jason Shackell. The Everton goalkeeper can\u2019t hold it and Bostwick slams home the rebound. 24 min: Gillingham have hacked a Nathaniel Mendez-Laing effort off the line to keep things goalless at Priestfield. Down in League Two, Bury are ahead at Huish Park. It goes from bad to worse for Darren Way, who has garnered only one win from his last 17 matches in charge. His team were 21st at kick-off. Nicky Maynard, previously of Bristol City, opens the scoring with his 10th goal of the season. 22 min: Chelsea are giving Nottingham Forest a hard time at Stamford Bridge. Luke Steele mad a stunning early save to deny Alvaro Morata from point-blank range before the Forest midfielder Claudio Yacob did brilliantly to block a shot from Callum Hudson-Odoi, the in-demand teenager. Davide Zappacosta has also had an effort deflected on to the roof of the net from distance. Andy Cook strikes, sweeping home Matt Jarvis\u2019s cross. Jarvis joined on loan from Norwich earlier this week and has made an instant impact. That is Cook\u2019s 12th goal of the season following a summer move from Tranmere. He has scored in all three rounds of this season\u2019s FA Cup. Andy Barcham puts Wally Downes\u2019s side ahead. Barely a whiff of celebration from the Brazilian. Everton double their lead at Goodison Park and, what seemed a potential banana skin for Marco Silva\u2019s side, now seems anything but. It was a lovely deft finish by the Everton forward, who has made a lively start. Can Danny Cowley\u2019s side fight their way back in? Leighton Baines dinks the ball in to the back post, and Ademola Lookman nods in beyond Josh Vickers in the Lincoln goal. That is Lookman\u2019s first goal for Everton since December 2017 v Apollon Limassol, all of 394 days ago. Nathan Redmond helps Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s men to a flying start. Redmond breaks free and hits a low, left-footed shot from 18 yards that\u2019s heading towards the far corner before being deflected in via Richard Keogh, the Derby skipper. A dream start for Graham Potter\u2019s side. Swansea are without injured talisman Oli McBurnie in Birmingham but Courtney Baker-Richardson, the 23-year-old has scored on his seventh start for the club. Meanwhile, Sunderland lead at Charlton early on in League One. Luke O\u2019Nien has struck at the Valley. The 3pms under way around the grounds. Up at the Riverside, Dimi Konstantopoulos becomes Middlesbrough\u2019s oldest ever player at the age of 40 years and 37 days. Up front, Britt Assombalonga starts while there is a debut for Rajiv van La Parra after arriving on loan. Meanwhile, Aaron Ramsdale, half the age of the aforementioned Boro keeper, makes his debut in goal for AFC Wimbledon after joining on loan from Bournemouth. Neil Warnock makes seven changes to the Cardiff side beaten by Tottenham on New Year\u2019s Day as the Premier League club visit League One Gillingham in the FA Cup third round. Some things to look for over the next 24 hours or so: Team news news: Maurizio Sarri gives Ethan Ampadu and Callum Hudson-Odoi a runout at Stamford Bridge, while Cesc F\u00e0bregas captains Chelsea on his final appearance for the club, before a move to Monaco. Everton, who have been a bit of a shambles of late, have gone strong at home to League Two leaders Lincoln, with Gylfi Sigurdsson among those starting at Goodison. At Villa Park, there is a debut for January recruit, the Croatia goalkeeper Lovre Kalinic but Tammy Abraham is absent. The striker is reportedly inching closer to a loan move to Wolves. At Derby, Southampton have stuck by Angus Gunn in goal, preferred to Alex McCarthy and the youngster Callum Slattery starts against Frank Lampard\u2019s side.

It is a sorry state of affairs for the oldest national competition in world football, a result of the Football Association\u2019s whopping new six-year \u00a3820m deal with overseas rights holders, one that the governing body says will benefit the grassroots game. Every one of the 32 third-round ties strewn across this weekend will be screened worldwide, which is brilliant in terms of a global reach, for those fans in the Middle East plugged into Brentford v Oxford and Bolton v Walsall, but perhaps not quite so great for the traditionalists of this world. And while it is saddening, we need not be totally downbeat for there are still some seemingly cracking ties on this afternoon\u2019s menu, including Lincoln\u2019s trip to Goodison Park and Nottingham Forest at Chelsea, in what will be Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s final game for the club. The focus is already on under-pressure Stoke manager Gary Rowett, who takes his side to Shrewsbury this afternoon, but will sharpen should his team slip-up. By the time we hit 3pm, seven ties will be nearing conclusion, with another 10 teams rocking up at stadiums across the country ready to do battle in the late kick-offs this evening. FA Cup third-round fixtures, all 3pm (GMT): Accrington v Ipswich Town, Aston Villa v Swansea City, Bolton Wanderers v Walsall, Brentford v Oxford United, Chelsea v Nottingham Forest, Derby County v Southampton, Everton v Lincoln City, Fleetwood Town v AFC Wimbledon, Gillingham v Cardiff City, Middlesbrough v Peterborough United",

      "body": "<p>For Lincoln City there will be no new shockwave to follow the one they caused in 2017 by becoming the first non-league club for 103 years to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals but they certainly gave it a good go. On a chilly Merseyside afternoon Danny Cowley\u2019s men, now leaders of League Two, pushed Everton all the way in a third-round tie during which it was tough at times to tell the favourites from the underdogs.</p> <p>Having gone 2-0 up in the space of two first-half minutes, Everton ultimately did enough to seal their place in the fourth round but this was another largely unconvincing display from Marco Silva\u2019s side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/gillingham-cardiff-fa-cup-match-report\">Cardiff out of FA Cup after Gillingham\u2019s Elliott List delivers knockout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everton toiled against opponents who sit 58 places below them and all but closed that gap with a display brimming with togetherness and defiance.

      "bodyText": "For Lincoln City there will be no new shockwave to follow the one they caused in 2017 by becoming the first non-league club for 103 years to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals but they certainly gave it a good go. On a chilly Merseyside afternoon Danny Cowley\u2019s men, now leaders of League Two, pushed Everton all the way in a third-round tie during which it was tough at times to tell the favourites from the underdogs. Having gone 2-0 up in the space of two first-half minutes, Everton ultimately did enough to seal their place in the fourth round but this was another largely unconvincing display from Marco Silva\u2019s side. Everton toiled against opponents who sit 58 places below them and all but closed that gap with a display brimming with togetherness and defiance. Indeed, it was telling that, having been roared on throughout from the 5,000 or so spectators who travelled here from the east Midlands, Lincoln\u2019s players also received a standing ovation from sections of the home support on the final whistle \u2013 a nice touch and one that was richly deserved. \u201cWe can be really proud of our efforts,\u201d said Cowley. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 2-0 down after 15 minutes at a Premier League club you fear the worst.

      "bodyText": "This was a match graced by some high-quality goals, but there was only one talking point afterwards: who wanted a replay less? Was it Frank Lampard, whose Derby are scrapping for promotion in the Sky Bet Championship? Or was it Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, just a few places higher up the football pyramid, and desperate to stay in the Premier League? In this particular contest there was a clear victory for the Austrian, who wore a sullen expression as he contemplated hosting Derby in 10 days or so. Saints had taken a two-goal lead thanks to Nathan Redmond, but goals from Jack Marriott and Tom Lawrence in quick succession pegged the visitors back. \u201cWe showed 60 quick minutes\u201a\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said, \u201cbut then we got too comfortable. You can\u2019t do that because it\u2019s a cup game, and it was a typical one, because the opposition never gave up fighting. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want this game, we had a good chance to go through and we gave it away. We have to do it again with more concentration and more passion until the end.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a pity we didn\u2019t win, now we have another game and it\u2019s not something we want to have.\u201d Lampard was pretty cheery by comparison. \u201cI would have taken a replay at 2-0 down\u201a\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t great quality anywhere on pitch first half, but we were off it. Then the reaction after the second goal was terrific; our work off the ball, the running that we did. It showed what we can do when we\u2019re at it.\u201d Redmond opened the scoring after four minutes, picking up a flicked header from Shane Long and driving it past Derby keeper, Kelle Roos, making his second appearance of the season, via a deflection from Richard Keogh. Three minutes into the second half and the 24-year-old did even better, first drifting left into the Derby box and then cutting on to his right before curling a wonderful shot pass Roos again. \u201cHe showed his technical ability on the ball is fantastic\u201a\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said of Redmond. \u201cHe has good movements and it\u2019s very hard for opponents to catch him. The only thing missing is the last action; the final pass or shot on goal. He showed he also has quality in this part.\u201d It was roughly an hour into the match that Southampton entered their comfortable period. But at the same time, an apparently beleaguered Derby, with their manager\u2019s half-time team-talk already up in smoke, managed to find some gumption too. Saints were hustled out of possession in midfield and George Evans split their defence with a delightful 25-yard pass. Lawrence, the source of most of Derby\u2019s hopes and frustrations to that point, took a touch in the box and then looped the ball nonchalantly into the path of the onrushing Marriott, who finished coolly past the Southampton goalkeeper, Angus Gunn. Two minutes later and Gunn, who kept Chelsea at bay on his debut in midweek, was picking the ball out of the net again. This time it was Marriott returning the favour, spinning the ball into the path of Lawrence, who found a finish as good as Redmond\u2019s to bend the ball beyond the 22-year-old\u2019s outstretched arm. There were chances at either end before the finish, but a late defeat would have been unfair to either side. So they will go at it again the week beginning 14 January. For Lampard, in-between times, there is a trip to the Championship leaders, Leeds, and the rookie manager is hoping for more consistency from his team. \u201cIt showed what we can do when we are at it. We beat Man United [in the Carabao Cup] then went and lost at Bolton,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to take the good things out of [performances against Premier League clubs], but you also have to replicate it. The players aren\u2019t robots, and it doesn\u2019t always go perfectly, but we\u2019ve got it in us.\u201d",

One is that the technology is 99.9% complete and that soon \u201clevel five\u201d autonomy will be reached, meaning that cars can safely drive themselves in any situation. When that happens, the world will undergo rapid change, as driving jobs begin to disappear, urban spaces are reshaped and road travel becomes safer by the day.</p> <p>The other is that the final 0.1% is harder than all of the previous progress put together. And so we\u2019ll remain, for years, with cars that work well enough to demonstrate, to put on the streets with safety drivers and continue being tested, funded and improved \u2013 but not quite well enough to actually build a business around.</p> <p>Both views may be true.

      "bodyText": "1 Silicon Valley\u2019s cold war with the EU heats up At the beginning of 2019, as at the start of 2018, Margrethe Vestager remains the most powerful woman in tech. The EU competition commissioner has the world\u2019s biggest companies walking on tiptoe, afraid of her habit of enforcing competition law where the US authorities have refused to do so. In 2018, Google was the subject of Vestager\u2019s cold gaze, receiving multibillion fines for its anti-competitive practices around its Android operating system, its shopping service and Chrome browser. But in 2019, it\u2019s likely to be someone else\u2019s turn. The only question is who. In the US, Amazon has been the odds-on favourite, thanks to a combination of a hostile president, a direct negative effect on commercial competitors and the rise of the doctrine of \u201chipster antitrust\u201d (broadly arguing that monopolies can be harmful even if consumer welfare appears to be boosted). But in the EU, with a greater focus on privacy and data protection issues, Facebook looks vulnerable. The release by the UK parliament of internal Facebook emails appearing to show, among other things, Mark Zuckerberg authorising a hostile move to shut down access by Twitter\u2019s video app Vine won\u2019t endear the company to the competition commission. And, for many, Facebook still represents the great failure of competition commissions over the past 20 years, for rubber-stamping its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp \u2013 two of its greatest potential competitors still in their infancy. The powers of the EU are limited \u2013 it would take the US to break up Facebook \u2013 but another multibillion fine won\u2019t go down well at the already troubled company. 2 The app stores begin to falter It isn\u2019t just Facebook that might be feeling the hot breath of a regulator on its neck. The EU\u2019s ruling against Google\u2019s dominance of the Android app store could be the first domino to fall in a sweeping change that will reshape the consumer technology industry. Since the birth of the iPhone, a huge amount of digital commerce has been filtered through a few platforms, which have taken a hefty chunk of the revenue they handle. Apple takes 30% of app revenue, whether it be the purchase price of the software or the digital goods bought through it. Google, on Android, and Valve, for PC games, does similar. Each earns huge profits through being, essentially, the single point of entry for an industry. Now that\u2019s starting to wobble. Regulators are chipping away at one corner: Google\u2019s aforementioned fine in the EU and a court case in the US accusing Apple of abusing its monopoly over the iOS app store show the unease governments have over that centralisation of power. At the other end, slowly, power is shifting through external causes. Epic Games, maker of Fortnite, has become one of the few publishers to rival the power of the platform owners themselves and it is wielding it effectively: launching a new app store for Android devices and another for PCs and offering to take a substantially lower cut of game revenues on both. Not many brands have the following to pull off such a shift, but as many a parent will attest, Fortnite can move children where few others can. 3 The first driverless taxis won\u2019t change the world There are two schools of thought surrounding driverless cars. One is that the technology is 99.9% complete and that soon \u201clevel five\u201d autonomy will be reached, meaning that cars can safely drive themselves in any situation. When that happens, the world will undergo rapid change, as driving jobs begin to disappear, urban spaces are reshaped and road travel becomes safer by the day. The other is that the final 0.1% is harder than all of the previous progress put together. And so we\u2019ll remain, for years, with cars that work well enough to demonstrate, to put on the streets with safety drivers and continue being tested, funded and improved \u2013 but not quite well enough to actually build a business around. Both views may be true. In the meantime, however, a 99.9% good enough car is good enough to run a taxi service \u2013 as Google is showing in Phoenix, where Waymo One, the company\u2019s Uber competitor, is launching. What\u2019s most interesting about the service is how\u2026 uninteresting it is. The taxis aren\u2019t significantly cheaper than the competition; the journeys have the occasional glitch, as overcautious algorithms get stuck at T-junctions. Maybe one day driverless cars will change the world, but not yet. 4 We can stop thinking about bitcoin Only a fool would predict the death of bitcoin, let alone the wider industry it has spawned. The community has repeatedly shown an impressive capacity for survival against gigantic crashes, crippling hacks and severe legal roadblocks, and the nature of the blockchain is such that, if even one diehard is still mining bitcoin in an attic somewhere, it can never be said to be truly over. But the price of bitcoin has been falling for months and now stands at a fifth of its all-time high. Ethereum, an even techier alternative, has fallen almost three times that. These prices are not only a vague reflection of the interest the wider world has in cryptocurrencies \u2013 at least in so far as they can be used as a speculative asset \u2013 but also a very real reduction in the amount of money knocking around the ecosystem, funding startups, paying salaries and subsidising customer acquisition. That means that the number of actually useful creations (as opposed to white papers, test networks, experimental trials or proofs of concept) to come out of the sector \u2013 a number already hovering somewhere in the region of zero \u2013 is likely to stay low for a while. Maybe this will be the year that the industry puts its head down, starts putting substance over hype, and emerges in 2020 with something to show for more than a decade of speculation; or maybe this will be the year it slowly suffocates, deprived of the attention it needs to live. Either way, at least we can take a break. 5 Photography blurs with illustration Smartphone innovation has stagnated in recent years; screens have got as good as they\u2019re going to get, battery life is hitting the limits of physics and processors have become so fast that developers are already struggling to use all the power at their fingertips. But one of the last areas of competition is in the camera on the back of the phones. For Apple, that has meant moving to two lenses on the back of its top-end phones, investing in sapphire glass to minimise scratching and putting a hardware \u201cneural engine\u201d inside the phone to handle some of the more complicated elements of \u201ccomputational photography\u201d \u2013 using machine learning to manipulate images. For Google, the approach has been entirely about software. Like Apple, it has focused heavily on computational photography, but it has taken it further than anyone else.

And that\u2019s only going to intensify as other companies attempt to copy Google and Apple, or surpass them with their own features. 6 USB-C finally starts to make sense In theory, the USB-C connector is better than its predecessor. The standard has some obvious physical benefits: a smaller plug that works in any orientation; the ability to transmit more power, more data and more standards; cables that can be used in either direction, across domains. In practice, however, the transition has been exhausting. For one, there\u2019s been the standard pain of chucking out cables, chargers and accessories built for a now obsolete format and replacing them slowly \u2013 and expensively \u2013 with new versions.

Just because a piece of wire has a USB-C plug at each end doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it can charge a device at full speed, let alone transfer data at maximum bandwidth. Over 2019, these ridiculous situations will hopefully even out a bit, allowing the promise of \u201cone cable to rule them all\u201d finally to be met. 7 Another \u2018I told you so\u2019 moment for the worriers It\u2019s rare for world-changing technological events to come completely by surprise. In 2017, the WannaCry cyber-attack that shut down the NHS was largely foreseeable: it exploited a vulnerability that had been patched by Microsoft months earlier to combine an example of crypto-ransomware, first seen years earlier, with so-called \u201cworm\u201d mechanics that allowed it to self-propagate, first seen decades earlier. But despite that, WannaCry changed the landscape permanently. Before, we all knew that a major malware attack could cause real-world harm; but Wannacry revealed that the \u201cwe\u201d was a smaller group than it had thought, and what it \u201cknew\u201d was less useful than it had hoped. Just last month, we saw another example of the same sort of unsurprising surprise, as a drone was used to shut down Gatwick airport for 24 hours. Again, the ingredients had been in place for years before \u2013 as had some of the tools necessary to prevent such an attack \u2013 but the chaos that ensued proved the difference between knowing a threat exists and internalising that threat to the degree that you build useful plans to tackle it. This year will be the same. Some of the big events that subtly alter our understanding of how the world works won\u2019t involve megadeaths and cataclysmic destruction. But they can still be horribly disruptive anyway. Perhaps a massive botnet is used to overwhelm the servers of a supermarket\u2019s logistics division. Or a cyber-attack on the maintenance department of a big US tanker firm paralyses petrol and water distribution across a huge swath of the American south-west. Or a vulnerability in a smart speaker lets an eager prankster wake up millions with 100dB sound at 2am. The only thing we can be sure of is that, whatever it is, someone will be able to say \u201cI told you so\u201d.",

How long, they ask, can the expansion seen since the last crash go on before another recession hits?</p> <p>And if a global recession is pushed further into the future by even larger dollops of borrowed money from the financial system, will the next recession quickly become a crash of similar or even larger proportions than the one seen in 2008?</p> <p>Some analysts argue that such gloomy warnings ignore the precedent seen in recent years that major economies tend to start the year slowly before getting into gear later on. That was especially true in 2016, when most of the developed world saw only a small lift in GDP in the first quarter before growth took off.</p> <p>However, the three years from 2014 were characterised by falling oil and commodity prices, which moderated inflation. This gave the global economy a boost it desperately needed, albeit at the expense of oil- and commodity-exporting nations \u2013 and the environment. The boost faded in 2017 and left 2018 as a particularly unspectacular year \u2013 except in the US, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/29/donald-trump-tax-cuts-economic-miracle-trade-war\" title=\"\">Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts</a> more than made up for lacklustre global trade and fed a consumption boom.</p> <p>As 2019 gets under way, things look very different. Consumer debt has risen back to pre-crisis levels in many countries. Corporate borrowing has soared and governments, while they have reduced annual deficits, continue to sit on mountains of debt that dwarf the borrowing seen before the crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jacking up rates to calm growth is straight out of the textbook. The trouble with doing it now is that growth is slowing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another similarity with the pre-2008 period is the determination of central banks to increase borrowing costs. The speeches of central bank officials are littered with references to the need for higher rates, both to bring discipline back to borrowing and, in case another credit squeeze grips the banking sector, to have the tools to prevent a full-blown economic collapse. Bank of England governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/29/most-uk-businesses-unprepared-for-no-deal-brexit-says-carney\" title=\"\">Mark Carney has said as much</a>, though his remarks are tempered by threats of a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "There is a tendency for institutions that missed the warning signs before the last financial crisis to over-cook their doomsayer\u2019s warnings as they consider the potential for another one. The International Monetary Fund leads a group of gloomy forecasters that worry about the stability of the global economy amid rising debt levels and slowing GDP growth. How long, they ask, can the expansion seen since the last crash go on before another recession hits? And if a global recession is pushed further into the future by even larger dollops of borrowed money from the financial system, will the next recession quickly become a crash of similar or even larger proportions than the one seen in 2008? Some analysts argue that such gloomy warnings ignore the precedent seen in recent years that major economies tend to start the year slowly before getting into gear later on. That was especially true in 2016, when most of the developed world saw only a small lift in GDP in the first quarter before growth took off. However, the three years from 2014 were characterised by falling oil and commodity prices, which moderated inflation. This gave the global economy a boost it desperately needed, albeit at the expense of oil- and commodity-exporting nations \u2013 and the environment. The boost faded in 2017 and left 2018 as a particularly unspectacular year \u2013 except in the US, where Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts more than made up for lacklustre global trade and fed a consumption boom. As 2019 gets under way, things look very different. Consumer debt has risen back to pre-crisis levels in many countries. Corporate borrowing has soared and governments, while they have reduced annual deficits, continue to sit on mountains of debt that dwarf the borrowing seen before the crisis. Another similarity with the pre-2008 period is the determination of central banks to increase borrowing costs. The speeches of central bank officials are littered with references to the need for higher rates, both to bring discipline back to borrowing and, in case another credit squeeze grips the banking sector, to have the tools to prevent a full-blown economic collapse. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said as much, though his remarks are tempered by threats of a no-deal Brexit. He has been echoed by Jerome Powell, his counterpart at the US Federal Reserve. The Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, recently increased interest rates and signalled that it planned to continue on that path now that companies were reporting the largest labour shortages since 1996. Threadneedle Street has already raised its base rate from 0.25% in 2016 to 0.75%. The Fed is even further ahead, having pushed rates to a level of 2.25%-2.5% at its December meeting. Jacking up rates to calm soaring economic growth \u2013 at least the kind of growth that can lead to inflation \u2013 is straight out of the textbooks. The trouble with doing it now is that growth is slowing: and while the UK and other countries may have full employment by traditional standards, it isn\u2019t the kind of full employment that leads to wage rises. There are few detailed studies of today\u2019s labour market, but the situation seems to be that it was the 2008 crash \u2013 as much as the demise of collective bargaining and the growth of flexible contracts \u2013 that has knocked the stuffing out of the average worker, who feels unable to bargain up their wages. Labour-market economists like David Blanchflower and David Bell of Stirling University argue that unemployment needs to fall towards 2% before wages start to soar, rather than the 4%-4.5% that was considered the more traditional benchmark by central banks. With only small or non-existent increases in wages above inflation, households might opt for more borrowing, or dip further into their savings to maintain consumption. Recent evidence shows they are doing neither. From the UK to China, consumers are viewing the coming year as a difficult period and not the moment to buy much, apart from life\u2019s basics. They did the same in the years before 2008, when property prices began to stagnate as buyers reached their borrowing limits and car sales slowed. That turns the spotlight onto the IMF, which is concerned that higher loan costs and lower levels of consumer spending will mean that more corporations go bust. Its remedy has been for governments to pass reforms that allow more jobs to be created. However, the growth of flexible working has singularly failed to increase wage rates. London-based forecasters Fathom Consulting have pencilled in a global bust for 2020. Nouriel Roubini, who can claim to be one of the few economists to forecast the last crash, also nominates 2020. That\u2019s not much time to prepare.",

Its commissioners include the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the Conservative former cabinet minister Sayeeda Warsi and the campaigner Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was murdered in a racist attack in 1993. Lawrence said few people in positions of power \u201cunderstand what this experience [being a social tenant] is like\u201d. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ve ever had to live in poor housing or know what it is like to feel invisible, like no one cares,\u201d she said. \u201cThe case for investing in social housing is overwhelming. We cannot solve the housing crisis without it, but the system must be made more responsive to tenants at the same time.\u201d The commission is demanding a regulator with similar muscle to the body set up in the aftermath of the financial crisis to fix a system that has left social tenants feeling ignored or branded as troublemakers for raising serious concerns. The panel is also calling for a \u201csignificant expansion\u201d of new social housing as well as comprehensive changes to the way the sector is run. The commission has spent a year researching the housing emergency, with 31,000 people responding to its consultation exercise. One of the main findings is how the current regulatory system is failing social renters. In 2017-18 the average time taken for a decision by the housing ombudsman was eight months. Deep frustrations were expressed to the commission by both private renters and those in social-rented accommodation. The commission\u2019s full report is published on Tuesday. The commissioners \u2013 who also include the former Treasury minister Jim O\u2019Neill, Ed Daffarn of Grenfell United, which represents survivors, and Gavin Kelly of the Resolution Trust thinktank \u2013 want a new regulator for landlords based on the Care Quality Commission or the Financial Conduct Authority, which was set up after the crisis of 2008 to protect consumers. Research for the commission by the Britain Thinks agency found that 31% of social renters feel their landlord does not think about their interests when making decisions. In London 38% of social renters feel their landlord does not consider their interests. Nationally only a fifth (19%) of social renters felt able to influence the decisions made by their landlord about their home. The commission also proposes a new national tenants\u2019 organisation to give social housing residents a voice at a regional and national level and the scrapping of rules that slow down tenants from complaining to a regulator. There has been growing clamour for an overhaul of renters\u2019 rights after the Grenfell disaster in 2017. The next phase of the official inquiry into the fire is not expected to go ahead until the end of the year. Daffarn said: \u201cSocial housing is not like choosing a doctor \u2013 you can\u2019t just up sticks and move if your housing association gets a low rating. Much more is needed to put power in residents\u2019 hands. We need a new regulation system that will be proactive and fight for residents, with real repercussions for housing associations or councils that fail in their duty.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Behind the sweeping curves of the restored 1950s, grade-II-listed former BBC Television Centre Helios building in west London, Sophie Ashby and Charlie Casely-Hayford\u2019s compact one-bedroom flat is a trove of unexpected delights. This is no surprise since both Ashby, who heads up the Studio Ashby interiors practice, and her menswear-designer husband Casely-Hayford, live and breathe design for a living. Ashby, who bought the apartment off-plan four years ago, was keen to make a considered choice as it was her first owned home. \u201cAt the time I had just started my business and wanted to get on the property ladder, but also I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be able to get a mortgage without three years of accounts,\u201d explains Ashby. \u201cSo this was a neat solution \u2013 you pay in instalments over the years. Charlie and I had only just met, so I wasn\u2019t necessarily thinking about the future.\u201d While Ashby was sceptical about living in a development, it was the building\u2019s rich heritage and sociable lifestyle \u2013 residents have access to Soho House\u2019s White City House \u2013 that appealed to her. \u201cThe owners wanted the place to be full of people who actually live here, so you do really feel that sense of community,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe were among the first people here when we moved in last February and because of my job I had planned the interior.

Ashby then set about introducing her signature layers of colour, texture and, as she puts it, \u201cadding soul\u201d.

At the end of 2017, 23-year-old August Ames, well-loved star of the adult film industry, killed herself, seemingly because she was shamed for making homophobic tweets. Ronson, with producer Lina Misitzis, decided to check out her death and see where it took them.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to give anything away, but this series doesn\u2019t do what you expect. It\u2019s as compelling as a true crime show, but it points no fingers, at least not directly, in its search for the truth. Ronson is concerned that our immediate conclusions are not always the correct ones, and that when we rush to condemn, we\u2019re almost always wrong. (Which makes him sound like an Anglican vicar. He is far too funny and anxious for that.) <em>The Last Days of August</em> solves a mystery, but its solution is messy, because people are messy. It wants us to understand that everyone is complicated, that we all have a life behind the social media facade, and that 120 characters, or an Instagram smile, can never give us the fully rounded human. It\u2019s great.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78ee99f030845abb6d4997dc80c9959fac845086\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78ee99f030845abb6d4997dc80c9959fac845086/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil MacGregor, presenter of As Others See Us on Radio 4.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil MacGregor, presenter of As Others See Us on Radio 4.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019ve emerged from your duvet fortnight feeling over-Brexited, then why not try Neil MacGregor\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0001t91/episodes/player\" title=\"\">As Others See Us</a></strong>? In this Radio 4 five-parter, on every morning last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/17/neil-macgregor-britain-germany-humboldt-forum-berlin\" title=\"\">MacGregor</a> travelled to see what people in other countries think of the British: people meaning writers, politicians, the eminent; other countries meaning Germany, Egypt, Nigeria, Canada, India. He did so with his usual educated elan, discussing culture, history, war, revolution in a voice as fruity as plum pudding. MacGregor is a wonderfully intelligent and curious man and producer Simon Elmes is as experienced as you can get. But this series still feels like a date where the bloke says: \u201cEnough about me\u2026 what do you think about me?\u201d Especially in Egypt, Nigeria and India. Haven\u2019t we done enough? Shouldn\u2019t we just shut up now?</p> <p>The most interesting parts of these programmes were when his interviewees talked about their childhoods and how Britain affected them then. The least interesting were their views on Brexit (they all, politely, thought it was idiotic). Other niggles: I could have done without MacGregor\u2019s constant assumption that England and Britain are the same thing. And I would like to have heard from so-called \u201cordinary\u201d people. In northern Nigeria, MacGregor met a schoolgirl. He asked her name, her age, where she was born, the name of her school and how long she\u2019d attended. That was it. She was merely a bit of background colour. Do lofty, closed room conversations with politicians and cultural commentators on the topic of Sorry About Colonialism But Anyway What About Britain Today reveal anything or help anyone? Harrumph. My sugar crash is definitely kicking in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e37368885deb9c3f499fd209ee67cc3c96e791b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e37368885deb9c3f499fd209ee67cc3c96e791b0/0_0_5176_3491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers in Berwick Street market, Soho, London, 1961.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers in Berwick Street market, Soho, London, 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, for those who think it really was better in the good old days, here is a sweet podcast from the Photographers\u2019 Gallery in London. <strong><a href=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/content/soho-then/ep-1-food-shopping\" title=\"\">Soho Then</a> </strong>is made by Clare Lynch, audio producer and Soho resident, and you can listen in the usual way or while you check out accompanying photographs on the website. The first episode concerns food and shopping. It\u2019s gorgeous: voices, memories, background sounds painting a picture of a postwar environment that\u2019s almost all gone now. Local, international, mongrel London; a small but vital part of our history.</p> <h2>Three BBC shows to help avert environmental disaster</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0001tz9\" title=\"\">New Year Solutions</a></h2> <p>Jo Fidgen, in a deceptively light and why-not? manner, entices us all to make lifestyle changes that could save the planet. The biggest problem with climate change is our apparent powerlessness to prevent it, but Fidgen, with the help of experts, shows us that we can each make small alterations to our lives that could stop catastrophe. Giving up the car one day a week, going veggie in a similar manner: nothing too hard.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cswqvf\" title=\"\">The Inquiry \u2013 Are We Heading for a Mass Extinction?</a></h2> <p>Similar thinking to Fidgen\u2019s series, but a different approach. This two-parter (which began last week) from the reliable World Service <em>Inquiry</em> series has experts discussing the terrifying and imminent possibility of widespread dramatic species loss. Evidence about our current situation is produced and compared with geological record. How close are we to wiping everything out? And if we are that close, what can we do to stop it? Let\u2019s stay optimistic\u2026</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2019/02/the-compass\" title=\"\">The Compass: A History of Wastefulness</a></h2> <p>Another World Service series (the WS is producing some excellently bingeable documentaries at the moment). Here, Australian journalist Alexandra Spring takes three episodes to discover why we chuck so much away: what our wasteful past has led to and how we can use history to learn another way of living. This week\u2019s first episode has Spring sail across an enormous sea of plastic soup, created by trillions of micro trash particles.</p>",

Ronson is concerned that our immediate conclusions are not always the correct ones, and that when we rush to condemn, we\u2019re almost always wrong. (Which makes him sound like an Anglican vicar. He is far too funny and anxious for that.) The Last Days of August solves a mystery, but its solution is messy, because people are messy. It wants us to understand that everyone is complicated, that we all have a life behind the social media facade, and that 120 characters, or an Instagram smile, can never give us the fully rounded human. It\u2019s great. If you\u2019ve emerged from your duvet fortnight feeling over-Brexited, then why not try Neil MacGregor\u2019s As Others See Us? In this Radio 4 five-parter, on every morning last week, MacGregor travelled to see what people in other countries think of the British: people meaning writers, politicians, the eminent; other countries meaning Germany, Egypt, Nigeria, Canada, India. He did so with his usual educated elan, discussing culture, history, war, revolution in a voice as fruity as plum pudding. MacGregor is a wonderfully intelligent and curious man and producer Simon Elmes is as experienced as you can get. But this series still feels like a date where the bloke says: \u201cEnough about me\u2026 what do you think about me?\u201d Especially in Egypt, Nigeria and India. Haven\u2019t we done enough? Shouldn\u2019t we just shut up now? The most interesting parts of these programmes were when his interviewees talked about their childhoods and how Britain affected them then. The least interesting were their views on Brexit (they all, politely, thought it was idiotic). Other niggles: I could have done without MacGregor\u2019s constant assumption that England and Britain are the same thing. And I would like to have heard from so-called \u201cordinary\u201d people. In northern Nigeria, MacGregor met a schoolgirl. He asked her name, her age, where she was born, the name of her school and how long she\u2019d attended. That was it. She was merely a bit of background colour. Do lofty, closed room conversations with politicians and cultural commentators on the topic of Sorry About Colonialism But Anyway What About Britain Today reveal anything or help anyone? Harrumph. My sugar crash is definitely kicking in. Finally, for those who think it really was better in the good old days, here is a sweet podcast from the Photographers\u2019 Gallery in London. Soho Then is made by Clare Lynch, audio producer and Soho resident, and you can listen in the usual way or while you check out accompanying photographs on the website. The first episode concerns food and shopping. It\u2019s gorgeous: voices, memories, background sounds painting a picture of a postwar environment that\u2019s almost all gone now. Local, international, mongrel London; a small but vital part of our history. Three BBC shows to help avert environmental disaster New Year Solutions Jo Fidgen, in a deceptively light and why-not? manner, entices us all to make lifestyle changes that could save the planet. The biggest problem with climate change is our apparent powerlessness to prevent it, but Fidgen, with the help of experts, shows us that we can each make small alterations to our lives that could stop catastrophe. Giving up the car one day a week, going veggie in a similar manner: nothing too hard. The Inquiry \u2013 Are We Heading for a Mass Extinction? Similar thinking to Fidgen\u2019s series, but a different approach. This two-parter (which began last week) from the reliable World Service Inquiry series has experts discussing the terrifying and imminent possibility of widespread dramatic species loss. Evidence about our current situation is produced and compared with geological record. How close are we to wiping everything out? And if we are that close, what can we do to stop it? Let\u2019s stay optimistic\u2026 The Compass: A History of Wastefulness Another World Service series (the WS is producing some excellently bingeable documentaries at the moment). Here, Australian journalist Alexandra Spring takes three episodes to discover why we chuck so much away: what our wasteful past has led to and how we can use history to learn another way of living. This week\u2019s first episode has Spring sail across an enormous sea of plastic soup, created by trillions of micro trash particles.",

Beijing funded an overseas investment boom in the past few decades as it strove to become the world\u2019s second largest economic superpower, while also buying vast amounts of the natural resources produced by emerging nations. The scale of the expansion forms part of China\u2019s multibillion-dollar \u201cBelt and Road\u201d Initiative, a state-backed campaign to promote its influence around the world, while providing stimulus for its own slowing economy. The transcontinental development project launched by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in 2013 aims to improve infrastructure links between Asia, Europe and Africa, with the aim for China to reap the benefits from increasing levels of global trade. Mounting tensions between China and the US, however, have acted as a handbrake on rising levels of world trade. The International Monetary Fund forecasts Chinese growth will slow to 6.2% this year from about 6.6% in 2018, due to escalations in the trade dispute that erupted last year. There are also rising fears over the rapid growth of debt in China used to fuel its expansion over the past decade. With Chinese investment in some African nations worth more than some of those states\u2019 own domestic spending, analysts fear the prospect of weaker investment in future and fading demand for commodity exports. Figures from the United Nations\u2019 development agency, Unctad, show that weakness in global commodity prices in 2014 and 2015 caused foreign direct investment flows into Africa to fall from $55bn in 2015 to $42bn in 2017, showing how Africa might be hit by a Chinese slowdown. Richard Kozul-Wright, director of the division for globalisation and development strategies at Unctad, said: \u201cChina has been slowing down gradually for the last two or three years, coinciding with continued expansion abroad.

That\u2019s a big uncertainty.\u201d Craig Botham, an emerging-markets economist at the City investment firm Schroders, warned that weaker Chinese demand for commodities could have a negative impact on emerging markets: \u201cIt should mean slower growth for anyone with an export link to China.\u201d The overseas lending from China\u2019s two main development banks reached $675bn at the end of 2016 \u2013 more than twice the size of loans from the World Bank, which has a remit to tackle poverty in the developing world, with African development a focus of the Chinese institutions. More than four fifths of the amount China spends on construction overseas goes to low- or middle-income economies. According to Unctad, China holds the fourth-largest stock of foreign direct investment in Africa at $40bn, behind the US at $57bn, the UK at $55bn, and France at $49bn. The investments run from aid projects to infrastructure, including help to upgrade more than 18,000 miles of highways, 1,200 miles of railways, and raising ports capacity by about 85 million tonnes per year. According to Deloitte, China is the most visible single-country funder and builder of infrastructure projects in Africa, having spent about $11.5bn a year on average since 2012 \u2013 about a third of all African government spending, worth an average $30.1bn. Despite the risks facing developing nations from China\u2019s slowdown, experts say Beijing is likely to remain significantly influential. Officials committed late last year to spending $60bn in Africa over the next three years, although there are fears the project may saddle developing countries with too much debt just as the world economy begins to falter.

      "body": "<p>Michelle Bailey has endured countless scrapes. The most recent, just before Christmas, involved an acutely intoxicated woman repeatedly threatening her with violence. Bailey, the 48-year-old managing director of Barnsley-based Active Response Security Services, talked her down, as always. \u201cYou need to keep very calm. So far no one has ever pulled a knife, thank god,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Tudor Simionov was not so fortunate. About 5.30am on New Year\u2019s Day the 33-year-old was providing security for a central London party when it was stormed by gatecrashers. Attempting to fight them off, Simionov was stabbed. By 6.05am he was dead. Two months earlier he had left Romania for what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/02/bouncer-stabbed-at-new-year-party-came-to-uk-for-better-life-says-girlfriend\" title=\"\">his fianc\u00e9e called \u201ca better life\u201d</a>.</p> <p>His death has drawn attention to an industry once confined to nightclub bouncers and security guards, but which has quietly grown and diversified \u2013 so much so that it now helps prop up a significant chunk of public services. Some call it the UK\u2019s \u201cfourth emergency service\u201d.</p> <p>Karen Bermingham of the <a href=\"https://www.sia.homeoffice.gov.uk/Pages/about-us.aspx\" title=\"\">Security Industry Authority</a> (SIA), a regulatory agency linked to the Home Office, said the trade has become vital to tackling crime. \u201cWe\u2019re the eyes and ears on the ground and we are spotting and reporting cases where, for instance, there is grooming, we\u2019re kind of like an emergency service,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As violent crime increases and police numbers dwindle, private guards have been hired to fill the security vacuum, along with CCTV operators, cash transit specialists and close protection officers. The private security sector has been trained to help solve some of the most complex crimes, including child exploitation, along with assisting the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the intelligence agencies.</p> <p>Increasingly, its operatives are also trained in counter-terrorism, feeding directly into the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-counter-terrorism-security-office\" title=\"\">National Counter Terrorism Security Office</a>. The spate of terror attacks throughout 2017, particular the bombing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/22/police-and-mi5-missed-chances-to-prevent-manchester-arena-bombing-mps-find\" title=\"\">inside the Manchester Arena</a>, further emphasised the importance of security guards in preventing possible atrocities.</p> <p>The industry\u2019s broadening responsibilities are reflected in its growth. During 2017-2018 there were 143,894 applications for individual licences to operate in the security industry compared to 110,437 the previous year.</p> <p>The rise consolidates an already substantial industry. There are currently 386,657 licence holders, of whom just under 10% are women. By comparison, there are currently about 146,000 police officers in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b39016bc42b0c2ab5f9cf5644b0f5024385b87b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b39016bc42b0c2ab5f9cf5644b0f5024385b87b5/0_248_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Bailey of Barnsley-based security company Active Response.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Bailey of Barnsley based security company Active Response.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Bairstow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Closer analysis of the security trade reveals 239,134 licence holders are involved in \u201cdoor supervision\u201d, of whom 24,034 are women. Most door staff are aged 26-45 with more than 3,000 over 65.</p> <p>The next most popular role is that of security guard, with 68,715 in the UK. The least female friendly sector is close protection \u2013 bodyguarding \u2013 with just 773 women out of 14,148 individuals currently licensed.</p> <p>Rick Mounfield, chief executive of the <a href=\"https://security-institute.org/\" title=\"\">Security Institute</a>, which has almost 3,000 \u201csecurity professional\u201d members, says the wage spectrum is vast, ranging from zero-hours contracts paying \u00a310 an hour to salaries of up to \u00a3500,000 for a talented <a href=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/641470/so-you-want-to-be-an-ethical-hacker\" title=\"\">\u201cethical hacker\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Mounfield said the size of the sector should come as no surprise. \u201cSecurity is probably the second oldest employment stream there is, right up there with prostitution. Everybody has needed security since we lived in caves.\u201d</p> <p>Mounfield hailed the industry\u2019s multiculturalism and its ability to draw recruits such as Simionov. \u201cIt needs to be multicultural, to reflect society. You need cultural awareness if you are going to deconflict and manage physical intervention,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Along with the erosion in police numbers the transformation of the UK\u2019s shopping habits has also helped drive expansion. <a href=\"http://www.mancommercialprotection.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Man Commercial Protection</a>, based in the West Midlands, has grown through the popularity of online shopping and the need to patrol the mammoth warehouses where online retailers store goods.</p> <p>Laura McCarthy, office manager for the firm, describes demand for their services as \u201cmanic\u201d. She also says council cutbacks have meant they safeguard train and bus depots in the region.</p> <p>\u201cPolice and councils now look to outsource to a security company, we have that level of training and with new clients we are just trying to meet demand,\u201d said McCarthy.</p> <p>Five years ago her firm employed 300 people, now it has almost 1,000.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The private security sector is certainly filling some of the gaps that were once lower-level policing tasks</p> <footer> <cite>Rick Mounfield, Security Institute</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Driving part of the growth is the <a href=\"https://www.bsia.co.uk/about-us/partnerships/police-security-initiative.aspx\" title=\"\">Police and Security Group Initiative</a>, backed by Scotland Yard but targeted by some critics who claim it is privatising policing by stealth.</p> <p>Mounfield said the agreement, introduced to \u201cpromote collaboration between police forces and the private security industry\u201d, transparently transferred obligations once carried out by police.</p> <p>Among the responsibilities that police can officially hand over to the private sector, roles include \u201cneighbourhood wardens, hospital security guards, park wardens, shopping mall guards and train guards\u201d.</p> <p>Mounfield said: \u201cThe private security sector is certainly filling some of the gaps that were once lower-level policing tasks.\u201d</p> <p>Simionov was among those seemingly proud to join the industry, a first step on the UK job ladder as he prepared for married life. A day after his death, his partner, Madalina Anghel, shared a brief note on Facebook: \u201cThe loss is impossible. It is hard for me to find the right words at this time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Michelle Bailey has endured countless scrapes. The most recent, just before Christmas, involved an acutely intoxicated woman repeatedly threatening her with violence. Bailey, the 48-year-old managing director of Barnsley-based Active Response Security Services, talked her down, as always. \u201cYou need to keep very calm. So far no one has ever pulled a knife, thank god,\u201d she said. Tudor Simionov was not so fortunate. About 5.30am on New Year\u2019s Day the 33-year-old was providing security for a central London party when it was stormed by gatecrashers. Attempting to fight them off, Simionov was stabbed. By 6.05am he was dead. Two months earlier he had left Romania for what his fianc\u00e9e called \u201ca better life\u201d. His death has drawn attention to an industry once confined to nightclub bouncers and security guards, but which has quietly grown and diversified \u2013 so much so that it now helps prop up a significant chunk of public services. Some call it the UK\u2019s \u201cfourth emergency service\u201d. Karen Bermingham of the Security Industry Authority (SIA), a regulatory agency linked to the Home Office, said the trade has become vital to tackling crime. \u201cWe\u2019re the eyes and ears on the ground and we are spotting and reporting cases where, for instance, there is grooming, we\u2019re kind of like an emergency service,\u201d she said. As violent crime increases and police numbers dwindle, private guards have been hired to fill the security vacuum, along with CCTV operators, cash transit specialists and close protection officers. The private security sector has been trained to help solve some of the most complex crimes, including child exploitation, along with assisting the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the intelligence agencies. Increasingly, its operatives are also trained in counter-terrorism, feeding directly into the government\u2019s National Counter Terrorism Security Office. The spate of terror attacks throughout 2017, particular the bombing inside the Manchester Arena, further emphasised the importance of security guards in preventing possible atrocities. The industry\u2019s broadening responsibilities are reflected in its growth. During 2017-2018 there were 143,894 applications for individual licences to operate in the security industry compared to 110,437 the previous year. The rise consolidates an already substantial industry. There are currently 386,657 licence holders, of whom just under 10% are women. By comparison, there are currently about 146,000 police officers in the UK. Closer analysis of the security trade reveals 239,134 licence holders are involved in \u201cdoor supervision\u201d, of whom 24,034 are women. Most door staff are aged 26-45 with more than 3,000 over 65. The next most popular role is that of security guard, with 68,715 in the UK. The least female friendly sector is close protection \u2013 bodyguarding \u2013 with just 773 women out of 14,148 individuals currently licensed. Rick Mounfield, chief executive of the Security Institute, which has almost 3,000 \u201csecurity professional\u201d members, says the wage spectrum is vast, ranging from zero-hours contracts paying \u00a310 an hour to salaries of up to \u00a3500,000 for a talented \u201cethical hacker\u201d. Mounfield said the size of the sector should come as no surprise. \u201cSecurity is probably the second oldest employment stream there is, right up there with prostitution. Everybody has needed security since we lived in caves.\u201d Mounfield hailed the industry\u2019s multiculturalism and its ability to draw recruits such as Simionov. \u201cIt needs to be multicultural, to reflect society. You need cultural awareness if you are going to deconflict and manage physical intervention,\u201d he said. Along with the erosion in police numbers the transformation of the UK\u2019s shopping habits has also helped drive expansion. Man Commercial Protection, based in the West Midlands, has grown through the popularity of online shopping and the need to patrol the mammoth warehouses where online retailers store goods. Laura McCarthy, office manager for the firm, describes demand for their services as \u201cmanic\u201d. She also says council cutbacks have meant they safeguard train and bus depots in the region. \u201cPolice and councils now look to outsource to a security company, we have that level of training and with new clients we are just trying to meet demand,\u201d said McCarthy. Five years ago her firm employed 300 people, now it has almost 1,000. Driving part of the growth is the Police and Security Group Initiative, backed by Scotland Yard but targeted by some critics who claim it is privatising policing by stealth. Mounfield said the agreement, introduced to \u201cpromote collaboration between police forces and the private security industry\u201d, transparently transferred obligations once carried out by police. Among the responsibilities that police can officially hand over to the private sector, roles include \u201cneighbourhood wardens, hospital security guards, park wardens, shopping mall guards and train guards\u201d. Mounfield said: \u201cThe private security sector is certainly filling some of the gaps that were once lower-level policing tasks.\u201d Simionov was among those seemingly proud to join the industry, a first step on the UK job ladder as he prepared for married life. A day after his death, his partner, Madalina Anghel, shared a brief note on Facebook: \u201cThe loss is impossible. It is hard for me to find the right words at this time.\u201d",

Some journalists called it \u201cmanufactured\u201d, \u201cscripted\u201d and a \u201cmonologue\u201d . The Congress party called it \u201cfixed\u201d.

      "bodyText": "India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has been accused of being afraid of the media after consenting to a rare interview \u2013 just one of a handful in four years as PM \u2013 on New Year\u2019s Day in which he answered a range of questions that critics compared to \u201cfree-hit deliveries\u201d in cricket. The interview, to news agency Asian News International \u2013 or ANI, attracted widespread comment and a fair amount of ridicule. Some journalists called it \u201cmanufactured\u201d, \u201cscripted\u201d and a \u201cmonologue\u201d . The Congress party called it \u201cfixed\u201d. One MP said the questions put to Modi \u201cwere more in the nature of feeding rather than grilling the prime minister\u201d. A cartoon showed Modi interviewing himself. The Indian media have been fretting about lack of access to Modi ever since he assumed office in 2014. He has not held a single press conference. The handful of interviews have been mostly set pieces in which the interviewer has failed to put difficult questions or challenged Modi on his answers. While Modi has never made any secret of his disdain for the press, other members of his Bharatiya Janata party have compounded the testy relationship with the press by variously abusing journalists as \u201cpresstitutes\u201d, \u201cdalals\u201d (pimps) or \u201cbazaru\u201d (for sale). But the latest interview has attracted criticism beyond media circles with the opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, joining the fray. Gandhi questioned Modi\u2019s refusal to subject himself to random questioning, pointing out how he, by contrast, is more accessible and willing to take difficult and impromptu questions. Gandhi called the ANI interview staged, and the interviewer \u201cpliable\u201d. \u201c[Modi] does not have the guts to come and sit in front of you,\u201d he said at a press conference. In fact, some analysts believe that Modi gave the interview to ANI precisely because he has been stung by recent criticism for failing to meet the press.

We\u2019re Woking \u2013 let\u2019s put on a good show so that, when people turn off the telly, they say: \u2018Bloody hell, that was enjoyable.\u2019\u201d",

I said those words out loud to myself 10 days ago, waking up after yet another binge with a friend, watching Richard Curtis films until 4am, mixing cocktails and bitching about work until we passed out on the sofa. </p> <p>My life can be defined by a kind of alcoholic bulimia. I either binged on it, or deprived myself of it out of misplaced puritanism and later, unaffordability. My parents did not drink in front of me as a child. I had no fake ID and looked 14 until my first grey hairs came in a couple of years ago.</p> <p>I had my first taste of alcohol at a friend\u2019s house party, aged 14 or 15, drinking alcopops in their living room while their parents were away, with some other kids from our church youth group. I enjoyed the feeling it gave me. I was shy, I stammered, I didn\u2019t have many close friends. At the next party I was drinking neat vodka from the bottle until I was sick.</p> <p>At the next, a barbecue with some friends from my local karate club, I was carried to a cab by a burly, furious male driver with my trousers falling down, covered in my own vomit, having downed an entire litre bottle of Southern Comfort. I was 16. I was also lucky that the cabbie dropped me back to my nan\u2019s \u2013 I was too frightened to present myself at home in such a state at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon \u2013 and saw me safely inside. My nan cleaned me up and put me to bed.</p> <p>I spent my late teens working in a nightclub, back in the good old days when club nights ran from Wednesdays through to Mondays and the drug of choice was WKD rather than today\u2019s MDMA and GHB.</p> <p>Working behind the cocktail bar was a different kind of escapism, a creative outlet with a newfound respect for alcohol. I didn\u2019t drink as I was also working day shifts in a coffee shop and, later, the fire service, and needed my wits about me to pull off my 60-hour working weeks.</p> <p>I left the nightclub when I was pregnant (needless to say, I was sober throughout), and the fire service two years later. I was on the dole, which led to a period of extreme poverty. Needless to say, I did not drink when I could not afford to feed myself and my son. I used the odd can of Sainsbury\u2019s Basics lager in a stew or casserole, but I didn\u2019t drink it. I want to be absolutely clear about that.</p> <p>I fell into a permanent habit of problematic drinking when I moved to London in 2014. I had my first book out, my second on the way, and had been uncomfortably catapulted into the public eye. It started with a glass of wine in the evenings. Every evening. Then two. Then a bottle. Then I started at lunchtime. I had a drink before I did any public talks, to calm my nerves.</p> <p>I joked with a runner at the Observer Festival of Ideas when he asked if I needed anything, \u201ca whisky would be great\u201d. He returned with two doubles. I laughed it off at the time, but it became a habit. I turned up on the BBC\u2019s <em>This Week</em> with Michael Portillo, after a Pride party at the US ambassador\u2019s residence. It was 11pm. I needed six double espressos before I could go in front of a camera. My friends waited for me in a car outside to take me back to the party. I was unhappy, but smiling for the cameras. I was drinking slugs of whisky before going on breakfast television.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was drinking slugs of whisky before going on breakfast television.

But I was functional, and so it didn\u2019t look like a problem. Not to me.</p> <p>I moved back home to Southend in 2015 for a quieter life. I didn\u2019t want to be having boozy lunch interviews with journalists any more. I couldn\u2019t stand the parties I needed to get smashed at to feel like I fitted in. I longed for my simple life back, standing at the stove, scrawling recipes in notebooks, blogging, reading, going for walks.</p> <p>I moved to a house a few roads away from my parents, back into my childhood neighbourhood, and started to request that journalists come to me, rather than meet me in a pub in the City. I started turning down party invitations. I lost a lot of friends. But the one that never left my side, stuck by me unwaveringly, came in a 40% abv bottle. It took a long time for me to recognise the extent of my problem, and longer still to do something about it.</p> <p>I would love to say I had a great awakening, one last bender, some voice from the heavens but, in truth, I am just tired of being tired. I have a chronic illness that is in the process of diagnosis, and sobriety won\u2019t cure me, but alcoholism certainly fogs the waters when it comes to separating what can be treated and what I\u2019m making worse.</p> <p>I\u2019m furious with myself about the jobs I\u2019ve turned down, the potential opportunities I\u2019ve lost, the deadlines I\u2019ve missed. I hope that this year the bridges I soaked in whisky and watched burn down will begin to be rebuilt.</p> <p>This is my mea culpa. I\u2019m sorry I was unreliable. I\u2019m sorry I swore on television. I\u2019m sorry I missed so many of my son\u2019s class assemblies. I\u2019m sorry my manuscript was late. I\u2019m sorry to my ever-patient agent and her assistants for having to pick up the pieces every time I disappear on a three-day binge. I\u2019m sorry to every editor I ghosted, every friend I\u2019ve flaked out on, every person I\u2019ve verbally lashed out at in a paranoid and depressive comedown.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been a fucking atrocious, ghastly mess for a very long time, but I\u2019m out of excuses. Yes, I\u2019ve had a difficult road to here. Violence, sexual abuse, trauma, PTSD, poverty, low self-esteem. But I know that trying to black out my past with oblivion will just damage my future.

Two-nil, a clean sheet again, and I have to say they made it tough for us. And probably I made it tough for us, because you know when you make nine changes, it\u2019s never easy for a team that\u2019s never played together. So I\u2019m delighted we\u2019re in he next round.

A last-minute goal settled a three-game marathon in Reading\u2019s favour in 1927; the Biscuitmen made it all the way to the semis <strike> , the last time they got so far </strike>. United beat Reading in successive seasons in 1937 and 1938. Colin Webster and Dennis Violett shone for the Busby Babes in a 4-1 rout in 1955.</p> <p><strong>In more modern times ...</strong> the United of Cantona and Giggs won 3-0 at Elm Park during their successful run of 1996; Gabriel Heinze, Louis Saha and a certain Ole Gunnar Solskjaer put them three up in six minutes (!) at the Madejski in 2007; Nani and Javier Hernandez were the heroes in 2013; Wayne Rooney, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford wrapped up a 4-0 win this time two years ago.</p> <p><strong>All in all, history is not on Reading\u2019s side.</strong> Their recent form doesn\u2019t give them much hope either: they\u2019ve not won a match since November 3, and are coming off the back of a 4-1 thrashing by Swansea. United, nobody awake needs reminding, have won all four of their matches since interim boss Solskjaer rocked up. This should make it five from five - the visitors are a 33-1 shot - though Reading will hope United take their eye off the ball and the foot off the pedal. Because in the third round of the FA Cup, you never know. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 12.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-05T11:57:04.309Z\">at 11.57am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Thanks for reading, and hope to see you later for Blackpool-Arsenal. And now Solskjaer - the first manager in United history to win his first five games - speaks! Was the result better than the performance, asks Matt Smith of BT Sport? \u201cYeah I think you\u2019re right there. Two-nil, a clean sheet again, and I have to say they made it tough for us. And probably I made it tough for us, because you know when you make nine changes, it\u2019s never easy for a team that\u2019s never played together. So I\u2019m delighted we\u2019re in he next round. We learned a lot. We know we need some fitness work, and to work on relations. But I\u2019ve put a team together that\u2019s never played together. We knew they were going to come and play, and they made us work hard. When we had possession we were too wasteful, and we know we have things to improve on. If we repeat that performance at Wembley, we won\u2019t have a clean sheet or any points.\u201d There were some other 12.30pm kick-offs in the FA Cup third round today. Here are the results. Bournemouth 1-3 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Burnley 1-0 Barnsley Sheffield Wednesday 0-0 Luton Town Shrewsbury Town 1-1 Stoke City West Bromwich Albion 1-0 Wigan Athletic West Ham United 2-0 Birmingham City That\u2019s five wins out of five for Solskjaer. Five shiny bronze centimes for the thoughts of Jose Mourinho. United jet off for some warm-weather training in Dubai, in order to prepare for their trip to Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday. Reading meanwhile take succour from a gusty performance, dusting themselves down for the visit of Nottingham Forest next Saturday. Enough time for Jaakkola to fingertip a long-range Pereira effort around the post, and it\u2019s a routine win for United. The hosts did what they had to do, and they sail comfortably into the fourth round. Championship strugglers Reading played extremely well, but ultimately were too blunt up front to bother Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s second string. 90 min: A komik kut at the end, as Rashford, one-on-one with Jaakkola, tries to round the keeper on the right ... then stands on the ball and skitters hysterically out of play for a goal kick. He laughs heartily at his mistake, yet another sign that United are playing with renewed joie de vivre. 89 min: Reading pile forward in a desperate attempt to get back into the game. Suddenly Pereira spots Lukaku alone on the halfway line. His long pass forward momentarily looks to set the striker free, but Jaakkola is out quickly to sweep the ball away from danger. 88 min: Reading have had 13 attempts at goal today; United just the seven. Reading still on 60% possession. But it\u2019s the small things that matter at this level, and the hosts have snaffled their chances when they\u2019ve come. 86 min: Swift finds space out on the right and curls a cross into the area. Romero is out to claim. The visitors are keeping on, right until the end. 84 min: Chong strokes a pass wide right for Dalot, whose looping cross eludes Pereira, diving in for a header, six yards out. There was a slight nudge on Lukaku as the ball came over, and the referee consults VAR, but it\u2019s not enough for a penalty. 82 min: Barrow zips down the left and nearly gets past Fellaini in the United box. Nearly, but not quite. Goal kick. 81 min: Barrow slips Richards into space down the left. Richards crosses long. Meite, coming in from the right at a tight angle, slams a wild shot deep into the stands from close range. He was offside anyway. But Reading, to their immense credit, haven\u2019t given up. 80 min: Swift sends Aluko skittering down the right. Meite is free in acres in the middle, but Aluko can\u2019t find the space to loop the ball across, and runs it out of play. 78 min: Good work by Rinomhota down the right, nipping past Jones with ease, the United defender charging out recklessly. But his cross is well cleared by Dalot with Reading forwards waiting to pounce. 77 min: To a chorus of pantomime boos, Chong is booked for a light but cynical clip on Richards. 76 min: Reading make their final change, swapping Harriott for Meite. 75 min: Reading press United back in their final third, Aluko, Barrow and Rinomhota stroking it around, probing hither and yon. But they can\u2019t find the killer pass. 73 min: Reading are still on 61% possession for the match. They\u2019re going out, but they\u2019ve given a great account of themselves this afternoon, a performance that\u2019s sure to give them a boost in their Championship relegation battle. 72 min: Barrow bowls down the left, then slips a pass inside for Aluko, who clips a first-time shot towards the bottom left from the edge of the box. Romero tips round for a corner. From the set piece, Yiadom\u2019s shot hits McTominay on the shoulder. Reading want a penalty, but they\u2019re never getting it. Another corner instead, which comes to nothing. 70 min: Aluko drives at United but the door is slammed shut. United break upfield, Lukaku slipping a ball wide right to Chong, who is fast but can\u2019t get on the end of that. The Old Trafford faithful certainly are excited by the promise of Chong, a huge roar going up as he\u2019s in hot pursuit. 68 min: Young hoicks a free kick into the Reading box from the left. Lukaku can\u2019t get a header on target. Then another wave, as Rashford bursts into the area from the left, but he\u2019s crowded out. Finally a third go, as Young dribbles in from the left and slips a ball inside for Fellaini, who tries to back-flick into the net from close range. No Lee Sharpe he. 66 min: Nothing going on, so BT Sport show footage of Sanchez sitting in Solskjaer\u2019s seat in the dugout, and being told to move in short order. 64 min: Sanchez departs with a frown, as Rashford comes on in his stead. 63 min: Typical timing: Sanchez has pulled up, and has indicated that he needs to come off. 61 min: Reading make their second change, swapping McCleary for Barrow. Meanwhile United make a double substitution: Mata and Fred are replaced by Fellaini and the 19-year-old winger Tahith Chong. 59 min: McCleary makes good ground down the left with some ball-on-string entertainment. He flicks a pass down the channel to release Loader into the box, but the Reading forward has foolishly wandered offside. A needless mistake with United once again looking vulnerable in defence. 57 min: A bit of a lull. United don\u2019t really need to move up the gears, so this is where we are. 55 min: Now it\u2019s Reading\u2019s turn to escape. A long ball down the United left. Lukaku cushions a header down for Sanchez, who can\u2019t get a shot away. Yiadom should clear, but he allows Lukaku to barge him off the ball, to the left of goal. Lukaku sets up Mata, whose first-time swipe hits Moore. 53 min: Aluko jinks his way across the front of the United box, right to left. Then he suddenly checks and plays a cute straight pass to Harriott, who is free on the penalty spot! He has to score, but batters straight at Romero. United escape. 52 min: Dalot and Mata play a long-distance one-two down the right. Dalot dinks one into the centre but Lukaku is on the back foot. Mata tries a cross from the left but it\u2019s too deep. The first signs of United flickering to life in this second half, though. 50 min: Kelly takes a shot from the best part of 40 yards. Full marks for ambition. 49 min: Darmian clatters into the back of Loader, who was in the process of turning him down the inside-left channel, 25 yards from goal. A free kick in a dangerous area. Swift takes, sending one over the wall and dipping towards the bottom right. Romero reads it well and snaffles the catch. 47 min: Harriott dribbles down the middle of the park and flicks a pass to his left for Loader. It doesn\u2019t quite come off, but United were once again light at the back there. 46 min: McClearly and Loader work the ball down the right. The ball\u2019s teed up for Swift, who blazes over from distance. Reading have obviously come out swinging, with nothing to lose. A fair chance, one way or the other, that this won\u2019t end 2-0. The second half is underway. United get the ball rolling again. Reading have made a change, with the injured Ilori replaced by the forward-thinking Aluko. Rinomhota moves to right back, with Yiadom moving into the centre of defence. Half-time entertainment. This is delightful. Please don\u2019t get too lost in nostalgic reverie, and remember to come back for the second half. Reading have been excellent. But United have been clinical. The hosts have one foot in the fourth round. Just as Reading were threatening to equalise, United break upfield. Sanchez threads a pass down the inside left to release Lukaku, who rounds Jaakkola on the outside and rolls home. 45 min +3: Harriott has a whack this time from his beat out on the right. It\u2019s blocked. But then Yiadom spins Jones with the greatest of ease, down the inside right. He slams a shot towards the top right; it\u2019s parried round the post for a corner that comes to nothing. 45 min +2: Swift has been Reading\u2019s chief creative force, and here he sends a stunning crossfield pass to Harriott out on the right. Not for the first time, there\u2019s a lot of space out there. Not for the first time, Harriott doesn\u2019t do anything with the opportunity. 45 min: There will be five added minutes, a combination of the Ilori injury and the VAR exercise. 44 min: Swift robs Pereira, 35 yards out, and feeds Harriott down the right. Harriott opens his body and looks to pass the ball into the bottom right, but his shot is weak and easily snaffled by Romero. 43 min: Young hauls down Harriott in the middle of the park. For some reason the referee gives Sanchez a lecture instead. This half is petering out. 41 min: Yiadom bursts past Sanchez down the right. There\u2019s not much in it, but the referee blows for a United free kick. Just as well for the hosts, because Yiadom was yomping into the area. Yiadom loses the place completely, throwing semaphore shapes in disgust. He suddenly remembers he\u2019s on a booking and calms down quicksmart. 40 min: Space for McCleary down on the right. He hooks into the box for Loader, but Darmian and Jones crowd out the Reading striker. 37 min: Fred looks industrious and impressive. He sends Lukaku trotting into the Reading half with a quick forward thrust. Lukaku feeds Sanchez on his left. Sanchez dribbles into the box with great purpose, but he\u2019s shepherded away from danger by Ilori, and Jaakkola then hacks away from danger while down on his knees. 35 min: United\u2019s defence is all over the shop, offering up plenty of chances. But Reading aren\u2019t taking them. Twice in the space of a minute, there\u2019s oodles of room for Harriott, then Loader, down the inside-right channel. But both young Reading forwards hesitate when they should drive forward to trouble Romero. 34 min: Reading are still on 61% possession. But what\u2019s possession nowadays? United seem happy to let them ping it around and play on the break. 33 min: Yiadom is quite correctly booked for a wild and late lunge on Fred. He took out the United midfielder\u2019s standing leg with gusto. Clumsy more than anything else, but still. 32 min: Reading aren\u2019t taking this lying down. Harriott has a whack from a position wide on the right. It\u2019s not a million miles from the top-left corner. 30 min: A glorious chance missed at both ends! First Lukaku barrels his way down the middle. He should tear clear, but with Moore on his shoulder, lets the ball clank between his feet. Momentum gone. He finally digs it out for a shot, but Jaakkola parries well. Then Harriott is sent scampering into acres down the right. With United\u2019s entire defence inexplicably AWOL, he slips a ball inside for Loader, who should shoot when one on one with Romero. But instead he tries to round the keeper on the right. Romero stands up well to block for a corner, which leads to nought. 28 min: Sanchez twists and shimmies in the Reading box, but can\u2019t get a shot away because Richards is sticking to him like glue. Ilori, moving well again, sends a long clearance towards Harriott, who briefly threatens to race clear. But Darmian is across to cover well. 27 min: Young tears down the left and sends a low cross-cum-shot into the arms of Jaakkola. The goal has lit a fire under United. They\u2019re playing with much more speed and purpose now. 25 min: Sanchez attempts to cross from the left. The ball clanks into Yiadom\u2019s arm, just inside the box. United want another penalty kick, but they\u2019re not getting one. Yiadom was standing right in front of Sanchez, and he had little chance of getting his arm out of the way. Also, on second viewing, he wasn\u2019t in the box. We move on. 24 min: It took two minutes and five seconds, but that was the correct decision. A shame for Reading, though, who had otherwise started very well. Mata slots the ball into the bottom right, Jaakkola given no chance! 22 min: And it\u2019s a penalty to United, Mata having been barged over by Richards as he played the ball forward to Fred! Mata will get up and take it himself. 20 min: United score! But the flag goes up! Young hoicks the ball into the Reading area from the left. Fred hooks it down near the penalty spot. Mata plays the dropping ball back to Fred, who sweeps home. But Mata\u2019s touch looks to have caught Fred offside. We\u2019re going to VAR. 18 min: Reading respond very impressively. First Swift looks to have sent Loader clear down the middle with a defence splitter from inside his own half, but the Reading striker went too soon and the flag goes up for offside. Then a left-wing cross from Harriott finds its way to Yiadom, haring into the United area from the right. Yiadom is in acres - where\u2019s Young? - and could take a touch before shooting. But he suffers a rush of blood to the head, and blooters a first-time effort wide and high. That goes down as a good chance spurned. 16 min: Finally, United spring into life. Fred, McTominay and Lukaku play it upfield at speed, some glorious one-touch passing. Sanchez picks up possession 25 yards out, drops a shoulder as he shifts the ball to his right, and sends a dipping screamer, intended for the top left, inches over the bar. So close! 15 min: Ilori\u2019s back up, but padding around gingerly at the moment. 13 min: Ilori has come off second best in a 50-50 challenge for a high ball with Lukaku. He\u2019s landed awkwardly on his hip from a height. On the Reading bench, erstwhile United defender John O\u2019Shea wonders whether he\u2019ll get a fairytale run-out at his alma mater, at the ripe age of 37. 11 min: Reading have enjoyed 62% of possession so far. United have looked a little sleepy so far, not long out of bed. 10 min: McTominay\u2019s back up and about. Reading spend some time probing down the left. Swift then switches play to Harriott, who briefly threatens to turn Pereira down the inside-right channel. Pereira recovers well and United try to break upfield, but Sanchez\u2019s attempt to release Lukaku is wayward. 8 min: United finally get a little rhythm going. Fred at the centre of some pretty triangles. Suddenly Sanchez attempts to turn Harriott down the inside left. He\u2019s fouled, and it\u2019s a chance to clip a free kick into a loaded box. Young wedges the set piece into the mixer. Jones wins a header. Moore wins another to clear. McTominay goes down having hurt his noggin. He\u2019s down getting the magic sponge. 6 min: Loader and Swift try to one-two their way down the middle of the park. A couple of passes stick, the one intended to split United\u2019s defence doesn\u2019t. But full marks for ambition. 4 min: Reading continue to knock the ball around in a carefree style, albeit mainly in their own half. They\u2019ve decided to try to enjoy themselves, by the looks of it, just as their manager suggested. United haven\u2019t got going yet. 2 min: It\u2019s not been all Reading, exactly, but the visitors have been pinging it around in a confident manner. Everyone\u2019s had a touch. Perhaps they\u2019ve been a little too confident, because for a second it looks as though Kelly is going to gift possession to a buzzing Fred on the edge of his own box. But he plays away from danger. And we\u2019re off! Reading get the ball rolling, and they\u2019ll be kicking towards the Stretford End in this first half. The teams are out! A fantastic atmosphere at Old Trafford, as the sound of the Stone Roses pings around the place. This is the one. It\u2019s almost as though a huge weight was recently lifted. United are in their famous red, white and black, while Reading sport their traditional blue and white. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. \u201cAfter the Reading manager\u2019s interview just now, it feels completely surreal to me to have someone named Jos\u00e9 talking about Manchester United with any kind of enthusiasm or interest.\u201d Adam Kline-Schoder with today\u2019s top zinger, ladies and gentlemen. He\u2019s here all week. Try the pickled egg in a sausage and black pudding coating rolled in breadcrumbs. Solskjaer speaks ... and smiles. He\u2019s loving this life. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hectic couple of weeks, but it\u2019s been fantastic. It\u2019s great to be in a competition that you can win, it\u2019s a trophy we can go for. Most of these players have started a game in the last four games anyway. Romelu and Alexis, it\u2019s about time to start them. I give young Scott a chance, he\u2019s played enough games. It should be an opportunity for everyone to put themselves in the frame for Tottenham. Changing so many players might be a risk, but we have a couple of injuries and some tired legs, so this is how it has to be. I\u2019m going to enjoy it as long as I\u2019m here. If you don\u2019t enjoy working at Man United, you\u2019re not gonna enjoy working in football! I\u2019m not thinking about job prospects, but trophies. This is probably our biggest chance of a trophy. I have told the lads how nice it is to run out at Wembley for a final.\u201d For the record, the Reading gig is the well-travelled Gomes\u2019 sixth job in the last two-and-a-half years. And his tenth in a 13-year managerial career. He makes Roy Hodgson look like Guy Roux. Altogether now: \u2669 \u266a \u266b \u266c \u266d \u266e \u266f There\u2019s a voice, keeps on callin\u2019 me ... \u2669 \u266a \u266b \u266c \u266d \u266e \u266f The new Reading manager Jose Manuel Gomes speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s a big game, the football party of the English federation. It\u2019s an honour to be part of this game. We must enjoy it, we must show to our supporters that we are able to play good football and get good results in the league. Today is a day to enjoy, and you never know what can happen. United are a strong team with fantastic players. We will try to play positive, offensive football. Why not? I cannot change this because we play against Manchester United, and we will try to give a good picture of what we can do.\u201d Pre-match patter. Corrections and clarifications dept. \u201cHi Scott,\u201d begins Christian Palmer. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to make any difference to today\u2019s result, but Reading made it to the semis in 2015. Here\u2019s your minute-by-minute report. Don\u2019t worry, my memory is failing me too.\u201d Oh dear. Thank you. Sorry. Yes, I am getting old. I remember when the Madejski was all fields. Only two United players remain from the starting XI named for the win at Newcastle on Wednesday. Phil Jones and Juan Mata keep their places. Otherwise it\u2019s all change, with Sergio Romero replacing David de Gea in goal, Matteo Darmian playing in the centre of defence, and the lesser-spotted Alexis Sanchez starting up front. Reading make four changes to the team thrashed at home by Swansea last weekend. Liam Moore, Liam Kelly, Callum Harriott and Danny Loader replace Sone Aluko, Yakou Meite, Modou Barrow and - returning to his old stomping ground, the Old Trafford benches - John O\u2019Shea. Manchester United: Romero, Dalot, Darmian, Jones, Young, Fred, McTominay, Andreas Pereira, Mata, Lukaku, Sanchez. Subs: Lindelof, Rashford, Martial, Grant, Fellaini, Garner, Chong. Reading: Jaakkola, Yiadom, Tiago Ilori, Moore, Richards, Kelly, Rinomhota, McCleary, Swift, Harriott, Loader. Subs: Gunter, O\u2019Shea, Aluko, Barrow, Meite, Walker, East. Referee: Stuart Atwell (Nuneaton). Manchester United and Reading have history in the FA Cup. A long tradition stretches all the way back to 1912, when Billy Meredith and Sandy Turnbull starred in a 3-0 win for United at Old Trafford. A last-minute goal settled a three-game marathon in Reading\u2019s favour in 1927; the Biscuitmen made it all the way to the semis , the last time they got so far . United beat Reading in successive seasons in 1937 and 1938. Colin Webster and Dennis Violett shone for the Busby Babes in a 4-1 rout in 1955. In more modern times ... the United of Cantona and Giggs won 3-0 at Elm Park during their successful run of 1996; Gabriel Heinze, Louis Saha and a certain Ole Gunnar Solskjaer put them three up in six minutes (!) at the Madejski in 2007; Nani and Javier Hernandez were the heroes in 2013; Wayne Rooney, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford wrapped up a 4-0 win this time two years ago. All in all, history is not on Reading\u2019s side. Their recent form doesn\u2019t give them much hope either: they\u2019ve not won a match since November 3, and are coming off the back of a 4-1 thrashing by Swansea. United, nobody awake needs reminding, have won all four of their matches since interim boss Solskjaer rocked up. This should make it five from five - the visitors are a 33-1 shot - though Reading will hope United take their eye off the ball and the foot off the pedal. Because in the third round of the FA Cup, you never know. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>Born in Wimbledon, where his father ran an Indian restaurant, <a href=\"http://www.akramkhancompany.net\" title=\"\">Akram Khan</a>, 44, is one of Britain\u2019s most celebrated contemporary dancers and choreographers. He is currently nearing the end of the tour of his final solo show, <a href=\"http://www.akramkhancompany.net/productions/xenos/\" title=\"\"><em>Xenos</em></a>, a piece about the forgotten contribution of Indian soldiers in the first world war, and is about to appear in <a href=\"http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/whats-on/2019/until-the-lions/\" title=\"\"><em>Until the Lions</em></a>, based on a story in the <em>Mahabharata</em>.</p> <p><strong>A lot of people still remember you from the choreography you provided for a section in the Olympics opening ceremony in 2012. How do you feel when you compare how we felt then with what is going on now? </strong><br>It\u2019s amazing going from London 2012, which celebrated our sense of embracing each other and embracing the difference in each other, to being in 2019, where we are hurtling towards post-Brexit. Everything that Brexit stands for is the opposite of what the message of the London Olympics was. It is our most pessimistic time now. A terrifying time.</p> <p><strong>You always make works that address big themes. Why do you think dance can connect in that way? </strong><br>The body is the most truthful and most direct way of saying things because it is the most primal. I have always loved words and worked with words, but somehow the body encompasses the more feminine senses. Patriarchal society separated the senses. Sight and sound became a male thing; taste, feeling and smell are more orientated towards the feminine. The body encapsulates all five senses simultaneously working together to tell a story.</p> <p>As a kid I was very invisible. I had a problem with speaking to communicate my thoughts and ideas. It had a huge impact on me when I won a disco competition dancing to Michael Jackson and Five Star. I realised that movement was my best way of communicating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I love performing, but I don\u2019t enjoy the creative process on my own body</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Dance is something you share with your mother, isn\u2019t it? </strong><br>Oh yes. When my daughter was born, she came to the hospital and danced to welcome our child. My Japanese in-laws were sitting there and looking surprised. She has always communicated stories through her body. She says it is a spiritual experience when you dance with someone. You share something without saying it in words and there is nothing more profound than that. That\u2019s why I did dance really.</p> <p>I am hugely nervous about the technological revolution that stops us moving. We look at a screen, at a phone or an iPad, at such an early age. It is frightening that the more technology advances, the more it entices you into a virtual world and the less you are physically active in the real world.</p> <p><strong>Your father is also in your work. </strong><a href=\"http://www.akramkhancompany.net/productions/desh-2011/\" title=\"\"><strong><em>DESH</em></strong></a>,<strong> your first solo</strong><strong>, examined your relationship with him and his homeland in Bangladesh\u2026 </strong><br>I have always seen parents through a western perspective, so my mum is good, my dad is bad. My mum is on a pedestal, my father is definitely not. All narratives in the west are predominantly written in this very clear system. In eastern culture, it is far more complex. The good has a lot of subtle badness in it, and the bad, a subtle goodness. What I realised is that the eastern approach is much closer to the human condition. I\u2019ve just made a documentary for Channel 4 called <em>Curry House Kids</em>, which focuses on Brick Lane and my generation of people whose parents owned Indian restaurants. Making this documentary, I started to realise my father\u2019s role in my life and his journey and how difficult it was.</p> <p><strong>How has having your own children \u2013 a three</strong><strong>-year</strong><strong>-old son, Kenzo</strong><strong>, and a daughter, Sayuri, aged five </strong><strong>\u2013 changed your view of things? </strong><br>My children have forced me to look at the future. We are the dead of the future. Children are the future. But we are leaving them an environment that they have to tackle and deal with. By looking at the future, I am also looking more at the past and asking where did we go wrong? I am trying to address other people\u2019s stories, other voices that were silenced.</p> <p>My new work for my company, <a href=\"http://www.akramkhancompany.net/productions/outwitting-the-devil/\" title=\"\"><em>Outwitting the Devil</em></a>, which premieres in Stuttgart in July, ties into my worries. It is us who are the devil. We are the first generation to know that we are destroying our planet. And we are the last generation that can do anything about it. The separation we have now, it\u2019s not one of colour or of nations, it\u2019s going to be one big separation of the rich, who have access to all the resources and the poor, who have access to none.</p> <p><strong>How is it </strong><strong>working with your company for that and <em>Until the Lions</em> as opposed to working by yourself for your solo <em>Xenos</em>? </strong><br>I really enjoy working with other people. I love performing but I don\u2019t enjoy the creative process on my own body. I can\u2019t sit outside and fantasise. Psychologically and physically when I am training on my own body, it\u2019s frustrating. When I was younger, even eight years ago, I felt happier to create work on my own body.</p> <p><strong>Why did you want to make <em>Until the Lions</em>? </strong><br>Myths are written by males and most of history is written by white men, so in both <em>Xenos</em> and <em>Until the Lions</em>, I wanted to change the perspective. In <em>Until the Lions</em> the heroine Amba is seen as a problem; but you can clearly see she is just fighting for justice. She was wronged yet society scorns her because she is a woman who dares to speak against the patriarchal system.</p> <p>This piece is very meaningful for me. It\u2019s about gender issues, a woman who transforms herself into a man. It is about a woman standing up to a man in a patriarchal system. How can it not be relevant? Some myths are timeless because they are about the human condition. They are going to be relevant as long as human beings exist.</p> <p><em>Until the Lions is at </em><em>the </em><a href=\"http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/whats-on/2019/until-the-lions/\" title=\"\"><em>Roundhouse</em></a><em>, London from 11-17 January </em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Born in Wimbledon, where his father ran an Indian restaurant, Akram Khan, 44, is one of Britain\u2019s most celebrated contemporary dancers and choreographers. He is currently nearing the end of the tour of his final solo show, Xenos, a piece about the forgotten contribution of Indian soldiers in the first world war, and is about to appear in Until the Lions, based on a story in the Mahabharata. A lot of people still remember you from the choreography you provided for a section in the Olympics opening ceremony in 2012. How do you feel when you compare how we felt then with what is going on now? It\u2019s amazing going from London 2012, which celebrated our sense of embracing each other and embracing the difference in each other, to being in 2019, where we are hurtling towards post-Brexit. Everything that Brexit stands for is the opposite of what the message of the London Olympics was. It is our most pessimistic time now. A terrifying time. You always make works that address big themes. Why do you think dance can connect in that way? The body is the most truthful and most direct way of saying things because it is the most primal. I have always loved words and worked with words, but somehow the body encompasses the more feminine senses. Patriarchal society separated the senses. Sight and sound became a male thing; taste, feeling and smell are more orientated towards the feminine. The body encapsulates all five senses simultaneously working together to tell a story. As a kid I was very invisible. I had a problem with speaking to communicate my thoughts and ideas. It had a huge impact on me when I won a disco competition dancing to Michael Jackson and Five Star. I realised that movement was my best way of communicating. Dance is something you share with your mother, isn\u2019t it? Oh yes. When my daughter was born, she came to the hospital and danced to welcome our child. My Japanese in-laws were sitting there and looking surprised. She has always communicated stories through her body. She says it is a spiritual experience when you dance with someone. You share something without saying it in words and there is nothing more profound than that. That\u2019s why I did dance really. I am hugely nervous about the technological revolution that stops us moving. We look at a screen, at a phone or an iPad, at such an early age. It is frightening that the more technology advances, the more it entices you into a virtual world and the less you are physically active in the real world. Your father is also in your work. DESH, your first solo, examined your relationship with him and his homeland in Bangladesh\u2026 I have always seen parents through a western perspective, so my mum is good, my dad is bad. My mum is on a pedestal, my father is definitely not. All narratives in the west are predominantly written in this very clear system. In eastern culture, it is far more complex. The good has a lot of subtle badness in it, and the bad, a subtle goodness. What I realised is that the eastern approach is much closer to the human condition. I\u2019ve just made a documentary for Channel 4 called Curry House Kids, which focuses on Brick Lane and my generation of people whose parents owned Indian restaurants. Making this documentary, I started to realise my father\u2019s role in my life and his journey and how difficult it was. How has having your own children \u2013 a three-year-old son, Kenzo, and a daughter, Sayuri, aged five \u2013 changed your view of things? My children have forced me to look at the future. We are the dead of the future. Children are the future. But we are leaving them an environment that they have to tackle and deal with. By looking at the future, I am also looking more at the past and asking where did we go wrong? I am trying to address other people\u2019s stories, other voices that were silenced. My new work for my company, Outwitting the Devil, which premieres in Stuttgart in July, ties into my worries. It is us who are the devil. We are the first generation to know that we are destroying our planet. And we are the last generation that can do anything about it. The separation we have now, it\u2019s not one of colour or of nations, it\u2019s going to be one big separation of the rich, who have access to all the resources and the poor, who have access to none. How is it working with your company for that and Until the Lions as opposed to working by yourself for your solo Xenos? I really enjoy working with other people. I love performing but I don\u2019t enjoy the creative process on my own body. I can\u2019t sit outside and fantasise. Psychologically and physically when I am training on my own body, it\u2019s frustrating. When I was younger, even eight years ago, I felt happier to create work on my own body. Why did you want to make Until the Lions? Myths are written by males and most of history is written by white men, so in both Xenos and Until the Lions, I wanted to change the perspective. In Until the Lions the heroine Amba is seen as a problem; but you can clearly see she is just fighting for justice. She was wronged yet society scorns her because she is a woman who dares to speak against the patriarchal system. This piece is very meaningful for me. It\u2019s about gender issues, a woman who transforms herself into a man. It is about a woman standing up to a man in a patriarchal system. How can it not be relevant? Some myths are timeless because they are about the human condition. They are going to be relevant as long as human beings exist. Until the Lions is at the Roundhouse, London from 11-17 January",

      "bodyText": "We knew that the 116th Congress was going to be the most diverse in history, with 102 women, many more openly gay members, more blacks, more Latinos, the first two female Native Americans, a Somali immigrant and the first ever Palestinian American woman elected to the House. But it was an altogether different thing to actually see that blazingly colorful diversity assembled under the portraits of the older white men who have lorded over the House of Representatives for so long. As Nancy Pelosi made her way through the chamber to reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel, stopping after almost every step to receive a hug, it was a very emotional scene and the first time since Donald Trump\u2019s election that I felt lightness and happiness radiating from the Capitol. And color. Deb Haaland of New Mexico, wearing a traditional Pueblo dress, was on the verge of tears as she embraced Sharice Davids of Kansas, a member of Ho-Chunk Nation. They are the first Native American women to serve in the House. Openly gay, Davids is also one of the record number of LGBTQ members of the chamber. Nearby, Ilhan Omar, a Somali immigrant from Minnesota, was resplendent in her white and gold hijab. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, chose a copy of the Qu\u2019ran to swear herself in as the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress. (The Qu\u2019ran once belonged to Thomas Jefferson). When Pelosi joined the House in 1987, there were only 23 female members. As of Thursday, there are 102, nearly 90% of whom are Democrats. It was striking when Pelosi passed a row that included Democratic representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Barbara Lee, Jahana Hayes, Lauren Underwood and Sheila Jackson Lee, all women of color. That rainbow was only visible on the left side of the dias \u2013 the Democratic side. On the right, where the Republicans sat, there was still the usual sea of suits worn by mainly older white men. They will be a formidable force, trying to stymie Pelosi at every turn and frustrate the new, younger activists who are such an important part of her governing coalition. But change was everywhere on Thursday, from the line outside the women\u2019s bathroom off the House floor (only gained in 2011) to the fans who practically overwhelmed Ocasio-Cortez outside Pelosi\u2019s office. There were, naturally, some sour notes. This was Washington, after all. Liz Cheney\u2019s attempt to get a \u201cBuild That Wall\u201d chant going, some stony Republican grimaces, and, lowest of all, a tape from Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 college days of her dancing on a rooftop that was put up on Twitter by a rightwing troll. There was also the false suggestion that she wasn\u2019t really from the Bronx. \u201cHere is America\u2019s favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is,\u201d read the post, with the user, who has since deleted their account, claiming it was a \u201chigh school video of \u2018Sandy\u2019 Ocasio-Cortez\u201d. It\u2019s frustrating in a post #MeToo world that women in power are still caricatured as inauthentic. Trump\u2019s sneers at Elizabeth Warren, calling her Pocahontas, are meant to portray her as a phony, faking her ethnic roots. Pelosi, and, of course, Hillary Clinton, are often portrayed as stiff and inauthentic. It frightens the rightwing to see urban liberals like Ocasio-Cortez amass real followings and assert their growing power. So the rightwing tries to take them down with hackneyed caricatures and doctored tapes. In the case of the dancing tape of Ocasio-Cortez, the attempted attack completely backfired. Of course, the dancing tape went viral and clearly increased her popularity on social media and enhanced her status as a young sensation on Capitol Hill. And she hit back in the best way, with humor. \u201cYou hate me cuz you ain\u2019t me, fellas,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. Then she quickly made a new video of herself dancing outside her new congressional office. In the lighthearted, 11-second clip, she dances along to a line from Edwin Starr\u2019s classic Motown hit War: \u201cWhat is it good for? Absolutely nothing,\u201d she sings (or lip-syncs), pointing half playfully, half defiantly at the camera before bursting into laughter and flinging herself through the door of her office as if she had occupied her seat on Capitol Hill for years, not 24 hours Thursday felt like the start of something truly new and important. It was clear that it rattled the president, as he ranted about calling a national emergency to get his wall built and said he was willing to let the government showdown go on forever. Pelosi is a great strategist and she\u2019s already outmaneuvered the president on the wall. She has talked of working with rational Republicans and extending a hand of friendship. She knows exactly what she needs to put together a winning vote. It will be scintillating to watch her moves and how the White House reacts. It\u2019s a new day and it\u2019s not Trump\u2019s Washington any more.",

      "bodyText": "Elizabeth Warren has been criticized by her opponents as \u201cout of touch\u201d, but the Massachusetts senator\u2019s message seemed to resonate with voters in Iowa as she officially kicked off the presidential campaign she announced this week. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to working families in America?\u201d she asked an enthusiastic crowd of about 500 in Council Bluffs, a city of 62,000 straddling the Iowa-Nebraska border. \u201cWhy has America\u2019s middle class been hollowed out? What\u2019s happening to opportunity in this country? Why is the path so rocky for so many people, and so much rockier for people of color? Why has this happened in America?\u201d The Democrat, whose criticism of big banks and corporations has made her a progressive star, was appearing as part of a five-city tour across the crucial state over the weekend. She was also scheduled to stop in Sioux City, Storm Lake, Des Moines and Ankeny. It was a strong introduction to the state which will host the first Democratic contest of the 2020 race 13 months from now. It was also an opportunity for the senator, who seems more comfortable talking about the intricacies of policy than she does politicking, to get a head start over what is expected to be a crowded field. \u201cThis is the fight of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI picked it because it picked me.\u201d She got a warm reception on Friday at McCoy\u2019s, a bowling alley bar in spitting distance of the interstate that leads in and out of town. An enthusiastic crowd of 300 packed the bar\u2019s event room on an unseasonably warm January evening, with 200 others forced to watch from outside. Warren addressed the latter briefly in the parking lot before her speech. \u201cWe are in this fight together, all the way,\u201d she said. The senator stuck to a populist tone upon taking the stage, telling her audience that problems both at home and abroad in America \u201cintersect in a Washington that is working for the wealthy and well-connected\u201d, and is worse off for it. \u201cRight now, government works great for giant drug companies \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t work great for people trying to fill prescriptions,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t work great for families who want kids who can actually breathe the air. It works great for giant financial companies like Equifax \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t work for people whose social security numbers get stolen. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference in America,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cIt is an America right now that works for the rich and the powerful. And we need to call that out for what it is: corruption, pure and simple.\u201d It was on message for the former Harvard law professor, who has made economic populism the focus of her public service. Now 69, she spearheaded the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and has been a reliable critic of Donald Trump. Trump, of course, has hit right back, frequently mocking Warren as \u201cPocahontas\u201d, which she and Native American leaders have slammed as a \u201cracial slur.\u201d And yet, her response to such racist bullying has created a significant question mark over her presidential bid. In October, Warren released the results of a DNA test that revealed she had distant Native American heritage, a move aimed at silencing the president\u2019s taunts and disproving claims she falsely claimed Cherokee and Delaware tribe heritage in the past. But the move was widely criticized, including by Native American groups, as racist and for its apparent ignorance of the racist history of blood tests. On Friday night, neither the president\u2019s taunts nor Warren\u2019s unfortunate response came up. Instead, Warren described growing up in Oklahoma with a father put out of work by a heart attack and a mother who sacrificed a great deal to make ends meet. \u201cIf you want to know who I am, that story is etched on my heart, and always will be,\u201d she said, offering a sort of origin story. Warren mostly stuck to the domestic issues for which she\u2019s most known, delivering impassioned, convincing monologues on everything from healthcare to student loan debt to prescription drug prices to the minimum wage. \u201cWhen I was a kid, a minimum wage in America would support a family of three,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would pay a mortgage, keep the utilities on, and put food on the table. Today, a minimum wage job in America will not keep a momma and a baby out of poverty. Think about that difference. Because for me, that\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d During a question-and-answer session, Warren moved on to foreign affairs, expressing concern about the \u201crise of autocracies\u201d around the world and the Trump administration\u2019s hardline immigration policies, including the separations of children from their families. \u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d she said of a recent trip to the border, where she saw migrants held in cages. \u201cWe cannot give up the dream of comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Warren said, to applause. \u201cWe have to have an immigration system that understands the difference between the threat posed by criminals and terrorists and nine-year-old girls. \u201cWe need to be committed to a system that keeps us safe, and a system that is consistent with our values.\u201d The message seemed to appeal to those in attendance, many of whom remain undecided. \u201cI like what I heard,\u201d said Sara Madison, a substitute teacher in Council Bluffs. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s only invested in Washington.\u201d Attendees expressed concern about their and their children\u2019s futures and identified with Warren\u2019s populist rallying cry as a possible way forward in the fight against Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s the voice of the real middle class,\u201d said Ashanti Scates, a veteran and mother of two from Omaha, Nebraska, just over the river, who has been a fan since Warren entered the Senate in 2013. \u201cThe everyday Americans.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>How many times can you tell a good story? It depends on the teller, but that tends to suggest that the more a story is told the further it retreats from reality. Somebody once said that if everyone who claimed to have been at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/may/27/rite-of-spring-100-years-stravinsky\" title=\"\">first performance of Stravinsky\u2019s <em>The Rite of Spring</em></a> had actually been there, you\u2019d have needed Wembley stadium to fit them all in. Conversely, the famous riot has been so anthologised that it has now become chic in academic circles to question whether it actually happened.</p> <p>Gillian Moore is not chic in this sense, but simply offers a stylish and concise account of the event, complete with the fisticuffs and catcalls, the cries of \u201cdentist\u201d (because of Nijinsky\u2019s quaint choreography of the head resting sideways in the hand), the insults and general racket, the supposed arrival of the police, the terrified dancers desperately counting the sevens and elevens of complex music they could barely hear. Recent events in Paris have reminded us of the peculiar genius of the French for semi-organised violent demonstrations, and there\u2019s not much doubt that something of the kind took place that May night of 1913 in the new, open-plan Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, though without the tear gas or the blazing cars. In art as in politics, France has always had its underground, and the <em>Rite </em>disturbance was almost certainly pre-planned, perhaps deliberately provoked by the publicity-conscious Sergei Diaghilev, but then, as happens with <em>\u00e9v\u00e8nements</em>, got somewhat out of hand.</p> <p>Whatever it was exactly, the riot was what made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/stravinsky-rite-of-spring\" title=\"\"><em>The Rite of Spring</em></a> famous, long before anyone had heard and seen it apart from a few thousand Parisians and Londoners (the two early Russian performances were concerts). But it wasn\u2019t what made it great. Rowdy first performances do not a masterpiece make.

The composers of the Mighty Handful (<em>Moguchaya Kuchka</em>), who included Stravinsky\u2019s teacher Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, had been brilliant amateurs, but Rimsky-Korsakov himself had turned professional as a conservatoire teacher, and in so doing provided a model of how a slightly crazy, off-the-wall Russianism might discipline itself into a large international force. I think Moore is mistaken in claiming that Stravinsky didn\u2019t know how to write his music down before studying with Rimsky (privately \u2013 he was never a conservatoire student); but it\u2019s true that, like the <em>kuchka</em>, he lacked, and continued to lack, proper theoretical training. What he seems to have got from Rimsky was a powerful work ethic, and a realisation that his music must always be painstakingly structured, never thrown to the four winds. In a sense, he never learnt to write \u201cwell\u201d academically. His Paris success baffled his ex-fellow R-K pupils, who understood his limitations but not his genius. But then they stayed in St Petersburg and for the most part slotted comfortably into Soviet pedagogy; Stravinsky went west, and sped away from the inhibitions of a too-demanding academy.</p> <p>Much of this Moore charts lucidly and readably. Her prehistory harks all the way back to the Decembrists of 1825, then takes in Tolstoy, the realist (Peredvizhniki) painters, the neonationalist arts-and-crafts movement of Abramtsevo and Talashkino, the World of Art (Mir Iskusstva), and the neoprimitivism of Nikolay Roerich, the scenarist and designer of the Ballets Russes <em>Rite</em>. This is elegant, useful contextual history, though Stravinsky did not - as she suggests - meet Roerich in 1904, and had no connection with the World of Art until commissioned by Diaghilev in 1909. No more than any other writer is she able to explain the astounding rapidity of his evolution in three or four years from the sparky Russianism of orchestral pieces such as <em>Fireworks</em> to the harsh brutalism of <em>The Rite</em>, even with the recently rediscovered <em>Funeral Song</em> to help. But she is right to emphasise the ritual, processional character of this latter piece as a key property of the ballet and (she might have added) a great deal of Stravinsky\u2019s later work. Ritual isn\u2019t just the subject matter of the <em>Rite</em>; it\u2019s the essence of its musical thinking and, one could say, the crucial discovery from the more relaxed processional form of <em>Petrushka</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Frank Zappa\u2019s obsession with Stravinsky is well-known, but I had no idea how much of it found its way into his music</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moore, director of music at the Southbank Centre in London, would be well able to write a musical study of the <em>Rite</em>.

      "bodyText": "How many times can you tell a good story? It depends on the teller, but that tends to suggest that the more a story is told the further it retreats from reality. Somebody once said that if everyone who claimed to have been at the first performance of Stravinsky\u2019s The Rite of Spring had actually been there, you\u2019d have needed Wembley stadium to fit them all in. Conversely, the famous riot has been so anthologised that it has now become chic in academic circles to question whether it actually happened. Gillian Moore is not chic in this sense, but simply offers a stylish and concise account of the event, complete with the fisticuffs and catcalls, the cries of \u201cdentist\u201d (because of Nijinsky\u2019s quaint choreography of the head resting sideways in the hand), the insults and general racket, the supposed arrival of the police, the terrified dancers desperately counting the sevens and elevens of complex music they could barely hear. Recent events in Paris have reminded us of the peculiar genius of the French for semi-organised violent demonstrations, and there\u2019s not much doubt that something of the kind took place that May night of 1913 in the new, open-plan Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, though without the tear gas or the blazing cars. In art as in politics, France has always had its underground, and the Rite disturbance was almost certainly pre-planned, perhaps deliberately provoked by the publicity-conscious Sergei Diaghilev, but then, as happens with \u00e9v\u00e8nements, got somewhat out of hand. Whatever it was exactly, the riot was what made The Rite of Spring famous, long before anyone had heard and seen it apart from a few thousand Parisians and Londoners (the two early Russian performances were concerts). But it wasn\u2019t what made it great. Rowdy first performances do not a masterpiece make. Victor Hugo\u2019s play Hernani is supposed to have ignited the 1830 July revolution in Paris, but who ever stages it now, except in the form of Verdi\u2019s opera? The Rite has had a very different posterity, and it\u2019s one of the strengths of Moore\u2019s finely illustrated monograph that it supplies chapter and verse, not only on the score\u2019s background and artistic context \u2013 material available, if less handily, elsewhere \u2013 but also, more originally, on the amazing subsequent reach of music whose ancestry was so esoteric that Stravinsky could plausibly claim it had virtually no tradition behind it and had come to him out of the blue.

I played for Colchester and within a couple of years I was back at Northampton.\u201d Ludlam played for England Under-18s and in the 2015 World Rugby Under-20 Championship final against New Zealand in Italy, alongside Ellis Genge and Charlie Ewels, after which he was named England\u2019s player of the tournament. He has been slower than a number of contemporaries in establishing himself in the Premiership but he can at last dare to dream. \u201cPlaying for England would be brilliant but it is not something I am thinking about,\u201d says Ludlam, whose work at the breakdown and perpetual motion are an ideal fit for Boyd\u2019s way of playing. \u201cI just want to be better than last week and if I continue like that, the rest can look after itself. I have my head down, working hard. I like playing at 7, making tackles and competing at breakdowns, but I have played across the back row. I am just glad to be playing.\u201d Northampton are looking for a third successive league victory, something they have not achieved since September 2017 when they were at the top of the Premiership. \u201cConfidence goes a long way,\u201d Ludlam says. \u201cIt was good to go into the new year on a bit of a high but the task is to keep getting better.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Having busted a move not once, but twice, on her African trip last year, the prime minister, Theresa May, has thrown a spotlight on that most enchanting of traditions: politicians dancing. In honour of her performances, here we present our definitive list of dancing politicians \u2013 ranked.</p> \n<h2>10. Margaret Thatcher</h2> \n<p>One of the most divisive figures in recent British political history, we can at least probably all agree that when called upon to dance in public, the Iron Lady danced passably, if in a slightly uninspired fashion. It seems that occasionally the lady <em>was</em> for turning, although a twirl seemed to have been deemed a step too far.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doataPBjxpA\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/doataPBjxpA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Margaret Thatcher showing Theresa May how it is done.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>9. Neil Kinnock</h2> \n<p>The same could not be said of Neil Kinnock. When not <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh8ktNsie0I\">falling over on beaches</a>, Labour\u2019s leader during many of the Thatcher years could sometimes be found starring in pop videos. Here he is, inexplicably making a cameo in the video for My Guy by Tracey Ullman, who equally inexplicably managed to rack up three top 10 hit singles in 1983.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn7_qoWDzmY\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mn7_qoWDzmY?start=119&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=119\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Neil Kinnock appearing in a Tracey Ullman video, although nobdoy knows quite why.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>8. John Prescott</h2> \n<p>At the height of the New Labour years, when not throwing punches, John Prescott could frequently be seen having a dance at Labour party conference. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BgNKzyp6JAk?t=10s\">Here he is making shapes alongside a brass band</a> and the Blairs \u2013 much, it appears, to the disdain of Gordon Brown lurking in the background.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgNKzyp6JAk\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BgNKzyp6JAk?start=10&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=10\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  John Prescott and the New Labour gang cutting some rug.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>7. John Redwood</h2> \n<p>Not so much a dance as a sort of baffled nod and slight sway, ultra-Brexiteer John Redwood\u2019s highlight in office was his attempt to sing along to the Welsh national anthem, and the confused physical motion that went with it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzBq0n8dxFQ\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GzBq0n8dxFQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  John Redwood\u2019s Welsh national anthem moment.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>6. Ann Widdecombe</h2> \n<p>Trailblazer Ann Widdecombe made a Strictly Come Dancing appearance a viable career option for an ex-politician in 2010. She managed to be the lowest-scoring celebrity in seven of the 10 weeks that she lasted in the competition, but the public kept voting her back for more. Her signature move was to essentially lurk at the back of the stage while Anton du Beke tried to distract the judges by actually dancing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKIY5VnsYAM\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GKIY5VnsYAM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Ann Widdecombe bring new meaning to the concept of dancing.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5. David Cameron and Boris Johnson</h2> \n<p>The Tory dream ticket, or your worst nightmare? Either way David and Boris appeared as a dancing double act as they joined forces to bop along enthusiastically to the Spice Girls at the 2012 London Olympic closing ceremony.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2012/aug/13/cameron-johnson-dance-spice-girls-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/39y5d\" data-video-id=\"1786927\" data-video-name=\"London Olympics closing ceremony: Boris Johnson and David Cameron dance to the Spice Girls - video\" data-video-provider=\"BBC and Reuters\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-394635998\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/8/13/120813BorisCameronDancing-720.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/8/13/120813BorisCameronDancing-16x9.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/8/13/120813BorisCameronDancing_3gpLg16x9.3gp\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120813BorisCameronDancing/120813BorisCameronDancing.m3u8\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2012/aug/13/cameron-johnson-dance-spice-girls-video\">London Olympics closing ceremony: Boris Johnson and David Cameron dance to the Spice Girls</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4. Neil Hamilton</h2> \n<p>In between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1996/oct/01/conservatives.uk\">resigning in disgrace</a> and reinventing himself as the Welsh Ukip assembly member who likes to hang around with alt-right internet trolls who\u2019ve taught him phrases such as \u201ctriggered\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/neilukip/status/1011671738030182402?lang=en\">truly dank memes</a>\u201d, Neil Hamilton had to make a living.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</h2> \n<p>Despite repeated Republican attempts to humiliate her, the youngest ever US congresswoman still has an indefatigable sense of humour, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/04/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-college-dance-video-discredit-backfires\">and dance moves</a>!

Ed Balls</h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://edballs.mirror.co.uk/\">Ed Balls</a> woke up on 7 May 2015 hoping by the end of the night to be chancellor of the exchequer. Instead, by the end of the night he was no longer an MP and just 16 months away from being Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s novelty political contestant.

      "bodyText": "Having busted a move not once, but twice, on her African trip last year, the prime minister, Theresa May, has thrown a spotlight on that most enchanting of traditions: politicians dancing. In honour of her performances, here we present our definitive list of dancing politicians \u2013 ranked. 10. Margaret Thatcher One of the most divisive figures in recent British political history, we can at least probably all agree that when called upon to dance in public, the Iron Lady danced passably, if in a slightly uninspired fashion. It seems that occasionally the lady was for turning, although a twirl seemed to have been deemed a step too far. 9. Neil Kinnock The same could not be said of Neil Kinnock. When not falling over on beaches, Labour\u2019s leader during many of the Thatcher years could sometimes be found starring in pop videos. Here he is, inexplicably making a cameo in the video for My Guy by Tracey Ullman, who equally inexplicably managed to rack up three top 10 hit singles in 1983. 8. John Prescott At the height of the New Labour years, when not throwing punches, John Prescott could frequently be seen having a dance at Labour party conference. Here he is making shapes alongside a brass band and the Blairs \u2013 much, it appears, to the disdain of Gordon Brown lurking in the background. 7. John Redwood Not so much a dance as a sort of baffled nod and slight sway, ultra-Brexiteer John Redwood\u2019s highlight in office was his attempt to sing along to the Welsh national anthem, and the confused physical motion that went with it. 6. Ann Widdecombe Trailblazer Ann Widdecombe made a Strictly Come Dancing appearance a viable career option for an ex-politician in 2010. She managed to be the lowest-scoring celebrity in seven of the 10 weeks that she lasted in the competition, but the public kept voting her back for more. Her signature move was to essentially lurk at the back of the stage while Anton du Beke tried to distract the judges by actually dancing. 5. David Cameron and Boris Johnson The Tory dream ticket, or your worst nightmare? Either way David and Boris appeared as a dancing double act as they joined forces to bop along enthusiastically to the Spice Girls at the 2012 London Olympic closing ceremony. 4. Neil Hamilton In between resigning in disgrace and reinventing himself as the Welsh Ukip assembly member who likes to hang around with alt-right internet trolls who\u2019ve taught him phrases such as \u201ctriggered\u201d and \u201ctruly dank memes\u201d, Neil Hamilton had to make a living. And at one point he made that living by dancing on TV in a glass box for Johnny Vegas while someone poured a bucket of fish over him. 3. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Despite repeated Republican attempts to humiliate her, the youngest ever US congresswoman still has an indefatigable sense of humour, and dance moves! After an anonymous Twitter user posted a video showing Ocasio-Cortez boogying during college, the 29-year-old reprised some old steps outside her office on Capitol Hill, tweeting: \u201cI hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous. Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too!\u201d Cue further mock horror. 2. Ed Balls Ed Balls woke up on 7 May 2015 hoping by the end of the night to be chancellor of the exchequer. Instead, by the end of the night he was no longer an MP and just 16 months away from being Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s novelty political contestant. Who can forget the sight of the former shadow chancellor dancing to Gangnam Style on the nation\u2019s television sets? But probably his finest hour was an exquisitely camp salsa, while dressed as The Mask. Dance partner Katya Jones maintained her grace throughout the 10 weeks Ed survived on the show. 1. Theresa May We have to hand top spot to Theresa. She went to Africa to boost post-Brexit British exports, and exported a whole load of dance memes. Since she first danced at a South African school, the video clip has been posted thousands of times on social media. Post-punk band Killing Joke even made a version soundtracked with their I Am The Virus single, and it has been re-cut by others, in honour of her Maybot reputation, so that she\u2019s dancing to Kraftwerk\u2019s The Robots. Congratulations, Theresa May. And maybe we\u2019ll eventually get to see her on Strictly once she\u2019s had enough of trying to steer the country through Brexit \u2026",

Beating a Premier League side is one thing but the way the goal was scored was special, too. It was a diving header and somebody managed to do a good job of selling the photograph, because it made it to a newspaper in Sydney. I know because someone sent me a copy from Australia.</p> <p>We were confident about playing them at Millmoor. That stadium was almost worth a goal start for us. Sustaining Championship football for as long as we did was partly down to it. People didn\u2019t fancy it there. Teams didn\u2019t want to use the changing rooms and I\u2019m sure Southampton had that mindset. The longer the game went on, the more we saw it was possible to win.</p> <p>We have to believe we can do something similar against City. I\u2019ve studied Pep Guardiola for 10 years. It will be a great experience just to study him from the next technical area and it would be nice to have a chat. It won\u2019t be easy but Wigan knocked them out last year.

One of my most memorable moments is when we beat Everton after two replays in the fifth round in 1990. It was in the days without mobile phones so the press agencies would phone their copy over from the press box. But on the morning of the second replay, somebody had ripped out all the phone wires in the press box. Luckily the commercial manager jumped in his car, got on to the bosses at BT and managed to get the phones back on.</p> <p>Then there was the run to the semi-finals in 1994. We played Manchester United at Wembley and were 1-0 up with a minute to go in extra time. But Mark Hughes turned and volleyed in that equaliser. The next day Joe Royle told me it wouldn\u2019t have gone in if it had been anyone else.</p> <p>I went with friends and they were standing on the seats and singing to United.

My slight change in title since John Still\u2019s retirement as manager has added even more to the occasion and we have a chance to go up there and upset my uncle.</p> <p>I had a chat with Tony after the draw. We were excited to draw each other. He\u2019s been singing the praises of Chris Wilder and the team up there. He said some of United\u2019s football has been terrific.

      "bodyText": "Richie Barker on Manchester City v Rotherham Scored in Rotherham\u2019s 2-1 win over Southampton in 2002 and now their assistant coach I never get tired of talking about my goal against Southampton. Beating a Premier League side is one thing but the way the goal was scored was special, too. It was a diving header and somebody managed to do a good job of selling the photograph, because it made it to a newspaper in Sydney. I know because someone sent me a copy from Australia. We were confident about playing them at Millmoor. That stadium was almost worth a goal start for us. Sustaining Championship football for as long as we did was partly down to it. People didn\u2019t fancy it there. Teams didn\u2019t want to use the changing rooms and I\u2019m sure Southampton had that mindset. The longer the game went on, the more we saw it was possible to win. We have to believe we can do something similar against City. I\u2019ve studied Pep Guardiola for 10 years. It will be a great experience just to study him from the next technical area and it would be nice to have a chat. It won\u2019t be easy but Wigan knocked them out last year. Who knows? Roy Butterworth on Fulham v Oldham Oldham\u2019s match-day press officer for 56 years I got my first season ticket in 1947 and volunteer at the club for nothing now. One of my most memorable moments is when we beat Everton after two replays in the fifth round in 1990. It was in the days without mobile phones so the press agencies would phone their copy over from the press box. But on the morning of the second replay, somebody had ripped out all the phone wires in the press box. Luckily the commercial manager jumped in his car, got on to the bosses at BT and managed to get the phones back on. Then there was the run to the semi-finals in 1994. We played Manchester United at Wembley and were 1-0 up with a minute to go in extra time. But Mark Hughes turned and volleyed in that equaliser. The next day Joe Royle told me it wouldn\u2019t have gone in if it had been anyone else. I went with friends and they were standing on the seats and singing to United. I remember saying: \u2018It\u2019s not over yet\u2019. Sure enough, in it went. Then we lost the replay.\u201d Darren Currie on Sheffield United v Barnet Barnet\u2019s caretaker manager and nephew of Tony Currie, Sheffield United legend and director I was at home with my wife and children for the draw and the phone didn\u2019t stop ringing when it turned out it was Sheffield United away. All the family have been in touch and we\u2019ve been talking about it ever since. I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My slight change in title since John Still\u2019s retirement as manager has added even more to the occasion and we have a chance to go up there and upset my uncle. I had a chat with Tony after the draw. We were excited to draw each other. He\u2019s been singing the praises of Chris Wilder and the team up there. He said some of United\u2019s football has been terrific. They\u2019re doing so well in the Championship. We\u2019re under no illusions. It\u2019s a really difficult game but we want to enjoy it. I look forward to seeing Tony. We\u2019ll embrace \u2013 we\u2019re family. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll meet up after the game whatever the outcome. Let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s him congratulating me. Tim Thraves on Newport v Leicester Newport\u2019s PA announcer I\u2019ve been doing this job since the mid-70s and I\u2019m also the official commentator for away games. My late father, John Thraves, was a director of the club in the 60s and 70s. Last season was our first run for a long time. We knocked Leeds out in the third round and almost beat Spurs. They both found it hard because our crowds are very noisy. Leicester will find the Welsh are very passionate on these occasions. I\u2019ll be pitch level with the radio mic. I have a phrase before kick-off \u2013 \u201cLet\u2019s get behind the boys and let\u2019s make some noise\u201d \u2013 and I really go for it. The fans respond to it and my job is to get them whipped up. I remember the public address system failing at a game against Swindon at our old ground. I went around the track announcing the teams with a loud hailer. It was very amusing for the away fans.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cJust try,\u201d Francis says.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I dangle listlessly from the monkey bar.</p> <p>\u201cJust one,\u201d he tries again, his palm flat to my mid-back. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p> <p>I imagine him employing the same tone with his toddler. \u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d I spit out, petulantly. I jiggle my legs impatiently, \u201cI want to get down.\u201d Francis smiles. \u201cOK, no worries.\u201d He steps back and I jump to the floor.</p> <p>Later, at the end of our workout session, he tilts his head sympathetically. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you have a go earlier?\u201d I explain that I knew, categorically, that I wouldn\u2019t be able to \u201cheave my bulk over that stupid bar\u201d. That I didn\u2019t have the necessary strength to perform a chin-up, and that I already felt like an idiot \u2013 so why add fuel to that fire?</p> <p>He gives me homework. \u201cTonight, when you\u2019re in bed about to sleep, close your eyes and breathe through your nose; spend 10 minutes just breathing \u2013 lengthening your inhales and exhales \u2013 and thinking about which muscles are involved in a chin-up. Imagine those muscles working.\u201d</p> <p>Francis is a trainer at The Foundry, a swanky gym in London, where I\u2019ve been a member (semi-committedly) for about two years. We are three weeks into my \u201cholistic transformation\u201d, an eight-week programme that is meant to start me on a path towards not just better physical health, but stronger emotional and mental health. As the gym\u2019s cofounder Dave Thomas explains: \u201cImproving your physique can improve your health, both mentally and physically, but it can also have the opposite effect. Being healthy is a much more complex state than having a six-pack.\u201d</p> <p>Embracing that complexity is about to become one of the biggest trends in the fitness industry. Jessica Harman of forecasting agency WGSN, tells me that in the past year, \u201cthe fitness industry has shifted focus from the performance, strength and shape of our bodies to our wellbeing and mental health\u201d. Last year, <a href=\"https://remindstudio.com/\" title=\"\">Re:Mind became London\u2019s first meditation studio</a> \u2013 where for \u00a322 a time, dedicated \u201ccalmers\u201d guide you through sessions of \u201cenergising breathwork\u201d, or encourage you to \u201cfocus on good intentions\u201d. In the summer, <a href=\"https://moveyourframe.com/\" title=\"\">boutique studio Frame</a> launched an initiative to educate its members about how different styles of movement impact on mood; <a href=\"https://www.mindsetfit.co.uk/\" title=\"\">new gym Mindset</a> opened with an express focus on mental health, and the aim of helping gym-goers overcome \u201cemotional barriers\u201d through fitness; while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/apr/01/shape-of-the-future-how-barrys-bootcamp-changed-the-way-we-work-out\" title=\"\">Barry\u2019s Bootcamp</a> partnered with <a href=\"https://www.wearehumen.org/\">HUMEN, a charity that works to improve men\u2019s mental health</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Feeling positive and excited about what you\u2019re doing is just as important as results</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cBrands like Equinox fitness club have integrated mindfulness practices into classes as well as employing sleep coaches for members,\u201d says Victoria Buchanan, a researcher at trend forecasting agency The Future Laboratory. High-street gyms like Fitness First have taken up the mantle; last year they partnered with grassroots <a href=\"https://runtogether.co.uk/\" title=\"\">athletics organisation RunTogether</a>, working to support initiatives such as <a href=\"https://runtogether.co.uk/running-support/runandtalk/\" title=\"\">#RunAndTalk</a> \u2013 which aims to improve mental health through running.</p> <p>The programme I\u2019ve signed up for promises to \u201ctransform my body and mind\u201d \u2013 leaving me fitter, more motivated, less stressed. In real terms, this means I get personal-trainer-guided workouts (\u201cWe\u2019d like you to train five times a week,\u201d Francis says, at which I snort with laughter), nutritional advice (the first piece of which is to cut out one cup of coffee a day) and talks on managing stress. As well as creating a fitness programme for me, Francis checks in on my emotional and mental wellbeing at each session. It\u2019s much cosier than the \u201cabs first, questions later\u201d approach that used to be the norm. The course is not cheap, but it\u2019s easy to apply the same approach to your own regime (see panels below).</p> <p>To start with, I often feel frazzled \u2013 tired, overwhelmed, distracted. As Francis points out, I have a tendency to lose focus halfway through an exercise (or even a sentence). \u201cThese are all things we can work on,\u201d he says, soothingly. We discuss goals; I tell him I want to look like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\" title=\"\">a Kardashian</a> \u2013 curvaceous but thin, toned but grabbable. \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d he says and then disregards completely. \u201cI think our first goal is to do a chin-up.\u201d He points out that looking like a Kardashian is counterproductive, as \u201cit\u2019s not an action you can physically take\u201d. Which is how I end up lying in bed three weeks later, meditatively focusing on my biceps and latissimus dorsi (the back muscles used in a chin-up).</p> <p>Our workouts consist of three sessions of resistance training a week, with increasingly heavy weights, mixed with one or two cardio sessions. They\u2019re always group-based (for the weights sessions, there are just three or four of us; for cardio, it\u2019s more like a class, with around 12 others). Despite the group element, after the first week or so, each resistance workout is tailored to my mood or tiredness level. This is \u201cnourishing movement\u201d. \u201cThere has to be an element of enjoyment,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cFeeling positive and excited about what you\u2019re doing is just as important as results. If you\u2019re slogging through, you\u2019re not getting the emotional benefit of exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Francis doesn\u2019t take every session, but WhatsApps me most days \u2013 often about fitness and food, or sometimes just to ask how I am. The cynic in me knows that it\u2019s all part of a service, but it\u2019s encouraging to have the attention. The idea is to offer an impartial and nonjudgmental ear; he\u2019s not a therapist and doesn\u2019t purport to give me solutions to my personal problems, just the opportunity to chat if I want to. In fact, some therapists argue that talking while moving can foster a greater sense of openness \u2013 it\u2019s less confronting than sitting opposite someone (whether therapist or friend) \u2013 while the endorphin rush and self-esteem boost you get from achieving a fitness goal could make it more likely you reach your emotional epiphanies. Well, that\u2019s the theory. I don\u2019t love discussing my feelings at the best of times, but especially not when I\u2019m halfway through a squat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even walking for 10 minutes is better than nothing, especially if you\u2019re outside</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, through the weeks, Francis concentrates on correcting \u201cnegative self-talk\u201d (\u201clet\u2019s not say \u2018heave my bulk\u2019 any more, shall we?\u201d) and thought patterns that, he theorises, are holding me back. \u201cYou focus on all the possible negative outcomes.

I find it difficult to do five sessions each week, but do manage three \u2013 and I go outside every day, regardless. As Francis points out, \u201cEven walking for 10 minutes is better than nothing, especially if you\u2019re outside.\u201d As the weeks go on, I find I\u2019m drinking less alcohol (an unconscious choice, but since I\u2019m committing to 7am gym sessions, a few wines seem masochistic). My quasi sobriety, combined with the exercise, means I\u2019m also sleeping better. One morning, around six weeks in, I reach over to stop my 5.50am alarm and realise I\u2019m actually looking forward to the session.</p> <p>In the past, I had always thought of exercise as correcting a mistake: \u201cI\u2019m going to run because I ate five doughnuts yesterday.\u201d Today, I want to exercise because I know it\u2019ll be fun and because moving feels good.</p> <p>It\u2019s a much gentler way to transform than any I\u2019ve tackled before, and by the end of the eight weeks, I feel less frazzled. I\u2019m not a whole new person, but I do feel good; optimistic, even. I can deadlift more than my body weight, and \u2013 as of just a few days ago, I can do one chin-up. Jumping down from the monkey bars, I feel a frisson of pride. I look back on the work it took to get here (the early mornings, the hours of training, the meditative breathing) and allow myself to bask in the achievement. I turn and grin at Francis, who smiles and says: \u201cOK, let\u2019s try for two.\u201d</p> <h2>The experts\u2019 guide to\u2026 clearing your mind</h2> <p><strong>Start small</strong> In his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stick-Science-Behaviour-Sean-Young-ebook/dp/B071WWSP2Y\" title=\"\">Stick With It: The Science Of Lasting Behaviour</a>, psychologist Dr Sean Young breaks lifestyle changes down into dreams (long term), goals (medium term) and steps (short term). If the dream is to get fitter, then the goal might be to run 10k in the next three months, and the first step to get off the bus a stop early and walk the rest of the way. Each step should be small enough that it takes fewer than two days to accomplish. Stimulating the brain\u2019s reward system every two days has been shown to keep us motivated over a longer period.</p> <p><strong>Reframe anxiety</strong> Dealing with chronically high cortisol levels might be the single most impactful thing you can do to improve mental and brain health.

They no longer felt isolated.\u201d If half a tab of acid all seems a little too 1969, Carhart-Harris argues that just experiencing awe could have a similar effect \u2013 \u201cby challenging our self-involved viewpoints and giving us a sense of perspective on our problems\u201d. One way to do this is to write the story of a time you felt in awe of nature \u2013 according to <a href=\"https://www.bauer.uh.edu/mrrudd/download/AweExpandsTimeAvailability.pdf\" title=\"\">a study at Stanford University Graduate School of Business</a>, this quick task increased participants\u2019 sense of wellbeing, as well as their willingness to give to charity; it even made them feel like they had fewer time pressures. The key is to understand yourself as a small part of a vast, living system \u2013 for that, nothing beats being outside in nature.

I jiggle my legs impatiently, \u201cI want to get down.\u201d Francis smiles. \u201cOK, no worries.\u201d He steps back and I jump to the floor. Later, at the end of our workout session, he tilts his head sympathetically. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you have a go earlier?\u201d I explain that I knew, categorically, that I wouldn\u2019t be able to \u201cheave my bulk over that stupid bar\u201d. That I didn\u2019t have the necessary strength to perform a chin-up, and that I already felt like an idiot \u2013 so why add fuel to that fire? He gives me homework. \u201cTonight, when you\u2019re in bed about to sleep, close your eyes and breathe through your nose; spend 10 minutes just breathing \u2013 lengthening your inhales and exhales \u2013 and thinking about which muscles are involved in a chin-up. Imagine those muscles working.\u201d Francis is a trainer at The Foundry, a swanky gym in London, where I\u2019ve been a member (semi-committedly) for about two years. We are three weeks into my \u201cholistic transformation\u201d, an eight-week programme that is meant to start me on a path towards not just better physical health, but stronger emotional and mental health. As the gym\u2019s cofounder Dave Thomas explains: \u201cImproving your physique can improve your health, both mentally and physically, but it can also have the opposite effect. Being healthy is a much more complex state than having a six-pack.\u201d Embracing that complexity is about to become one of the biggest trends in the fitness industry. Jessica Harman of forecasting agency WGSN, tells me that in the past year, \u201cthe fitness industry has shifted focus from the performance, strength and shape of our bodies to our wellbeing and mental health\u201d. Last year, Re:Mind became London\u2019s first meditation studio \u2013 where for \u00a322 a time, dedicated \u201ccalmers\u201d guide you through sessions of \u201cenergising breathwork\u201d, or encourage you to \u201cfocus on good intentions\u201d. In the summer, boutique studio Frame launched an initiative to educate its members about how different styles of movement impact on mood; new gym Mindset opened with an express focus on mental health, and the aim of helping gym-goers overcome \u201cemotional barriers\u201d through fitness; while Barry\u2019s Bootcamp partnered with HUMEN, a charity that works to improve men\u2019s mental health. \u201cBrands like Equinox fitness club have integrated mindfulness practices into classes as well as employing sleep coaches for members,\u201d says Victoria Buchanan, a researcher at trend forecasting agency The Future Laboratory. High-street gyms like Fitness First have taken up the mantle; last year they partnered with grassroots athletics organisation RunTogether, working to support initiatives such as #RunAndTalk \u2013 which aims to improve mental health through running. The programme I\u2019ve signed up for promises to \u201ctransform my body and mind\u201d \u2013 leaving me fitter, more motivated, less stressed. In real terms, this means I get personal-trainer-guided workouts (\u201cWe\u2019d like you to train five times a week,\u201d Francis says, at which I snort with laughter), nutritional advice (the first piece of which is to cut out one cup of coffee a day) and talks on managing stress. As well as creating a fitness programme for me, Francis checks in on my emotional and mental wellbeing at each session. It\u2019s much cosier than the \u201cabs first, questions later\u201d approach that used to be the norm. The course is not cheap, but it\u2019s easy to apply the same approach to your own regime (see panels below). To start with, I often feel frazzled \u2013 tired, overwhelmed, distracted. As Francis points out, I have a tendency to lose focus halfway through an exercise (or even a sentence). \u201cThese are all things we can work on,\u201d he says, soothingly. We discuss goals; I tell him I want to look like a Kardashian \u2013 curvaceous but thin, toned but grabbable. \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d he says and then disregards completely. \u201cI think our first goal is to do a chin-up.\u201d He points out that looking like a Kardashian is counterproductive, as \u201cit\u2019s not an action you can physically take\u201d. Which is how I end up lying in bed three weeks later, meditatively focusing on my biceps and latissimus dorsi (the back muscles used in a chin-up). Our workouts consist of three sessions of resistance training a week, with increasingly heavy weights, mixed with one or two cardio sessions. They\u2019re always group-based (for the weights sessions, there are just three or four of us; for cardio, it\u2019s more like a class, with around 12 others). Despite the group element, after the first week or so, each resistance workout is tailored to my mood or tiredness level. This is \u201cnourishing movement\u201d. \u201cThere has to be an element of enjoyment,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cFeeling positive and excited about what you\u2019re doing is just as important as results. If you\u2019re slogging through, you\u2019re not getting the emotional benefit of exercise.\u201d Francis doesn\u2019t take every session, but WhatsApps me most days \u2013 often about fitness and food, or sometimes just to ask how I am. The cynic in me knows that it\u2019s all part of a service, but it\u2019s encouraging to have the attention. The idea is to offer an impartial and nonjudgmental ear; he\u2019s not a therapist and doesn\u2019t purport to give me solutions to my personal problems, just the opportunity to chat if I want to. In fact, some therapists argue that talking while moving can foster a greater sense of openness \u2013 it\u2019s less confronting than sitting opposite someone (whether therapist or friend) \u2013 while the endorphin rush and self-esteem boost you get from achieving a fitness goal could make it more likely you reach your emotional epiphanies. Well, that\u2019s the theory. I don\u2019t love discussing my feelings at the best of times, but especially not when I\u2019m halfway through a squat. Instead, through the weeks, Francis concentrates on correcting \u201cnegative self-talk\u201d (\u201clet\u2019s not say \u2018heave my bulk\u2019 any more, shall we?\u201d) and thought patterns that, he theorises, are holding me back. \u201cYou focus on all the possible negative outcomes. From now on, when you\u2019re in the gym I don\u2019t want you to think about whether something might go wrong.\u201d As well as meditative tasks, he sets homework for me, which includes talking to some of the other people who have signed up for the transformation (\u201ca sense of community will help to keep you motivated,\u201d he explains) and \u201cspending some time on grass\u201d. (\u201cLike running?\u201d I ask. \u201cYeah, or just walking, or hanging around. Just be outside on the grass for an hour if you can.\u201d) Being in a natural environment, even if it is just a local park, he points out, may help me feel more clear-headed and less stressed. I work on that chin-up until my arms become sore and my hands are calloused, but often get frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018limiting belief\u2019, it\u2019s just a fact of nature,\u201d I say at the end of my first month, no closer to getting my chin over the bar. I find it difficult to do five sessions each week, but do manage three \u2013 and I go outside every day, regardless. As Francis points out, \u201cEven walking for 10 minutes is better than nothing, especially if you\u2019re outside.\u201d As the weeks go on, I find I\u2019m drinking less alcohol (an unconscious choice, but since I\u2019m committing to 7am gym sessions, a few wines seem masochistic). My quasi sobriety, combined with the exercise, means I\u2019m also sleeping better. One morning, around six weeks in, I reach over to stop my 5.50am alarm and realise I\u2019m actually looking forward to the session. In the past, I had always thought of exercise as correcting a mistake: \u201cI\u2019m going to run because I ate five doughnuts yesterday.\u201d Today, I want to exercise because I know it\u2019ll be fun and because moving feels good. It\u2019s a much gentler way to transform than any I\u2019ve tackled before, and by the end of the eight weeks, I feel less frazzled. I\u2019m not a whole new person, but I do feel good; optimistic, even. I can deadlift more than my body weight, and \u2013 as of just a few days ago, I can do one chin-up. Jumping down from the monkey bars, I feel a frisson of pride. I look back on the work it took to get here (the early mornings, the hours of training, the meditative breathing) and allow myself to bask in the achievement. I turn and grin at Francis, who smiles and says: \u201cOK, let\u2019s try for two.\u201d The experts\u2019 guide to\u2026 clearing your mind Start small In his book Stick With It: The Science Of Lasting Behaviour, psychologist Dr Sean Young breaks lifestyle changes down into dreams (long term), goals (medium term) and steps (short term). If the dream is to get fitter, then the goal might be to run 10k in the next three months, and the first step to get off the bus a stop early and walk the rest of the way. Each step should be small enough that it takes fewer than two days to accomplish. Stimulating the brain\u2019s reward system every two days has been shown to keep us motivated over a longer period. Reframe anxiety Dealing with chronically high cortisol levels might be the single most impactful thing you can do to improve mental and brain health. From altering our emotional responses, to impairing memory and decision-making abilities, chronic stress physically ages brain tissue. Next time you\u2019re feeling stressed, try telling yourself you\u2019re actually excited. Physically, excitement and stress are very similar (sweaty palms, butterflies, pounding heart) and, according to researchers at Harvard Business School, this simple linguistic switch could be more effective than consciously trying to \u201ccalm down\u201d. Sit up straight Research shows that adopting an upright posture (back straight, shoulders pulled back but relaxed) can, over a day, make someone with mild depressive symptoms feel significantly more positive, less tired and less introspective. The University of Auckland study looked at 61 people with mild to moderate depression and found that good posture was associated with higher self-esteem. Exercise with others A 2017 study by the New England College of Osteopathic Medicine found that group exercise over 12 weeks improved emotional wellbeing by a quarter and reduced stress levels by the same amount. The same psychological benefits were not seen in those who exercised alone. Piggyback on other habits According to a study from University College London, it takes 66 days to form a habit. Behaviour-change psychologist Dr Aria Campbell-Danesh, who goes by Dr Aria, recommends tagging your first small steps on to things you already do each day. \u201cIf your ritual is to make a cup of tea at 3pm, go for a five-minute walk beforehand. That\u2019s 25 minutes more movement each week \u2013 an amazing start if your resolution is to get fitter.\u201d Cycle to improve memory As Dr Aria explains: \u201cAnalysis of four decades of studies found that cycling improves our brain\u2019s ability to store and retrieve memories, both during and after cycling, whereas only a small improvement was found after running.\u201d Results lasted well after the exercise was completed \u2013 the cumulative effect of a weekly bike ride could be impressive. Take up resistance training to protect your brain This could mean deadlifts and squats in the gym, 10 press-ups at the end of a run or even carrying bags of heavy shopping \u2013 just make sure your muscles are moving against resistance at some point each day. Researchers from Rush University Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center followed 900 people in a Chicago retirement community over four years. They found that those with greater muscle strength were significantly less likely to experience cognitive decline. Eat Greek The Mediterranean diet has been consistently linked to a lowered risk of everything from coronary heart disease to numerous types of cancer. Recently, it has also been used to treat people with depression. \u201cIn one Australian study, a dietician encouraged people to eat Mediterranean-style,\u201d explains Dr Brendon Stubbs, a clinical lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry at King\u2019s College London. \u201cHalf of the 67 participants switched to this diet, alongside their regular treatment [of psychotherapy, antidepressants or both] while the other half continued with their normal diet and antidepressant treatment. At the end of 12 weeks, those who\u2019d switched their diets had a bigger reduction in depression symptoms.\u201d The experts\u2019 guide to\u2026 boosting your body Be kind to yourself Helen West is one of the dieticians behind The Rooted Project, a website that aims to dispel myths around food and nutrition. She recommends focusing on the positive steps taken, and not on the things we want to change. \u201cWeight is not a behaviour \u2013 so it\u2019s counterproductive to focus on it. Focus on actionable things, like eating more fruits and vegetables, finding a way to sneak more movement into your days, and trying to get more sleep.\u201d Try HIIT As we get older, our cells\u2019 ability to create energy declines. However, a study by doctors at the Mayo Clinic (a US-based medical centre) involving 72 participants across two age groups, found that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) not only halted but reversed this trend, boosting cells\u2019 ability to generate energy by 69% in those between 65 and 80 years of age, and by 49% in younger individuals (18-30 years). You could start by alternating three minutes of fast walking and three minutes of slow walking for 30 minutes or more, four times a week. Make time for recovery If you do decide to start a new, intensive gym regime, remember the importance of recovery. \u201cOvertraining can cause inflammation, which has been linked to everything from cancer to depression,\u201d says The Foundry\u2019s Dave Thomas. He advises wearing a tracker such as a Fitbit when you sleep, to work out your average resting heart rate. \u201cIf, the morning after you\u2019ve trained, your resting heart rate is noticeably above normal \u2013 by 10-15bpm or more \u2013 it means you haven\u2019t yet recovered and shouldn\u2019t train that day.\u201d Move like a centenarian Turns out, though, that the secret to long life might not be down to how much you exercise, but to how much you move. In his study of what he called the world\u2019s Blue Zones (areas such as Ikaria in Greece where inhabitants regularly live past 100), writer Dan Buettner found that those who were healthiest in old age \u201clive in environments that nudge them into moving every 20 minutes or so\u201d. Walking, gardening or even just getting up at regular intervals were enough to keep Blue Zone-dwellers healthy throughout their lives. According to researchers at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, low- to moderate-intensity movement spread throughout the day is associated with significantly improved insulin levels, compared with doing just an hour of intense exercise. Hack your circadian rhythm \u201cThere are some fairly basic steps you can take to make sure that you\u2019re not delaying the production of melatonin \u2013 the hormone that makes us sleep,\u201d says Dr Mithu Storoni, author of Stress Proof. \u201cHaving a big breakfast and an early, light dinner can help you sleep better, because food and digestion delays the onset of melatonin.\u201d Equally, exercising in the morning rather than the evening, and making sure that your bedroom is between 18 and 21C will mean you\u2019re more likely to drift off \u2013 warmer temperatures may disrupt our ability to fall into an REM sleep. Cut down your eating hours Restricting meals to an eight-hour period (and having 16 hours of \u201cfasting\u201d) will help lower insulin levels and cause your body to start burning its fat stores. \u201cThis whole process is excellent news for brain health,\u201d explains dementia specialist Dr Jamie Wilson. \u201cReducing insulin levels can have an impact on your generation of amyloid beta, one of the harmful proteins that have been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s. 10am to 6pm are the usual hours, but it\u2019s flexible.\u201d Add ferments to every meal A healthy and diverse microbiome (the ecosystem of bacteria in our intestinal tract) is thought to improve our immune system and guard against everything from heart disease to depression. \u201cAdding probiotic foods such as natural yoghurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir and miso to every meal has been shown to increase the diversity of our gut bacteria,\u201d says Storoni. \u201cAnd, according to a meta-analysis of data published last year, this not only helps with general wellbeing, but also reduces feelings of anxiety.\u201d The experts\u2019 guide to\u2026 nourishing your soul Experience something awesome In his studies into the impact of psychedelics on patients with depression, Dr Robin Carhart-Harris of Imperial College London noticed an interesting phenomenon. \u201cAfter the treatment, people became more appreciative of nature and reported feeling more \u2018connected\u2019. They no longer felt isolated.\u201d If half a tab of acid all seems a little too 1969, Carhart-Harris argues that just experiencing awe could have a similar effect \u2013 \u201cby challenging our self-involved viewpoints and giving us a sense of perspective on our problems\u201d. One way to do this is to write the story of a time you felt in awe of nature \u2013 according to a study at Stanford University Graduate School of Business, this quick task increased participants\u2019 sense of wellbeing, as well as their willingness to give to charity; it even made them feel like they had fewer time pressures. The key is to understand yourself as a small part of a vast, living system \u2013 for that, nothing beats being outside in nature. A day trip to a forest, or an evening gazing at the vast night sky at a local observatory may be more effective than an indoor writing task. Be grateful The words \u201cgratitude journal\u201d may make you cringe, but regularly writing a list of things you\u2019re grateful for has, in one randomised control trial , been shown to foster a deep and lasting sense of contentment. \u201cThe act of writing with a pen seems to be important,\u201d says Dr Aria. \u201cBut this weekly 20-minute task saw participants\u2019 moods improve.\u201d In fact, eliciting the emotion of gratitude, even just once a week, led to a 28% reduction in perceived stress. Each entry should be specific \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m grateful that my partner brought me tea in bed this morning,\u201d rather than \u201cI\u2019m grateful for my partner\u201d \u2013 and you should reflect on what it was about that moment that made you feel particularly good. During the task, participants reported falling asleep more easily and sleeping, on average, for 30 minutes longer each night. Join a tennis club According to a study of more than 800 people (who were followed for the first six years after they retired by researchers at the University of Queensland), being a member of a club (of any kind) is associated with an increase in reported quality of life. Another study, by US researchers, who followed more than 8,000 people in Denmark for a period of 25 years, found that being a member of a tennis club was particularly beneficial; it conferred almost an extra 10 years of life, compared with people who did not exercise (in comparison, indoor exercises like running on a treadmill conferred only one and a half extra years). The difference, the researchers theorised, was the element of \u201cplay\u201d. Find your meaning A sense of purpose, a passion or a thing, person or place that gives our life meaning has been shown to help guard against a number of health conditions. One wide-ranging Japanese study followed 3,000 people for an average of 13 years and found that men who reported having a greater sense of purpose were significantly less likely to die of a stroke or cardiovascular disease. One study asked participants to spend a week taking photographs of all the most meaningful things, places and people in their lives. At the end of the week, they compiled all the photographs, and reflected on them. The result was that each participant had a stronger idea of their life\u2019s purpose and reported a greater feeling of meaning and contentment. \u2022 If you would like to make a comment on this piece, and be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

To be honest, it doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019ll never know as much about the glorious pop staple that is a good girl band as Peter Loraine. Remember Sporty, Posh, Baby, Ginger and Scary? Loraine helped create those iconic nicknames as editor of Top of the Pops magazine in 1996. Then, once he\u2019d finished accidentally branding one of pop\u2019s biggest phenomenons, he helped create Girls Aloud, working with them from Popstars: The Rivals in 2002 to that fateful breakup tweet in 2013. He also auditioned and later managed the Saturdays, before working on the recent All Saints and Bananarama reunions. He currently manages new girl band, Four of Diamonds.</p> <p>So who better to ask for advice about what makes the perfect girl band than a man who has dedicated his life to them? Here\u2019s Peter Loraine\u2019s five-point guide to pop perfection \u2026</p> <p><strong>1. You need a gobby one<br></strong>\u201cYou need a mouth, as in a ringleader, a spokesperson, somebody who\u2019s happy to say: \u2018Shut the fuck up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/15/lily-allen-brazen-behaviour-didnt-care-sophie-heawood\">Lily Allen.</a>\u2019 Good humour. Really important not to take yourselves too seriously, especially in a world of social media because it really doesn\u2019t matter who you are or what you do, there\u2019s always a handful of people that are haters. So you\u2019ve got to have a thick skin and ideally have a laugh at the comments if you can. I think where it\u2019s particularly successful is if they have an idea in their own heads of how\u2019d they like to be perceived and how they\u2019d like to look, because when it comes from them it makes a difference. People can tell.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Not everyone has to sing like Mariah<br></strong>\u201cThe voices need to work together and sound unique. By that, I mean, you knew when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/09/nadine-coyle-girls-aloud-xenomania-solo-artist\" title=\"\">Nadine</a> [Coyle, Girls Aloud] sang. You knew when Keisha and Mutya [from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/16/fashion.shopping\">Sugababes</a>] sang together. These days, you have to sing live on stuff; you can\u2019t go on TV and mime. You have to be able to say yes if you\u2019re lucky enough to get the phone call from Radio 1 to say they want you in the Live Lounge, or All Saints going on Jools Holland. You can\u2019t fake it now; you could, but you can\u2019t now. That\u2019s not to say that they all have to be Mariah Carey. You need voices that blend together and if there\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t sing the lead but can bring a specific tone then that can be really important as well.\u201d</p> <p><strong>3. Get a good stylist, please<br></strong>\u201cA bad stylist can kill it. You\u2019d never get away with a Spice Girls thing now because no one would believe it. If you\u2019ve got one that likes to dress really girly, and another who only wears jeans and tracksuit tops, that\u2019s just going to look like a mess now. But you don\u2019t want them all to look the same either because then it looks manufactured. It\u2019s about how you can take what\u2019s in the individual girls\u2019 heads, find a continuity, but then make it more than what you could buy if you just went into River Island.\u201d</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>You need chemistry, not competition winners<br></strong>\u201cChemistry is so important. I use this analogy often: if you have a day job and you work in Marks &amp; Spencer, you don\u2019t get to choose who you work with, but you can take it or leave it. There will be some people you like and some you don\u2019t like. For a band that have been auditioned and put together, like Girls Aloud were, the chances of finding girls that are all going to get on to the point where they can spend 24 hours a day with each other for years is rare. There have been cases where it\u2019s like: \u2018She\u2019s amazing, but this group won\u2019t see it past the end of year one if we put her in because she will cause so much trouble with the others.\u2019 We\u2019ve had to say no before, because we couldn\u2019t risk it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKInGw6K-4M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pKInGw6K-4M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Spice Girls were auditioned and lived together and very cleverly hand-picked, and by the time they were presented to the world they had bonded and very fortunately it did work for them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/24/all-saints-on-how-to-be-a-girl-group\" title=\"\">All Saints</a> is more of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/24/people-wet-knickers-bananarama-80s-trio-return\" title=\"\">Bananarama</a> template of \u2018me and my mates are going to form a group\u2019. With Four of Diamonds, they\u2019ve lived together for two years and we\u2019ve struck gold because they\u2019ve formed a really strong bond together, because had they not got on we\u2019d have been screwed. The investment [in girl bands] is so massive financially and it takes years before you make it back so you can\u2019t have a situation where they self-combust after 18 months. Fifth Harmony: awesome songs, bad personnel. They\u2019re a good example of how, if you don\u2019t get the right people and they don\u2019t get on, it\u2019s just a massive waste of money and time. They looked like competition winners. All those photos of them on red carpets glaring at each other like they hated each other. Them being interviewed saying the thing they\u2019re most excited about doing is going solo. An absolute car crash.\u201d</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>You need a properly amazing tune<br></strong>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a good song you get the opportunity for the rest to cut through. There\u2019s so much music out there now, but there are fewer TV shows, fewer pop mags, it\u2019s harder to get radio\u2019s attention. The volume of what is out there is colossal so it\u2019s about making an impact with the song and then it\u2019s: \u2018Hey, they look great\u2019; and, \u2018Hey, I read a bit about them and they\u2019re really interesting.\u2019 It\u2019s not about selling 10,000 singles in the shops and getting in the charts and then getting on the telly. If we were to release a new song with the Saturdays now it would be weird because everything\u2019s changed. There\u2019s no six-week lead-in times. Now, you start putting a song up on streaming and then you take it from there.\u201d</p> <p><em>Four of Diamonds\u2019 new single Blind is out now</em></p>",

I use this analogy often: if you have a day job and you work in Marks &amp; Spencer, you don\u2019t get to choose who you work with, but you can take it or leave it. There will be some people you like and some you don\u2019t like. For a band that have been auditioned and put together, like Girls Aloud were, the chances of finding girls that are all going to get on to the point where they can spend 24 hours a day with each other for years is rare. There have been cases where it\u2019s like: \u2018She\u2019s amazing, but this group won\u2019t see it past the end of year one if we put her in because she will cause so much trouble with the others.\u2019 We\u2019ve had to say no before, because we couldn\u2019t risk it. The Spice Girls were auditioned and lived together and very cleverly hand-picked, and by the time they were presented to the world they had bonded and very fortunately it did work for them. All Saints is more of a Bananarama template of \u2018me and my mates are going to form a group\u2019. With Four of Diamonds, they\u2019ve lived together for two years and we\u2019ve struck gold because they\u2019ve formed a really strong bond together, because had they not got on we\u2019d have been screwed. The investment [in girl bands] is so massive financially and it takes years before you make it back so you can\u2019t have a situation where they self-combust after 18 months. Fifth Harmony: awesome songs, bad personnel. They\u2019re a good example of how, if you don\u2019t get the right people and they don\u2019t get on, it\u2019s just a massive waste of money and time. They looked like competition winners. All those photos of them on red carpets glaring at each other like they hated each other. Them being interviewed saying the thing they\u2019re most excited about doing is going solo. An absolute car crash.\u201d 5. You need a properly amazing tune \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a good song you get the opportunity for the rest to cut through. There\u2019s so much music out there now, but there are fewer TV shows, fewer pop mags, it\u2019s harder to get radio\u2019s attention. The volume of what is out there is colossal so it\u2019s about making an impact with the song and then it\u2019s: \u2018Hey, they look great\u2019; and, \u2018Hey, I read a bit about them and they\u2019re really interesting.\u2019 It\u2019s not about selling 10,000 singles in the shops and getting in the charts and then getting on the telly. If we were to release a new song with the Saturdays now it would be weird because everything\u2019s changed. There\u2019s no six-week lead-in times. Now, you start putting a song up on streaming and then you take it from there.\u201d Four of Diamonds\u2019 new single Blind is out now",

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>You never know what you\u2019re going to be faced with each day when you work in pest control for a local authority. This week starts with a visit to a house where the occupants have seen and taken a photo of a rat climbing a tree and feeding from a fat ball meant for birds. I tell them it was probably because they were leaving too much food out and that they should stop. I put down some poison and arrange to return next week.</p> <p>Next up is a visit to a theatre, where a dead pigeon is squashed in the doors. I dissect it and remove it using shears and a sharp blade before I put it in a bag to make sure it\u2019s disposed of correctly because pigeons can carry disease. </p> <p>Nowadays, with climate change and people travelling further, bedbugs have become more prolific and I can do two or three callouts a week. We\u2019re always concerned we\u2019ll spread them but we\u2019re vigilant with protective clothing. Sometimes I strip off in the backyard when I get home \u2013 they can hide anywhere. I make a return visit to a house where the owner had complained of an infestation. To their delight I find the bedbugs have gone.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>Today, rat jobs come in thick and fast. There are issues year-round. It can be very emotional because people don\u2019t want to live in their property if there are rats. It can be resolved simply if people call us in time. Some people leave it and try to get rid of them themselves, but others hear a noise and call us straightaway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b8b6647bdf0a01ac50409c6b69cf6a97fe70899\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b8b6647bdf0a01ac50409c6b69cf6a97fe70899/0_3_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shane Roxby works in pest control for Durham county council\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When we visit places that have a pest control problems, we\u2019re seen as saviours.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Durham county council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>I visit a company that has done its own pigeon proofing work, which is amateurish. Pigeons are getting trapped and it is a risk to the business. We remove the netting and put in some spikes, which doesn\u2019t kill anything but stops birds from landing. We do a full assessment to make sure any protected species, such as buzzards and kites, won\u2019t be harmed. We\u2019re proud that we\u2019re wildlife accredited and put a lot of time and money into it.</p> <p>I also visit a home where the discovery of a wasps\u2019 nest has stopped a workman in his tracks while he was tiling the roof. I spray the nest with an insecticide, which allows the tiler to get back to work within an hour.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>Staff from a residential care home have discovered a hole chewed in a door frame. I think it\u2019s probably the work of a mouse attracted by bird feeders in the garden. When we visit places with a pest control problem, we\u2019re seen as saviours because people are so desperate and need help. We get letters and emails of thanks. It\u2019s an interesting job because you meet a broad variety of people. I\u2019ve met people who have fought in wars. I remember one Polish man telling us about rats climbing from the ships when he was in the merchant navy.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>You\u2019ve got to have a hardy stomach for this job and I am reminded of that today. We drop in at a conference centre to proof some air conditioning units to stop rats getting inside. While we\u2019re there, some staff tell us maggots are dropping from the ceiling in the ladies toilet. We investigate and find them all over the carpets in every room. We get harnessed up and go onto the roof voids. We find seven bird carcasses in the guttering, from which maggots are crawling. We get rid of them, much to the relief of everybody involved.</p> <p><em>If you would like to contribute to our My working week series about your job in public services, get in touch by emailing <a href=\"mailto:sarah.johnson@theguardian.com\">sarah.johnson@theguardian.com</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Monday You never know what you\u2019re going to be faced with each day when you work in pest control for a local authority. This week starts with a visit to a house where the occupants have seen and taken a photo of a rat climbing a tree and feeding from a fat ball meant for birds. I tell them it was probably because they were leaving too much food out and that they should stop. I put down some poison and arrange to return next week. Next up is a visit to a theatre, where a dead pigeon is squashed in the doors. I dissect it and remove it using shears and a sharp blade before I put it in a bag to make sure it\u2019s disposed of correctly because pigeons can carry disease. Nowadays, with climate change and people travelling further, bedbugs have become more prolific and I can do two or three callouts a week. We\u2019re always concerned we\u2019ll spread them but we\u2019re vigilant with protective clothing. Sometimes I strip off in the backyard when I get home \u2013 they can hide anywhere. I make a return visit to a house where the owner had complained of an infestation. To their delight I find the bedbugs have gone. Tuesday Today, rat jobs come in thick and fast. There are issues year-round. It can be very emotional because people don\u2019t want to live in their property if there are rats. It can be resolved simply if people call us in time. Some people leave it and try to get rid of them themselves, but others hear a noise and call us straightaway. Wednesday I visit a company that has done its own pigeon proofing work, which is amateurish. Pigeons are getting trapped and it is a risk to the business. We remove the netting and put in some spikes, which doesn\u2019t kill anything but stops birds from landing. We do a full assessment to make sure any protected species, such as buzzards and kites, won\u2019t be harmed. We\u2019re proud that we\u2019re wildlife accredited and put a lot of time and money into it. I also visit a home where the discovery of a wasps\u2019 nest has stopped a workman in his tracks while he was tiling the roof. I spray the nest with an insecticide, which allows the tiler to get back to work within an hour. Thursday Staff from a residential care home have discovered a hole chewed in a door frame. I think it\u2019s probably the work of a mouse attracted by bird feeders in the garden. When we visit places with a pest control problem, we\u2019re seen as saviours because people are so desperate and need help. We get letters and emails of thanks. It\u2019s an interesting job because you meet a broad variety of people. I\u2019ve met people who have fought in wars. I remember one Polish man telling us about rats climbing from the ships when he was in the merchant navy. Friday You\u2019ve got to have a hardy stomach for this job and I am reminded of that today. We drop in at a conference centre to proof some air conditioning units to stop rats getting inside. While we\u2019re there, some staff tell us maggots are dropping from the ceiling in the ladies toilet. We investigate and find them all over the carpets in every room. We get harnessed up and go onto the roof voids. We find seven bird carcasses in the guttering, from which maggots are crawling. We get rid of them, much to the relief of everybody involved.

That\u2019s where policies dreamed up in Whitehall hit millions of people\u2019s real lives, and elections and referendums are fought and won (or lost).</p> <p>The referendum campaign made that point on a seismic scale, with the result confounding the commentariat and chucking out a prime minister who had won a majority a year earlier. And the 2017 general election, too, went against the grain of Westminster wisdom.</p> <p>And as a team, we still try to escape the daily diet of parliamentary drama when we can \u2013 most recently, for me, to Labour MP Gloria De Piero\u2019s constituency of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/09/deeply-divided-brexit-ashfield-residents-voice-their-differences\">Ashfield in Nottinghamshire</a>, and for my colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/06/remain-tory-mp-brexit-clacton-deal\">Peter Walker, to the Clacton, Essex</a>, seat held by the Conservative MP Giles Watling. Both of us received a salutary reminder that Theresa May is regarded with considerably more warmth by voters than many of her own MPs.</p> <p>Yet the nature of the Brexit negotiations, against the backdrop of a divided cabinet and a hung parliament, has made Westminster politics, in the narrow sense of who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down, and what alliances are being struck, arguably more important in shaping Britain\u2019s future than for decades.</p> <p>That means plenty of time spent listening to MPs and trying to understand their concerns, their motivations and their breaking points \u2013 and thinking through countless possible permutations for the coming crucial weeks.</p> <p>A healthy knowledge of parliamentary procedure has proved essential, for which we all rely on the fount of wisdom and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewsparrow\">liveblog doyen Andy Sparrow</a>.

And it forces Downing Street to be ready to explain the government\u2019s policy, on any conceivable subject, twice a day, every day. As well as lobby briefings, a parliamentary pass brings with it the privilege (though it doesn\u2019t always feel like it) of being able to sit in the press gallery, high up above the green benches in the House of Commons, and watch MPs debate questions great and small. What always strikes you most \u2013 particularly at the weekly prime minister\u2019s questions session \u2013 is the sheer volume. MPs speaking from the dispatch box confront a wall of noise \u2013 not to mention the derisive hand gestures and relentless under-the-breath barracking, much of which goes undetected by the TV cameras. There\u2019s an extraordinary repertoire of verbal responses I\u2019ve never heard anywhere else \u2013 the exultant \u201cMore!\u201d as MPs cheer on their leader, the fruity \u201cAaah!\u201d that translates as something like \u201cgotcha\u201d, and the sonorous Jim-Hacker-does-Churchill inflections that colour the speech of the most level-headed MPs when matters of national security are at stake. It\u2019s intense, emotionally charged theatre \u2013 and at times, it\u2019s plain silly. But when every vote counts, as it has done at key moments in the Brexit process, it has a hard edge. When I came to the job in early 2016 \u2013 then with my much-missed jobshare partner and now Guardian podcast heroine Anushka Asthana \u2013 we were keen to highlight the fact that most politics happens far away from Westminster. That\u2019s where policies dreamed up in Whitehall hit millions of people\u2019s real lives, and elections and referendums are fought and won (or lost). The referendum campaign made that point on a seismic scale, with the result confounding the commentariat and chucking out a prime minister who had won a majority a year earlier. And the 2017 general election, too, went against the grain of Westminster wisdom. And as a team, we still try to escape the daily diet of parliamentary drama when we can \u2013 most recently, for me, to Labour MP Gloria De Piero\u2019s constituency of Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, and for my colleague Peter Walker, to the Clacton, Essex, seat held by the Conservative MP Giles Watling. Both of us received a salutary reminder that Theresa May is regarded with considerably more warmth by voters than many of her own MPs. Yet the nature of the Brexit negotiations, against the backdrop of a divided cabinet and a hung parliament, has made Westminster politics, in the narrow sense of who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down, and what alliances are being struck, arguably more important in shaping Britain\u2019s future than for decades. That means plenty of time spent listening to MPs and trying to understand their concerns, their motivations and their breaking points \u2013 and thinking through countless possible permutations for the coming crucial weeks. A healthy knowledge of parliamentary procedure has proved essential, for which we all rely on the fount of wisdom and liveblog doyen Andy Sparrow. Goodness knows, so has humour, brought by the inestimable John Crace, who is just as funny in the office as on the page. And, of course, even in the thick of it all, family. The day after the confidence vote in Theresa May, the result of which was not announced until 9pm, the indefatigable Dan Sabbagh jumped on the Eurostar to the European council in Brussels bright and early \u2013 and I went off to see my son\u2019s school nativity play. He played a cow, in case you were wondering.",

Blair Cottrell and Neil Erikson, the organisers of the far-right rally, said they had called it in order to \u201cdiscuss\u201d Melbourne\u2019s youth crime and alleged African gang problems. \u201cOur country is under attack,\u201d Cottrell said over a megaphone. \u201cAfricans are 77 times more likely to commit home invasion. That\u2019s not racism, that\u2019s a fact!\u201d Independent senator Fraser Anning flew down from Queensland to attend the event and Erikson thanked him for his presence. \u201cThe leftwing media likes to hang tags on us like neo-nazis, racists and facists, they are just ordinary hard working Australians who pay their taxes,\u201d Anning told reporters. \u201cAustralia has had enough. I think this is the start of something bigger. The revolution will eventually start. People have had enough of these people and they have got to be sent back to where they came from.\u201d In August, Anning\u2019s \u201cfinal solution\u201d speech to parliament attracted condemnation from all sides of politics. Some rightwing protesters wore Australian and Eureka flags as capes around their necks and chanted \u201cAussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oi, Oi, Oi\u201d, and \u201crise without fear.\u201d Counter-protesters shouted \u201cnazi scum not welcome here\u201d. A man in a ute equipped with speakers and a megaphone drove down the Esplanade in St Kilda chanting \u201cSudanese are welcome, racists are not\u201d. Rightwing protesters surrounded his vehicle, broke the speakers and ran off with the generator. Later the two protest groups and police lines left the foreshore area and spilled out onto the road and walked towards the Luna Park. In one heated confrontation a rightwing protester broke through police lines and tried to grab a banner from three anti-racism campaigners. Police sprayed capsicum spray and used rubber pellets before arresting the rightwing protester. Paramedics were helping to treat two women who were sprayed in the eyes. The Guardian Australia saw at least six people being led away by police. An 18-year-old man was arrested on the beach after being found with a \u201cdangerous article\u201d at about 12.20pm, police said. \u201cVictoria Police respects people\u2019s right to protest peacefully, but will not tolerate those who break the law.\u201d Police superintendent Tony Silva said there had been three arrests, including one for breach of bail. He said a number of others had been briefly detained and then released, adding that he hoped the public felt reassured police had the situation under control. One local resident, who gave her name as Janet, said the protests did not represent St Kilda. \u201cPeople should just calm down,\u201d she said. Grandmother Kimberley Neave from Inverloch said she had come to the rightwing rally because she was upset with the direction of the country and the amount of immigration. Earlier, Greek migrant Vas Karakassidis told the anti-racism rally that she knew what it was like to grow up feeling like you don\u2019t belong. \u201cThis beach always welcomed everyone,\u201d she said. The far-right rally was condemned by the Australian human rights commissioner, Chin Tan, who said there was no place in the country for such rallies. Cottrell and Erikson were convicted and fined by magistrates in 2017 for inciting contempt and ridicule of Muslims by making a video in which they beheaded a dummy with a toy sword in a protest against the building of the Bendigo mosque. Cottrell has appealed the conviction. The pair claim their rally was a response to recent incidents in which youths have mugged people in the Port Phillip Bay area. Erikson also last week confronted a group of young men of African background who were playing soccer at St Kilda, prompting police intervention. St Kilda and nearby Caulfield, areas with high Jewish populations, have also experienced a blitz of anti-semitic vandalism. With additional reporting from Australian Associated Press.",

      "body": "<p>It is traditional in January for newspapers to run articles about diet and health, so I thought I would write about the healthy subject of physical exercise and my long-running unhealthy relationship with it. There are two ways to be unhealthy about exercise: you can avoid it, or you can be obsessive about it. And because I\u2019m the kind of person who likes to do things properly, in my life I\u2019ve covered both bases.</p> <p>As a kid, I loathed PE, and I used to tell myself that was because I simply didn\u2019t enjoy it. In reality, it was because I wasn\u2019t good at it and, as a precocious perfectionist, if I couldn\u2019t do something well, I simply wouldn\u2019t do it. Some of my most vivid memories from school involve PE teachers singling me out and making me run/hit a ball/jump to show the rest of the class how not to do it.</p> <p>I was the \u201cbefore\u201d photo of PE, while my athletic best friend was invariably the \u201cafter\u201d. Thus began the long years of increasingly elaborate lies (\u201cA lot of 11-year-olds get three periods a month\u201d) in order to avoid exercise. Then I turned 13 and suddenly became obsessed with being skinny. Exercise no longer seemed a problem but a solution to a problem that didn\u2019t actually exist. I went to aerobics classes at the gym on our local high street, where I was about a third of the age of everyone else; I sometimes wonder if any of them thought it odd that a little girl who didn\u2019t even need a bra was in a bums, tums and thighs class. Daily, I would do hundreds of sit-ups and star jumps in my room, making the whole house shake with my newfound athleticism, high on the idea of how many calories I was burning. This went on for years, and I guess you could say I was finally getting something out of exercise, though I wouldn\u2019t describe it as beneficial.</p> <p>When I finally shook that in my early 20s, I reverted to my default position of avoiding exercise in the (not unreasonable) belief that a recovering anorexic couldn\u2019t be trusted with it, any more than an alcoholic should sniff a bottle of whisky. But the real problem was I had never learned to think of exercise as something one might do simply because it\u2019s fun: either it had to be for an end goal (being thin), or you had to be good at it. If you\u2019re bad at something, it couldn\u2019t ever be enjoyable, right? But at some point in my mid-20s I realised that I needed to do something other than sit in a chair all day, so I asked a friend for advice. \u201cHave you tried yoga?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>In the US and UK, yoga has an extremely annoying image \u2013 one of thin women with long, lean limbs, who subsist on seaweed salad and oat milk. It\u2019s exercise for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/27/gwyneth-paltrow-goop\" title=\"\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> wannabes. And precisely because of that image, I signed up immediately, because while I was no longer doing sit-ups in my bedroom, some deluded fantasies take longer to die and mental illness is tenacious.</p> <p>So I went to my first yoga lesson and quickly realised that I did not have a natural gift for it. I despaired at my inflexibility, my wonkily-shaped feet, my terror of going upside down. I was easily the worst in the class. Even the overweight 60-year-old men who had come on doctor\u2019s orders were better than me.</p> <p>And yet I kept going, twice a week, every week. It would be a lie to claim there wasn\u2019t, initially, an obsessive element to this. But at a certain point I realised that, actually, yoga doesn\u2019t make you thin. Not even the dynamic classes I go to (because the slow classes literally send me to sleep). But yoga made me feel strong and flexible, two things I had never before felt in my life, physically or metaphorically. And so I continued to go.</p> <p>I\u2019ve now been doing yoga for, I think, 14 years and lest any images of me doing elegant backbends are dancing through your head, let me reassure you, I am still terrible. While everyone in my class is springing effortlessly into a handstand, I remain stubbornly grounded. But I don\u2019t care. My ludicrously patient teacher (namaste, Stewart Gilchrist at <a href=\"https://eastlondonschoolofyoga.com/\" title=\"\">East London School of Yoga</a>!) ensures I make just enough progress every week to stay excited (I can touch my toes! I\u2019m basically an Olympian!). He never singles me out as an example of how not to do something, even though I am, and he reassures me that just because something is hard it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do it. After all, he says, you learn how to do something only by making mistakes; no one is judging you but you. These are lessons that I have \u2013 as yoga teachers say \u2013 \u201ctaken off my mat\u201d and applied to my daily life.</p> <p>That I make time every week to do exercise that (a) won\u2019t make me thinner and (b) I\u2019m embarrassingly bad at, is as shocking to me as the fact I can now eat for pleasure. The two are linked, of course, and maybe I would have got here eventually anyway. But yoga helped me on my way. And for that reason I will always be grateful to it, Gwyneth schmyneth.</p>",

Diesel cars manufactured before 2015 are likely to fall foul of the rules, as well as most pre-2006 petrol cars. They will be charged \u00a312.50 to come into central London at any time, on top of the \u00a311.50 congestion charge, which operates from Monday to Friday 7am to 6pm.</p> <p>Then from October 2021 the zone will be hugely expanded, with mums and dads on the school run potentially affected, as 3.6 million London residents are brought into the scheme. Any cars failing to meet the standards by then will have to pay \u00a312.50 a day if they are driven anywhere in an area bounded by the city\u2019s north and south circular roads.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/05/londons-ultra-low-emission-zone-what-you-need-to-know\">London's ultra-low emission zone: what you need to know</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/12/archive-zip/giv-39025lQhEcujE5ag/\" data-alt=\"ULEZ map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/12/archive-zip/giv-39025lQhEcujE5ag/\">ULEZ map</a> </figure>  <p>Precisely how many drivers will be hit with the charge are unknown, as many are likely to sell older vehicles before 2021.

In 2020 <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/birminghams-new-clean-air-zone-14802158\" title=\"\">Birmingham is planning to introduce pollution charges</a> on cars driving within the city\u2019s ring road, with a \u00a36 to \u00a310 fee mooted. In Leeds there are radical plans to charge the most polluting vehicles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/09/drivers-faced-with-50-daily-charge-in-leeds-to-cut-air-pollution\" title=\"\">up to \u00a350 a day</a> to enter a new clean air zone from January 2020.

At least 360 primary schools in the capital are in areas exceeding safe legal pollution levels, half of which comes from cars, lorries and buses.</p> <p>TfL expects that after just the first year of the ULEZ, harmful nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in central London will reduce by 45%, and 40% in the surrounding areas. It says: \u201cThe expansion of the ULEZ to the north and south circulars will deliver a further 20% reduction across London. This is the next step in the mayor of London\u2019s ultimate goal of creating a zero emissions from road transport by 2050.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0fbce33b4a3c7fc8b09e582c4f4f66ba32b822d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0fbce33b4a3c7fc8b09e582c4f4f66ba32b822d/0_0_1904_1142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black cab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black cabs \u2013 even older models \u2013 will escape the new emissions charge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Brooker/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But expansion of the zone to cover far greater parts of London, and the speed of its implementation, has provoked a fierce backlash from some. An analysis of submissions to the <a href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/environment/air-quality-consultation-phase-3b/user_uploads/ulez-consultation-report-to-the-mayor.pdf\" title=\"\">consultation document</a> found that 56% either supported or strongly supported the expansion of the ULEZ, but 40% were opposed or strongly opposed.</p> <p>Thousands signed an open letter from the Healthy Air campaign, which said: \u201cI strongly welcome the mayor\u2019s commitment to tackling London\u2019s illegal and harmful levels of air pollution. Road transport is a major source of air pollution and we need urgent action to tackle this.\u201d</p> <p>Friends of the Earth went further, calling for a bigger ULEZ, and sooner. It said: \u201cThe ULEZ must come into force much sooner than planned \u2013 by the end of 2018 at the latest. Londoners shouldn\u2019t have to wait until 2021 for cleaner air. The zone must cover the whole of London to make a difference, extending beyond the north and south circular roads and including all of outer London too.\u201d</p> <p>But there are numerous opponents, such as the Alliance of British Drivers and motorbike groups \u2013 and even the Musician\u2019s Union. The Motorcycle Action Group said: \u201cWill the mayor compensate the thousands of low-paid workers using small, older motorbikes because it\u2019s all they can afford, and what scheme will he be setting up to pay the difference in cost between cheap, older bikes and expensive public transport?\u201d</p> <p>How will motorists in London react? Many will only be waking up to the charges just weeks before they come into force.</p> <p>Guardian journalist Graham Snowdon, who lives in Herne Hill, south London, and was driving a 2006 Ford Focus 1.8 diesel, says that he has been forced to buy a new car as a result of the ULEZ changes. \u201cI drive into what\u2019s currently the congestion charge zone once a week to play football. But it\u2019s in the evening, and I don\u2019t have to pay. The first I knew about ULEZ was an email I got from TfL. I knew it was expanding, but I didn\u2019t know what it entailed. It was going to cost me \u00a312.50 a week from this April \u2013 and then \u00a312.50 every day from 2021, so I had to get rid of the car.</p> <p>\u201cBut I suppose that I\u2019m not that annoyed; NOx emissions are really dangerous, and it\u2019s good in a way that I\u2019ve been forced to do this. The Ford Focus could probably have done another 50,000 miles or so. Instead, I\u2019ve paid \u00a38,000 for a second-hand 2014 Ford Focus 1.0 Ecoboost, and the bonus is that my car tax will now only be \u00a330 a year. I thought I better buy a new car now, ahead of April. When other people wake up to this, I think it\u2019s going to have quite an impact on the second-hand car market.\u201d</p>",

Many motorists are unaware of how strict \u2013 and expensive \u2013 the new rules are for the ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ), which starts on 8 April this year. Diesel cars manufactured before 2015 are likely to fall foul of the rules, as well as most pre-2006 petrol cars. They will be charged \u00a312.50 to come into central London at any time, on top of the \u00a311.50 congestion charge, which operates from Monday to Friday 7am to 6pm. Then from October 2021 the zone will be hugely expanded, with mums and dads on the school run potentially affected, as 3.6 million London residents are brought into the scheme. Any cars failing to meet the standards by then will have to pay \u00a312.50 a day if they are driven anywhere in an area bounded by the city\u2019s north and south circular roads. Precisely how many drivers will be hit with the charge are unknown, as many are likely to sell older vehicles before 2021. Transport for London says there are about 1.15m vehicles currently registered in the expanded ULEZ. It says: \u201cWhen the zone expands to the north and south circular in 2021 we estimate that 80% of car kilometres driven within the zone, on an average day, would be by cars that already meet the ULEZ standard.\u201d It adds that 90% of motorcycles are likely to be compliant by 2021. But that still leaves at least 100,000 cars or more paying the charge \u2013 which critics are calling a new \u201cpoll tax\u201d on Londoners that they claim will rake in as much as \u00a3750m to \u00a31.5bn from hard-pressed motorists. But TfL says the expected impact will be much less \u2013 it projects that in 2019-20, the first year of the ULEZ, revenue will be \u00a3174m and costs \u00a347m, producing a surplus of \u00a3127m. In 2021, when the greatly expanded zone comes into force, TfL is projecting annual revenue to jump to \u00a3222m, but costs will also rise as a new generation of enforcement cameras are installed. It estimates costs in 2021-22 will be \u00a3125m, so the surplus will fall to \u00a397m. The battle to bring healthy air to city residents is not just in London. In 2020 Birmingham is planning to introduce pollution charges on cars driving within the city\u2019s ring road, with a \u00a36 to \u00a310 fee mooted. In Leeds there are radical plans to charge the most polluting vehicles up to \u00a350 a day to enter a new clean air zone from January 2020. Meanwhile, Bath has plans to charge many motorists \u00a39 a day to drive into its Georgian streets, but the proposals have provoked anger and resentment. The idea behind London\u2019s ULEZ is a determination to clean up the city\u2019s filthy air \u2013 widely regarded as the dirtiest of any major city in Europe. At least 360 primary schools in the capital are in areas exceeding safe legal pollution levels, half of which comes from cars, lorries and buses. TfL expects that after just the first year of the ULEZ, harmful nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in central London will reduce by 45%, and 40% in the surrounding areas. It says: \u201cThe expansion of the ULEZ to the north and south circulars will deliver a further 20% reduction across London. This is the next step in the mayor of London\u2019s ultimate goal of creating a zero emissions from road transport by 2050.\u201d But expansion of the zone to cover far greater parts of London, and the speed of its implementation, has provoked a fierce backlash from some. An analysis of submissions to the consultation document found that 56% either supported or strongly supported the expansion of the ULEZ, but 40% were opposed or strongly opposed. Thousands signed an open letter from the Healthy Air campaign, which said: \u201cI strongly welcome the mayor\u2019s commitment to tackling London\u2019s illegal and harmful levels of air pollution. Road transport is a major source of air pollution and we need urgent action to tackle this.\u201d Friends of the Earth went further, calling for a bigger ULEZ, and sooner. It said: \u201cThe ULEZ must come into force much sooner than planned \u2013 by the end of 2018 at the latest. Londoners shouldn\u2019t have to wait until 2021 for cleaner air. The zone must cover the whole of London to make a difference, extending beyond the north and south circular roads and including all of outer London too.\u201d But there are numerous opponents, such as the Alliance of British Drivers and motorbike groups \u2013 and even the Musician\u2019s Union. The Motorcycle Action Group said: \u201cWill the mayor compensate the thousands of low-paid workers using small, older motorbikes because it\u2019s all they can afford, and what scheme will he be setting up to pay the difference in cost between cheap, older bikes and expensive public transport?\u201d How will motorists in London react? Many will only be waking up to the charges just weeks before they come into force. Guardian journalist Graham Snowdon, who lives in Herne Hill, south London, and was driving a 2006 Ford Focus 1.8 diesel, says that he has been forced to buy a new car as a result of the ULEZ changes. \u201cI drive into what\u2019s currently the congestion charge zone once a week to play football. But it\u2019s in the evening, and I don\u2019t have to pay. The first I knew about ULEZ was an email I got from TfL. I knew it was expanding, but I didn\u2019t know what it entailed. It was going to cost me \u00a312.50 a week from this April \u2013 and then \u00a312.50 every day from 2021, so I had to get rid of the car. \u201cBut I suppose that I\u2019m not that annoyed; NOx emissions are really dangerous, and it\u2019s good in a way that I\u2019ve been forced to do this. The Ford Focus could probably have done another 50,000 miles or so. Instead, I\u2019ve paid \u00a38,000 for a second-hand 2014 Ford Focus 1.0 Ecoboost, and the bonus is that my car tax will now only be \u00a330 a year. I thought I better buy a new car now, ahead of April. When other people wake up to this, I think it\u2019s going to have quite an impact on the second-hand car market.\u201d",

However, if your situation is not so dire \u2013 perhaps your plastic took a pounding in the run-up to Christmas or you splurged in the sales \u2013 there are things you can do to get your finances on to a better footing. </p> <h2><strong>Cut your credit card costs</strong> <br></h2> <p>Many people with existing credit and store card debt could save hundreds of pounds or more by transferring these balances to another provider offering a better rate.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the start of the year is usually the most popular time for switching card balances. Last January was the busiest in 12 years, with \u00a31.63bn switched in 31 days, according to TotallyMoney.</p> <p>This is traditionally a very competitive market, although providers seem to be reining in their generosity a little. A year ago, you could get balance transfer deals offering 0% interest for up to 38 months, but the longest period available now is 33 months, says the financial research firm Defaqto.</p> <p>The main benefit of a 0% deal is that all of your monthly repayment goes towards clearing the outstanding balance, and therefore the debt can be cleared much more quickly \u2013 but you do need to be disciplined. Also be aware that there will often be a fee to pay, which is typically a small percentage of the amount of debt being moved over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12edbf8ceebc170b81c711dc053226e551744603\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12edbf8ceebc170b81c711dc053226e551744603/0_172_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Various credit cards and bank cards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">January is usually the most popular time for switching card balances.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>MBNA is offering 0% interest for 33 months on balance transfers, where the fee is 1.99% \u2013 that is, \u00a319.90 per \u00a31,000 transferred. Similarly, Post Office Money is offering 0% for up to 32 months, with a 2% fee.</p> <p>Not all deals involve paying a balance transfer fee.

      "bodyText": "Did you blow your budget in December? In a few days\u2019 time, the first set of post-Christmas credit card bills will land on doormats \u2013 and for many they will not make pleasant reading. The average Christmas credit card bill is estimated to be \u00a3323 which, when added to existing debt, means a typical Briton has started 2019 owing about \u00a3740 on their credit card, according to price comparison website MoneySuperMarket. If you are in serious financial difficulty, then seek free advice from an organisation such as National Debtline as soon as possible. However, if your situation is not so dire \u2013 perhaps your plastic took a pounding in the run-up to Christmas or you splurged in the sales \u2013 there are things you can do to get your finances on to a better footing. Cut your credit card costs Many people with existing credit and store card debt could save hundreds of pounds or more by transferring these balances to another provider offering a better rate. Not surprisingly, the start of the year is usually the most popular time for switching card balances. Last January was the busiest in 12 years, with \u00a31.63bn switched in 31 days, according to TotallyMoney. This is traditionally a very competitive market, although providers seem to be reining in their generosity a little. A year ago, you could get balance transfer deals offering 0% interest for up to 38 months, but the longest period available now is 33 months, says the financial research firm Defaqto. The main benefit of a 0% deal is that all of your monthly repayment goes towards clearing the outstanding balance, and therefore the debt can be cleared much more quickly \u2013 but you do need to be disciplined. Also be aware that there will often be a fee to pay, which is typically a small percentage of the amount of debt being moved over. MBNA is offering 0% interest for 33 months on balance transfers, where the fee is 1.99% \u2013 that is, \u00a319.90 per \u00a31,000 transferred. Similarly, Post Office Money is offering 0% for up to 32 months, with a 2% fee. Not all deals involve paying a balance transfer fee. For example, Santander has a card offering 0% for 27 months with no fee. If you take the average credit card debt of \u00a32,663, someone who transferred this to a 0% balance transfer card with an interest-free period of 27 months and then repaid \u00a3100 a month, so that their debt is paid off within the interest-free period, would typically save \u00a3880 in total, according to the website GoCompare. But woe betide you if you are late with a monthly payment or otherwise breach the terms of the deal. And not everyone who applies will be offered the advertised rate \u2013 some will be offered less favourable terms. Get a better overdraft deal If you are not getting a good deal, think about switching. Authorised overdraft costs vary hugely: some banks impose daily fees, some impose monthly charges, some charge interest, and some use a combination of these. The good news is that a radical shake-up of the way banks charge for overdrafts is on its way. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s plan is that the current plethora of fees and costs will be swept away and replaced by a simple, single interest rate. However, the new rules are not due to come into force until December. In the meantime, many banks have overdraft calculators on their websites, so log on and compare what you would be charged at other institutions. Take the example of a standard current account-holder who borrows \u00a3500 on an authorised overdraft over seven days. If they are a NatWest customer, they will be charged \u00a37.75 (\u00a36 monthly fee and \u00a31.75 interest). App-based bank Monzo will charge them \u00a33.50 (50p a day). Meanwhile, if they are a Barclays customer, it\u2019s \u00a35.25 (75p a day up to \u00a31,000). However, if they are a Nationwide customer and hold its FlexAccount, it will be a lot less: \u00a31.67 in interest. And a First Direct customer pays just 71p in interest. Debt consolidation can work \u2013 for some people If you are juggling various costly debts such as store card and credit card borrowing, you may be able to save money by consolidating them into one cheaper personal loan, where the monthly repayments remain unchanged and the debt is guaranteed to be gone by the end of the term. This is not an answer for everyone, but for some people it will work. There are best-buy personal loan deals available at less than 3% from the likes of M&amp;S Bank, Cahoot (a division of Santander), Clydesdale Bank and Zopa. However, only applicants with a clean credit record are likely to get these headline-grabbing rates.

      "bodyText": "All day it felt like the storm was closing in. A clear morning gave way to violent buffets of wind. The flags over the Members Pavilion stood out so stiff they could have been cardboard. The clouds overhead increased layer by layer, until the air itself grew so thick that you felt like dipping a slice of bread in it. All around Sydney, blotches of yellow and orange into deep dried-blood red clustered over the rain radar, from Hornsby to Mosman, over Homebush and Bankstown. Somehow for hours the Sydney Cricket Ground stayed safely in a decreasing dry centre. The morning sun had shone as blithely and brightly as Australia\u2019s hopes of offering meaningful resistance. As briefly, too. This struggling team hasn\u2019t won a lot of sessions this series. Adding 98 runs for the loss of only Usman Khawaja was a win. Marcus Harris was entertaining the crowd, and after a calendar year bereft of Test centuries, it looked like 2019 would start with one. At the other end was Marnus Labuschagne, the highly contentious newcomer to the side who was batting at first drop, producing a couple of classy shots and some solid defence. But this summer the clouds have never been far away. \u201cI thought this would be Australia\u2019s day with the bat,\u201d said former Australia batsman Ed Cowan alter on ABC radio. \u201cIt was the day when they could make the mental breakthrough.

      "body": "<p>The world was Kafkaesque before Franz Kafka; all he did was contribute the adjective. He was certainly not the first literary artist to identify the essential uncanniness of quotidian reality. From Catullus through Jonathan Swift and on to Heinrich von Kleist, ETA Hoffmann and Dostoevsky, the fictions we spin in order that life might be sustainable have been questioned, derided and upended, over and over. All the same, Kafka remains a special case. As George Steiner pointed out, no other great writer, not even Shakespeare, managed to arrogate to himself and make uniquely his own a letter of the alphabet. In the darker realm of literature, at least, K is king.</p> <p>The adjective \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/may/18/kafkaesque-a-word-so-overused-it-has-lost-all-meaning\" title=\"\">Kafkaesque</a>\u201d has, of course, become a cliche. Kafka\u2019s name, according to Philip Roth, \u201cis plastered indiscriminately on almost any baffling or unusually opaque event that is not easily translatable into the going simplifications\u201d. Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/15/franz-kafka-archive-public\" title=\"\">Max Brod</a>, his friend and the man we must thank for disregarding Kafka\u2019s specific, written instructions that all his unpublished work should be destroyed, protested against the \u201crepulsive expression \u2018Kafkaesque\u2019\u201d, adding that \u201cKafkaesque is that which Kafka was not!\u201d But neither was he what Brod claimed him to be, a \u201csaint of our time\u201d.</p> <p>And Theodor Adorno was right to insist that he was not \u201ca poet of the Judaic homeland\u201d. Indeed, one of the themes running throughout Benjamin Balint\u2019s fascinating and forensically scrupulous account of the history of Kafka\u2019s papers is the writer\u2019s deeply ambiguous relationship \u2013 if it can even be called that \u2013 with Israel, or, as it still was in his time, Palestine. While Brod, a typical Mitteleuropean man of letters, \u201ccame,\u201d according to the journalist and Zionist Robert Weltsch, \u201cto complete identification with the Jewish people\u201d, Kafka maintained a sceptical attitude on the \u201cJewish question\u201d, both in the personal and the public spheres. \u201cWhat have I in common with the Jews?\u201d he asks in his diary, adding with typically lugubrious humour, \u201cI have hardly anything in common with myself.\u201d</p> <p>It was not until he discovered what Balint describes as \u201can unlikely source of vitality\u201d in the performances of a Yiddish theatre troupe in Prague\u2019s Cafe Savoy that he began to appreciate his Jewish inheritance. \u201cThe caf\u00e9 was tawdry,\u201d Balint writes, \u201cits doorman a part-time pimp,\u201d yet the burlesque performances had the peculiar effect of making Kafka\u2019s \u201ccheeks tremble\u201d.</p> <p>Kafka filled more than a 100 pages of his diary, Balint tells us, with accounts of the Yiddish players and their plays. \u201cHe was impressed by their authenticity and \u2018vigour\u2019 (<em>Urw\u00fc</em><em>chsigkeit</em>), and by the ironic idiom itself \u2013 in which high and low, biblical and vernacular rattled against each other.\u201d Samuel Beckett must have undergone the same kind of Damascene moment when he first began to look seriously at the miniature tragicomic epics of Buster Keaton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"75e3248e036fb15581b33288d238e54beb656b90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75e3248e036fb15581b33288d238e54beb656b90/0_0_1936_2581/750.jpg\" alt=\"Entrusted his archive with instructions to destroy it \u2026 Franz Kafka in 1906.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Entrusted his archive with instructions to destroy it \u2026 Franz Kafka in 1906.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: History and Art Collection/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether his glimpse of a shared Jewish past turned Kafka into a \u201cJewish\u201d writer is doubtful. True, he did teach himself Hebrew, as his friend Georg Langer, a scholar of the Kabbalah, attested: \u201cHe, who always insisted that he was not a Zionist, learned our language at an advanced age and with great diligence.\u201d Yet as Kafka himself wrote not long before his death: \u201cWhat is Hebrew, but news from far away?\u201d As to Palestine itself, it seems to have been for Kafka not so much the promised as the improbable land. As he scathingly remarked: \u201cMany people prowl around Mt Sinai.\u201d Perhaps the matter is best expressed by the Swiss critic Jean Starobinski: \u201cIn the face of Judaism, Kafka is an exile, albeit one who ceaselessly asks for news of the land he has left.\u201d</p> <p>All these aspects of the extremely vexed Jewish question are pertinent to Balint\u2019s subject, which is the battle between Germany and Israel for possession of Kafka\u2019s literary remains, and the plight of the two women caught in the crossfire \u2013 although it must be acknowledged that Esther Hoffe and her daughter Eva exploded quite a few bombs themselves.</p> <p>The Israeli case was succinctly stated by Meir Heller, the hard-nosed lawyer who through eight years of intricate, sometimes bitter, and \u2013 yes, alas \u2013 Kafkaesque litigation represented the National Library of Israel: \u201cLike many other Jews who contributed to western civilisation, we think, his legacy ... [and] his manuscripts should be placed here in the Jewish state.\u201d</p> <p>The other interested party was the German Literature Archive at Marbach, under the direction of Ulrich Raulff, which, as Balint writes, \u201cwished to add Kafka\u2019s manuscripts to the estates of more than 1,400 writers \u2026 held in storage facilities kept at a constant 18C\u201319C (about 66F) and a relative humidity of 50 percent-55 percent\u201d. So far, so German; one of the less temperate comments came from the publisher and Kafka scholar Klaus Wagenbach: \u201cThe Israelis seem to have become crazed.\u201d</p> <p>The squabble \u2013 and it was a squabble, despite the many high-minded pronouncements that the affair called forth \u2013 centred not on Kafka himself, or his wishes as to the fate of his papers, running to tens of thousands of pages, but to the ambiguities of the will left behind by Brod, the original keeper of the archive. A tireless, prolific and for the most part mediocre writer and journalist, Brod was Kafka\u2019s closest friend and confidant, and regarded him with, as he confessed, \u201cfanatical veneration\u201d, finding even his chronic hypochondria \u201cinventive and entertaining\u201d.</p> <p>After the second world war, Brod settled in Palestine, not without doubts and difficulties, and with less of an enthusiastic reception than he might justifiably have expected. In Israel\u2019s defence, the new state was more in need of people of action than of another central European intellectual, even one carrying a bulging suitcase of papers left behind by one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, indeed of all the centuries.</p> <p>Kafka had entrusted his archive to Brod with instructions to destroy it, instructions that Brod insisted he assured Kafka he had no intention of carrying out. In Tel Aviv, Brod became friends with another German exile, Otto Hoffe, and his much younger wife, Esther. Brod, whose own wife had recently died and whose lover had left him, latched on to the Hoffes, and in time took on Esther as his secretary, and perhaps more \u2013 although Esther\u2019s daughter Eva insisted that Esther\u2019s relation to Brod \u201cwasn\u2019t carnal, it was spiritual\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/17/looking-for-kafka-franz-prague-cemetery-1964\">Looking for Kafka  \u2013 archive, 17 January 1964</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whatever the nature of the connection between the two, on his death in 1968 Brod left Esther in possession of the great bulk of Kafka\u2019s papers, including original manuscripts of novels and stories, and a wealth of correspondence. Balint, who is a library fellow at the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem, emphasises that for decades the Israeli state showed no interest in securing the papers, and did not even react when Esther put some manuscripts up for auction.</p> <p>In time, Esther left what remained of them \u2013 a substantial haul, despite those auctions \u2013 to Eva, still living in Tel Aviv. At once Israel, in the form of its National Library, moved to contest Esther\u2019s will, provoking the Marbach Literature Archive to weigh in with its own case. Since it had already been in negotiation with Esther to buy Brod\u2019s estate, including the Kafka papers, the archive\u2019s director held that it had the right at least to make a bid against the Israeli claim. There followed no fewer than three trials in Israel, which ended with the supreme court\u2019s decision that Eva must hand over, without recompense, the entire Brod papers, including Kafka\u2019s legacy, to the library.</p> <p>Who was in the right, or could there even be a \u201cright\u201d decision in such a case, involving the claims of the Jewish state against a nation that had permitted the murder of 6 million Jews? The real loser was not the Marbach archive, for all the affront it suffered, but Eva, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-eva-hoffe-original-heiress-of-kafka-letters-dies-at-85-1.6342295\" title=\"\">who died in August 2018</a>. Balint, in a passage that Kafka would surely have admired, sums up the matter eloquently and movingly when he writes: \u201cLike the man from the country in Kafka\u2019s parable \u2018Before the Law\u2019, Eva Hoffe remained stranded and confounded outside the door of the law \u2026 Her inheritance was the trial itself. Paradoxically, she had inherited her disinheritance, inherited the impossibility of carrying out her mother\u2019s will. She possessed only her dispossession.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Kafka\u2019s Last Trial is published by Picador.

So far, so German; one of the less temperate comments came from the publisher and Kafka scholar Klaus Wagenbach: \u201cThe Israelis seem to have become crazed.\u201d The squabble \u2013 and it was a squabble, despite the many high-minded pronouncements that the affair called forth \u2013 centred not on Kafka himself, or his wishes as to the fate of his papers, running to tens of thousands of pages, but to the ambiguities of the will left behind by Brod, the original keeper of the archive. A tireless, prolific and for the most part mediocre writer and journalist, Brod was Kafka\u2019s closest friend and confidant, and regarded him with, as he confessed, \u201cfanatical veneration\u201d, finding even his chronic hypochondria \u201cinventive and entertaining\u201d. After the second world war, Brod settled in Palestine, not without doubts and difficulties, and with less of an enthusiastic reception than he might justifiably have expected. In Israel\u2019s defence, the new state was more in need of people of action than of another central European intellectual, even one carrying a bulging suitcase of papers left behind by one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, indeed of all the centuries. Kafka had entrusted his archive to Brod with instructions to destroy it, instructions that Brod insisted he assured Kafka he had no intention of carrying out. In Tel Aviv, Brod became friends with another German exile, Otto Hoffe, and his much younger wife, Esther. Brod, whose own wife had recently died and whose lover had left him, latched on to the Hoffes, and in time took on Esther as his secretary, and perhaps more \u2013 although Esther\u2019s daughter Eva insisted that Esther\u2019s relation to Brod \u201cwasn\u2019t carnal, it was spiritual\u201d. Whatever the nature of the connection between the two, on his death in 1968 Brod left Esther in possession of the great bulk of Kafka\u2019s papers, including original manuscripts of novels and stories, and a wealth of correspondence. Balint, who is a library fellow at the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem, emphasises that for decades the Israeli state showed no interest in securing the papers, and did not even react when Esther put some manuscripts up for auction. In time, Esther left what remained of them \u2013 a substantial haul, despite those auctions \u2013 to Eva, still living in Tel Aviv. At once Israel, in the form of its National Library, moved to contest Esther\u2019s will, provoking the Marbach Literature Archive to weigh in with its own case. Since it had already been in negotiation with Esther to buy Brod\u2019s estate, including the Kafka papers, the archive\u2019s director held that it had the right at least to make a bid against the Israeli claim. There followed no fewer than three trials in Israel, which ended with the supreme court\u2019s decision that Eva must hand over, without recompense, the entire Brod papers, including Kafka\u2019s legacy, to the library. Who was in the right, or could there even be a \u201cright\u201d decision in such a case, involving the claims of the Jewish state against a nation that had permitted the murder of 6 million Jews? The real loser was not the Marbach archive, for all the affront it suffered, but Eva, who died in August 2018. Balint, in a passage that Kafka would surely have admired, sums up the matter eloquently and movingly when he writes: \u201cLike the man from the country in Kafka\u2019s parable \u2018Before the Law\u2019, Eva Hoffe remained stranded and confounded outside the door of the law \u2026 Her inheritance was the trial itself. Paradoxically, she had inherited her disinheritance, inherited the impossibility of carrying out her mother\u2019s will. She possessed only her dispossession.\u201d \u2022 Kafka\u2019s Last Trial is published by Picador. To order a copy for \u00a313.19 (RRP \u00a314.99) go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

They\u2019re running 15 minutes late for their 1pm call time on the red carpet at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/25/radio-1-playlist-secrets-uncovered-battle-of-brands\">Radio 1\u2019s</a> annual Teen awards, an event it feels as if they\u2019re slowly outgrowing, and the gaggle of photographers are getting restless. Suddenly, Little Mix appear, dressed head to toe in variations of black business attire. Gone, for the time being at least, are the leotard-based outfits Mel C once criticised for being \u201ctoo provocative\u201d, and the beaming smiles that accompanied playful No 1 hits such as Black Magic and Shout Out to My Ex. Once the flashbulbs are off, however, they click into schmooze mode, goofing around on live radio with host Matt Edmondson and partaking in an on-camera Halloween-themed interview involving questions plucked out of a pumpkin.</p> <p>We meet briefly, sandwiched between a stairwell and the disabled loo. They\u2019re meant to be doing last-minute rehearsals ahead of their debut performance of Woman Like Me, but have time for a quick hello. It\u2019s 2pm and they have been here since 8am. At one point, a bored-looking Thirlwall balances a bottle of water on her head, while the others organise themselves into height order. Suddenly they are engulfed by people \u2013 radio pluggers, PRs, thick-set security guards, a constantly primed glam squad \u2013 and shuffled off to prepare for the show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"52008ecdd6af03c888b10c19a77eca355917785e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52008ecdd6af03c888b10c19a77eca355917785e/0_1438_4241_4241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Little Mix.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Based on pop\u2019s unwritten girl band laws, Little Mix should have announced a hiatus by now, one that involves a smattering of TV presenting, a tell-all book and, for one lucky member, a few weeks in the Australian jungle come November time. Their last album, 2016\u2019s Glory Days, however, was their first to shift more than a million copies in the UK, while Woman Like Me became their 13th Top 10 hit. This year, they will turn their attention fully to the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/09/little-mix-get-weird-american-adventure-uk-girl-group\" title=\"\">where their popularity has been on the wane</a> (2012\u2019s debut DNA peaked at No 4, while LM5 has so far reached No 40). \u201cThat\u2019s our main aim: we really want to crack America,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to put the work in.\u201d</p> <p>That desire to prove people wrong has always been part of their, ahem, DNA ever since producers on The X Factor told them there was no point putting them through to live shows as viewers didn\u2019t vote for girl bands. Expectations were so low that the paparazzi would shout \u201csee you on This Morning, girls\u201d, referring to ITV\u2019s preferred dumping ground for discarded contestants the morning after live shows. The only people who seemed to believe in Little Mix were Little Mix themselves. \u201cWe set our goals very high from the start,\u201d says Pinnock, slumping further into her hotel armchair. \u201cWe wanted dolls, we wanted bed sheets, we wanted makeup, absolutely everything, and obviously these things kept being ticked off.\u201d</p> <p>They also wanted the ultimate in music industry credibility: a Brit award, something they achieved in 2017 when they won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/22/brit-awards-winners-2017-full-list-david-bowie-the-1975-little-mix\" title=\"\">best British single for Shout Out to My Ex</a>. They also got to open that year\u2019s show. \u201cI cried when I found out we were performing,\u201d laughs Nelson. \u201cOh my God,\u201d shrieks Edwards. \u201cDo you know that was one of the best moments of my life. I\u2019d just fallen off my bike cause I was mortal and I\u2019d split my head open a bit.\u201d She senses confusion. \u201cDid I ever tell you this?\u201d The other two look shocked as Edwards rattles through the story: she was on holiday in the Maldives, she\u2019d had \u201cone too many Jack Daniel\u2019s\u201d and went over her handlebars and cracked her head on a tree. \u201cI was a mess. My friend checked my head and was like: \u2018Babe, just to let you know you\u2019re bleeding,\u2019 but I was reading me emails and was like: \u2018I don\u2019t care!

A week before our interview, at a Julie Adenuga-hosted Apple Music event in east London \u2013 essentially the authentic flipside to the Teen awards \u2013 in which they performed stripped-back versions of their hits with an all-female band, they\u2019d mentioned a different working title, one I\u2019d noted down as \u201cWine and Wet Wipes\u201d. \u201cHa!\u201d shouts Edwards instead of actually laughing, a time-saving device they all use. \u201cWine and Makeup Wipes,\u201d corrects Nelson, \u201cbut I hated it\u201d. \u201cIt sounds like an Amy Winehouse album title doesn\u2019t it,\u201d adds Edwards. They\u2019d also said that the creation of LM5 was lubricated by a healthy dose of alcohol. \u201cIt definitely helped,\u201d Thirlwall tells me later on the phone, \u201cand gave me the courage to sing about things I might have been scared to touch on before.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/15/little-mix-lm5-review\">Little Mix: LM5 review \u2013 unlikely survivors are American dreaming | Alexis Petridis' album of the week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as Strip\u2019s self-empowerment, the album also touches on feminism (Joan of Arc), female friendship (the Destiny\u2019s Child-esque Told You So) and, on the Thirlwall-penned Woman\u2019s World, gender politics. \u201cI remember years ago I did a political tweet and got absolutely annihilated by mostly male MPs who were furious that a pop star had an opinion,\u201d she says, referring to her expression of sadness at the 2015 air strikes in Syria. \u201cNow I feel more confident to write about things. With Woman\u2019s World, I remember getting in the studio and the whole #MeToo thing was happening and I was really angry. I started talking about my mum and how she was always seen as less equal even though she worked just as hard as the men around her. I thought it was about time we did a female empowerment song that was very specifically about what was going on in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Thirlwall isn\u2019t the only one who has felt emboldened to tackle issues head-on. In a recent interview, Pinnock discussed how she felt \u201cinvisible\u201d in the band, and was told early on by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s creative director, Frank Gatson, that as a black woman she\u2019d have to work twice as hard to make it in the music industry. \u201cI\u2019ve kept it in me for seven years and it just felt like such a weight was lifted when I said the words,\u201d she says now. \u201cThere is such a problem with racism, so to actually just say it and have so many people of colour message me and thank me for saying something \u2026 \u201d She trails off. \u201cI remember when I used to cry about it to my manager I used to be like: \u2018Why do I feel like this?\u2019 and she\u2019d never say it, and I\u2019d never say it. It was really strange. Now, though, oh my God, I\u2019m so proud of this skin.\u201d</p> <p>We chat about the band\u2019s favourite songs on the album, specifically the head-knocking R&amp;B banger Forget You Not, a song Edwards partially leaked in October after filming footballer boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain dancing to it. It\u2019s a shame it\u2019s only on the deluxe edition, I say. \u201cNo it isn\u2019t,\u201d snaps Edwards. \u201cIt is, babe,\u201d soothes Pinnock. \u201cNo it isn\u2019t,\u201d maintains Edwards. This goes on for a few minutes. \u201cYou\u2019re winding me up,\u201d she continues. \u201cI\u2019m fucking fuming.\u201d People will buy the deluxe, though. \u201cWell I hope so because it\u2019s got one of my favourite songs on there! That wasn\u2019t the final decision.\u201d The tension is diffused with a quick-fire Q&amp;A. Favourite girl band of all time? \u201cI can\u2019t decide between Spice Girls and Destiny\u2019s Child,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cSame,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cGrowing up Spice Girls, but musically it was TLC and Destiny\u2019s Child,\u201d adds Pinnock. Thirlwall, meanwhile, goes with the Supremes, citing Diana Ross as her favourite girl band member ever. What five things should any good girl band have, I ask. \u201cFriendship, unity, passion, drive and sass,\u201d Nelson, Pinnock and Edwards say, almost as one. Thirlwall takes her time. \u201cFriendship. Loyalty. Ambition. Talent,\u201d A pause: \u201cAnd balls!\u201d</p> <p><em>LM5 is out now</em></p>",

There is a chorus of cackles, before they look sheepishly at each other. \u201cPeople kind of assumed we were taking sides because of the way it was worded but we would never pick sides,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cWe\u2019d never want to tear Cardi B down, it\u2019s not about that, it was more that she said something that wasn\u2019t true.\u201d When I speak to Thirlwall a week later she reiterates that point. \u201cWe just wanted to state the facts,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything\u2019s OK now \u2026 I hope.\u201d We talk about the Strip furore that erupted shortly after the album\u2019s release. \u201cIt\u2019s not about sexualising yourself; it\u2019s about having a voice and speaking out and being brave enough to stand up to people,\u201d she says. And then along came Piers Morgan (on Good Morning Britain he asked: \u201cWhat is empowering about this? \u2026 It\u2019s using sex to sell records\u201d). \u201cYeah, right on cue,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWhat was amazing, actually, is that we haven\u2019t had to say much [to him], as women have rallied together and defended us,\u201d she adds, referring to tweets from the likes of Ariana Grande and Fifth Harmony\u2019s Lauren Jauregui. Does she have anything to say to Morgan now? \u201cI mean, he\u2019s, you know, ugh \u2026 I don\u2019t want to dwell too much on it, and he doesn\u2019t deserve a line on it because he\u2019s obviously loving it.\u201d Rewind to a more innocent time, a Sunday in mid-October to be precise, and Little Mix are kicking off the LM5 campaign in the labyrinthine corridors of London\u2019s Wembley Arena. They\u2019re running 15 minutes late for their 1pm call time on the red carpet at Radio 1\u2019s annual Teen awards, an event it feels as if they\u2019re slowly outgrowing, and the gaggle of photographers are getting restless. Suddenly, Little Mix appear, dressed head to toe in variations of black business attire. Gone, for the time being at least, are the leotard-based outfits Mel C once criticised for being \u201ctoo provocative\u201d, and the beaming smiles that accompanied playful No 1 hits such as Black Magic and Shout Out to My Ex. Once the flashbulbs are off, however, they click into schmooze mode, goofing around on live radio with host Matt Edmondson and partaking in an on-camera Halloween-themed interview involving questions plucked out of a pumpkin. We meet briefly, sandwiched between a stairwell and the disabled loo. They\u2019re meant to be doing last-minute rehearsals ahead of their debut performance of Woman Like Me, but have time for a quick hello. It\u2019s 2pm and they have been here since 8am. At one point, a bored-looking Thirlwall balances a bottle of water on her head, while the others organise themselves into height order. Suddenly they are engulfed by people \u2013 radio pluggers, PRs, thick-set security guards, a constantly primed glam squad \u2013 and shuffled off to prepare for the show. Based on pop\u2019s unwritten girl band laws, Little Mix should have announced a hiatus by now, one that involves a smattering of TV presenting, a tell-all book and, for one lucky member, a few weeks in the Australian jungle come November time. Their last album, 2016\u2019s Glory Days, however, was their first to shift more than a million copies in the UK, while Woman Like Me became their 13th Top 10 hit. This year, they will turn their attention fully to the US, where their popularity has been on the wane (2012\u2019s debut DNA peaked at No 4, while LM5 has so far reached No 40). \u201cThat\u2019s our main aim: we really want to crack America,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to put the work in.\u201d That desire to prove people wrong has always been part of their, ahem, DNA ever since producers on The X Factor told them there was no point putting them through to live shows as viewers didn\u2019t vote for girl bands. Expectations were so low that the paparazzi would shout \u201csee you on This Morning, girls\u201d, referring to ITV\u2019s preferred dumping ground for discarded contestants the morning after live shows. The only people who seemed to believe in Little Mix were Little Mix themselves. \u201cWe set our goals very high from the start,\u201d says Pinnock, slumping further into her hotel armchair. \u201cWe wanted dolls, we wanted bed sheets, we wanted makeup, absolutely everything, and obviously these things kept being ticked off.\u201d They also wanted the ultimate in music industry credibility: a Brit award, something they achieved in 2017 when they won best British single for Shout Out to My Ex. They also got to open that year\u2019s show. \u201cI cried when I found out we were performing,\u201d laughs Nelson. \u201cOh my God,\u201d shrieks Edwards. \u201cDo you know that was one of the best moments of my life. I\u2019d just fallen off my bike cause I was mortal and I\u2019d split my head open a bit.\u201d She senses confusion. \u201cDid I ever tell you this?\u201d The other two look shocked as Edwards rattles through the story: she was on holiday in the Maldives, she\u2019d had \u201cone too many Jack Daniel\u2019s\u201d and went over her handlebars and cracked her head on a tree. \u201cI was a mess. My friend checked my head and was like: \u2018Babe, just to let you know you\u2019re bleeding,\u2019 but I was reading me emails and was like: \u2018I don\u2019t care! I\u2019m performing at the Brits.\u2019\u201d We talk about LM5, the title. \u201cThat\u2019s literally what the fans were already calling it,\u201d says Nelson, matter-of-factly. A week before our interview, at a Julie Adenuga-hosted Apple Music event in east London \u2013 essentially the authentic flipside to the Teen awards \u2013 in which they performed stripped-back versions of their hits with an all-female band, they\u2019d mentioned a different working title, one I\u2019d noted down as \u201cWine and Wet Wipes\u201d. \u201cHa!\u201d shouts Edwards instead of actually laughing, a time-saving device they all use. \u201cWine and Makeup Wipes,\u201d corrects Nelson, \u201cbut I hated it\u201d. \u201cIt sounds like an Amy Winehouse album title doesn\u2019t it,\u201d adds Edwards. They\u2019d also said that the creation of LM5 was lubricated by a healthy dose of alcohol. \u201cIt definitely helped,\u201d Thirlwall tells me later on the phone, \u201cand gave me the courage to sing about things I might have been scared to touch on before.\u201d As well as Strip\u2019s self-empowerment, the album also touches on feminism (Joan of Arc), female friendship (the Destiny\u2019s Child-esque Told You So) and, on the Thirlwall-penned Woman\u2019s World, gender politics. \u201cI remember years ago I did a political tweet and got absolutely annihilated by mostly male MPs who were furious that a pop star had an opinion,\u201d she says, referring to her expression of sadness at the 2015 air strikes in Syria. \u201cNow I feel more confident to write about things. With Woman\u2019s World, I remember getting in the studio and the whole #MeToo thing was happening and I was really angry. I started talking about my mum and how she was always seen as less equal even though she worked just as hard as the men around her. I thought it was about time we did a female empowerment song that was very specifically about what was going on in the world.\u201d Thirlwall isn\u2019t the only one who has felt emboldened to tackle issues head-on. In a recent interview, Pinnock discussed how she felt \u201cinvisible\u201d in the band, and was told early on by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s creative director, Frank Gatson, that as a black woman she\u2019d have to work twice as hard to make it in the music industry. \u201cI\u2019ve kept it in me for seven years and it just felt like such a weight was lifted when I said the words,\u201d she says now. \u201cThere is such a problem with racism, so to actually just say it and have so many people of colour message me and thank me for saying something \u2026 \u201d She trails off. \u201cI remember when I used to cry about it to my manager I used to be like: \u2018Why do I feel like this?\u2019 and she\u2019d never say it, and I\u2019d never say it. It was really strange. Now, though, oh my God, I\u2019m so proud of this skin.\u201d We chat about the band\u2019s favourite songs on the album, specifically the head-knocking R&amp;B banger Forget You Not, a song Edwards partially leaked in October after filming footballer boyfriend Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain dancing to it. It\u2019s a shame it\u2019s only on the deluxe edition, I say. \u201cNo it isn\u2019t,\u201d snaps Edwards. \u201cIt is, babe,\u201d soothes Pinnock. \u201cNo it isn\u2019t,\u201d maintains Edwards. This goes on for a few minutes. \u201cYou\u2019re winding me up,\u201d she continues. \u201cI\u2019m fucking fuming.\u201d People will buy the deluxe, though. \u201cWell I hope so because it\u2019s got one of my favourite songs on there! That wasn\u2019t the final decision.\u201d The tension is diffused with a quick-fire Q&amp;A. Favourite girl band of all time? \u201cI can\u2019t decide between Spice Girls and Destiny\u2019s Child,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cSame,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cGrowing up Spice Girls, but musically it was TLC and Destiny\u2019s Child,\u201d adds Pinnock. Thirlwall, meanwhile, goes with the Supremes, citing Diana Ross as her favourite girl band member ever. What five things should any good girl band have, I ask. \u201cFriendship, unity, passion, drive and sass,\u201d Nelson, Pinnock and Edwards say, almost as one. Thirlwall takes her time. \u201cFriendship. Loyalty. Ambition. Talent,\u201d A pause: \u201cAnd balls!\u201d LM5 is out now",

The lost overs will make it more difficult for them to force a victory but the delay will allow their attack to rest up in preparation for enforcing the follow on should Australia\u2019s batting woes continue.</p> <p>Day three actually began promisingly for the home side. Marcus Harris showed plenty of intent during the opening session and he was ably supported by Marnus Labuschagne on a pitch perfect for batting. But both fell in a sloppy afternoon session that yielded four wickets for India and reinforced the issues at the heart of this brittle Australian XI. </p> <p>Peter Handscomb and Pat Cummins both looked solid after Tea and they will resume their partnership half an hour earlier than scheduled on day four to account for the 16 overs lost to bad light this evening.</p> <p>We will of course be right here whenever the first ball is bowled to steer you through the day.

The minutes batted column, the last saving grace of first-class matches, are slowly disappearing too. Can it not be that annotations are used for cricketing scorecards?</p> <p>Of course, the official version can remain as it is, but when one looks at such features digitally, especially considering the match reports are sometimes not available, or not telling us the complete story of gripping encounters, annotations can make the scorecard more user friendly. </p> <p>The element of subjective essential will remain there, of course, but most of the time an edge-filled innings will be called out for what it was while a Kohli ODI masterclass can be anointed as the greatest of all time. Scorecard writers may as well develop an own style of theirs and become important, like OBO and BBB writers are nowadays after the advent of the internet.</p> <p>For example, Pujara 193 (373) can be personalised as \u201cPatient innings which punished any width on offer.\u201d Modes of dismissals can be specified too. For Harris\u2019s innings, one can say \u201cA technically proficient innings filled with stunning drives before an untimely rattle of the stumps after he played on an unremarkable delivety\u201d. A sentence can be enough to address each individual performance for an innings (bowling and batting) in such a scorecard, while the best of the lot can be offered more space, along with a a chance for the \u2018scorecard writer\u2019 to use his own style of writing, dry sense of humour, or simple poetic appreciation.</p> <p>In an age full of new fans and people who might not appreciate the beauty of numbers alone, such additions can be an exciting addition to scorecards, which have so far been a purely statistical and rather dry aspect of this beautiful game.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c304827e4b072dc52e68dea\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-05T06:02:26.138Z\">6.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stumps on Day 3 - Australia 236-6 (in reply to India's 622-7 dec)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There we go.

Weird, as he is sound activated ( normally by my sneezing). Investigating, I found Sandy with all her fur standing on end, after presumably having done a rabbit sneeze. I tried calming her down by explaining the state of play but to no avail. Also my wife doesn\u2019t understand cricket. Yesterday I told her that India had scored more than 600 and she wowed dutifully but without that essential glint of comprehension. Any advice as to how to convert non believers?\u201d. </p> <p>If the sound of this timber rattling doesn\u2019t make the hairs on the back of her neck stand up on end, there\u2019s no hope for her. Could you manipulate Frosty so that instead of singing Christmas tunes you just hear the \u201cclack\u201d of a stump cartwheeling out of the ground whenever he\u2019s prompted?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue0ghB6Z_C4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ue0ghB6Z_C4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c304372e4b0cebe76180656\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-05T05:42:03.826Z\">5.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Australia\u2019s batting coach is former England international Graeme Hick.

There\u2019s bugger all pressure on these guys with no one really coming through. The question is, do they really care that much? Are Travis Head or Shaun Marsh that bothered to be back in the pavilion? They\u2019ve got their 18-grand match fee, and now they can kick their feet up and relax for a while! Pretty dismal state of affairs.</p> <p>Perhaps 18-grand is what you get paid if you have an outstanding match? Your performance could be judged on a scale of $0 to $18000. Last match Cummins would\u2019ve got full pay but no one else. So far this match Harris is leading the way with about $12k which could go either up or down depending on his second innings.

A selection without good reasoning to back it up might work, but it\u2019s still a bad way of making those choices.</p> <p>Or to put it more bluntly, you can put your life savings on red and win. If you do, it still doesn\u2019t make it a sound financial strategy.</p> <p>I\u2019d add that the question isn\u2019t just about whether a player might succeed.

Have a breather, I\u2019d suggest, Mr Shami. <br><br>\u201cMon cher Adam.\u201d Why, it\u2019s Bob Wilson dropping us a line from Paris. Good evening over there, comrade. \u201cMany thanks to the LemonCroftCollins trio for a really smooth OBO run in the last couple of games. Good areas. I love this series like a child or a puppy. It\u2019s been a vintage squeeze. I get the current Australian sackcloth and ashes routine about this team but I think these Indians have been remarkable. The almost imperceptible increase in their grip on this has been a thing of beauty. We all love the hack and thump of dizzyingly macho mental disintegration but this lot have executed the most <em>gradual</em> schlonking I\u2019ve ever seen. They have poached you like jellyfish in a jacuzzi. It\u2019s like a romcom with a bodycount.\u201d </p> <p>I can\u2019t add to that. Superb. A romcom with a bodycount, a new turn for Paul Rudd? <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2ff1b3e4b0cebe761804ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-04T23:55:46.056Z\">11.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>15th over: Australia 36-0 (Harris 28, Khawaja 8) </strong>Jadeja is on,<strong> </strong>and there is a <strong>dropped catch from the first ball of his spell! </strong>Well, Rahul didn\u2019t quiteget to it at mid-on, but he should have.

Not a bad start at all from the openers. <br></p> <p>\u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Kim Thonger! How goes you? \u201cI fully expect Australia to bat well on this pitch. They might even declare, on either 567 for 8 or 678 for 9, ah but no I\u2019m English, so by their scoring method perhaps it will be 4 for 567 or 5 for 678.

      "bodyText": "So an early end to another day of Indian dominance at the SCG. The lost overs will make it more difficult for them to force a victory but the delay will allow their attack to rest up in preparation for enforcing the follow on should Australia\u2019s batting woes continue. Day three actually began promisingly for the home side. Marcus Harris showed plenty of intent during the opening session and he was ably supported by Marnus Labuschagne on a pitch perfect for batting. But both fell in a sloppy afternoon session that yielded four wickets for India and reinforced the issues at the heart of this brittle Australian XI. Peter Handscomb and Pat Cummins both looked solid after Tea and they will resume their partnership half an hour earlier than scheduled on day four to account for the 16 overs lost to bad light this evening. We will of course be right here whenever the first ball is bowled to steer you through the day. Thanks for your company, catch you tomorrow. \u201cAs this game hurtles towards a swift conclusion (barring a Cummins century and inclement weather)\u201d begins Abhijato Sensarma, \u201cI am left to wonder about minuscule things which I frankly have no time for - yet, one can\u2019t help overthinking ideas during such sessions of Test cricket. Ever since the dawn of professional cricket, the scorecard has been said to say \u2018only half the story\u2019. The minutes batted column, the last saving grace of first-class matches, are slowly disappearing too. Can it not be that annotations are used for cricketing scorecards? Of course, the official version can remain as it is, but when one looks at such features digitally, especially considering the match reports are sometimes not available, or not telling us the complete story of gripping encounters, annotations can make the scorecard more user friendly. The element of subjective essential will remain there, of course, but most of the time an edge-filled innings will be called out for what it was while a Kohli ODI masterclass can be anointed as the greatest of all time. Scorecard writers may as well develop an own style of theirs and become important, like OBO and BBB writers are nowadays after the advent of the internet. For example, Pujara 193 (373) can be personalised as \u201cPatient innings which punished any width on offer.\u201d Modes of dismissals can be specified too. For Harris\u2019s innings, one can say \u201cA technically proficient innings filled with stunning drives before an untimely rattle of the stumps after he played on an unremarkable delivety\u201d. A sentence can be enough to address each individual performance for an innings (bowling and batting) in such a scorecard, while the best of the lot can be offered more space, along with a a chance for the \u2018scorecard writer\u2019 to use his own style of writing, dry sense of humour, or simple poetic appreciation. In an age full of new fans and people who might not appreciate the beauty of numbers alone, such additions can be an exciting addition to scorecards, which have so far been a purely statistical and rather dry aspect of this beautiful game.\u201d There we go. Play abandoned for the day. Action begins tomorrow at 10am local time (half an hour early). Play remains suspended. At this late stage in the day you\u2019d have to think it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see any more action until tomorrow. Brian Withington is still logged on. \u201cExcellent points about the forthcoming Ashes tour, and surely messrs Smith and Warner will be welcomed back to the fold with open arms by all (the English like their chips far too much to sport them on the shoulders). The Australian bowling attack should also find more assistance from English conditions. Unless some Australian groundskeepers can be imported to prepare flatter tracks, we had best hope that England can conjure up one or two bowlers capable of exploiting lateral movement off the pitch. Rumour has it there\u2019s an old lag from Burnley who might just fit the bill.\u201d Kenrick Riley knows the drill and is pleasingly filling the delay with correspondence. \u201cA selection dilemma for you,\u201d he begins, teasingly. \u201cBowlers meeting... Mitchell: \u201cJosh, one of us has to drop down so Pat can open up\u201d. Josh:\u201dIt should be me. You two quicks get them on the back foot so my swing will wrong-foot them\u201d. Pat: \u201cNah, you\u2019re sweet\u201d. Mitchell: \u201cYes but, if you two right-handers get their eyes fixed, I can come in with Gary and clean up\u201d. Pat: \u201cNah, you\u2019re sweet\u201d. Mitch/Josh: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wanna open\u201d? Pat: \u201cCos I\u2019ll be opening the batting\u201d!\u201d. Still off for bad light. \u201cMorning Jonathan,\u201d afternoon Finbar Anslow. \u201cJust had a creepy moment in my otherwise silent house: I\u2019m lying in bed diligently scrolling through the day\u2019s play when suddenly Frosty starts singing \u2018Let it Snow\u2019 in the front room. Weird, as he is sound activated ( normally by my sneezing). Investigating, I found Sandy with all her fur standing on end, after presumably having done a rabbit sneeze. I tried calming her down by explaining the state of play but to no avail. Also my wife doesn\u2019t understand cricket. Yesterday I told her that India had scored more than 600 and she wowed dutifully but without that essential glint of comprehension. Any advice as to how to convert non believers?\u201d. If the sound of this timber rattling doesn\u2019t make the hairs on the back of her neck stand up on end, there\u2019s no hope for her. Could you manipulate Frosty so that instead of singing Christmas tunes you just hear the \u201cclack\u201d of a stump cartwheeling out of the ground whenever he\u2019s prompted? Australia\u2019s batting coach is former England international Graeme Hick. He\u2019s just been interviewed on the telly. It\u2019s safe to say the reaction on social media has not been positive. \u201cConsidering what these guys are getting paid for there pretty spineless efforts I think they should start introducing fines for throwing your wicket away,\u201d suggests Tom Ivers. \u201cEspecially tough ones for doing so once already set. There\u2019s bugger all pressure on these guys with no one really coming through. The question is, do they really care that much? Are Travis Head or Shaun Marsh that bothered to be back in the pavilion? They\u2019ve got their 18-grand match fee, and now they can kick their feet up and relax for a while! Pretty dismal state of affairs. Perhaps 18-grand is what you get paid if you have an outstanding match? Your performance could be judged on a scale of $0 to $18000. Last match Cummins would\u2019ve got full pay but no one else. So far this match Harris is leading the way with about $12k which could go either up or down depending on his second innings. What I\u2019m getting at is they clearly need some incentive\u201d. I\u2019m not sure I share your view that there could be a link between financial incentive and performance (not at these numbers anyway) but this is clearly a moment in Australian cricket history where mediocrity is being rewarded like never before. Tom\u2019s email also brought to mind this early noughties slice of Camden post-post-punk. Sixteen and a half overs remaining in the day. I\u2019ll keep you updated as to whether the light improves and we have an opportunity to see any more cricket. 83.3 over: Australia 236-6 (Handscomb 28, Cummins 25) The delay for the review prompts the umpires to reconsider the gloom and with the light fading they invite both teams to leave the field. From around the wicket the ball hit Handscomb just about in line with leg stump and DRS revealed it was going on to miss the pegs by a mile. As expected, dreadful review. Very optimistic LBW shout in my opinion. Handscomb given not out on field to Jadeja. 83rd over: Australia 236-6 (Handscomb 28, Cummins 25) The first runs in an age are awarded to byes, courtesy of an absolute beauty from Kuldeep that pitches wide of off stump, turns, misses Cummins\u2019s edge by a fraction and scoots low through Pant\u2019s legs and away to the boundary. The first runs off the bat in an age come - of course - to Pat Cummins. His latest textbook four is a classical cover drive with his body still and his front foot advanced to the pitch of the ball. 82nd over: Australia 228-6 (Handscomb 28, Cummins 21) It looks from here as though a consideration whether to take the new ball or not is the light, or lack of it. Kohli is in discussion with the umpires between overs and there\u2019s the suspicion the conversation involved him being informed if he switches to pace the batsmen will be offered the light. The outcome of all that speculation is another Jadeja maiden, India\u2019s third in a row. 81st over: Australia 228-6 (Handscomb 28, Cummins 21) The new Kookaburra is now available but while Kuldeep is having so much fun Kohli understandably keeps his wrist spinner operating with the old ball. Cummins negotiates an uncertain maiden. 80th over: Australia 228-6 (Handscomb 28, Cummins 21) Handscomb happy to dot out a routine Jadeja over as the dark clouds continue to gather. 79th over: Australia 228-6 (Handscomb 28, Cummins 21) Yet another four to Cummins, glancing the increasingly dangerous Kuldeep for four to fine-leg after Handscomb had navigated most of an awkward over. 78th over: Australia 219-6 (Handscomb 25, Cummins 17) Four more to Bradman Cummins, this time driving Jadeja straight down the ground. There was a hint of a c&amp;b opportunity but Jadeja\u2019s dive to his right was in vain. \u201cOne of the shameful joys of an English winter might be supposed to be waking early to discover the latest developments in the tragi-comic saga that Australian test cricket has apparently become,\u201d emails Brian Withington. \u201cHowever, am I alone in sensing that the spectacle is beginning to pall as a source of legitimate healthy entertainment and Brexit distraction, and is instead veering towards traffic-accident level voyeurism?\u201d. That depends how deep the chips on one or more of your shoulders go Brian. \u201cAt this rate, Englishmen who should be abed will be wistfully pining for a return of the swaggering days of the baggy green, waking in trepidation to the latest tales of the flaying of our tiring bowlers and cowing of our callow batsmen. Please can you reassure your anxious English followers that normal service will be resumed in time for the Ashes tour?\u201d. Well Brian, we\u2019re expecting Steve Smith and probably David Warner to return for the Ashes. One or both could be game changers. Plus, Australia\u2019s bowling attack hasn\u2019t performed badly this series but on English pitches one can expect them to enjoy more lateral movement and therefore provide a greater wicket-taking threat. England should still be clear favourites mind you. 77th over: Australia 215-6 (Handscomb 25, Cummins 13) Those foreboding clouds remain nearby, it must be said, and they look like they could spill over the SCG at any minute. India would not want that to happen, especially while Handscomb isn\u2019t picking Kuldeep\u2019s wrong\u2019un. So close to an outside edge but the Victorian survives and settles for a maiden. 76th over: Australia 215-6 (Handscomb 25, Cummins 13) More nimble footwork from Handscomb turns a stock Jadeja delivery into a whip off his toes for two. That forces the bowler to adjust his length, gifting the batsman a simple single. If you\u2019ve watched those dark clouds sail by the SCG and wondered what damage they might cause, well, this is a few miles west... 75th over: Australia 212-6 (Handscomb 22, Cummins 13) Another boundary to Cummins, capitalising on an overpitched Kuldeep delivery and ushering it with textbook form to the extra cover boundary. 74th over: Australia 208-6 (Handscomb 22, Cummins 9) Handscomb has handled himself well against both spinners so far. He\u2019s used his feet to good effect and shown his mettle in regularly delaying the insistent Jadeja at the top of his mark, denying the bowler the opportunity to scamper through his work at his preferred tempo. 73rd over: Australia 208-6 (Handscomb 22, Cummins 9) What\u2019s all the fuss about, asks Cummins as he rocks back and pulls Kuldeep with the spin for a four that was about a bail\u2019s width away from a six. He finds out soon enough, almost inside-edging behind, almost losing his off stump to a ripping turner. \u201cHarris and Head,\u201d begins Grant Moss, like a malevolent headteacher. \u201cClearly a lot of talent but they simply do not yet have the temperament to understand the situation and to play accordingly. Harris has a weakness outside the off. He needs to put the shot away for a while, or at least to be more judicious in its use, much the same as others before him put away shots that were continually causing them problems until they rectified how they played them. At least one can hope that both players will learn a lot from this series and provide some much needed stability and success in an otherwise quite poor batting line-up. Marsh has not delivered on the faith placed in him and should be dropped.\u201d 72nd over: Australia 203-6 (Handscomb 21, Cummins 5) Jadeja replaces Bumrah and he has a vigorous LBW appeal against Cummins turned down before Australia\u2019s best batsman* drives squarely for a precise boundary. *Am I even typing this ironically anymore? 71st over: Australia 199-6 (Handscomb 21, Cummins 1) Cummins gets off the mark with a single that was an ODI two but almost declined by a pair unsure whether to stick or twist against Kuldeep\u2019s variations. \u201cHi Adam,\u201d well, it\u2019s Jonathan here now Ian Forth, but you\u2019re forgiven. \u201cDo you think the strange mist moving across the ground might mean you\u2019re actually now in a science fiction film? Don\u2019t be surprised if the ground is covered in triffids tomorrow, or aliens have taken over the Australian batting lineup (that may already have happened, to be fair).\u201d I reckon The Triffids might actually put up a decent top order. At least they\u2019d qualify for baggy greens. 70th over: Australia 198-6 (Handscomb 21, Cummins 0) Replays of Paine\u2019s dismissal do not reflect well on the batsman who ended up in all sorts by misreading the ball in flight. However, that he did get so tangled up was a consequence of some beautiful flight and dip from Kuldeep. That he then found enough turn to twist through the gate was the cherry on the cake. Maiden over from Bumrah to Handscomb. \u201cFourth innings career saving century for SMarsh you say? At this rate it seems it\u2019ll be a third innings career saving century\u201d. Kunal Tolani emailing the truth lols. 69th over: Australia 198-6 (Handscomb 21) Kuldeep gets play back underway after Tea, bowling his left-arm wristies to Tim Paine from around the wicket. That angle amplifies any turn and forces Australia\u2019s skipper to remain watchful during what is destined to be a maiden over but becomes a wicket maiden after Paine yorks himself on the final delivery, not even turning around to address the wreckage, the death rattle of the timbers sufficiently informative. Please keep me company during this final session, either on Twitter - @JPHowcroft- or by email - jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com. Oh, and don\u2019t forget, today is pink day at the SCG. Thanks to India\u2019s spin-heavy attack the over-rate today has been where it should always be. That means this 32-over final session should only last two hours and not eat into the emergency half-hour now routinely accepted as standard. Unless one or more of these storms that have drifted past the SCG decide to shed their loads. In many ways Travis Head is the case in point of Australia\u2019s batting woes. Plenty of pedigree, plenty of promise and plenty of starts, but with an unfortunate ability to find ways to lose his wicket when big scores are there for the taking. Harris\u2019s knock today must have confirmed his seat on the Qantas, while Marnus Labuschagne showed there was method behind the madness of his selection. Conversely, the pressure on Shaun Marsh continues to build. For so long a boom or bust batsman, the peaks this series have not balanced out the troughs. 183 runs at 26 just isn\u2019t good enough for a 38-Test veteran who will be 36 by the first Test at Edgbaston. Although there\u2019s still time for a fourth innings career-saving century... Anyway\u2026 on to the business in hand, that of Australia stumbling towards a 3-1 series defeat like a drunk traversing cobblestones in the rain desperately trying not to spill his kebab. After a promising morning session led by the industrious Marcus Harris, things unravelled badly in the afternoon. Any ambitions of levelling the series surely now reside only in fantasy. We\u2019re already into \u201cwhat does this all mean for the Ashes?\u201d territory. Thank you very much Mr Lemon, my favourite cricketing Geoffrey since Geoffrey Higgs, a principal character in the BBC TV series Sloggers (played by actor Sam Fairbrother). Unfortunately I can\u2019t seem to locate any clips online of the show, which ran to two seasons in the mid-90s. If anybody can help me out, I would be eternally grateful. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Sloggers, it was one of those gently distracting series the BBC was adept at creating for middle-school aged children. It was named after a fictional junior cricket team from Slogthwaite, Lancashire, and filmed in a bucolic village mise en sc\u00e8ne at White Coppice near Chorley. Sloggers was the brainchild of the legendary Sid Waddell, one of the all-time great sports commentators, and author of another popular children\u2019s TV show focussed on sport, Jossy\u2019s Giants. Sloggers was also the first TV gig for actor and comedian Ralf Little. And to square the circle, it featured a cameo from a certain other cricketing Geoffrey in the show\u2019s final ever episode. Enjoy the tea interval. Australia had a rare session win in the first today, with one wicket for 98 added, but India win the second with four wickets for 76. That middle order slide, and again there were plenty of starts with no one able to stick around for a really big score. Ben Jones of CricViz is telling me that Australia has never had a four-Test series in which so many batsmen have faced between 30 and 100 balls. There\u2019s a story in that, if you can Magic Eye it. So it\u2019s up to Paine to try once more to be the resistance, take people\u2019s messages, mix the cordial, and otherwise do all that needs to be done. I\u2019ll leave you with him, and the typing fingers of Jonathan Partridge Howcroft. 68th over: Australia 198-5 (Handscomb 21, Paine 5) Bumrah with the last salvo before the scones. Full toss, letting Handscomb off strike. Thanks champ, says Paine, who gets a snorter from Bumrah, leaping off a good length and cutting back in to smash his gloves. Bouncer again, and Paine sways away. Bumrah is generating heat and he\u2019s fired up. Tries more of the same, and this time Paine hooks for four. Bottom edge, got it fine, but contact enough. Then a single off his pads as Bumrah pitches up. A bit of a wasted over from Bumrah when he might have challenged the stumps and the edge more than the costae verae. 67th over: Australia 192-5 (Handscomb 20, Paine 0) Tough time to come in, and Paine makes it look tougher. Hit on the pad, huge appeal, but he\u2019s walked across his stumps and is struck outside the line. Then Paine spoons a ball away square of the wicket and is nearly caught, the lunge in coming up short. Phew. Oh dear. Some dismissals are soft, that was a custard tart left on the dashboard in the sun. Caught and bowled off a full toss. Earlier in the session Head drove one of those for four. This time he was coming half forward at it, not committing to a shot. The ball dipped but reached him on the full, and was spooned right back to where it came from. Hot slop. 66th over: Australia 192-4 (Head 20, Handscomb 20) Bumrah under thick grey cloud, it\u2019s a soupy sky up above us here in Sydney. Handscomb nearly gets a ball square but the infielding has been good today, there\u2019s another save. The last ball of the over gets away though, even if it wasn\u2019t entirely deliberate. Good yorker from Bumrah, but just outside off stump, and as Handscomb squeezes it out he steers it to third man for four. 65th over: Australia 188-4 (Head 20, Handscomb 16) Kuldeep has changed ends and replaced Jadeja, bowling from the Randwick End. Back onto the stumps goes Handscomb, pulling Kuldeep around the corner for a couple of runs. Flicks the next but Bumrah at backward square does well to stop it. So Handscomb drives wide of mid-off for one, taking off quickly for the run. Head skips down and drives nicely out through cover! It looked like four off the bat, but the point sweeper will cut it off and keep it for two. 64th over: Australia 183-4 (Head 18, Handscomb 13) Bumrah to replace Kuldeep after that short double-spin burst. Bumrah targeting the pads meets Head with a leg glance. Handscomb gets a run from a misfield at cover, then Head times the next shot off his pads better, finding the midwicket boundary. He\u2019s doing a job again. 63rd over: Australia 177-4 (Head 13, Handscomb 12) Handscomb growing in confidence, given strike for the last ball of the over, and immediately driving Jadeja through the covers for another boundary. 62nd over: Australia 172-4 (Head 12, Handscomb 8) Kuldeep in the double-spin attack, though neither batsman has ditched his helmet for a cap as Harris did in the first session. A full toss to start the over, and Head drives it straight for four. That helps a batsman. 61st over: Australia 167-4 (Head 7, Handscomb 8) Jadeja bowls, only a touch short, and Handscomb is back in a flash to pull for four! In the air but controlled, and smoked. It\u2019s funny, no matter how good the shot you can still hear Rishabh burbling away behind the stumps. He chuckled at that shot, a little throaty gurgle. He\u2019s like a Jim Henson puppet; he should be stationed under a bridge. 60th over: Australia 163-4 (Head 7, Handscomb 4) Ah yes. Kuldeep Yadav is back, with his left-arm wrist spinners. Lopped off Khawaja earlier. Fascinating bowler. Someone who has more time than me: when was the last time that two specialist spinners in a Test were both left-armers? Let me know. His first over back is a maiden as Head blots him out. 59th over: Australia 163-4 (Head 7, Handscomb 4) Jadeja. Handscomb. Maiden. You know the drill. Ouch. 58th over: Australia 163-4 (Head 7, Handscomb 4) Wonder what the bowlers will make of this breeze? It\u2019s blowing across Shami from his left shoulder to his right, as he bowls to the left-handed Head. A stiff wind, the flags on the Members Paviliion are taut. Shami pins Head for five balls by bowling straight at the pegs, but slips wide to close the over and Head throws a cover drive at it, not timed cleanly, for two. 57th over: Australia 161-4 (Head 5, Handscomb 4) Handscomb is solving that Jadeja fast-overs problem by making the bowler wait. There\u2019s a shout for lbw as Handscomb is stuck on the crease, but he got a big inside edge. He comes down the wicket to the next ball, which is what he likes to do. Needs the confidence to get those feet moving, he looks hesitant. Works two runs to leg. Leaves the next ball, and the last. 56th over: Australia 159-4 (Head 5, Handscomb 2) Shami attacking the stumps, Head playing away a bit dicily to leg. There\u2019s a strange haze cmoing across the ground, like ocean spray. But not wet. There\u2019s a very cool sea breeze coming through now too. Head finally clips through the field for one, and Handscomb reciprocates. \u201cHi Geoff, welcome back,\u201d wrote Scott Lowe earlier. \u201cQuick question: if Marnus gets a hundred, does that justify his selection? Do all those who criticised the selection have to eat humble pie? As an Aussie fan, I want him to succeed, but I fear if he does we are just going to get more of these bizarre picks.\u201d Well, aside from him having been dismissed in the interim, the question still stands. Had he made a big score, inevitably various people would have started hopping into those of us who criticised the pick. But no, it wouldn\u2019t mean the criticism was wrong. The criticism isn\u2019t of the player, it\u2019s of the process used to pick the player. A selection without good reasoning to back it up might work, but it\u2019s still a bad way of making those choices. Or to put it more bluntly, you can put your life savings on red and win. If you do, it still doesn\u2019t make it a sound financial strategy. I\u2019d add that the question isn\u2019t just about whether a player might succeed. It\u2019s about fairness for other players who\u2019ve done the work, done the right thing, and haven\u2019t been treated well. 55th over: Australia 157-4 (Head 4, Handscomb 1) Almost gone! Twice, really. Handscomb, the good player of spin, gets two outside edges in a row against Jadeja. One along the ground, one just bouncing in front of slip. He survives, somehow, and make it to drinks. 54th over: Australia 156-4 (Head 3, Handscomb 1) Head flicks the straight ball from Shami for one. Handscomb with his UltraBackLift is back on. Defending one, accessing the ball well enough. Leaving one, with the bat wafting around it in a fancy leave. Elbow high to the last. Kerry O\u2019Keeffe had a mare on the telly last week, but he\u2019s back to better form today. \u201cThat seam is straighter than Fred Nile.\u201d Very NSW-niche, but paid. Thanks SH for the email. 53rd over: Australia 155-4 (Head 2, Handscomb 1) Jadeja leaves me no time to type, no time to dream, no time to breathe as he races through an over for the cost of one run. Head\u2019s doubled his score. 52nd over: Australia 154-4 (Head 1, Handscomb 1) The rebuild starts again. Here\u2019s Peter Handscomb, known as a good player of spin but facing Mohammad Shami. Off the mark immediately via the inside edge. Against the run of play, he falls. Australia starting to slide. Labuschagne had just middled a straight drive against Shami for four, but a couple of balls later he\u2019s locked off on his front foot, has to come across his pad, and whips the full ball through midwicket. Sometimes that shot can work, but not when the region is so well patrolled. Rahane is one of the fieldsmen there, and he dives to his right and pulls in the very sharp catch. 51st over: Australia 148-3 (Labuschagne 34, Head 0) A Jadeja maiden as Head can\u2019t beat the field. 50th over: Australia 148-3 (Labuschagne 34, Head 0) Shami from the Paddington End. They\u2019ve got two midwickets in for him, one short and one regulation. No first slip but a second. More backward point than gully. Cover, mid-off. Mid on and two leg-side sweepers behind square. Short ball an option. The option is taken up, and Marnus uppercuts it for four! Down to third man. That looked easy. Shami\u2019s annoyed, and hurls at the stumps after a drive is played back to him. 49th over: Australia 144-3 (Labuschagne 30, Head 0) Travis Head blocks out the remaining five balls of the Jadeja over. Oh, that\u2019s poor. Another single-figure dismissal for Marsh. Nearly half of his Test innings end that way. A nothing ball from Jadeja, over the wicket. No turn, no huge bounce. Marsh just prods defensively down the wrong line and offers a big edge near the shoulder of the bat. Regulation. Looked good for his 8, though... 48th over: Australia 144-2 (Labuschagne 30, Marsh 8) There\u2019s his photo opp! Labuschagne holds the dye-stained blood-rust Kookaburra blade high in its follow through after driving through cover for four. Shami dished up a full one and Marnus took full toll. Then adds another boundary down the ground. This is impressive so far. 47th over: Australia 136-2 (Labuschagne 22, Marsh 8) Jadeja races through another over. The ball races to the cover boundary from Marsh\u2019s bat. Is he on for one today? 46th over: Australia 132-2 (Labuschagne 22, Marsh 4) Bumrah is making Marnus play in this over, but the defensive intent from the batsman remains. John offers a follow-up on email. \u201cThe textual tone of surprise is mostly because I thought it was going to be plastered with adverts. In the past when the BBC have taken a stream from a commercial station, they covered the ads with a station ident which becomes very annoying very quickly. The last time I emailed you about cricket commentary in Australia you wrote an article that ruffled a fair few feathers. It\u2019s only fair I offer compliments when something is good.\u201d True indeed, John was a part of the piece below coming together. And a few of those feathers have remained ruffled to this day, if we\u2019re entirely honest. 45th over: Australia 132-2 (Labuschagne 22, Marsh 4) Nice start for Marsh, who blocks out most of the over but drives the second-last ball away through long-off. Looks good, as he does. Tonned up here last year. Beautiful batting surface. It\u2019s a tailor-made Marsh day. 44th over: Australia 128-2 (Labuschagne 22, Marsh 0) Was that a little boo I heard from the crowd as S Marsh came to the middle? Fancy it might have been. Only from a small portion of the crowd, but there was something. Marnus plays one loose shot early in Bumrah\u2019s over, and is chastened enough by missing the ball that he goes back to leaving everything else. He\u2019s striving to do the Test batting thing. 43rd over: Australia 128-2 (Labuschagne 22) What a shame for Harris. He\u2019s played so well, so entertainingly, but has fallen in slightly familiar fashion, flashing outside the off stump. That shots has garnered him plenty of runs, it must be said. Jadeja came around the wicket last ball of the over, left-armer angling across left-hander, and Harris aims a wafty cut, but the ball\u2019s too full for it. Bottom edge, leg stump, see ya later. 42nd over: Australia 128-1 (Harris 79, Labuschagne 22) Bumrah from the other end. Can\u2019t wait for another commentator to note that he has an unusual run-up. Harris gets off strike immediately. Marnus leaves everything else well alone. 41st over: Australia 127-1 (Harris 78, Labuschagne 22) Here we go. Jadeja with the left-arm lobs, Harris playing a few circumspectly and then getting off strike. Labuschagne looks good first up, driving out through the covers, and after a long drawn-out roll, the ball meets the boundary cushion. \u201cI\u2019ve got to say I\u2019ve really enjoyed listening to ABC,\u201d writes in John Goldstein with a textual tone of surprise. \u201cThe BBC have had the streams and have been putting them out live on Sports Extra in the UK. It\u2019s actually better than TMS in many respects.\u201d Jim Maxwell is standing next to me as it happens, so I\u2019ll pass that on. Remember you can tweet or email me anytime to get involved with the OBO. First order of business: the Pujara Pool Party from yesterday. Andrew Benton nominated a score of 192, and the eventual Pujara total was 193. Congratulations Andrew, you win: a quiet sense of satisfaction and the undying respect of your cricket/internet peers. What ho! Remember, you can\u2019t spell \u2018Howzat\u2019 without it. A session in which Australia was not embarrassed batting. Wonder of wonders. Harris was a lot of fun in that couple of hours, and Marnus must have a million things going through his head but he hung in there after nearly being castled first up. Australian batsmen only made four Test hundreds in 2018, three of them in the corresponding fixture here. Can Harris get 2019 off to a better start? 40th over: Australia 122-1 (Harris 77, Labuschagne 18) Shami to bowl the final over of the session, Harris off strike first ball with one to point, raising the 50 partnership between these two. They\u2019ve been excellent. Labuschagne is then defending a series of balls tailing in at his woodwork, handling it well enough to earn himself a sandwich. The end of a stanza where the home side advanced the score by an even 100 by my count, losing Khawaja (27) along the way when he misread an very handy Kuldeep wrong\u2019un and was caught at midwicket. Aside from that, it has been strangely smooth sailing for the hosts. Yes, the pitch is flat but that has been no problem for India\u2019s bowlers so far in the series. More of that, please. Harris has been especially fantastic, hitting the ball hard to the sweepers to keep the board ticking over in the smaller currencies when he wasn\u2019t finding the gaps and the rope down the ground and at cover. This is surely his day to post three figures in a Test for the first time. Surely! For that, I\u2019ll leave you with Geoff Lemon. Bye for now. 39th over: Australia 121-1 (Harris 76, Labuschagne 18) Pace from both end to finish, Bumrah back for a one-over burst. And he\u2019s so close to slipping a yorker under the blade of Labuschagne, Pant with his hands on his head. Earlier, they were living dangerously too with Labuschagne taking on Jadeja (DON\u2019T TAKE ON JADEJA) at cover, but the throw never came. Between times, Harris deflected one to third man with soft hands. Tom Richardson reckons we should give the emerging player award to Tim Paine. Interesting thought. Who\u2019s going to take the ACMA away, take ACMA home tonight? 38th over: Australia 119-1 (Harris 75, Labuschagne 17) Shami is pulled by Harris for one, nicely along the ground. Labuschagne is able to leave a couple before using his bat, picking up one to cover off the front foot when he does. \u201cHe looks confident,\u201d says Mike Hussey on the telly. \u201cThis is a really good start from him.\u201d Lunch is due in five minutes. \u201cJust to let you know how appreciated your team efforts have been over Christmas,\u201d writes John Davis, most kindly. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed going to bed in the UK catching the start of play and waking up and catching up with it all - this series has felt much more important as a result. Very much looking forward to this summer\u2019s escapades - I can\u2019t say I\u2019m delighted to see Smith and Warner back, but I\u2019m glad Paine and the bowlers will get some support. Currently recovering from a huge early (and very surprising) birthday curry with friends - thanks to all of them and, especially, my amazing wife Paula for organising it without dropping me a hint until they all walked into the pub.\u201d What a lovely, positive email. Happy birthday to you. A surprise party, what a hoot! (Subtweet into the ether: I\u2019d like of them one day). And well played, Paula. 37th over: Australia 117-1 (Harris 74, Labuschagne 16) OUCH! We have a delay in the middle of the over when Labuschagne thumps Kuldeep into the upper thigh of Vihari at short leg. I\u2019m not being euphamistic - it was actually his thigh. Amusingly, the new man goes for the same sweep shot after the delay, but thankfully for Vihari, he missed. The shot gets him a single later in the over, Harris jumping down to drive the final ball to long-on, who has been kept busy throughout the session. \u201cIt\u2019s always tempting fate when peoplepass judgement on the moral number of Tests that should be awarded,\u201d emails Ian Forth. \u201cI recall the late Peter Roebuck suggesting that England now merited a three match series against Australia. When? After the 2005 Lords Test.\u201d The venue stuff frustrates me. We need to grow the game everywhere, and that includes Hobart. Yes, their crowds aren\u2019t great, but nor are the Tests they\u2019re given. 36th over: Australia 114-1 (Harris 72, Labuschagne 15) What a session Harris has had, moving from 19 to 72 with still a quarter hour up to go. Granted, he was beaten at the start of this new Shami over, but that must be the first time today, or near enough. He\u2019s back to his happy place later on, driving two to cover then pushing one down the ground. He must go on to a ton here. There will be excuse whatsoever for a brain fade. 35th over: Australia 111-1 (Harris 69, Labuschagne 15) Kuldeep has been swung around to the Randwick End and I like that. This is the where spinners tend to do their best work at this ground, to the best of my recollection anyway. Harris is jumping down at him immediately, in the mode of Pujara who danced so well on the opening day. But it is on the back foot where he picks up a single, cutting to point. Labuschagne smothers the spin of the rest, well forward from the crease. 34th over: Australia 110-1 (Harris 68, Labuschagne 15) Shami is back from the Paddington End and Labuschagne using his bat conservatively against a bowler he is facing for the first time, almost certainly in any form of cricket. A maiden it will be. 33rd over: Australia 110-1 (Harris 68, Labuschagne 15) Jadeja to Harris, who again strides confidently to drive down the ground early in the over. Defending with a touch more intent this time around Labuschagne retains the strike from the final delivery, finding one behind square leg. This is turning into a handy little stand. We have our annual Cricket Media Association dinner/awards tonight. If you were selecting the men\u2019s emerging player of the year, who would you select? No, I am not crowd-sourcing our work, but I am curious. Caveat: they have to be playing this week so that we can present the the gong in person and say nice things about them. \u201cDoes Shane Warne get an unfair rap for his commentary?\u201d Asks Liz H. I\u2019m inclinded to simply say \u2018no\u2019 and move on, but I\u2019ll be kind! \u201cHe repeats himself and chuckles at his own jokes...but very enthusiastic, perceptive and praises ALL good cricket.\u201d I\u2019m going to do as Tony Jones would on that dreadful show and take this as a comment. 32nd over: Australia 108-1 (Harris 67, Labuschagne 14) Harris is absolutely smashing these singles to the sweepers on the off-side, picking out mid-off with easy from the first offering of Kuldeep\u2019s new over. Labuschagne is safe at home, building his platform, before sweeping with real confidence to finish to secure his second boundary. 31st over: Australia 103-1 (Harris 66, Labuschagne 10) You look up, and the Jadeja over is complete. The only action was a single to Harris, another to the man on the point boundary in front of the O\u2019Reilly Stand. It\u2019s a healthier crowd today; they should get more in than the ordinary numbers of day one and two. Speaking of the SCG Trust in the previous post, remember when their chairman was insisting that this ground is deserving of two Tests a summer at the expense of other venues? No, it is not. 30th over: Australia 102-1 (Harris 65, Labuschagne 10) Up comes the 100 for Australia, via a Harris single to long-off. He\u2019s struck the ball so well down the ground today. Labuschagne takes one off his pads then Harris finishes with another through the gap on the off-side, out to deep cover. \u201cThe curator has a lot of work to do here,\u201d says Ed Cowan on ABC. \u201cI\u2019m surprised the SCG Trust didn\u2019t appoint one Tom Parker\u2019s understudies when he retired. They went external when he retired and it takes a long time to work out how the turf plays. The Shield games played here have been on very, very average wickets.\u201d 29th over: Australia 99-1 (Harris 63, Labuschagne 9) Jadeja to Labuschagne, sending down a timely maiden of darts to calm things down a touch. \u201cYou would like to take this pitch around the world if you were a batsmen,\u201d Jim Maxwell says on ABC. \u201cIt is like a solid concrete block. I reckon you could play a timeless Test for ten days.\u201d 28th over: Australia 99-1 (Harris 63, Labuschagne 9) Bang, bang, bang! Harris, now batting in his baggy green, takes Kuldeep down with three boundaries in four balls! The first is lofted over long-on, the second pulled with fury to midwicket and the third picked up flat also to long on, getting just to the pitch of the flighted change-up. Into the 60s he goes, with a bullet! 27th over: Australia 87-1 (Harris 51, Labuschagne 9) Jadeja is back, zipping through a quick over at Harris, who keeps the strike with one to square leg. He was given a bit of tap during his first stint, so this is an important shift for him in the lead up to lunch. \u201cThe SCG is essentially a football ground these days,\u201d Ed Cowan says on ABC as I turn the dial. I\u2019m not sure what the context is, but I feel like it is important to include. I think he\u2019s lamenting how little Shield cricket is played here at the moment. 26th over: Australia 86-1 (Harris 50, Labuschagne 9) Labuschagne gets on a nice little run here, punching Kuldeep for two through cover off the back foot then nailing the overpitched reply to the cover rope from his front dog. For the rest, he\u2019s sturdy in defence. What a fantastic opportunity for the young, plucky Queenslander this is. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to that bit in the re-cut poem,\u201d Ben Jones (reading along next to me) says, \u201cwhen Warner says that he doesn\u2019t really hate Moeen, not even a little bit, not even at all.\u201d On that topic, Bob Wilson is back in my inbox: \u201cI thought you had talked to Naylor about being funnier than me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly rude and disobliging.\u201d 25th over: Australia 80-1 (Harris 50, Labuschagne 3) From the first ball of Bumrah\u2019s new over, the adopted Victorian opener pushes one to point to raise his second Test half-century. He\u2019s there in 67 balls, picking up five boundaries along the way. With the exception of one miscue off Jadeja, he\u2019s been wonderful in this first hour today. Labuschagne is off the mark later in the over from the outside of his blade, albeit along the ground through the cordon for a couple. He adds a single to midwicket to finish the over, which will feel much better as they take their drinks. I forgot to post the Khawaja wicket, here \u2018tis. 24th over: Australia 76-1 (Harris 49, Labuschagne 0) Harris strikes with the middle of his bat for the umpteenth time this morning, to the sweeper at point. This is his best chance yet to make his way to a maiden Test ton, make no mistake. Labuschagne plays the remainder of the Kuldeep over carefully. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good player of spin,\u201d notes Ricky Ponting. He\u2019ll need to be, Kuldeep is a star (and my fave, as you can probably tell). Superb areas, Gaz. I\u2019m going to re-write the Julia Stiles poem at lunch. 23rd over: Australia 75-1 (Harris 48, Labuschagne 0) I was about to type \u201cthis could turn into Australia\u2019s best session of the series\u201d or something like that when Khawaja fell. There are people getting stuck into him online, and I get that, but it was the delivery that did him. It brings Labuschagne, to the middle at number three for Australia. Imagine saying that twelve months ago. He\u2019s on strike to Bumrah after Harris adds a couple through square leg then a single to point. The new man cops an inswinging yorker first up, just keeping it out via bat and boot! Welcome! At the end of the over he joins Harris for a laugh in the middle of the pitch, looking at the bottom of his bat that saved him from a first baller. Phew. Fantastic bowling, Khawaja done by the Kuldeep wrong\u2019un! He was on the front foot trying to score through cover but didn\u2019t pick the one that goes the other way, the miscue ending up with Pujara for an easy catch at cover. What classy, accurate bowling that is. 22nd over: Australia 72-1 (Harris 45) 21st over: Australia 70-0 (Harris 44, Khawaja 26) Jadeja has been taken off after just those three overs, Bumrah back from the Randwick End. Harris is forced to play throughout, getting down well to a slower ball before pushing another one to mid-on. He\u2019s doing just as Chris Rogers says a busy opener must, turning the board over as often as possible with singles. Khawaja keeps the strike with one into midwicket to finish. 20th over: Australia 68-0 (Harris 43, Khawaja 25) Harris is again on the front foot scoring, taking one early in the Kuldeep over to mid-on. The spinner was instrumental in India\u2019s series-winning victory at Dharamsala in 2017, on debut no less. He may be India\u2019s third choice spinner for now, but he has a long, long career ahead of him. Mindful of this, no doubt, Khawaja watches the rest of the accurate set respectfully. 19th over: Australia 67-0 (Harris 42, Khawaja 25) Australia are going at better than four an over so far this morning, helped by Khawaja getting into his reverse sweep posture for the first time today, nailing it too for four more. When he was playing this shot a year ago it was seen as a sign of weakness, now it is one of his most dependable. For evidence, see how well he played it in Dubai during his fourth innings epic. 18th over: Australia 61-0 (Harris 41, Khawaja 20) Spin from both ends, Kuldeep replacing Shami from the Paddington End. On telly, Tim Lane describes him as a left-arm over the wrist bowler, which will doubtless inspire feral comments about him being a snowflake or some such - what a world we live in. The runs keep coming after Harris sizes him up, carving a couple out to point then getting on the front foot to pick out that same sweeper for two more to finish. Into the 40s he moves. Go you good thing. 17th over: Australia 57-0 (Harris 37, Khawaja 20) Are these two Hayden and Langer in disguise? Two more boundaries in this over, the 50 stand brought up with another cover driven boundary from Harris, later in the over Khawaja jumping down the track to hammer Jadeja over mid-off for four more! That\u2019s entertainment! 16th over: Australia 47-0 (Harris 32, Khawaja 15) This is some excellent batting, Khawaja getting into position early to flick a boundary to fine leg with that lovely lift of the back foot when contact is made. Harris is better again, capping the over with a perfect cover drive. No need to run for that. Have a breather, I\u2019d suggest, Mr Shami. \u201cMon cher Adam.\u201d Why, it\u2019s Bob Wilson dropping us a line from Paris. Good evening over there, comrade. \u201cMany thanks to the LemonCroftCollins trio for a really smooth OBO run in the last couple of games. Good areas. I love this series like a child or a puppy. It\u2019s been a vintage squeeze. I get the current Australian sackcloth and ashes routine about this team but I think these Indians have been remarkable. The almost imperceptible increase in their grip on this has been a thing of beauty. We all love the hack and thump of dizzyingly macho mental disintegration but this lot have executed the most gradual schlonking I\u2019ve ever seen. They have poached you like jellyfish in a jacuzzi. It\u2019s like a romcom with a bodycount.\u201d I can\u2019t add to that. Superb. A romcom with a bodycount, a new turn for Paul Rudd? 15th over: Australia 36-0 (Harris 28, Khawaja 8) Jadeja is on, and there is a dropped catch from the first ball of his spell! Well, Rahul didn\u2019t quiteget to it at mid-on, but he should have. After talking up Harris, he\u2019s played the false stroke, sounding ugly off his bat,, but he survives. He does well later in the over, keeping his cool after his reprieve to drive through cover from the balls of his feat, out to the rope for four. 14th over: Australia 32-0 (Harris 24, Khawaja 8) Lovely again from Harris, the second time this morning he has driven down the ground with control, albeit only for one this time. Even so, this might be the best we\u2019ve seen him look for Australia so far. Khawaja then flicks a couple, watching the rest carefully. Not a bad start at all from the openers. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Kim Thonger! How goes you? \u201cI fully expect Australia to bat well on this pitch. They might even declare, on either 567 for 8 or 678 for 9, ah but no I\u2019m English, so by their scoring method perhaps it will be 4 for 567 or 5 for 678. If they reach 6 for 789 though, I\u2019ll eat my trilby. I\u2019ve confused myself now, so I shall stop.\u201d Gosh, the last time Australia declared? Possibly at this ground 12 months ago? Some niche work is required to take this further: the longest time between Australian declarations? Thankfully, I have Geoff Lemon to my right and Ben Jones from CricViz to my left. They live for tasks like this. 13th over: Australia 29-0 (Harris 23, Khawaja 6) Bumrah versus is shaping up as a tasty little contest, the Indian seamer building up up his pace through the over at the Aussie opener. Some good Test cricket early in the day here. 12th over: Australia 29-0 (Harris 23, Khawaja 6) It\u2019s Shami from the Paddington End, running away from us. Harris uses the pace well, timing a defensive push to cover to pick up one early in the over. Khawaja is using his bat in defence for the rest, getting one to mid-on to keep the strike. 11th over: Australia 27-0 (Harris 22, Khawaja 5) Shot! First ball of the day, Bumrah overpitches to Harris to leans into a lovely off-drive for three. Khawaja is immediately under pressure with a delivery slipping past his blade and into his pad but by the end of the over he is leaving confidently. Out come the teams for their pink cap presentation. The Australians and Indians file past Glenn McGrath to present him with their baggy pinks, which are no in turn popped online to help with today\u2019s huge fundraising task. To the middle they continue to begin day three. Bumrah has the ball in his hand, Australia resuming at 24-0 with Harris (19), there with Khawaja (5) PLAY! One of the joys about writing at the SCG is the half hour or so when the sun is setting over the back of the Members and Ladies Stands. Here was my vantage point last night. I don\u2019t like much about Sydney, but I do like this. \u201cWelcome to the hot seat, Collins!\u201d Good morning to you, Raakesh Natraj. \u201cTim Paine, top bloke. Wonder how long he\u2019ll hang on to the captaincy after the return of Smith and Warner? Would like him to go on.\u201d Well, in practical terms, it\u2019ll be at least April 2020 before Smith is eligible to lead again - they banned him for two years from captaincy gigs. There\u2019s no reason to pension off Paine any time soon, for mine. If anything, this whole episode reinforces how unfortuante it is that Paine wasn\u2019t able to lead this side earlier. If we knew what we knew. Yes, his finger was cooked for years, but by the time Smith took over, Paine was very much back in business. Ah well. When he does finish up, Cummins is the man for me. In 818 Tests that Australia has played, only one has been led by a quick. Ridiculous. Pat: It\u2019s on! Righto, I\u2019m now upstairs. The ground is looking a treat and it is already hot, with a forecast top of 35 degrees in Sydney today. There will be no complaints given that during this fixture last year it reached 47. Have that. To the enormous credit of Tim Paine, he fronted the press conference at stumps last night. Better still, he maintained a great sense of humour, especially when a colleague\u2019s phone went off on the table. Nicely played. Today is Jane McGrath Day. The Pink Test has been an important part of the SCG Test over the last decade, raising money to support Breast Care nurses across Australia. If you\u2019re so inclined, this is a good day to throw some money the McGrath Foundation\u2019s way. Another smashing day in the harbour city, not a cloud to be seen. Now, there are days in the dirt and then there are days in the dirt and Australia certainly experienced one of the latter on Friday. That was quite brutal yesterday afternoon as India\u2019s lower order got busy, Pant\u2019s unbeaten 159 a real wonder. Without any realistic hope of winning the Test from here, the job for the hosts is to find a way to bat for a full day; for the top order to make the most of these favourable conditions to show that some lessons were learned in Melbourne. I\u2019m looking forward to your company through the first session before Geoff Lemon and JP Howcroft stop by later to drive the OBO home. What do you think? Is this the day Travis Head or Marcus Harris post three figures for the first time? Does Usman Khawaja put on a clinic? Or will it all come tumbling down? Drop me a line, ping me a tweet - you know the drill. Good morning.",

One in eight children aged between five and 19 in England has a diagnosable mental health condition; the prevalence of emotional disorders, including anxiety and depression, has risen by 48% since 2004. \u201cThe pressures young people face range from school stress, bullying and worries about job and housing prospects, to concerns around body image,\u201d says Emma Saddleton, helpline manager at the charity <a href=\"https://youngminds.org.uk/\" title=\"\">YoungMinds</a>.</p> <p>While we may not be able to remove all these challenges, we can pass on skills to help young people cope with stress and adversity. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s known as resilience,\u201d Saddleton says. \u201cThe ability to overcome difficult experiences and be shaped positively by them.\u201d Our brains respond to the information around us, so resilience can be taught, modelled and nurtured at any age. \u201cBy doing this, through strong support networks and encouraging communication, we can help young people understand when they feel down and know what they can do to make themselves feel better,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>As a parent myself \u2013 I have a son of eight and a daughter of six \u2013 it\u2019s something that\u2019s high on my agenda, and I\u2019ve discovered some effective techniques. Crucially, they don\u2019t require you to overhaul your parenting style, but simply to make a few tweaks that will help your children thrive.</p> <h2><strong>Have one-on-one time with each child, without distractions</strong></h2> <p>I have a full-on job, two school-age children, and an elderly mother to care for, so I understand that we\u2019re all busy; I\u2019m not trying to pile on the guilt. But I\u2019ll never forget what my daughter, then four, said one day. We were working on a jigsaw, but I kept nipping to the kitchen to check my phone. When I rejoined her for the third or fourth time, she rightly observed, \u201cDaddy, you\u2019re not really here, are you?\u201d</p> <p>Resilience comes from relationships; children need nurturing. It\u2019s not a magical \u201cinner strength\u201d that helps kids through tough times; instead, it\u2019s the reliable presence of one, supportive relationship, be it parent, teacher, relative, family friend or healthcare practitioner. My key point is, it\u2019s quality, not quantity, that counts. Ten minutes of fully focused attention is better than an hour when your mind is on other things. If you\u2019re on your tablet at the dinner table, you\u2019re teaching them it\u2019s OK to always be distracted. And that they are not important enough for your sole attention.</p> <p>One-on-one time doesn\u2019t have to be time carved out of an already hectic schedule. Make bathtime, car journeys, meals, queues count. Chat, listen, talk about your feelings, encourage them to express theirs. Once these one-to-ones become regular, your children will know they always have a safe space to open up.</p> <h2><strong>Give sleep a chance</strong></h2> <p>I see so many children who are struggling to sleep, waking tired, with dark circles under their eyes. A lack of good-quality sleep is a huge driver for stress: it has a negative effect on memory, concentration, cognitive function, and decision-making.</p> <p>One of the fastest ways to improve sleep \u2013 for all of us \u2013 is to limit screen time before bed. The type of blue light emitted by digital devices suppresses production of melatonin, the hormone that signals to the body it\u2019s time for sleep. In addition, looking at screens before bed keeps us emotionally wired and stimulated, making it harder for us to switch off.</p> <p>It\u2019s a steely parent who can ban tech completely, and I don\u2019t think you need to. But I would urge you to issue a household ban on devices at least an hour before bedtime. Turn off the wifi, if need be. (TV isn\u2019t so bad if you need that as a compromise; we tend not to sit as close to the screen.)</p> <p>Earlier in the evening, insist everyone uses \u201cnight-time mode\u201d on their devices, which swaps the blue light for a warmer glow. You can download apps that do this (such as <a href=\"https://justgetflux.com/\" title=\"\">f:lux</a>), too, or buy blue-light-cancelling glasses. It\u2019s also worth switching your children\u2019s night lights to red ones \u2013 red has the least impact on melatonin production. When I did this in my children\u2019s rooms, they slept in more than an hour later the next morning.</p> <h2><strong>Get out and exercise</strong></h2> <p>We all know that regular activity is important, and that most of us, children included, need to do more of it. But what if I told you that, as well as keeping them physically fit, exercise will increase your child\u2019s resilience? It actually strengthens the brain.</p> <p>It\u2019s well documented that exercise is on a par with medication when it comes to treating mild to moderate depression and anxiety. This could be because it gets the body used to moving more fluidly in and out of the stress state. The same hormones released when we\u2019re stressed (cortisol and adrenaline) are raised temporarily when we exercise. Regular physical activity teaches our stress-response system to recover more efficiently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5afafcde55951fc2027bfc53e113a4aed938926\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5afafcde55951fc2027bfc53e113a4aed938926/36_56_5094_3056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girl on climbing frame\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It can be a lot of fun to do this together, and I\u2019ve learned that kids do what they see us doing, not what we tell them to. I\u2019m a big fan of \u201cmovement snacking\u201d \u2013 short bursts of exercise throughout the day. I\u2019ll put on the radio before dinner and we\u2019ll all dance around in the kitchen. Or my kids will join me doing squats, star jumps, bear crawls or frog hops. The sillier I look, the more they seem to enjoy it.</p> <h2><strong>Teach delayed gratification</strong></h2> <p>Resilience means understanding you can\u2019t always have what you want as soon as you want it. It\u2019s an important concept to pass on in the age of Amazon Prime, Spotify, Netflix and Uber. Psychology teaches us that people who can accept delayed gratification lead happier, healthier lives. Without the ability to defer pleasure and reward, our kids are losing an important skill for their wellbeing.</p> <p>One of the best ways to teach it? Playing board games. These require impulse control, turn-taking, and mental flexibility. They exercise the prefrontal cortex, the rational part of the brain involved in decision-making, emotional regulation and, yes, resilience. Board games are also a good way for you to model resilience by being a good loser.</p> <p>But there are no shortage of other ways to encourage delayed gratification: learning a musical instrument; listening to whole albums instead of skipping from track to track online; mastering a new sport; even watching a TV series together week by week, instead of bingeing in a couple of sittings.</p> <h2><strong>Eat the alphabet</strong></h2> <p>Nutrition has a significant impact on mental health. Good-quality food changes the composition of our gut bugs, which helps send calm signals to the brain. Poor-quality, highly processed food sends stress signals instead. A diverse diet, rich in fibre, will lead to greater diversity in our gut bugs, which in turn will help make us more resilient, and anxiety and depression less likely. Persuading kids to eat more healthily can feel like an uphill battle, though, especially if they\u2019re fussy, so this is not about becoming a top chef \u2013 just trying a few tricks that can really benefit them emotionally.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/29/bittersweet-three-indian-women-50-years-in-uk\">'It\u2019s been bittersweet': three Indian women on 50 years in the UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I like to challenge the whole family to \u201ceat the alphabet\u201d over 30 days.

It turns healthy eating into a game, and encourages children to try new foods.

      "body": "<h2>\u2018One of my nicknames is The Tank\u2019: Dickie Borthwick, footballer, 83, Weymouth, Dorset<br></h2> <p>My competitive football career started at Invergordon Academy in the Scottish Highlands, before I progressed to Invergordon Town at the age of 15. Since then, I\u2019ve played in about 1,600 matches and scored well over 400 goals. The game I most remember was a local derby for Sherborne Town against another Sherborne side. I scored a hat-trick, but I also broke the goalkeeper\u2019s thumb with a shot. You never forget a hat-trick. I scored another when I was 65.</p> <p>When I go on the pitch, I always say to the opposition, \u201cI\u2019m getting on a bit, but treat me as a normal player. Tackle me hard, I don\u2019t mind, because I\u2019ll be doing it to you.\u201d I don\u2019t want to be treated as an old person. And one or two do come in hard, and sometimes they\u2019ve come off worse. One of my nicknames is The Tank. I\u2019ve never been a dirty player, mind you.</p> <p>I have a routine to keep fit. Every evening before bed, I go to the window and take in 10 really, really deep breaths of fresh air. And I do the same thing in the morning \u2013 10 breaths of fresh air, really holding it in my lungs. Living in Weymouth, we have lovely sea air. But wherever I am, I do this routine.</p> <p>And I\u2019m strict with my diet. I live alone and I know what food is good for me and what isn\u2019t. Certain foods suit the body. I\u2019m disciplined, too. When I have a cup of tea, I take just one biscuit from the tin. I wouldn\u2019t think about taking any more. Discipline, desire, dedication, determination and drive: I\u2019ve tried to conduct my life by those five Ds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Discipline, desire, dedication, determination and drive : I\u2019ve tried to conduct my life by those five Ds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Playing football does make me feel young. People say, \u201cYou\u2019re never that age.\u201d Getting older is not a nice thing. I also play keyboards and sing in the pubs and clubs, and one of my gigs is at a rest home where there are obviously a lot of elderly people. I think, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to get like that.\u201d</p> <p>People have asked if I\u2019d play walking football. It\u2019s fine for those who can\u2019t run very quickly, but it\u2019s not for me. For as long as I can run around at a reasonable pace, I won\u2019t attempt walking football. I want to play the game at the rate it should be played. I was a precision engineer by trade and we were on piece work; the quicker you worked, the more bonus you earned. It\u2019s an in-built thing for me. I\u2019ve never slowed down.</p> <p>The difficulty I\u2019ve had in the past few years is finding a team. Veterans\u2019 teams are constantly folding, including the team I signed for a couple of seasons ago. On the Thursday, the manager had 14 players available; but by the Sunday, only eight were available. He just said, \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m finished with veteran footballers. You\u2019re not reliable.\u201d </p> <p>So I\u2019m without a club at the moment. Veterans football has become very competitive compared to 10 years ago, and I don\u2019t want to play for cups and medals. I want to play in a competitive game, yes, but with the social side of it afterwards \u2013 food laid on, talk about the game, have a couple of pints. I miss the banter. In one pub, we even had a post-match singalong around the piano.</p> <p>I\u2019m still available.

The following year, we did our first London Marathon together. We didn\u2019t really have a training schedule; we ran five miles on weekdays, but added an extra mile to our longer Sunday run each week. We built up that way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is good for relieving stress.

I didn\u2019t keep to that very well, did I? All have been the London Marathon, except for the time I ran the Lochaber one.

I stopped playing when I had children and didn\u2019t return for many years. But when I went back to work, I took it up again: there happened to be a table there. I played at lunchtimes and one of the men asked if I could be a reserve for their local league team.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t play seriously until I started competing in veterans\u2019 tournaments when I was 50. I was free from looking after the children by then. The first tournament I can remember was in Coventry, where I won the over-40s. The woman I beat was 42. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind being beaten by a 40-year-old, but not a 50-year-old!\u201d</p> <p>The first big tournament I won was the Veterans European Championships in Vienna in 1995, when I was 65. I won the over-60s and beat the then world champion and a previous world champion. I\u2019ve become world champion myself since, but I still think the first was my biggest win. I\u2019d never won anything like that before. They played the national anthem and I received a bouquet and a huge cup.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Table tennis has taken me to places I would never have visited otherwise. I\u2019ve played all over the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Table tennis has taken me to places I would never have visited. I\u2019ve played all over the world. My husband wasn\u2019t a keen traveller, but I travelled with a group of veterans. I liked China very much \u2013 I won the over-80s singles and doubles there. I thought Rio was exotic. Canada was wonderful.</p> <p>I was disappointed at the world championships in Las Vegas last June. I was defending the title I won two years previously in Alicante, but lost to a Japanese player in the semi-final. It was very close \u2013 16-14 in the final game \u2013 so I only got the bronze. They don\u2019t play national anthems these days because there\u2019s no time. It\u2019s an enormous event. In Vegas, there were 150 tables in one room and 5,000 players! I\u2019ve possibly got my eye on the over-90s title at the next world championships in 2020. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think table tennis gets enough publicity in this country. It\u2019s much more affordable than buying a set of golf clubs; you can pay as little as \u00a320 for a good bat. And then there are the health benefits. <a href=\"http://www.batfoundation.com/bat-research/\" title=\"\">King\u2019s College London </a>did an experiment with several activities for the elderly, and table tennis came out well. As well as the physical movement, there\u2019s the rapid eye movement and concentration, which is supposed to help prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia.</p> <p>I was honoured to receive an MBE for services to table tennis. My family were stunned. Prince Charles made the award. I\u2019ve never been impressed with him on the news, but he was charming. He asked if I was still playing. When I said I was, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.

He had been a cyclist before the war, so it was in the blood. My first race was as a 20-year-old in a 50-mile time trial in Northumberland; I was the fastest novice, which fuelled my enthusiasm.</p> <p>I won the Veterans\u2019 Road Race World Championship in Austria in 1997 when I was 70. I was up against former professionals. On the Monday, I won the world championship and on the Wednesday I became the European Masters champion. I won by three or four lengths at both events. I\u2019ve got photos of my finishes, with my one-armed victory salute \u2013 a bit like Alan Shearer! I got two huge cups for those races. I\u2019ve got trophies galore and more than 100 medals.</p> <p>Over the years, I\u2019ve ridden many 12-hour time trials, and at the age of 80 I was determined to do a 24-hour one. I lost an hour and a half to sickness, but I still broke the record for an 80-year-old. I covered 326 miles in that time. And I crashed near the finish, too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I still do between 150-180 miles a week on the bike</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I still do between 150-180 miles a week on the bikeI\u2019ve nearly killed myself on numerous occasions. When I was about 60, I had a nasty accident in Northumberland. I was coming up to a junction and there was no marshal around. I hadn\u2019t seen that a wagon had stopped. I hit it at about 25mph and landed in the middle of the road. I broke my collarbone, punctured my lung and had to have a plate put into my left arm. And when I was 73, I was nearly killed in Thailand. A van hit me head-on and left me bleeding at the side of the road. I had to have 29 stitches in my head.</p> <p>The secret of my longevity? I had a very long-living mother who died only a week before her 99th birthday. Other than that, I\u2019ve led a normal life. We didn\u2019t have the supplements we have today. I wasn\u2019t living on just bread and jam, but it was a simple diet.</p> <p>I still do between 150-180 miles a week on the bike. Fortunately, living in Northumberland, the roads are quiet. But the real handicap \u2013 whether I\u2019m heading out north, south, east or west \u2013 is that I\u2019ve got to climb straight away. And you\u2019re starting from cold, which is not good.</p> <p>Cycling has never been as popular as running, but the social aspect has gone completely. When I go out on a Sunday, the most I see riding together are two or three riders. At one time, we might have had up to 60 doing a club run.</p> <p>Everyone recognises me because I wear my original club colours. And I don\u2019t wear a helmet. Never have \u2013 only when I\u2019ve been racing. </p> <p>\u2022 Commenting on this piece?

      "bodyText": "\u2018One of my nicknames is The Tank\u2019: Dickie Borthwick, footballer, 83, Weymouth, Dorset My competitive football career started at Invergordon Academy in the Scottish Highlands, before I progressed to Invergordon Town at the age of 15. Since then, I\u2019ve played in about 1,600 matches and scored well over 400 goals. The game I most remember was a local derby for Sherborne Town against another Sherborne side. I scored a hat-trick, but I also broke the goalkeeper\u2019s thumb with a shot. You never forget a hat-trick. I scored another when I was 65. When I go on the pitch, I always say to the opposition, \u201cI\u2019m getting on a bit, but treat me as a normal player. Tackle me hard, I don\u2019t mind, because I\u2019ll be doing it to you.\u201d I don\u2019t want to be treated as an old person. And one or two do come in hard, and sometimes they\u2019ve come off worse. One of my nicknames is The Tank. I\u2019ve never been a dirty player, mind you. I have a routine to keep fit. Every evening before bed, I go to the window and take in 10 really, really deep breaths of fresh air. And I do the same thing in the morning \u2013 10 breaths of fresh air, really holding it in my lungs. Living in Weymouth, we have lovely sea air. But wherever I am, I do this routine. And I\u2019m strict with my diet. I live alone and I know what food is good for me and what isn\u2019t. Certain foods suit the body. I\u2019m disciplined, too. When I have a cup of tea, I take just one biscuit from the tin. I wouldn\u2019t think about taking any more. Discipline, desire, dedication, determination and drive: I\u2019ve tried to conduct my life by those five Ds. Playing football does make me feel young. People say, \u201cYou\u2019re never that age.\u201d Getting older is not a nice thing. I also play keyboards and sing in the pubs and clubs, and one of my gigs is at a rest home where there are obviously a lot of elderly people. I think, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to get like that.\u201d People have asked if I\u2019d play walking football. It\u2019s fine for those who can\u2019t run very quickly, but it\u2019s not for me. For as long as I can run around at a reasonable pace, I won\u2019t attempt walking football. I want to play the game at the rate it should be played. I was a precision engineer by trade and we were on piece work; the quicker you worked, the more bonus you earned. It\u2019s an in-built thing for me. I\u2019ve never slowed down. The difficulty I\u2019ve had in the past few years is finding a team. Veterans\u2019 teams are constantly folding, including the team I signed for a couple of seasons ago. On the Thursday, the manager had 14 players available; but by the Sunday, only eight were available. He just said, \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m finished with veteran footballers. You\u2019re not reliable.\u201d So I\u2019m without a club at the moment. Veterans football has become very competitive compared to 10 years ago, and I don\u2019t want to play for cups and medals. I want to play in a competitive game, yes, but with the social side of it afterwards \u2013 food laid on, talk about the game, have a couple of pints. I miss the banter. In one pub, we even had a post-match singalong around the piano. I\u2019m still available. There\u2019s no question about that. \u2018Cricket\u2019s in my blood, ever since I played barefoot in Jamaica\u2019: Cecil Wright, cricketer, 85, Oldham I came to England from Jamaica in 1959 as a fast bowler, to play professionally for Crompton Cricket Club in the Central Lancashire League.

I won the over-60s and beat the then world champion and a previous world champion. I\u2019ve become world champion myself since, but I still think the first was my biggest win. I\u2019d never won anything like that before. They played the national anthem and I received a bouquet and a huge cup. Table tennis has taken me to places I would never have visited. I\u2019ve played all over the world. My husband wasn\u2019t a keen traveller, but I travelled with a group of veterans. I liked China very much \u2013 I won the over-80s singles and doubles there. I thought Rio was exotic. Canada was wonderful. I was disappointed at the world championships in Las Vegas last June. I was defending the title I won two years previously in Alicante, but lost to a Japanese player in the semi-final. It was very close \u2013 16-14 in the final game \u2013 so I only got the bronze. They don\u2019t play national anthems these days because there\u2019s no time. It\u2019s an enormous event. In Vegas, there were 150 tables in one room and 5,000 players! I\u2019ve possibly got my eye on the over-90s title at the next world championships in 2020. We\u2019ll have to wait and see. I don\u2019t think table tennis gets enough publicity in this country. It\u2019s much more affordable than buying a set of golf clubs; you can pay as little as \u00a320 for a good bat. And then there are the health benefits. King\u2019s College London did an experiment with several activities for the elderly, and table tennis came out well. As well as the physical movement, there\u2019s the rapid eye movement and concentration, which is supposed to help prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. I was honoured to receive an MBE for services to table tennis. My family were stunned. Prince Charles made the award. I\u2019ve never been impressed with him on the news, but he was charming. He asked if I was still playing. When I said I was, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to take you on today.\u201d \u2018I\u2019ve nearly killed myself on numerous occasions\u2019: Ron Longstaff, cyclist, 91, Hexham, Northumberland What started me off was my father buying me a lightweight bike when he was demobbed. He had been a cyclist before the war, so it was in the blood. My first race was as a 20-year-old in a 50-mile time trial in Northumberland; I was the fastest novice, which fuelled my enthusiasm. I won the Veterans\u2019 Road Race World Championship in Austria in 1997 when I was 70. I was up against former professionals. On the Monday, I won the world championship and on the Wednesday I became the European Masters champion. I won by three or four lengths at both events. I\u2019ve got photos of my finishes, with my one-armed victory salute \u2013 a bit like Alan Shearer! I got two huge cups for those races. I\u2019ve got trophies galore and more than 100 medals. Over the years, I\u2019ve ridden many 12-hour time trials, and at the age of 80 I was determined to do a 24-hour one. I lost an hour and a half to sickness, but I still broke the record for an 80-year-old. I covered 326 miles in that time. And I crashed near the finish, too. I still do between 150-180 miles a week on the bikeI\u2019ve nearly killed myself on numerous occasions. When I was about 60, I had a nasty accident in Northumberland. I was coming up to a junction and there was no marshal around. I hadn\u2019t seen that a wagon had stopped. I hit it at about 25mph and landed in the middle of the road. I broke my collarbone, punctured my lung and had to have a plate put into my left arm. And when I was 73, I was nearly killed in Thailand. A van hit me head-on and left me bleeding at the side of the road. I had to have 29 stitches in my head. The secret of my longevity? I had a very long-living mother who died only a week before her 99th birthday. Other than that, I\u2019ve led a normal life. We didn\u2019t have the supplements we have today. I wasn\u2019t living on just bread and jam, but it was a simple diet. I still do between 150-180 miles a week on the bike. Fortunately, living in Northumberland, the roads are quiet. But the real handicap \u2013 whether I\u2019m heading out north, south, east or west \u2013 is that I\u2019ve got to climb straight away. And you\u2019re starting from cold, which is not good. Cycling has never been as popular as running, but the social aspect has gone completely. When I go out on a Sunday, the most I see riding together are two or three riders. At one time, we might have had up to 60 doing a club run. Everyone recognises me because I wear my original club colours. And I don\u2019t wear a helmet. Never have \u2013 only when I\u2019ve been racing. \u2022 Commenting on this piece?

He had seen it several times already \u2013 had once sat through it twice when, thanks to the principle of continuous performance, it was possible to stay put in your seat and watch the programme all over again at no extra cost.</p> <p>Films about war weren\u2019t new to me. The Four Feathers stood out on two counts. Surprisingly, given its date, and in contrast to the usual British monochrome, it was in Technicolor; and the war it featured was older and more obscure than the familiar one, which had ended in 1945. In it, an army led by General Kitchener fought the Muslim revivalist leader, the Mahdi, and his followers in Sudan in the late 1890s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/29/fintan-otoole-the-books-interview-brexit-english-nationalism\">Fintan O\u2019Toole: \u2018Brexit is full of hysterical self-pity\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adapted from the Edwardian novel by AEW Mason, the film tells the story of Harry Faversham, a young army officer who resigns his commission just before his regiment leaves England for Egypt, fearing that he can never live up to his family\u2019s brave military traditions. Three of his fellow officers send him white feathers; in self-disgust and self-pity he plucks a fourth from the fan of his disapproving fiancee. And then, in a heroic act of expiation, he follows his regiment up the Nile disguised as a mute native, and in one way and another saves the lives of the officers who have despised him.</p> <p>The film was shot on location in Sudan, which in its day gave it a rare authenticity. Many scenes are memorable. I can still see the gunboat being towed up the rapids in the Nile; the Mahdi\u2019s cavalry charge at Omdurman; Ralph Richardson, alone in the desert, losing his pith helmet and getting blinded by sunstroke (which means he can\u2019t see his rescuer \u2013 yes, the man to whom he sent a white feather, the now-mute Harry Faversham!).</p> <p>I suppose I must have understood that the film represented an older piece of history than <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045659/\" title=\"\">The Cruel Sea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047797/\" title=\"\">Above Us the Waves</a>; the helmets and the uniforms clearly came from a different age. But did I recognise anything antique in the film\u2019s patriotism and imperialism? In 1941, when the <a href=\"https://winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour/finest-hour-179/alexander-korda-churchills-man-hollywood/\" title=\"\">US Senate decided</a> to look into the motives of its producer, Alexander Korda, a witness told the inquiry that the film depicted \u201cthe ancient British sport of knocking off the natives \u2026 it was all pip-pip and tawny port and a thin red line of heroes\u201d. What would I have made of that, aged nine?</p> <p>Dimly, I might have seen that the British in the film were slightly comic as well as noble. More likely, it was for me simply a thrilling story. In the mid-1950s we were all little matinee-warriors who knew our own side when we saw it. If someone had told us that the Mahdi was played by a white Scotsman (John Laurie) and that Britain should never have been in Sudan in the first place, we would have been puzzled by their objections.</p> <p>For several reasons \u2013 biographical, social, patriotic \u2013 it was one of Winston Churchill\u2019s favourite films. He had fought at Omdurman as a young lieutenant in the Lancers 40 years before. Later, after a rollercoaster career had left him hard up and without much of an obvious political future, he and Korda became friends. Korda, a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 with grand ambitions for the British film industry, hired Churchill as a screenwriter and paid him lavishly \u2013 in the early 1930s, \u00a310,000 for two screenplays was excellent money.</p> <p>As it turned out, neither of Churchill\u2019s scripts was filmed, though the relationship was maintained. Churchill liked the cinema and possessed a cinematic imagination \u2013 images fill his speeches \u2013 and the two men shared a romantic appreciation of British history, out of which, arguably, came a strand of propaganda and a way of thinking about Britain/England that still endures.</p> <p>The director John Fleet charts the course of their friendship in a revealing documentary, <a href=\"https://www.januarypictures.com/churchill-and-the-movie-mogul/\" title=\"\">Churchill and the Movie Mogul</a>, which has its premiere this month as part of the BFI Southbank\u2019s Korda season. Well before a second world war had become a firm prospect in the public\u2019s mind, a Korda film was stressing the need for preparedness. \u201cI\u2019m an Englishman and I can\u2019t say one thing and mean another,\u201d says the chicken-munching king (Charles Laughton) in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933). \u201cThis little island is no match for all of Europe.\u201d All a king can do is \u201cbuild ships, ships and more ships \u2026 to leave it undone will cost us England\u201d.</p> <p>Churchill liked the film, with one reservation. It would have benefited, he wrote to Korda, from \u201ca little less chicken-bone-chewing and a little more England-building\u201d. That defect was remedied in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028872/\" title=\"\">Fire Over England</a> (1937), another adaptation of an AEW Mason novel, in which Queen Elizabeth (Flora Robson) sends little fire ships to destroy the mighty Spanish Armada, and Laurence Olivier and his soon-to-be wife, Vivien Leigh, play the romantic leads. \u201cHow small we are, how wretched and defenceless,\u201d says an Elizabethan courtier pondering England\u2019s place on an Elizabethan globe, but there is Elizabeth herself at Tilbury: \u201cI am come to live or die amongst you all \u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52f471435e1c68dc63a25ad45ffa32901467c1c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52f471435e1c68dc63a25ad45ffa32901467c1c3/0_33_3344_2007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Clements and June Duprez in The Four Feathers (1939)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Clements and June Duprez in The Four Feathers (1939).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Olivier and Leigh were together again as Admiral Nelson and his mistress in Lady Hamilton (1941), which Korda made in Hollywood under the title That Hamilton Woman. Churchill, by now prime minister, is reported to have watched it eight or nine times, most famously with President Roosevelt aboard the new battleship Prince of Wales. Each time Nelson died, Churchill cried. A witness to the performance in the battleship\u2019s wardroom noted that he took a handkerchief from his pocket \u201cand wiped his eyes without shame\u201d.</p> <p>Churchill is thought to have strongly influenced \u2013 perhaps even written \u2013 the scene in which Nelson warns his admiralty bosses against any peace deal with Napoleon: \u201cBelieve me, gentlemen, he wants to be master of the world. You cannot make peace with dictators. You have to destroy them.\u201d Churchill was by now realising a dream of his place in history. In a sense, he may have been crying at himself.</p> <p>The US had yet to enter the war. Nobody, including Olivier and Leigh, doubted that the film was propaganda intended to soften American public attitudes towards entry on the British side. It was for that reason that the Senate had its inquiry into Korda\u2019s motives and attitudes. That Hamilton Woman was, after all, an American production, and the US was officially both neutral and anti-imperial.</p> <p>The message that came from Korda and Churchill was double-edged. On the one hand, it was defiant. Britain/England was small and alone (despite its extensive empire), but it had been small and alone before. It was its natural condition \u2013 from 1940 to Nelson, to Drake, to Henry VIII, to people in woad throwing rocks at the Roman soldiery: always defiant and always, ultimately, successful. One of Churchill\u2019s film scripts concluded: \u201cIn all her wars England has always gained one battle \u2013 the last.\u201d On the other hand, the Korda-Churchill message was a cry for help. \u201cLook at little us, America, being brave once again.\u201d</p> <p>In 1942, Korda became the first film producer or director to receive a knighthood. After the war, he paid Churchill \u00a350,000 (the equivalent of about \u00a32m today) for the rights to A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, though no film was made.</p> <p>Their joint idea of England unhelpfully persists.</p> <p>\u2022 Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Surprisingly, given its date, and in contrast to the usual British monochrome, it was in Technicolor; and the war it featured was older and more obscure than the familiar one, which had ended in 1945. In it, an army led by General Kitchener fought the Muslim revivalist leader, the Mahdi, and his followers in Sudan in the late 1890s. Adapted from the Edwardian novel by AEW Mason, the film tells the story of Harry Faversham, a young army officer who resigns his commission just before his regiment leaves England for Egypt, fearing that he can never live up to his family\u2019s brave military traditions. Three of his fellow officers send him white feathers; in self-disgust and self-pity he plucks a fourth from the fan of his disapproving fiancee. And then, in a heroic act of expiation, he follows his regiment up the Nile disguised as a mute native, and in one way and another saves the lives of the officers who have despised him. The film was shot on location in Sudan, which in its day gave it a rare authenticity. Many scenes are memorable. I can still see the gunboat being towed up the rapids in the Nile; the Mahdi\u2019s cavalry charge at Omdurman; Ralph Richardson, alone in the desert, losing his pith helmet and getting blinded by sunstroke (which means he can\u2019t see his rescuer \u2013 yes, the man to whom he sent a white feather, the now-mute Harry Faversham!). I suppose I must have understood that the film represented an older piece of history than The Cruel Sea and Above Us the Waves; the helmets and the uniforms clearly came from a different age. But did I recognise anything antique in the film\u2019s patriotism and imperialism? In 1941, when the US Senate decided to look into the motives of its producer, Alexander Korda, a witness told the inquiry that the film depicted \u201cthe ancient British sport of knocking off the natives \u2026 it was all pip-pip and tawny port and a thin red line of heroes\u201d. What would I have made of that, aged nine? Dimly, I might have seen that the British in the film were slightly comic as well as noble. More likely, it was for me simply a thrilling story. In the mid-1950s we were all little matinee-warriors who knew our own side when we saw it. If someone had told us that the Mahdi was played by a white Scotsman (John Laurie) and that Britain should never have been in Sudan in the first place, we would have been puzzled by their objections. For several reasons \u2013 biographical, social, patriotic \u2013 it was one of Winston Churchill\u2019s favourite films. He had fought at Omdurman as a young lieutenant in the Lancers 40 years before. Later, after a rollercoaster career had left him hard up and without much of an obvious political future, he and Korda became friends. Korda, a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 with grand ambitions for the British film industry, hired Churchill as a screenwriter and paid him lavishly \u2013 in the early 1930s, \u00a310,000 for two screenplays was excellent money. As it turned out, neither of Churchill\u2019s scripts was filmed, though the relationship was maintained. Churchill liked the cinema and possessed a cinematic imagination \u2013 images fill his speeches \u2013 and the two men shared a romantic appreciation of British history, out of which, arguably, came a strand of propaganda and a way of thinking about Britain/England that still endures. The director John Fleet charts the course of their friendship in a revealing documentary, Churchill and the Movie Mogul, which has its premiere this month as part of the BFI Southbank\u2019s Korda season. Well before a second world war had become a firm prospect in the public\u2019s mind, a Korda film was stressing the need for preparedness. \u201cI\u2019m an Englishman and I can\u2019t say one thing and mean another,\u201d says the chicken-munching king (Charles Laughton) in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933). \u201cThis little island is no match for all of Europe.\u201d All a king can do is \u201cbuild ships, ships and more ships \u2026 to leave it undone will cost us England\u201d. Churchill liked the film, with one reservation. It would have benefited, he wrote to Korda, from \u201ca little less chicken-bone-chewing and a little more England-building\u201d. That defect was remedied in Fire Over England (1937), another adaptation of an AEW Mason novel, in which Queen Elizabeth (Flora Robson) sends little fire ships to destroy the mighty Spanish Armada, and Laurence Olivier and his soon-to-be wife, Vivien Leigh, play the romantic leads. \u201cHow small we are, how wretched and defenceless,\u201d says an Elizabethan courtier pondering England\u2019s place on an Elizabethan globe, but there is Elizabeth herself at Tilbury: \u201cI am come to live or die amongst you all \u2026\u201d Olivier and Leigh were together again as Admiral Nelson and his mistress in Lady Hamilton (1941), which Korda made in Hollywood under the title That Hamilton Woman. Churchill, by now prime minister, is reported to have watched it eight or nine times, most famously with President Roosevelt aboard the new battleship Prince of Wales. Each time Nelson died, Churchill cried. A witness to the performance in the battleship\u2019s wardroom noted that he took a handkerchief from his pocket \u201cand wiped his eyes without shame\u201d. Churchill is thought to have strongly influenced \u2013 perhaps even written \u2013 the scene in which Nelson warns his admiralty bosses against any peace deal with Napoleon: \u201cBelieve me, gentlemen, he wants to be master of the world. You cannot make peace with dictators. You have to destroy them.\u201d Churchill was by now realising a dream of his place in history. In a sense, he may have been crying at himself. The US had yet to enter the war. Nobody, including Olivier and Leigh, doubted that the film was propaganda intended to soften American public attitudes towards entry on the British side. It was for that reason that the Senate had its inquiry into Korda\u2019s motives and attitudes. That Hamilton Woman was, after all, an American production, and the US was officially both neutral and anti-imperial. The message that came from Korda and Churchill was double-edged. On the one hand, it was defiant. Britain/England was small and alone (despite its extensive empire), but it had been small and alone before. It was its natural condition \u2013 from 1940 to Nelson, to Drake, to Henry VIII, to people in woad throwing rocks at the Roman soldiery: always defiant and always, ultimately, successful. One of Churchill\u2019s film scripts concluded: \u201cIn all her wars England has always gained one battle \u2013 the last.\u201d On the other hand, the Korda-Churchill message was a cry for help. \u201cLook at little us, America, being brave once again.\u201d In 1942, Korda became the first film producer or director to receive a knighthood. After the war, he paid Churchill \u00a350,000 (the equivalent of about \u00a32m today) for the rights to A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, though no film was made. Their joint idea of England unhelpfully persists. \u2022 Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Human waste by the side of a busy road in Yosemite. Overflowing toilets in the Grand Canyon. The Rocky Mountains inaccessible because of unplowed roads. And in all these places, ordinary people stepping in to try to save some of America\u2019s most revered landmarks from being overrun. As the impasse over funding for Donald Trump\u2019s border wall pushes the government shutdown into its third week, US national parks are bearing the brunt of the financial crunch. The vast majority of park service staff are furloughed during one of of the busiest times of the year, particularly in the western US. Campers and hikers who might have been pleased to skip the entry fees into unstaffed parks have been welcomed by shuttered visitor centers, locked bathrooms, and garbage cans brimming over. Many have lost the reservations they had booked months or even years in advance. At least three people have died in the parks since the shutdown began, the Washington Post reported. Two people fell, one at the Horseshoe Bend overlook in Arizona and the second in Yosemite; another was hit by a falling tree in Great Smoky Mountains national park. It is unclear if the deaths are related to the shutdown, but experts said the staffing shortage made visits potentially more dangerous. A park service spokesman told the publication that an average of six people die each week in the parks. Across the west, Guardian reporters have found varying levels of crisis at three different national parks. In the vast desert expanses of Joshua Tree, in southern California, the situation has been fraught. Unsettling news reports and cold weather have done little to drive visitors away. Just after the new year, lines of cars cruised past boarded windows where officials typically collect $30 per vehicle. Climbers and selfie-takers could be seen climbing rocks clumped high amidst the park\u2019s eponymous prickly trees. \u201cAt Joshua Tree and Yosemite, impacts from human waste is a concern, which includes people relieving themselves in public places, such as behind buildings [and] on roadsides,\u201d said Andrew Mu\u00f1oz, a park service spokesperson. He described the situation as a health hazard and said that the litter increased the risk of dangerous interactions between people and wildlife. Though officials were scarce, local people are coming together to fill in the gaps, determined to keep the park accessible and clean. Megan Edge, a barista at a coffee shop next to the closed-down visitor center, said she and other employees were handing out maps and showing out-of-towners where to go. \u201cWe live for this park and try to take care of it,\u201d she said, adding that they had already run of out maps by midday due to the high demand for help. Each morning dozens of volunteers from the local not-for-profit organization Friends of Joshua Tree have been gathering to pick up trash, stock toilet paper, and clean toilets near campsites. \u201cWe were not prepared for this level,\u201d said the executive director, John Lauretig, standing next to a truck loaded with toilet paper. \u201cThere are over 150 pit toilets in the park.

      "bodyText": "Two women and four men have put their hands up to run for the National party in the western Victorian federal seat of Mallee to replace embattled MP Andrew Broad. Broad resigned as a junior minister and announced he would not recontest the next election following claims of inappropriate conduct late last year. He has said his decision to arrange to meet a woman on a sugar baby website was a \u201cdumb mistake\u201d. The Mallee preselection field includes Irymple airconditioning businessman Toby Heil, Birchip farmer Bernadette Hogan, Mildura acting police inspector Paul Mathieson, Mallee Sustainable Farming executive chairman Daniel Linklater and Minyip farmer Shane McGrath. McGrath is the son of the late former Victorian state MP Bill McGrath. Mildura social worker Anne Webster, who previously ran against Broad in 2013 for preselection, is also in contention. Webster, 59, founded a community organisation called Zoe Support, which helps mothers in their teens and early 20s reconnect with studying and training. She has lived in Mildura for 41 years and is married to a local doctor. She recently completed her PhD in sociology on adoption at the Australian National University, and said her six grandchildren were used to her trundling off to Canberra for her studies. \u201cI think there is significant distrust in politicians and politics more broadly,\u201d she said. Webster spent the last week travelling around Wimmera towns rallying support among National party members. \u201cThere is a feeling of great disappointment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to understand the difference between a person\u2019s actions and the party\u2019s attitudes, goals and values. The National party continues to be the way forward for regional and rural Australia.\u201d She nominated road upgrades, lack of rail services, water, energy, healthcare, education and immigration as key issues in the seat. The region was hoping to attract more refugees to struggling small towns to help fill unskilled job shortages, she said, highlighting the success of the Burmese Karen who have settled in Nhill. Hundreds of National party members will make a decision on the Mallee candidate on 19 January. Senior party officials are supporting the push for a female candidate. The National party state director, Matthew Harris, acknowledged that while a female candidate would be a good thing, it was not set in stone. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s up to the membership in Mallee,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll vote for whoever they think is the best candidate.\u201d While Broad holds the seat of Mallee on a margin of about 20%, the Nationals could face a tough battle to retain it. In a surprise upset during the November Victorian election, the independent Ali Cupper wrested the previously safe state seat of Mildura from Nationals MP Peter Crisp. Cupper believes there is strong local anger about a lack of resources and infrastructure after decades of being taken for granted. She said there could be fertile ground for a strong independent candidate to rise. The former Yarriambiak mayor Ray Kingston has announced a bid to run as an independent. The Liberal party is also likely to run a candidate in the seat of Mallee. One of the names being bandied about is Peta Credlin, Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff turned Sky News presenter, who grew up in the town of Wycheproof.",

The fierce and very public feud between Elon Musk and the rapper Azealia Banks was reignited on Friday after the tech billionaire\u2019s lawyers attacked the rapper\u2019s credibility in a filing in a shareholder lawsuit. \u201cThey are still slighting me like I don\u2019t have plenty more dirt to spill on Elon,\u201d Banks wrote on Instagram on Friday. \u201cThis is going to get extremely ugly \u2026 Elon will learn very soon who is more powerful of us two.\u201d She has since deleted the post. The revived feud between Banks and Musk is just the latest fallout from the Tesla CEO\u2019s infamous announcement on Twitter that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share. Attorneys for investors, who allege Musk\u2019s tweet was market manipulation that cost them hundreds of millions of dollars, are trying to learn more about one of the complicating factors in the case: Banks\u2019 apparent presence in Musk\u2019s house during the immediate fallout of the tweet. Banks had posted extensively about her time in Musk\u2019s home on Instagram, alleging that she had been invited by Musk\u2019s then girlfriend Claire Boucher, better know as Grimes, for a recording session, only to end up waiting around the house while the musician comforted her boyfriend for \u201cbeing too stupid not to go on Twitter while on acid\u201d. According to Musk\u2019s attorney\u2019s filing on Friday, which was first reported by Bloomberg, the plaintiffs have sought subpoenas for Grimes, Banks, and three media outlets (the New York Times, Gizmodo and Business Insider) that interviewed either Banks or Musk about their dispute. \u201cIt is evident that this is really more of an effort to sensationalize these proceedings than a legitimate attempt to preserve evidence,\u201d Musk\u2019s attorney Dean Kristy wrote in the filing. In the filing, Kristy refers to media reports describing Banks\u2019 \u201chistory of making bold and sometimes unverified claims\u201d to question her credibility as a witness. The filing also cites an article, in which a reporter characterized Banks calling Musk a caveman as \u201cvaguely eugenicist\u201d, as further evidence of her untrustworthiness.

Banks appears to have taken exception to Kristy\u2019s filing, an excerpt of which she posted as a screenshot in her now-deleted Instagram post. \u201cI\u2019m now even more angered by the fact that his lawyer is falsely stating I lied after being vindicated in both incidents with Russell Crowe and Jack Dorsey,\u201d she wrote.

      "bodyText": "The mercury plummeted in Victoria overnight but firefighters were still battling several blazes across the state. About 40 firefighters had to take life-saving action as an out-of-control blaze switched direction due to a wind change. Three groups of firefighters from the CFA and Forest Fire Management were working on the eastern flank of the Rosedale fire in Gippsland on Friday when a predicted wind change occurred, emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp said on Saturday. The flank became the fire front and raged towards the firefighters, who came out shaken but uninjured by the experience. A fire truck, trailer and bulldozer belonging to Forest Fire Management were burnt out. There will be a review into how the firefighters came to be in harm\u2019s way. \u201cThey found themselves in a very serious situation and they were shaken as a result of it,\u201d Crisp said. \u201cI have spoken to both the chiefs of those organisations, but they\u2019re safe and well and they are being well looked after and we need to and we will learn from this.\u201d A watch and act alert was in place for residents near Rosedale, in the state\u2019s east, where a fire had been burning on Friday night. Emergency services warned people in Kilmany, Fulham and Wurruk to monitor the dangerous conditions as the fire burned in a north-easterly direction towards them. A second watch and act was in place for a grassfire burning near Ancona, Merton and Strathbogie. While kite surfers in Port Phillip Bay were taking advantage of the strong winds and choppy conditions on Saturday morning, authorities were scrambling to remove trees that had blown across roads and highways. A State Emergency Service spokeswoman said the organisation was responding to reports of 144 fallen trees statewide, most of which were in Melbourne and its surrounds. She said there were 22 incidents of buildings being damaged, including 14 in Melbourne and the outer suburbs. Authorities were urging residents to secure outdoor items, park their vehicles under cover and to be wary of fallen trees and power lines. Melbourne was headed for a top of 21C on Saturday just a day after being belted with scorching heat. Some northern centres reached 46C on Friday before the cool change swept through. The milder conditions were expected to bring relief to firefighters battling the two major blazes to the north and east of Melbourne. A wind change helped them slow the spread of the fire overnight, but nearby residents were to stay on high alert through Saturday morning. Victoria Police said it was investigating the cause of the Rosedale fire. The emergency services minister, Lisa Neville, warned on Friday that the \u201cdanger period is not over\u201d with scope for more blazes. The Bureau of Meteorology was forecasting the heat to return soon, ahead of the Australian Open in Melbourne. Tennis Australia has upgraded temperature testing at the Melbourne Park sports centre and referees will be able to suspend play under extreme conditions. In Tasmania, the uncontrolled wilderness bushfire raging in the southwest was expected to continue its fury over the weekend as firefighters fought to put it out. The Gell river fire, west of the Tasmanian capital, had burned through almost 15,000 hectares of bush but no longer posed an immediate risk to properties, the Tasmania Fire Service said. But residents were warned of a risk of embers from the blaze, burning about 20km northwest of the communities. An advice warning remained in place on Saturday for Maydena, Tyenna, Mt Field, National Park, Bushy Park, Ellendale, Westerway and Fentonbury. Parks and Wildlife Service\u2019s Paul Black said on Friday the fire was expected to subside overnight as the wind change and cold front moved in. \u201cOver the next couple of days we\u2019ll have a much more moderate fire behaviour, which will give our crews an opportunity to make a very good assessment of what the fire has got to and what our control strategies should be from here on in,\u201d he said. \u201cThe area has a significant amount of smoke and cloud over it which makes it difficult to determine that western boundary ... but there will be more information coming out about that for 24 hours.\u201d Sprinkler lines had been set up to protect some communities in case the fire headed in their direction while more retardant drops, backburns and water bombing could happen. \u201cWe are not out of the woods. There is a significant fire risk,\u201d Tasmania Fire Service chief officer Chris Arnol said on Friday. Hobart was expected to hit a top of 22C on Saturday. \u2013 Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "body": "<p>Sandown\u2019s increasingly popular final to the veterans chase series has once more produced a big field of familiar names but the oddity this year is a drying surface which is unlikely to be perfect for many of them. <strong>Houblon Des Obeaux (3.00)</strong> could not be mistaken for a fast horse but he has plenty of form on good to soft ground and, at 20-1, makes a lot of appeal with the Venetia Williams yard suddenly in tremendous form.</p> \n<p>Now 12, he did not appear to relish heavy going for his first two starts this year but he showed plenty of ability last season, including when winning over this course and distance. If the light still burns within, he has dropped to a very attractive mark of 135; the last time he was rated so low was for a handicap hurdle on New Year\u2019s Day seven years ago, which he won.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jan/04/talking-horses-rooneys-cheltenham-boycott-meagre-evidence-horse-racing-tips\">Talking Horses: Rooneys\u2019 Cheltenham boycott is based on meagre evidence</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>1.50 Sandown</strong> As <strong>Laurina</strong> is second-favourite for the Champion Hurdle she really ought to be up to winning a Listed contest for mares and cannot sensibly be opposed, for all that her odds will be extremely short. Sensulano has potential but her latest success was in a handicap hurdle off a rating of 129 and that does not entitle her to get near the Irish raider.</p> \n<p><strong>2.05 Wincanton</strong> Though <strong>The Dellercheckout</strong> was perhaps a touch fortunate to win his Irish point to point, in which he was the only finisher, he looks a chaser and was a bit big at some of his hurdles when third at Ludlow last month. This might be a good time to catch him, on his chasing debut with Bryony Frost aboard for the first time.</p> \n<p><strong>2.25 Sandown</strong> Rathhill is favourite to give Nicky Henderson a sixth Tolworth success and is evidently held in high regard. But it is possible he may struggle, on this drying ground, to reel in <strong>Elixir De Nutz</strong>, who made all to score at Cheltenham in both November and December. On the latter occasion he beat Jarveys Plate, who boosted the form by springing a surprise in a Listed contest on New Year\u2019s Day.</p> \n<p><strong>2.40 Wincanton</strong> Having opened at 12-1 in places, <strong>Tight Call</strong> looks a potential source of value in his first handicap. He showed good battling qualities when edged out by Kajaki at Wetherby in November, his first defeat under rules, and the worth of that form has been upheld by first and third.</p> \n<p><strong>3.15 Wincanton</strong> Connections of <strong>Copain De Classe</strong> had a go at winning with a penalty after he scored by 10 lengths in late October but he seemed to find that too much to ask just 12 days later.

      "bodyText": "Sandown\u2019s increasingly popular final to the veterans chase series has once more produced a big field of familiar names but the oddity this year is a drying surface which is unlikely to be perfect for many of them. Houblon Des Obeaux (3.00) could not be mistaken for a fast horse but he has plenty of form on good to soft ground and, at 20-1, makes a lot of appeal with the Venetia Williams yard suddenly in tremendous form. Now 12, he did not appear to relish heavy going for his first two starts this year but he showed plenty of ability last season, including when winning over this course and distance. If the light still burns within, he has dropped to a very attractive mark of 135; the last time he was rated so low was for a handicap hurdle on New Year\u2019s Day seven years ago, which he won. 1.50 Sandown As Laurina is second-favourite for the Champion Hurdle she really ought to be up to winning a Listed contest for mares and cannot sensibly be opposed, for all that her odds will be extremely short. Sensulano has potential but her latest success was in a handicap hurdle off a rating of 129 and that does not entitle her to get near the Irish raider. 2.05 Wincanton Though The Dellercheckout was perhaps a touch fortunate to win his Irish point to point, in which he was the only finisher, he looks a chaser and was a bit big at some of his hurdles when third at Ludlow last month. This might be a good time to catch him, on his chasing debut with Bryony Frost aboard for the first time. 2.25 Sandown Rathhill is favourite to give Nicky Henderson a sixth Tolworth success and is evidently held in high regard. But it is possible he may struggle, on this drying ground, to reel in Elixir De Nutz, who made all to score at Cheltenham in both November and December. On the latter occasion he beat Jarveys Plate, who boosted the form by springing a surprise in a Listed contest on New Year\u2019s Day. 2.40 Wincanton Having opened at 12-1 in places, Tight Call looks a potential source of value in his first handicap. He showed good battling qualities when edged out by Kajaki at Wetherby in November, his first defeat under rules, and the worth of that form has been upheld by first and third. 3.15 Wincanton Connections of Copain De Classe had a go at winning with a penalty after he scored by 10 lengths in late October but he seemed to find that too much to ask just 12 days later. He has since had a decent break and may be worth chancing again, only 7lb higher than for his win. He faces Calipto, from the in-form Williams yard, but this one has been hard to win with. 3.35 Sandown It looked as though Court Royale was better than his ninth-place finish in Ascot\u2019s Betfair Hurdle last month, when he was given a lot to do. The form of his previous Taunton win looks respectable and he should be a force if resuming his progress here.",
