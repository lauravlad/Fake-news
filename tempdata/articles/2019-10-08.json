I came here in the confident hope of hearing proposals that could take negotiations forward. However, I must note that there has been no progress.</p> \n   <p>As you know, a deal between the EU and UK requires not only a positive meaningful vote of the House of Commons, but also the European Parliament\u2019s approval.</p> \n   <p>It is therefore important that the UK prime minister hears directly from the European parliament on its approach to Brexit. I am grateful to Mr Johnson for giving me that opportunity.</p> \n   <p>Our approach is very straightforward. We think an orderly Brexit, the UK leaving with a deal, is by far the best outcome. The deal that we thought had been agreed with the UK last year was a text the EP could have supported. It resolved all the issues associated with the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. It provided certainty for citizens and businesses. It looked forward to a close future EU-UK relationship. As things stand, it remains the best possible agreement.</p> \n   <p>As I explained to Mr Johnson, the parliament will not agree to a deal at any price. We will not agree to a deal that undermines the Good Friday agreement and the peace process or compromise the integrity of our single market. This we made plain in our resolution adopted with a huge majority in September.</p> \n   <p>We have examined the UK proposals to replace the original backstop and our response is that these are a long way from something to which the parliament could agree. In addition, they are not immediately operable.</p> \n   <p>Negotiations, I know, are continuing and the parliament, through its Brexit steering group, is being kept fully informed by Michel Barnier of the progress on those talks.</p> \n   <p>There are two alternatives to a deal at this juncture: extension or no deal.</p> \n   <p>On an extension, the parliament is open to this possibility, should there be a good reason or purpose for this.

Several times he was asked to denounce the unattributable No 10 briefing to the Spectator yesterday, that is widely assumed to have come from Dominic Cummings, his former adviser when Gove was education secretary. But Gove refused. </p> \n  <p>There may be many reasons why but for interesting background, and one probable explanatory factor, it is well worth reading <strong>Harry Lambert</strong>\u2019s long and excellent profile of Cummings <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/09/dominic-cummings-machiavel-downing-street\">in the New Statesman last month.</a> This is what Lambert says about the Cummings/Gove relationship.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[As a special adviser at education] Cummings governed through conflict. Chris Lockwood, then of the No 10 policy unit, remembers him as being \u201cawkward, abrupt, arrogant, aggressive, chronically late. He\u2019d change a meeting [time], he wouldn\u2019t turn up.\u201d And yet his position in the department was unassailable, for a simple reason: Gove considered himself to be in Cummings\u2019s lasting debt. \u201cI could never disavow Dominic,\u201d Gove once told a friend, \u201cI owe him everything.\u201d</p> \n   <p>In May 2009, the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal broke, and nearly claimed Michael Gove. He had claimed on expenses \u00a37,000 for redecorating a house, having spent thousands on high-end interior design. In Gove\u2019s mind, he hung on because of Cummings, \u201cwho put together a strategy for him not having to resign\u201d, says someone who knows them. Gove paid back the money, apologised, and survived.</p> \n   <p>A year later Cummings rescued him again. With the coalition government two months old and austerity imminent, Gove\u2019s education department repeatedly published an incorrect list of schools whose building projects would be scrapped. </p> \n   <p>\u201cIt was a big issue, and it looked like Michael would have to resign \u2013 we were all floundering around hopelessly,\u201d says a member of the department. Cummings, in exile at the time, was parachuted in.

Here is an extract from the FT story.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Businesses would be hit with an annual \u00a315bn bill for filling in customs forms for trade between the UK and the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to a British government paper published on Monday ...</p> \n   <p>HMRC\u2019s figures are likely to be on the low side as they did not include the additional costs of complying with new VAT procedures for services companies, which dominate the UK economy, or for new VAT rules that would apply to parcels following a no-deal Brexit. They also exclude the one-off costs businesses would incur in preparing to fill in customs declarations. </p> \n   <p>It is estimated that large companies importing and exporting in high volumes would face a cost of \u00a328 for filling in the forms for each load imported and that this would take an employee 1hr 45mins on average. If the work was outsourced, HMRC estimates the cost would rise to \u00a356 for each consignment, based on the average charges of freight forwarders.</p> \n   <p>This is the first time that HMRC has published such a detailed analysis of the costs to businesses in the UK and EU. It said: \u201cThe final costs of completing customs declarations will vary significantly from business to business depending on how often they trade.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McDonnell then referred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/no-deal-brexit-would-push-national-debt-to-levels-last-seen-in-60s\">the IFS estimate</a> that a no-deal Brexit would send government debt to its highest level for half a century. And he raised the anonymous No 10 briefing to the Spectator, saying that he thought Dominic Cummings was responsible. Condemning the proposal in the briefing to put the \u201cduty of sincere cooperation\u201d in the toilet, McDonnell summed up saying:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The reckless incompetence of this government just knows no bounds, does it?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Jesse Norman,</strong> the Treasury minister responding for the government, said <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-impact-assessment-for-the-movement-of-goods-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal/hmrc-impact-assessment-for-the-movement-of-goods-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal-third-edition\">the HM Revenue and Customs report (pdf)</a> about the cost of a no-deal Brexit for exporters put the cost of a no-deal to business at \u00a37.5bn - before taking into account any mitigations put in place. He referred to this passage in the report.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The latest static estimate for the annual administrative burden on UK businesses from additional import and export declarations is \u00a37.5bn (updated to reflect 2017 data), with import declarations accounting for around half of this figure.

They think now that if there is another delay we will keep coming back with new proposals. This won\u2019t happen. We\u2019ll either leave with no deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with no deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>And the Tories would fight a general election on a no-deal platform, the source says. </strong>The source writes:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To marginalise the Brexit party, we will have to fight the election on the basis of \u2018no more delays, get Brexit done immediately\u2019 ...</p> \n   <p>We will focus on winning the election on a manifesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson has not publicly said what his Brexit policy would be in an election: default to no deal, or make a final attempt after the election to agree a deal. The source is saying it would be the former. Essentially this would mean adapting the Brexit party\u2019s policy. Nigel Farage\u2019s party also wants no deal, although it calls that a \u201cclean break\u201d Brexit.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Tories would win on such a platform, the source says.</strong> The source writes:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Those who supported delay will face the inevitable consequences of being seen to interfere in domestic politics in a deeply unpopular way by colluding with a parliament that is as popular as the clap.</p> \n   <p>Those who pushed the Benn act intended to sabotage a deal and they\u2019ve probably succeeded. So the main effect of it will probably be to help us win an election by uniting the leave vote and then a no-deal Brexit. History is full of such ironies and tragedies.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is not yet proven, but could well turn out to be true.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>No 1</strong><strong>0 is still considering how it might circumvent the Benn act, which is intended to ensure that Johnson obtains a Brexit extension if he fails to get a deal by 19 October, the source reveals</strong>. The source writes:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So, if talks go nowhere this week, the next phase will require us to set out our view on the surrender act. The act imposes narrow duties. Our legal advice is clear that we can do all sorts of things to scupper delay, which for obvious reasons we aren\u2019t going into details about. Different lawyers see the \u201cfrustration principle\u201d very differently especially on a case like this where there is no precedent for primary legislation directing how the PM conducts international discussions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is highly controversial because it undermines the impression given by the government\u2019s evidence to the court of session in Edinburgh that Johnson would, in the event of a deal not being agreed, send a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit extension, as required by the Benn act. But the source is not saying the PM would not send a letter; instead, the argument is that other tactics might be used to \u201cscupper delay\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>No 10 would threaten to retaliate against any EU countries that back an article 50 extension, the source suggests.</strong> Here is the main quote, with a sentence in square brackets from Forsyth.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will make clear privately and publicly that countries which oppose delay will go the front of the queue for future cooperation \u2013 cooperation on things both within and outside EU competences. Those who support delay will go to the bottom of the queue. [This source also made clear that defence and security cooperation will inevitably be affected if the EU tries to keep Britain in against the will of its government] Supporting delay will be seen by this government as hostile interference in domestic politics, and over half of the public will agree with us.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is a further quote.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[In the event of a Brexit delay] we will wash our hands of it, we won\u2019t engage in further talks, we obviously won\u2019t given any undertakings about cooperative behaviour, everything to do with \u2018duty of sincere cooperation\u2019 will be in the toilet, we will focus on winning the election on a manifesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>\u201cThe duty of sincere cooperation\u201d is a standard feature of EU agreements and is included in <a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/XT-20013-2019-INIT/en/pdf\">the text (pdf)</a> of the agreement approving the last Brexit extension (until 31 October). </p> \n  <p>These passages are incendiary because they imply that the UK might withhold security cooperation from EU countries that back a Brexit extension. When Nick Timothy was working in Downing Street as Theresa May\u2019s chief policy adviser, he also used to float the idea that security could be used as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. But May herself never seemed very keen on that approach, and the idea was abandoned after Timothy was sacked following the 2017 general election. Now it seems to be back on the table.</p> \n  <p>But there is a problem with this threat. Any Brexit extension would have to be agreed unanimously by the EU27, as well as by the UK, and if all 27 were at the back of the queue, they would effectively all also be at the front of the queue too.</p> \n  <p>The first paragraph suggests that No 10 thinks its best hope of sidestepping the Benn act is to get a country like Hungary to veto a Brexit extension. But Hungary and Poland (the other country targeted by Brexiters) have both signalled they are not interested. The FT\u2019s <strong>George Parker</strong> explains why.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeWParker/status/1181472194028871680\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EU member states (eg Hungary) considering the threats emanating from No 10 this morning over whether to back a Brexit extension may wonder whether <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a> has more to offer them than the EU regional aid budget - currently E350bn - soon to be reallocated</p>\u2014 George Parker (@GeorgeWParker) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeWParker/status/1181472194028871680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 8, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The first paragraph is also interesting because it claims No 10 will depict an EU decision to grant a Brexit extension as \u201chostile interference in domestic politics\u201d. This is obviously nonsense, because any such extension would be in line with the expressed wishes of the UK parliament. But the source has clearly seen polling saying that a majority of voters would agree with the \u201chostile interference\u201d claim.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>No 10 would blame parliament for a Brexit delay, the source says. </strong>The source writes:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When they say \u2018so what is the point of delay?\u2019, we will say \u201cThis is not our delay, the government is not asking for a delay \u2014 parliament is sending you a letter and parliament is asking for a delay but official government policy remains that delay is an atrocious idea that everyone should dismiss. Any delay will in effect be negotiated between you, parliament, and the courts.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The real significance of this passage is that it amounts to an admission that, despite the claims about being able to \u201cscupper delay\u201d, there is a strong chance that those efforts will fail and that the Benn act will turn out to be robust. </p> \n  <p>It is also worth noting that the claim that the public will blame parliament primarily for a delay is true.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: Hopes of reaching a Brexit deal before the upcoming deadline were almost extinguished as unofficial Downing Street briefings suggested the government saw little prospect of an agreement. Officially, however, No 10 said talks were at a \u201ccritical point\u201d, but were continuing. And the prime minister was due to meet the Irish taoiseach later this week. The unofficial No 10 briefing claimed the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had insisted that Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union was the price of a deal. A Merkel ally dismissed the claim, saying it would run counter to longstanding German government policy and accusing Johnson of trying to place the blame for his failure to secure a deal on Germany. Later, the president of the European Council suggested Boris Johnson was seeking to win \u201csome stupid blame game\u201d. Donald Tusk criticised the prime minister after the series of unofficial briefings. The president of the European parliament dismissed Johnson\u2019s plans, saying they did not amount to an \u201cactual proposal\u201d. David Sassoli said a meeting with the prime minister on Tuesday had left him feeling \u201clike I was in a TV talk show\u201d. Labour accused No 10 of trying to sabotage the Brexit talks, while several other figures in the UK and within the EU27 said the blame for a no-deal Brexit would lie with London. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, accused Johnson of a \u201cpathetically transparent\u201d attempt to shift the blame on to Angela Merkel Merkel. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart, Daniel Boffey, Rowena Mason and Peter Walker have the full story: The language around the Brexit process had become toxic \u201cin some quarters\u201d, the Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar has acknowledged. But he added: I don\u2019t play dirty and I don\u2019t think most EU leaders do either. We\u2019ve been very straight up when the referendum happened three years ago. The UK has decided to leave the European Union, we respect that, but they made commitments to us that there would be no hard border between north and south, that the all-island economy would be protected and so would citizens\u2019 rights, and north-south co-operation as envisaged by the Good Friday agreement would continue. It\u2019s my job to hold them to those commitments that they made in good faith. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has met the US ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, to urge the latter country to reconsider its position on the diplomatic immunity given to the suspect in the case of Harry Dunn, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. A spokeswoman said: The foreign secretary met the US ambassador today and urged the US to reconsider its position and do the right thing by Harry Dunn\u2019s family. Downing Street has now issued its own account of the discussions between the prime minister and the president of the European parliament, David Sassoli. A No 10 spokesperson has said: The prime minister welcomed President Sassoli of the European parliament to Downing Street this afternoon. The prime minister stated his preference for leaving the EU with a deal. He emphasised that the UK\u2019s proposal represents a significant step and a reasonable compromise which respects the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, the single market and provides for democratic consent in Northern Ireland. The prime minister set out how there is little time remaining to negotiate a new agreement, and so we need to move quickly and work together to agree a deal. He reiterated that, if we did not reach an agreement, then the UK will leave without a deal on 31 October. The leaders discussed the need to approve any revised withdrawal agreement in both parliaments. The prime minister also spoke about the generous offer that the UK has made on citizens\u2019 rights and called for other member states to reciprocate the offer for UK citizens living in the EU. Sassoli has been scathing in his assessment of Johnson\u2019s offer and this evening\u2019s talks. The London assembly has now received a response on behalf of Boris Johnson to its request for him to explain his links to Jennifer Arcuri. A spokeswoman for the assembly said correspondence had been received shortly after 7pm on Tuesday \u2013 after the 6pm deadline the institution said it had set No 10. She said the London assembly was unable to publish the response and declined to confirm whether or not it fully addressed the issue at hand. Sassoli\u2019s sounding downbeat at this evening\u2019s press briefing and the tone\u2019s no lighter on his official Twitter account: Here\u2019s the damning statement he\u2019s just issued on his talks with Johnson, in which he makes clear his belief that a no-deal scenario would \u201cclearly be the responsibility of the UK government\u201d: I have just had a meeting with Prime Minister Johnson. I came here in the confident hope of hearing proposals that could take negotiations forward. However, I must note that there has been no progress. As you know, a deal between the EU and UK requires not only a positive meaningful vote of the House of Commons, but also the European Parliament\u2019s approval. It is therefore important that the UK prime minister hears directly from the European parliament on its approach to Brexit. I am grateful to Mr Johnson for giving me that opportunity. Our approach is very straightforward. We think an orderly Brexit, the UK leaving with a deal, is by far the best outcome. The deal that we thought had been agreed with the UK last year was a text the EP could have supported. It resolved all the issues associated with the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. It provided certainty for citizens and businesses. It looked forward to a close future EU-UK relationship. As things stand, it remains the best possible agreement. As I explained to Mr Johnson, the parliament will not agree to a deal at any price. We will not agree to a deal that undermines the Good Friday agreement and the peace process or compromise the integrity of our single market. This we made plain in our resolution adopted with a huge majority in September. We have examined the UK proposals to replace the original backstop and our response is that these are a long way from something to which the parliament could agree. In addition, they are not immediately operable. Negotiations, I know, are continuing and the parliament, through its Brexit steering group, is being kept fully informed by Michel Barnier of the progress on those talks. There are two alternatives to a deal at this juncture: extension or no deal. On an extension, the parliament is open to this possibility, should there be a good reason or purpose for this. But requesting an extension is a matter for the UK and it is not my place to comment on the political controversies or legal issues that are being debated in the United Kingdom. As far as no deal is concerned, we are very clear that this would be a very negative outcome. It will be economically damaging to both parties, in particular to the UK. It will have very serious consequences on the island of Ireland. It will increase uncertainty for business and above all for citizens. \u201cNo deal\u201d would clearly be the responsibility of the UK government. On citizens, we will continue to ensure that in all scenarios their rights are protected. I do hope a no-deal outcome can be avoided, but if not, the EU has taken the necessary measures to prepare for this outcome. I continue to place my faith in good sense and responsibility but among friends, duty demands that we tell each other the truth. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has refused to discuss her phone call with Boris Johnson this evening, briefing journalists instead about her conversation with the Estonian president and declining to take questions. The UK\u2019s proposals to replace the backstop are \u201cnot immediately operable\u201d and are a \u201clong way from something to which the [European] parliament could agree\u201d, the institution\u2019s president has said after this evening\u2019s discussions with Boris Johnson. David Sassoli said the European parliament wanted a Brexit deal, but would not accept one \u201cat any price\u201d and would not agree to proposals that undermine the Good Friday agreement or the internal market. There are two alternatives to a deal at this juncture: Extension or no deal. Sassoli said the European parliament would be open to a delay if it served a purpose, but refused to comment on the political controversies or legal issues\u201d that relate to the requirement upon the prime minister to request one. And he reiterated the line that a no-deal outcome would be overwhelmingly negative. The chairman of the London assembly oversight committee, Len Duvall, has said: It is very disappointing that we have not received a response from the prime minister. Missing the deadline of a polite request to fully cooperate is unhelpful and this already serious situation has now become grave. The allegations of potential misuse of taxpayers\u2019 money are no laughing matter. We will be taking this further. There are now a range of options available to us. Next week, the oversight committee will meet to discuss those options and decide on its next course of action. You can be assured that the London assembly will investigate this matter with absolute commitment. Boris Johnson\u2019s missed the London assembly oversight committee\u2019s 6pm deadline to explain his links to Jennifer Arcuri. A spokesperson for the prime minister has said he still intends to respond on Tuesday evening. As we revealed earlier, the prime minister failed to publicly disclose the full extent of his links with Arcuri in his official diary of appointments and activities as mayor of London. The mayoral diary, released under freedom of information laws, provides a detailed list of thousands of Johnson\u2019s meetings and engagements, from summits with world leaders to mundane listings such as \u201ctea with a tourist\u201d. But in the hundreds of pages of appointments, the diaries contain no public reference to Arcuri, the businesswoman at the centre of a conflict of interest allegation after her firm received thousands of pounds of public money while Johnson was mayor. Besides the call with the Irish taoiseach, the prime minister has just welcomed the European parliament president, David Sassoli, to Downing Street. Boris Johnson met the EU politician on the steps of No 10 and they both waved to the press, before heading to talk in the White room. Here\u2019s a little more from No 10 on this evening\u2019s discussions with Varadkar. A Downing Street spokesperson has said: The prime minister spoke to the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar tonight. Both sides strongly reiterated their desire to reach a Brexit deal. They hope to meet in person later this week. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Nineteen Labour MPs have signed an open letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, saying that a Brexit extension would \u201csolve nothing and add to public division and disenchantment with politics\u201d. They say the UK and the EU should work \u201cnight and day\u201d to get a deal so that parliament can pass it in the next few weeks. This contradicts the official Labour position, which is that there should be an extension now to take the threat of no-deal off the table. This is from Caroline Flint, one of the 19 signatories. This is from Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. Speaking to the Scottish parliamentary journalists\u2019 association earlier today, the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair renewed his call for a second referendum on Brexit to take place ahead of a general election. Having an election first would be a trap for Labour, he suggested. He said the opposition was divided and an election could end up with Boris Johnson winning and claiming a mandate for a no-deal Brexit. He said: The [Tory] strategy is laid out very clearly, and it\u2019s a vast elephant trap of great width and depth, with neon signs flashing around it saying: \u2018Elephant trap - elephants of limited awareness please fall in\u2019. They should avoid that ... The right thing is indeed to go back to the people but I beg you, please, not by way of a general election. To mix a general election up with the specific issue of Brexit is wrong in principle and it\u2019s wrong in the politics. Blair also claimed that the resignation of Ruth Davidson as Scottish Tory leader created an opportunity for Scottish Labour. He said: My belief is that it will be clear over these next months that there is the potential for a renewal of the centre ground of politics. That\u2019s true in the UK as a whole and I think that\u2019s true in Scotland as well. With the departure of Ruth Davidson from the scene of politics in Scotland, there is a very open space for the competition for that centre-ground vote. As for what might happen in a general election, here are the figures from the ComRes poll last night. And here are the figures from the Britain Elects poll tracker, which is an average of all polls. Scotland\u2019s deputy first minister John Swinney accused the UK government of making planning for a no deal \u201cunnecessarily difficult\u201d as he set out the SNP government\u2019s current preparations to Holyrood this afternoon. Announcing the establishment of a Scottish medicines shortage response roup, as well as a \u00a37m rapid poverty mitigation fund to scale up measures to alleviate food, fuel and housing needs, Swinney told MSPs that the UK government\u2019s approach has been \u201cto actively limit the analysis shared with us, to exclude the Scottish government from decision-making, and to fail to share with us its own plans for actions to mitigate \u2018no deal\u2019.\u201d Swinney also used the statement to announce plans to use the old port in Stranraer, on the key Northern Irish ferry route, to hold up to 300 HGVs should traffic flows between Northern Ireland and Scotland increase to that extent. And said that farmers and crofters are receiving 95% of their common agricultural policy payments early to shield them from the immediate effects of crashing out of the EU without a deal at the end of the month. Here is the privy council order for the prorogation of parliament tonight. Michelle O\u2019Neill, the Sinn Fein leader in Northern Ireland, has meetings with EU officials in Brussels tomorrow. She has issued this statement explaining the message she will be delivering to them. Today I led a Sinn F\u00e9in delegation which met with business representatives across retail, manufacturing, communications, hospitality and the food and drink industry and others concerned with the disastrous impact of Brexit on our economy. The consistent message from all of the meetings is that the consequences of Brexit will be dire for the north. They cannot plan for the future and are desperately worried about the prospect of job losses and economic collapse. That is the reality for the economy in the north regardless of what the DUP or any other delusional Brexit cheerleaders may say. This evening I will be travelling to Brussels for a series of meetings with EU diplomats. I will be making it clear to them that they have to remain firm on the need to avoid any hardening of the border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and protect our economy. The north\u2019s economy cannot withstand being excluded from the customs union and the single market and that is the message we will be bringing loud and clear to the EU. And these are from the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler. This is from Politico\u2019s chief Europe correspondent, Matthew Karnitschnig. Detlef Seif, the Brexit spokesman for Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU parliamentary group, tells me that the account of the Merkel/Boris Johnson conversation being given by unattributable No 10 sources (see 11.18am) does not ring true. He explains: In my mind it is completely improbable that the phone call between Merkel and Johnson took place in the way it has been reported in the British media. It would run counter to all the principles the German government has followed for the last three years, namely that the negotiations are led by the European commission. For the German chancellor to insist on Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union would completely breach these guidelines. There has been a lot of scepticism about Johnson\u2019s proposal in Berlin, but Merkel\u2019s attitude has always been a positive one, to find out if there is room for a compromise. The only explanation I can see for these reports is that Johnson is trying to build a story where he blames Germany for a no-deal Brexit. To brief out a confidential phone call in such a manner is utterly unprofessional and infuriating to anyone who has been working on a deal. Here is some German reaction to the No 10 briefing about the Johnson/Merkel call. From Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, chair of the foreign affairs committee in the German parliament and a member of Merkel\u2019s CDU party From Johann Wadephul, a German MP and deputy chair of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group DeepL translates this as: When @BorisJohnson points his finger at #Merkel, three fingers point to him. He doesn\u2019t want to admit that the so-called backstop regulation is unavoidable. Neither Ireland nor the EU can or want to allow an uncontrolled external border. #Brexit @cducsubt In his opening statement to MPs Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said consumers of certain foods might benefit from the tariffs that would apply in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He told the Commons: I should say as a result of cutting these tariffs, we should see a 15% reduction in the cost of honey from New Zealand, a 9% cut in the cost of grapes from South America and a 7% reduction in the cost of wine from Argentina. But the National Farmers Union has got a much more bleak assessment of the updated no-deal tariff schedule published this morning. The NFU president Minette Batters said: We will see - from day one - farm businesses facing new, high tariffs on much of the 60% of our exports that go into the EU, while tariffs on goods coming into the UK will be set far, far lower, and in many cases won\u2019t be applied at all. Without the maintenance of tariff protections, we are in danger of opening up the UK to imported food which would be illegal to be produced here, produced at a lower cost because it may fail to meet the environmental and animal welfare standards which are legally required of our own farmers \u2013 flooding our market and resulting in unsustainable price falls. Not only could this be terrible news for farmers, whose very businesses will be under threat, but also for consumers who enjoy the high-quality and affordable British food they produce. Farmers are going to feel betrayed by this government\u2019s failure to act now in making sure that all that can be done is being done to help mitigate the damaging effects of a no-deal Brexit. The Michael Gove statement is now over. Several times he was asked to denounce the unattributable No 10 briefing to the Spectator yesterday, that is widely assumed to have come from Dominic Cummings, his former adviser when Gove was education secretary. But Gove refused. There may be many reasons why but for interesting background, and one probable explanatory factor, it is well worth reading Harry Lambert\u2019s long and excellent profile of Cummings in the New Statesman last month. This is what Lambert says about the Cummings/Gove relationship. [As a special adviser at education] Cummings governed through conflict. Chris Lockwood, then of the No 10 policy unit, remembers him as being \u201cawkward, abrupt, arrogant, aggressive, chronically late. He\u2019d change a meeting [time], he wouldn\u2019t turn up.\u201d And yet his position in the department was unassailable, for a simple reason: Gove considered himself to be in Cummings\u2019s lasting debt. \u201cI could never disavow Dominic,\u201d Gove once told a friend, \u201cI owe him everything.\u201d In May 2009, the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal broke, and nearly claimed Michael Gove. He had claimed on expenses \u00a37,000 for redecorating a house, having spent thousands on high-end interior design. In Gove\u2019s mind, he hung on because of Cummings, \u201cwho put together a strategy for him not having to resign\u201d, says someone who knows them. Gove paid back the money, apologised, and survived. A year later Cummings rescued him again. With the coalition government two months old and austerity imminent, Gove\u2019s education department repeatedly published an incorrect list of schools whose building projects would be scrapped. \u201cIt was a big issue, and it looked like Michael would have to resign \u2013 we were all floundering around hopelessly,\u201d says a member of the department. Cummings, in exile at the time, was parachuted in. He \u201cbanged heads together\u201d, produced the right list, and started to play the media more successfully. Chris Leslie, the Independent Group for Change MP, asks Gove to condemn the No 10 briefing against Angela Merkel this morning. He says it has provoked \u201cracist\u201d attacks against Germany from Leave.EU (eg, here) and others. Gove says he did not hear Boris Johnson\u2019s call with Merkel. But he says the Germans are \u201cgood friends of this country\u201d. And he disassociates himself from any racist language about them. But he does not comment on the substance of the No 10 briefings. Back in the Commons Gove claims he has yet to meet a single business or business organisation that thinks a no-deal Brexit would be worse than a Jeremy Corbyn government. From my colleague Rajeev Syal Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP from North Down in Northern Ireland, says Boris Johnson will never be forgotten or forgiven for undermining the Good Friday agreement. Gove says he respects Hermon, but does not think it is the PM\u2019s intention for a moment to undermine the GFA. The Tory former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell invited Gove to condemn the unattributable briefings coming out of No 10. (See 10.25am and 10.34am.) He asked Gove if he was \u201cproud of the character\u201d of these \u201cquasi-official briefings\u201d. Gove did not criticise the briefings directly, but he said in politics it was important to use language that showed respect for people with differing points of view. UPDATE: These are from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs select committee, asks about the suggestions from the unnamed No 10 source who briefed the Spectator that the UK should use security as leverage in the Brexit talks. (See 10.25am.) Sir Keir Starmer also asked about this, but did not get a reply. Cooper asks Gove to condemn this threat. He says anyone making threats like this should be removed from No 10. She says people in government need to behave like grownups. Gove says it is vitally important that the UK retains security cooperation with its EU allies. But he says the UK also cooperates with countries outside the EU. He says the UK will continue to cooperate with the Irish police force, and with other police forces. He says the home secretary, Priti Patel, has written to the European commission asking if security cooperation in various areas can continue after Brexit. But the EU declined the offer. So it is the UK that is more committed to security cooperation than the EU, he says. Here is Michael Gove\u2019s peroration as he was responding to Sir Keir Starmer. We in this government have compromised. We in this government are showing flexibility. We in this government seek to leave [with] a deal. But, faced with the delaying, disruptive and denying tactics of the opposition, we say on behalf of the 17.4m: \u2018Enough, enough, enough - we need to leave.\u2019 Actually, Gove said: \u201cWe in this government seek to leave without a deal,\u201d but he clearly meant with a deal, which is why I have transcribed it as such above. But if you believe in Freudian slips, that may be revealing. From Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt Gove is responding to Starmer. He says the PM is not here because he is talking to EU partners. He says, if Starmer wanted a deal, he should not have voted against one three times. He says his no-deal readiness document was published three hours ago. But Starmer has not asked a single question about it, he says. He says Starmer is only interested in politics, not policy. On customs checks in Northern Ireland, he says they can take place away from the border. He says the UK plans would protect the integrity of the single market. But is Labour serious about protecting the integrity of the UK? He claims it isn\u2019t, because it would be happy for there to be a border down the Irish Sea. (In fact, Labour wants the whole of the UK to stay in the customs union.) He says the government wants to get a deal. But faced with the \u201cdelaying, denying and disruptive tactics of the opposition\u201d, the government says enough is enough, let\u2019s get on and leave. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is responding to Gove. The prime minister should be here. Talks with the EU are collapsing as we speak. Starmer says the UK offer to the EU for a replacement to the backstop is not serious. These plans \u201cwere never going to work\u201d, he says. But, instead of taking questions about the talks, the government is descending into a blame game. He quotes the briefings from sources close to No 10. They are blaming various other people. He says this is characteristic of Boris Johnson - never taking responsibility for his actions. He says threatening to withdraw security cooperation from the EU, as a No 10 source did yesterday, is \u201cbeneath contempt\u201d. He challenges Gove to deny this, and to back what Julian Smith said about this. (See 12.04pm.) He asks Gove if the government thinks the talks are over. He says Gove has presented Brexit as if he were reading a reassuring bedtime story. But the last time Gove was here he said the automative sector said it was ready for no deal, when in fact the industry said that was not true. He quotes the IFS analysis of no deal. That is why the Benn act was so essential, he says. Gove turns to the opportunities for Britain from Brexit. It will be able to take its seat at the WTO. It will be able to have a points-based immigration policy. It will be able to have its own policies for fishing and farming. It will be able to set its own rules for the service sector. But of course no deal will bring challenges, he says. He repeats the point about how the government wants a deal. But he says delaying Brexit would be damaging, too, because it would let down the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit. Gove summarises some of the actions taken by departments to prepare for no deal. But he says the EU needs to reciprocate. They should match the \u201cgenerosity and flexibility\u201d shown to EU nationals living in the UK, he says. So far \u201cvery few\u201d EU states have matched what the UK has offered to EU nationals here, he says. Gove says the government has also today published its updated tariff regime for a no-deal Brexit. Here is the Guardian story about that announcement. In the Commons, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, is making a statement about the no-deal readiness report published today. He says the government has a \u201cstrong desire to leave with a deal\u201d. From ITV\u2019s Europe editor, James Mates. In the Commons, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has just asked an urgent question about Brexit. He started by raising the HM Revenue and Customs figures, quoted by the Financial Times today (paywall), saying form-filling after a no-deal Brexit would cost business \u00a315bn. Here is an extract from the FT story. Businesses would be hit with an annual \u00a315bn bill for filling in customs forms for trade between the UK and the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to a British government paper published on Monday ... HMRC\u2019s figures are likely to be on the low side as they did not include the additional costs of complying with new VAT procedures for services companies, which dominate the UK economy, or for new VAT rules that would apply to parcels following a no-deal Brexit. They also exclude the one-off costs businesses would incur in preparing to fill in customs declarations. It is estimated that large companies importing and exporting in high volumes would face a cost of \u00a328 for filling in the forms for each load imported and that this would take an employee 1hr 45mins on average. If the work was outsourced, HMRC estimates the cost would rise to \u00a356 for each consignment, based on the average charges of freight forwarders. This is the first time that HMRC has published such a detailed analysis of the costs to businesses in the UK and EU. It said: \u201cThe final costs of completing customs declarations will vary significantly from business to business depending on how often they trade.\u201d McDonnell then referred to the IFS estimate that a no-deal Brexit would send government debt to its highest level for half a century. And he raised the anonymous No 10 briefing to the Spectator, saying that he thought Dominic Cummings was responsible. Condemning the proposal in the briefing to put the \u201cduty of sincere cooperation\u201d in the toilet, McDonnell summed up saying: The reckless incompetence of this government just knows no bounds, does it? Jesse Norman, the Treasury minister responding for the government, said the HM Revenue and Customs report (pdf) about the cost of a no-deal Brexit for exporters put the cost of a no-deal to business at \u00a37.5bn - before taking into account any mitigations put in place. He referred to this passage in the report. The latest static estimate for the annual administrative burden on UK businesses from additional import and export declarations is \u00a37.5bn (updated to reflect 2017 data), with import declarations accounting for around half of this figure. The \u00a37.5bn estimates the administrative burden of completing customs declarations for all EU trade in goods movements. Norman also dismissed the Spectator report as unsourced speculation, and said debt was at a peacetime record at the end of the last Labour government. The difference between the figure quoted by the FT (\u00a315bn) and the figure quoted by Norman (\u00a315bn) is explained by the fact that the FT is quoting the total cost to British and EU businesses. It is referring to this passage in the HMRC report. HMRC therefore estimates that the static total ongoing administrative burden on UK-EU trade is \u00a315bn (updated to reflect 2017 data) a year. Considering the costs on both sides of the border is required to understand the impact on UK-EU trade, as costs imposed on UK or EU businesses will have wider implications for supply chains, and therefore for consumers and businesses in either market. This is from Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy PM. In Dublin, the Irish finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, has been presenting his budget. It was a budget \u201cdeveloped in the shadow of Brexit\u201d, he said. He continued: The context for Brexit has shifted to no deal as our central assumption. This does not mean no deal is inevitable, but equally we stand ready if it does happen. In preparing for no deal we can ensure the government has the necessary resources to meet the impact of Brexit. Donohoe said the Irish government was announcing \u20ac1.2bn of spending on Brexit. He explained: We must increase the level and range of supports to ensure our economy is protected and this is why we are announcing over \u20ac1.2bn, excluding EU funding, to respond to Brexit. This is in two parts. I am making approximately \u20ac200m in Brexit expenditure available next year across departments to increase staffing and upgrade ports and airports. This is to ensure we are ready for Brexit whatever form it takes. We will intervene to protect our economy. It will be borrowed money. If we do not need it we will not borrow it. A no deal is unpredictable. It will impact different sectors in different ways. Our response will demand flexibility. \u20ac650m euro will be made available to support agriculture and tourism and those most affected regions. These are from the Atlantic\u2019s Tom McTague on the Johnson/Merkel call. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman refused to comment on where the \u201cNo 10 source\u201d quotes came from regarding Boris Johnson\u2019s call with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. (See 10.34am.) But the spokesman did not disown the quotes, or dispute their accuracy. The spokesman said the call involved a \u201cfrank exchange\u201d on the progress of the Brexit talks. He said: The purpose of the call was to discuss the progress that has been made in the talks so far. I would describe it as a frank exchange. The prime minister set out that the UK had made what we believe to be a significant offer but if we are to make future progress then the EU will need to compromise itself. The spokesman also said the talks were at a \u201ccritical point\u201d. What is not clear yet to journalists is whether No 10 is just being more circumspect in public for normal, diplomatic reasons (governments are almost always more polite about each other in public than in private) or whether there is an actual split within No 10 itself, with the briefing to the BBC and Sky this morning came from one Downing Street faction more eager to see the Brexit talks collapse than other parts of the government machine. Several readers have made the point to me, BTL and by email, that Donald Tusk\u2019s Quo Vadis? quote at the end of his tweet criticising Boris Johnson (see 11.43am) may have had a particular resonance. Tusk is Polish, and Quo Vadis is the title of a famous Polish novel. In an email to me one reader explained it like this: Tusk saying Quo Vadis? to Johnson would resonate very differently to Tusk\u2019s Polish audience (he was once PM of Poland before the Law &amp; Order right-wingers took over). Quo Vadis is the title of a very famous Polish novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz (c 1896) set in Nero\u2019s time and refers to the apostle Peter meeting Christ. Nero is referred to as the Beast in the novel because of his outrageous behaviour politically, personally and morally. You would have to ask a Polish scholar whether Tusk is making a particular point. This is from Mujtaba Rahman, the Brexit specialist at the Eurasia consultancy. The problem for MPs is that they have missed the boat on a no confidence vote this week. It is too late to have one today, and tonight parliament prorogues. The new session starts with the Queen\u2019s speech on Monday. Normally a Queen\u2019s speech debate lasts for six days, which would postpone any confidence vote until the following week at the earliest, although it is possible that there may be a way of scheduling one before then. And these are from the BBC\u2019s Berlin correspondent, Jenny Hill. As the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Boris Johnson was notorious for giving misleading accounts of what happened in EU transactions. Some EU figures seem to think that, when he authorised his team to brief on his conversation with Angela Merkel this morning, he might have been at it again. From the Times\u2019 Brussels correspondent, Bruno Waterfield Here is the Sun\u2019s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, on what he\u2019s learnt about this morning\u2019s cabinet. This is from Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary. He is rejecting one of the key proposals in the unofficial No 10 briefing given to the Spectator. (See 10.25am.) With Boris Johnson apparently all set to enter the general election hijacking the Brexit party\u2019s Brexit platform (no deal \u2013 see 10.25am), Nigel Farage, the party\u2019s leader, might need a new USP. Perhaps he is rehearsing one here \u2013 calling the EU a \u201cmonstrous project\u201d that should be \u201ckilled off\u201d. The European commission has said at its daily briefing that the Brexit talks are continuing. This is from the Independent\u2019s Jon Stone. And this is from the commission\u2019s Pablo P\u00e9rez, featuring a clip of the commission\u2019s chief spokeswoman Mina Andreeva. This is from Baiba Bra\u017ee, the Latvian ambassador to the UK, making the same point as Donald Tusk. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has posted a tweet responding to the briefing from No 10 today (see 10.25am and 10.34am). Unusually, he has directed it at Boris Johnson personally \u2013 including a payoff in Latin (because Johnson, of course, is a classicist). The government has just published a 155-page \u201cNo Deal Readiness Report\u201d (pdf). This is from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said that Angela Merkel\u2019s reported insistence that Northern Ireland must stay in the EU customs union is \u201cbeyond crazy\u201d and unacceptable. In a statement she said: The comments from the German chancellor to the prime minister that Northern Ireland must remain in the EU customs union forever now reveal the real objective of Dublin and the European Union. For the United Kingdom to be asked to leave a part of its sovereign territory in a foreign organisation of which the UK would no longer be a part and over which we would have no say whatsoever is beyond crazy. No UK government could ever concede such a surrender. The EU is not interested in a negotiated outcome at this time. Their position is the UK can only leave with a deal if it agrees a binding piece of international law permanently tying either the whole country or a part of it to the EU\u2019s legal order over which it has no control. The true purpose of the \u201cbackstop\u201d is now in the open for all to see. Those who eagerly supported the backstop as the best of both worlds can now see the error of that assessment. It was neither temporary nor an insurance policy. It appears that Martin Selmayr\u2019s remarks about Northern Ireland being the price of Brexit is still the EU negotiating stance. The prime minister\u2019s proposals have flushed out Dublin\u2019s real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom\u2019s elected representatives would be in the driving seat. We will not accept any such ultimatum or outcome. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, \u201ccrazy\u201d is the word Tory MPs were advised to use to describe the EU policy in an email sent out by No 10 last week, according to a BuzzFeed report. Selmayr was secretary general of the European commission until the summer. It has been alleged that in private he said Northern Ireland would be the price the UK paid for Brexit (because it would end up joining Ireland), but he strongly denied ever saying that. AFP\u2019s Deborah Cole, who is based in Berlin, says the No 10 account of what Angela Merkel told Boris Johnson (see 10.34am) does not quite ring true. The BBC\u2019s Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill agrees. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, says the briefing from No 10 this morning (see 10.34am) reinforces the case for a no-deal Brexit (or \u201cclean break\u201d, as he calls it). From the Times\u2019s Steven Swinford From the BBC\u2019s Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill From the Economist\u2019s Tom Nuttall Boris Johnson is poised to give up on Brexit deal talks with the EU after speaking to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, with a No 10 source briefing that an agreement looked \u201cessentially impossible not just now but ever\u201d, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. The pound is sinking on the back of the latest briefing from No 10, Bloomberg reports. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has accused No 10 of trying to sabotage the Brexit talks. Commenting on the briefing coming out of Downing Street about Boris Johnson\u2019s call with Angela Merkel this morning (see 10.34am), Starmer said: This is yet another cynical attempt by No 10 to sabotage the negotiations. Boris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit. It is now more important than ever that parliament unites to prevent this reckless government crashing us out of the EU at the end of the month. More briefing from Number 10. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. And this is from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates. No 10 sources have told the Guardian that these briefings are reliable. We are expecting official statements later. You can read James Forsyth\u2019s Spectator blog, in which he publishes, apparently more or less in full, a message he got yesterday from a \u201ccontact in No 10\u201d setting out Downing Street\u2019s thinking on the state of the Brexit process here. And here are the main points. Brexit talks with the EU will \u201cprobably end this week\u201d, the source says. The negotiations will probably end this week. This is entirely plausible, and consistent with the underlying tone of the No 10 lobby briefing yesterday. Boris Johnson would not revive the deal currently on offer to the EU after the election, the source says. The source writes: If this deal dies in the next few days, then it won\u2019t be revived ... We will also make clear that [if the talks break down] this government will not negotiate further so any delay would be totally pointless. They think now that if there is another delay we will keep coming back with new proposals. This won\u2019t happen. We\u2019ll either leave with no deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with no deal. And the Tories would fight a general election on a no-deal platform, the source says. The source writes: To marginalise the Brexit party, we will have to fight the election on the basis of \u2018no more delays, get Brexit done immediately\u2019 ... We will focus on winning the election on a manifesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave. Johnson has not publicly said what his Brexit policy would be in an election: default to no deal, or make a final attempt after the election to agree a deal. The source is saying it would be the former. Essentially this would mean adapting the Brexit party\u2019s policy. Nigel Farage\u2019s party also wants no deal, although it calls that a \u201cclean break\u201d Brexit. The Tories would win on such a platform, the source says. The source writes: Those who supported delay will face the inevitable consequences of being seen to interfere in domestic politics in a deeply unpopular way by colluding with a parliament that is as popular as the clap. Those who pushed the Benn act intended to sabotage a deal and they\u2019ve probably succeeded. So the main effect of it will probably be to help us win an election by uniting the leave vote and then a no-deal Brexit. History is full of such ironies and tragedies. This is not yet proven, but could well turn out to be true. No 10 is still considering how it might circumvent the Benn act, which is intended to ensure that Johnson obtains a Brexit extension if he fails to get a deal by 19 October, the source reveals. The source writes: So, if talks go nowhere this week, the next phase will require us to set out our view on the surrender act. The act imposes narrow duties. Our legal advice is clear that we can do all sorts of things to scupper delay, which for obvious reasons we aren\u2019t going into details about. Different lawyers see the \u201cfrustration principle\u201d very differently especially on a case like this where there is no precedent for primary legislation directing how the PM conducts international discussions. This is highly controversial because it undermines the impression given by the government\u2019s evidence to the court of session in Edinburgh that Johnson would, in the event of a deal not being agreed, send a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit extension, as required by the Benn act. But the source is not saying the PM would not send a letter; instead, the argument is that other tactics might be used to \u201cscupper delay\u201d. No 10 would threaten to retaliate against any EU countries that back an article 50 extension, the source suggests. Here is the main quote, with a sentence in square brackets from Forsyth. We will make clear privately and publicly that countries which oppose delay will go the front of the queue for future cooperation \u2013 cooperation on things both within and outside EU competences. Those who support delay will go to the bottom of the queue. [This source also made clear that defence and security cooperation will inevitably be affected if the EU tries to keep Britain in against the will of its government] Supporting delay will be seen by this government as hostile interference in domestic politics, and over half of the public will agree with us. And here is a further quote. [In the event of a Brexit delay] we will wash our hands of it, we won\u2019t engage in further talks, we obviously won\u2019t given any undertakings about cooperative behaviour, everything to do with \u2018duty of sincere cooperation\u2019 will be in the toilet, we will focus on winning the election on a manifesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave. \u201cThe duty of sincere cooperation\u201d is a standard feature of EU agreements and is included in the text (pdf) of the agreement approving the last Brexit extension (until 31 October). These passages are incendiary because they imply that the UK might withhold security cooperation from EU countries that back a Brexit extension. When Nick Timothy was working in Downing Street as Theresa May\u2019s chief policy adviser, he also used to float the idea that security could be used as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. But May herself never seemed very keen on that approach, and the idea was abandoned after Timothy was sacked following the 2017 general election. Now it seems to be back on the table. But there is a problem with this threat. Any Brexit extension would have to be agreed unanimously by the EU27, as well as by the UK, and if all 27 were at the back of the queue, they would effectively all also be at the front of the queue too. The first paragraph suggests that No 10 thinks its best hope of sidestepping the Benn act is to get a country like Hungary to veto a Brexit extension. But Hungary and Poland (the other country targeted by Brexiters) have both signalled they are not interested. The FT\u2019s George Parker explains why. The first paragraph is also interesting because it claims No 10 will depict an EU decision to grant a Brexit extension as \u201chostile interference in domestic politics\u201d. This is obviously nonsense, because any such extension would be in line with the expressed wishes of the UK parliament. But the source has clearly seen polling saying that a majority of voters would agree with the \u201chostile interference\u201d claim. No 10 would blame parliament for a Brexit delay, the source says. The source writes: When they say \u2018so what is the point of delay?\u2019, we will say \u201cThis is not our delay, the government is not asking for a delay \u2014 parliament is sending you a letter and parliament is asking for a delay but official government policy remains that delay is an atrocious idea that everyone should dismiss. Any delay will in effect be negotiated between you, parliament, and the courts. The real significance of this passage is that it amounts to an admission that, despite the claims about being able to \u201cscupper delay\u201d, there is a strong chance that those efforts will fail and that the Benn act will turn out to be robust. It is also worth noting that the claim that the public will blame parliament primarily for a delay is true. Here are some figures from a ComRes poll for the Telegraph out today. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM), is accused of reneging on a promise to compromise, on the basis that a Brexit extension could lead to a better outcome for Ireland. The source says: Varadkar was keen on talking before the Benn act when he thought that the choice would be \u2018new deal or no deal\u2019. Since the Benn act passed he has gone very cold and in the last week the official channels and the backchannels have also gone cold. Varadkar has also gone back on his commitments \u2014 he said if we moved on manufactured goods then he would also move but instead he just attacked us publicly. It\u2019s clear he wants to gamble on a second referendum. Varadkar has long been a hate figure for Brexiters, but it is true that he has been talking up the prospect of a second referendum. Only last week he said that the British political system was denying the public the chance to vote for what polls say they want \u2013 staying in the EU. The reference to \u201cmanufactured goods\u201d refers to the UK\u2019s decision to propose a backstop alternative last week involving all goods from Northern Ireland staying in the single market, not just agrifoods. France and Germany would be more willing to compromise with the UK, but are being held back by their solidarity with Ireland, the source claims. The source writes: There are quite a few people in Paris and Berlin who would like to discuss our offer but Merkel and Macron won\u2019t push Barnier unless Ireland says it wants to negotiate. This is a conventional government view. But the source also says that \u201cthose who think Merkel will help us are deluded.\u201d This is a view that has been attributed to Dominic Cummings in the past. This is from the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford in the summer. It is a busy day, but there is one story this morning that is hogging all the attention at Westminster, eclipsing even another spate of warning about a no-deal Brexit (such as the IFS saying it would send government debt to its highest level for half a century, as the Guardian reports, or HM Revenue and Customs saying it would cost businesses \u00a315bn in form-filling, as the FT reports). The zinger is James Forsyth\u2019s publication on the Spectator website last night of a very long message from someone he describes as \u201ca contact in No 10\u201d setting out the inside Downing Street view on where the Brexit talks are going. On the Today programme this morning Amber Rudd, the former Tory work and pensions secretary, said that she thought the author was Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff. Asked if she thought he had written it, she replied: I think Dominic Cummings, yes, because otherwise it would have been heavily denied and heads would have rolled. So clearly it\u2019s come from them, it\u2019s in their style. Rudd\u2019s assumption is one that that will be widely shared - if not universally shared - in the Westminster ecosystem. I\u2019ll come back to why later. And I will post a full summary of the message soon. But here is the most incendiary paragraph, in which the No 10 source implies the UK would withhold cooperation from any EU countries that support a Brexit extension. The source says: We will make clear privately and publicly that countries which oppose delay will go the front of the queue for future cooperation \u2014 cooperation on things both within and outside EU competences. Those who support delay will go to the bottom of the queue. [This source also made clear that defence and security cooperation will inevitably be affected if the EU tries to keep Britain in against the will of its government] Supporting delay will be seen by this government as hostile interference in domestic politics, and over half of the public will agree with us. Given that at the moment there is an assumption that the EU27 will unanimously agree a Brexit extension, that would mean the whole of the EU going to the \u201cbottom of the queue\u201d for cooperation. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 9.30am: The court of session in Edinburgh hears an appeal against the decision yesterday against a decision by the court not to issue an order compelling Johnson to comply with the Benn Act. The court will also hear a separate but related case, a \u201cnobile officium\u201d petition saying judges should take the the power to sign a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit instead in place of the PM. 9.30am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies holds a briefing on its green budget. As Richard Partington reports, it says emergency tax cuts and higher public spending to offset the impact of a no-deal Brexit would send government debt to its highest level in more than half a century. 9.30am: Representatives of the seafood industry, and the fishing minister George Eustice, give evidence to the international trade committee about a no-deal Brexit. 10am: Shanker Singham from the Alternative Arrangements Commission and other trade experts give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about Brexit. 10am: Academics from the British Election Study hold a briefing on predicting the next election. After 12.30pm: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is expected to make a Commons statement about Brexit no-deal planning. 1pm: Paschal Donohoe, the Irish finance minister, presents his budget for next year, including details of no-deal contingencies. 5pm: Johnson meets David Sassoli, president of the European parliament, in Downing Street. Evening: Parliament prorogues. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

A \u201crange of dates\u201d will now be in play at the meeting of European leaders next week but sources suggested the natural cut-off date would be June. With an extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership now looking inevitable, other diplomatic sources suggested an unlikely outlier for an end date could even be ahead of a possible general election so as to force the Commons into accepting a deal. \u201cBut politicians like to keep things off their plates for as long as possible and so pushing it longer seems more realistic,\u201d a senior EU diplomat said. The negotiations over a deal are said to be effectively dead in Brussels after Downing Street\u2019s extraordinary claims over the substance of a phone call between the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the UK prime minister. Merkel was said by an unnamed UK source to have told Johnson that Northern Ireland had to stay in the EU\u2019s customs union. The official claimed that as a consequence a deal looked \u201cessentially impossible, not just now but ever\u201d. Tusk, the European council president, gave an insight into the frustration at the anonymous briefings over the Merkel call, the alleged content of which described by senior politicians in Berlin as \u201cimprobable\u201d.

In Berlin Detlef Seif, the point person on Brexit for Merkel\u2019s party, the CDU, rejected the account given by Downing Street of the call between the two leaders. He said: \u201cIn my mind it is completely improbable that the phone call between Merkel and Johnson took place in the way it has been reported in the British media. \u201cIt would run counter to all the principles the German government has followed for the last three years, namely that the negotiations are led by the European commission. \u201cFor the German chancellor to insist on Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union would completely breach these guidelines.\u201d Germany has been one of the most outspoken advocates for allowing the UK as much flexibility as possible to avoid a no-deal scenario on 31 October or at a later date. The unnamed Downing Street briefings have been widely attributed to Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave supremo who is now the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser. \u201cThere has been a lot of scepticism about Johnson\u2019s proposal in Berlin, but Merkel\u2019s attitude has always been a positive one, to find out if there is room for a compromise,\u201d Sief said. \u201cThe only explanation I can see for these reports is that Johnson is trying to build a story where he blames Germany for a no-deal Brexit. To brief out a confidential phone call in such a manner is utterly unprofessional and infuriating to anyone who has been working on a deal\u201d. On Tuesday, Johnson spoke to the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in a 40 minute call and agreed to meet later this week in what will be seen as a last-ditch chance to find a deal. The briefings attributed to Cummings had suggested that Varadkar had gone back on his word by attacking Johnson\u2019s proposals for the Irish border, which involve a customs border on the island of Ireland and Northern Ireland staying in the single market for goods. In Brussels, thinking is moving to how to react to what is seen as an inevitable request for an extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership. A debate among EU27 states over the end date for any extension is yet to take place. Following a meeting with Johnson in No 10 on Tuesday, the European parliament\u2019s president, David Sassoli, said there had been \u201cno progress\u201d in talks but MEPs were open to a Brexit extension. Johnson has repeatedly said that he will not comply with the Benn act, which would instruct him to request an extension by 19 October if a deal is not secured with the EU.

He would present it as a Dunkirk moment for the forces of Brexit \u2013 heroic retreat before a Churchillian finest hour standing alone, unbowed against the foreign aggressor. Johnson can count on most of Fleet Street to help narrate events in those terms. Newspapers that gleefully boosted Nigel Farage to torment David Cameron and Theresa May will turn that dial back down for a Tory leader who shows suitably Faragist zeal. The Brexit party is bound to get a boost from article 50 extension, but not perhaps on the scale that Johnson\u2019s enemies would like.</p> <p>But the wellspring of Tory electoral confidence is Jeremy Corbyn. His <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/jeremy-corbyn-has-lowest-leadership-satisfaction-rating-any-opposition-leader-1977\" title=\"\">personal ratings</a> probe historically unfathomed depths. His supporters are in denial about this problem partly because a cult of infallibility has built up around the Labour leader, and partly because he has overturned a commanding Tory poll lead once before, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/jun/08/general-election-results-2017-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-may-election-results-live-news-line?page=with:block-593a1b0de4b0be3ed19247a3\" title=\"\">in 2017</a>.</p> <p>But a repeat of that performance is not easy to engineer. Johnson cannot be relied upon to run a campaign as inept as May\u2019s. The Corbyn brand has also lost much of its shine in the past two years. The whiff of antisemitism has become a stench. The latest target is Liverpool MP Louise Ellman, <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/labour-activists-warned-not-to-discuss-no-confidence-motion-in-dame-louise-ellman-on-yom-kippur-1.489774\" title=\"\">threatened with a no-confidence debate</a> in her constituency. It was originally scheduled for the eve of Yom Kippur, Judaism\u2019s holiest night, which suggests some commitment to making Merseyside Labour a hostile environment for Jewish women. Luciana Berger has already been driven out of the local party. Even if voters do not follow every detail, they sense that the opposition is crawling with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/four-female-labour-mps-hit-with-deselection-threats\" title=\"\">cranks and bullies</a>.</p> <p>Luckily for Corbyn, Johnson is striving to make the Tories look even more unhinged and thuggish. Labour has three props holding it up in an election. One is Corbyn\u2019s dynamism in a campaign spotlight, which belies his peevish diffidence the rest of the time. The second is a manifesto in tune with voters\u2019 austerity fatigue \u2013 an all-you-can-eat menu of public goods. Third, and most vital, is horror at the prospect of a Johnson victory, compelling some Liberal Democrat supporters to shuffle over to Labour as the only way to stop the Tories. But many Lib Dems refuse to make that journey because they find Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position opaque and dishonest. The Labour faithful present their leader\u2019s EU ambivalence as Solomonic wisdom, as if he has sagely risen above the superficial division between leavers and remainers. To less indulgent eyes, it looks like refusal to take a view on the biggest issue facing the country for generations, which suggests a failure of courage and judgment.</p> <p>Many anti-Brexit voters have no more patience with Labour and no respect for its leader. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/01/johnsons-political-strategy-inspired-by-trump-says-gauke\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s Trumpian excesses</a> make Labour government seem sensible by comparison, even to people who once recoiled at the thought of Corbyn in Downing Street. It is hard to know which of those factors weighs more in a ballot box.</p> <p>Both main English parties hope that traditional loyalties will overcome promiscuous voting patterns when the choice is presented in binary, red-blue terms. Both also think they can mine seams of new voters, either those who never used to turn out before the referendum (and may rally to Johnson\u2019s Brexit banner) or those who were too young last time (and may be amenable to Corbynism).</p> <p>Labour can afford to wait for an election, but Johnson desperately needs one, not because he can be sure of victory but because he has no idea what else to do. Downing Street is already a campaign headquarters, not the centre of a serious government. Brexit was only ever really a campaign. It is an idea born in protest and raised on wild, unrealistic promises. It refuses to be domesticated as government policy. May tried and failed. Johnson hasn\u2019t seriously bothered trying. He just wants to get the issue back into the realm of empty slogans, its natural habitat.</p> <p>The past three years have proved the impossibility of turning the fantasy of easy, heroic release from EU membership into a practical policy. There is no alchemy that satisfies leave voters without inflicting harm on the country and diminishing its standing in the world. But for their different reasons neither Johnson nor Corbyn wants to admit that.</p> <p>So they\u2019ll fight an election, not to solve Brexit, but to sustain the fiction that a solution lies just around the next bend down the same infernal road.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

There are certainly Tory MPs who are stupid or uninterested enough in the detail to believe that the government offer was serious. There is also a pro-sanity faction inside Downing Street, led by Eddie Lister, Johnson\u2019s chief of staff from his London mayoralty years, that believes in complying with laws and maintaining relationships with continental allies. But that side of the operation competes with the revolutionary set around Dominic Cummings, who has imported the single-minded fanaticism of the Vote Leave referendum campaign to No 10. In a race to set the terms of debate, there is an advantage to the side that has no interest in diplomacy and no hesitation in setting fire to things, even when one of those things is Britain\u2019s reputation as a rational actor on the international stage. Westminster fizzed today at anonymous briefings \u2013 vindictive threats of retaliation against EU states and a colourfully spun conversation between the prime minister and Angela Merkel, in which the famously cautious and temperate German chancellor appeared to demand EU annexation of Northern Ireland for ever. That all indicates that the Cummings method is prevailing. Sanity might intrude far enough up Downing Street to allow grudging submission to the law that obliges the government to seek an article 50 extension in the absence of a deal. It isn\u2019t clear how that can be choreographed to spare Johnson the shame of breaking his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to meet the 31 October Brexit deadline, but his electoral fortunes need not be ruined by the breach. He would present it as a Dunkirk moment for the forces of Brexit \u2013 heroic retreat before a Churchillian finest hour standing alone, unbowed against the foreign aggressor. Johnson can count on most of Fleet Street to help narrate events in those terms. Newspapers that gleefully boosted Nigel Farage to torment David Cameron and Theresa May will turn that dial back down for a Tory leader who shows suitably Faragist zeal. The Brexit party is bound to get a boost from article 50 extension, but not perhaps on the scale that Johnson\u2019s enemies would like. But the wellspring of Tory electoral confidence is Jeremy Corbyn. His personal ratings probe historically unfathomed depths. His supporters are in denial about this problem partly because a cult of infallibility has built up around the Labour leader, and partly because he has overturned a commanding Tory poll lead once before, in 2017. But a repeat of that performance is not easy to engineer. Johnson cannot be relied upon to run a campaign as inept as May\u2019s. The Corbyn brand has also lost much of its shine in the past two years. The whiff of antisemitism has become a stench. The latest target is Liverpool MP Louise Ellman, threatened with a no-confidence debate in her constituency. It was originally scheduled for the eve of Yom Kippur, Judaism\u2019s holiest night, which suggests some commitment to making Merseyside Labour a hostile environment for Jewish women. Luciana Berger has already been driven out of the local party. Even if voters do not follow every detail, they sense that the opposition is crawling with cranks and bullies. Luckily for Corbyn, Johnson is striving to make the Tories look even more unhinged and thuggish. Labour has three props holding it up in an election. One is Corbyn\u2019s dynamism in a campaign spotlight, which belies his peevish diffidence the rest of the time. The second is a manifesto in tune with voters\u2019 austerity fatigue \u2013 an all-you-can-eat menu of public goods. Third, and most vital, is horror at the prospect of a Johnson victory, compelling some Liberal Democrat supporters to shuffle over to Labour as the only way to stop the Tories. But many Lib Dems refuse to make that journey because they find Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position opaque and dishonest. The Labour faithful present their leader\u2019s EU ambivalence as Solomonic wisdom, as if he has sagely risen above the superficial division between leavers and remainers. To less indulgent eyes, it looks like refusal to take a view on the biggest issue facing the country for generations, which suggests a failure of courage and judgment. Many anti-Brexit voters have no more patience with Labour and no respect for its leader. But Johnson\u2019s Trumpian excesses make Labour government seem sensible by comparison, even to people who once recoiled at the thought of Corbyn in Downing Street. It is hard to know which of those factors weighs more in a ballot box. Both main English parties hope that traditional loyalties will overcome promiscuous voting patterns when the choice is presented in binary, red-blue terms. Both also think they can mine seams of new voters, either those who never used to turn out before the referendum (and may rally to Johnson\u2019s Brexit banner) or those who were too young last time (and may be amenable to Corbynism). Labour can afford to wait for an election, but Johnson desperately needs one, not because he can be sure of victory but because he has no idea what else to do. Downing Street is already a campaign headquarters, not the centre of a serious government. Brexit was only ever really a campaign. It is an idea born in protest and raised on wild, unrealistic promises. It refuses to be domesticated as government policy. May tried and failed. Johnson hasn\u2019t seriously bothered trying. He just wants to get the issue back into the realm of empty slogans, its natural habitat. The past three years have proved the impossibility of turning the fantasy of easy, heroic release from EU membership into a practical policy. There is no alchemy that satisfies leave voters without inflicting harm on the country and diminishing its standing in the world. But for their different reasons neither Johnson nor Corbyn wants to admit that. So they\u2019ll fight an election, not to solve Brexit, but to sustain the fiction that a solution lies just around the next bend down the same infernal road. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",
