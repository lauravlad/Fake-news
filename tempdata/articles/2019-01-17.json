      "bodyText": "When the Nine network dumped Karl Stefanovic it was hoping to clear the air around the Today show, which had been dogged by negative tabloid stories about its star\u2019s personal life ever since the break-up of his marriage. By replacing Stefanovic with a woman, Deb Knight, and hiring an Indigenous Triple J personality in Brooke Boney, Today struck a blow for diversity and change in commercial television. But the negative stories kept coming this week \u2013 low ratings on day one and criticism of the new line-up of presenters. On Thursday the new recruit was asked for her opinion on changing the date of Australia Day and it was refreshing to hear an Indigenous Channel Nine presenter talk about her perspective on her own network. She was challenged by sports presenter Tony Jones but she held her ground, using her new platform to great effect. While many saw it as a breakthrough for commercial TV, soon Nine was feeling the backlash and being asked if management also supported moving Australia Day, a position vehemently opposed by News Corp. Boney said she thought Australia was the best country in the world but the date was wrong because of its association with dispossession. \u201cBut I can\u2019t separate the 26th of January from the fact that my brothers are more likely to go to jail than school, or that my little sisters and my mum are more likely to be beaten and raped than anyone else\u2019s sisters or mum,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that started from that day. For me, it\u2019s a difficult day and I don\u2019t want to celebrate it. Any other day of the year I will tie an Australian flag around my neck and run through the streets with anyone else.\u201d The Daily Mail framed it as an \u201castonishing rant\u201d and a \u201cVERY awkward clash\u201d. Most of the comments on Today\u2019s Facebook page and nine.com.au were savagely negative and unabashed racism. Race to the bottom If 2018 was the year of the so-called \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d crime wave, led by the Herald Sun\u2019s hysterical coverage, this year is shaping up to be one in which sections of the media ascribe racial characteristics to people involved in road accidents. But only if they are black. Nine reporter Christine Ahern said on air and on Twitter that a crash involved six youths \u201cof African appearance\u201d while the identity of the occupant of the other car was simply a \u201c40-year-old man\u201d. No explanation of relevance was forthcoming. The Australian took up the theme with relish. \u201cSeven people have been hospitalised after a car carrying six youths of African appearance collided with another vehicle in Melbourne\u2019s southeast, leaving two roads closed and throwing traffic into chaos,\u201d the Oz reported. Science commentator Ketan Joshi called it race tagging and clashed with the Australian\u2019s Bernard Lane \u2013 who has previously claimed there is a link between home country trauma and African crime \u2013 when he was asked why their race was not relevant. The Australian Press Council has confirmed that the Australian has been reported for putting an undue emphasis on race. Moir makes history The award-winning political cartoonist Alan Moir told Beast he was \u201cimmensely proud, honoured and a little bemused\u201d to have a cartoon that was originally published in the Sydney Morning Herald in 2012 included in the Oxford Illustrated History of the World, a \u201crichly illustrated, truly global history of our world \u2013 from the emergence of homo sapiens to the twenty-first century\u201d. Edited by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and published by Oxford University Press this month, the editors of the book sought his permission to include the work, which is the only political cartoon in the book. Boiling the Toad was published in the Herald on 14 May 2012. Changing the date The countdown to Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100 has begun despite the protestations of the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, and the broadcaster\u2019s own former chairman. Last year Triple J changed the date of the popular event away from 26 January because \u201cin recent years the Hottest 100 has become a symbol in the debate about Australia Day\u201d. Voting closes on Tuesday. \u201cThe Hottest 100 wasn\u2019t created as an Australia Day celebration,\u201d the youth network said. \u201cIt was created to celebrate your favourite songs of the past year. It should be an event that everyone can enjoy together \u2013 for both the musicians whose songs make it in and for everyone listening in Australia and around the world. This is really important to us.\u201d It was revealed late last year that the new date was the source of great tension between the former chairman Justin Milne and the former managing director Michelle Guthrie. Ad nauseam In a move not likely to increase its relevance or improve its image, the TV Week Logie awards has introduced a new category. Not for excellence in acting or writing, but for the most popular TV commercial produced for Australian audiences. Not even the best crafted TV commercial, but the most popular one. The 61st TV Week Logie awards will be held at the Star Gold Coast in Queensland in June and broadcast on Nine and 9Now. Sky after Mark Sky News Australia under Paul Whittaker continues to revamp its management line-up. After hiring former Seven news director Chris Willis last year, Sky has now picked up Nine\u2019s director of morning TV, Mark Calvert \u2013 just weeks after he left Nine. Along with Stefanovic, Calvert was a victim of Nine\u2019s attempt to draw a line under the public relations nightmare that dogged Today after the Stefanovic marriage bust-up and the departure of Lisa Wilkinson to Ten. Calvert started in his newly created role of head of programming and special events this week, taking responsibility for the channel\u2019s national affairs commentary programs. Hello Paul Murray, Andrew Bolt and Peta Credlin. They might prove more of a handful than Stefanovic and his big fat Mexican wedding. Acting program director Greg Byrnes, the guy who was in charge when Sky hosted neo-Nazi Blair Cottrell, has had Calvert put in over his head. Whittaker said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to welcome Mark to the Sky News team in this senior role, as we prepare for a bumper election year. We believe we have brought together a highly qualified editorial and programming team to lead our news and national affairs coverage in 2019.\u201d Calvert said: \u201cThere\u2019s great energy and ambition at Sky News under Paul\u2019s leadership, and I can\u2019t wait to join him and the team. It\u2019s going to be a huge year for news, and Sky News will be in the thick of it.\u201d Perhaps Calvert could give young News Corp columnist Caleb Bond his own show on After Dark in 2019. Bond has already qualified as a Sky commentator by delivering arguably the worst take on the Gillette ad so far: \u201cWhat about toxic femininity?\u201d",

This month, he received a yellow card for a high tackle during Saracens\u2019 defeat by Sale in a match in which he was again called up for his aggressive manner in dealing with the referee. \u201cIt will be a consistent work in progress because he\u2019s a competitor and he wants to be at them. But he will continue to learn,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe all want the game to be safe and tackling to be in the right area. Owen wants the same thing \u2013 he wants to hit people hard, sometimes he has got it maybe a little bit wrong, but it is not intent and I am sure during the Six Nations he will endeavour to tackle in a legal way.\u201d",

With new entrants in pay-streaming anticipated from Disney, AT&amp;T\u2019s WarnerMedia and Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal, Netflix has made it clear that it does not consider itself in a price war for subscribers, but in a spending war against competitors. On Thursday the company said: \u201cOur growth is based on how good our experience is, compared to all the other screen-time experiences from which consumers choose. Our focus is not Disney, or Amazon or others, but on how we can improve our experience for our members.\u201d According to Mike Bloxham, senior vice-president of global media and entertainment at consulting firm Magid, Netflix\u2019s price hike is actually more likely to cause subscriber reductions at rival services. \u201cDue to [Netflix\u2019s] strong market position, although this won\u2019t necessarily be a popular move, the number of subscribers that will actually churn out of the service as a result will be minimal,\u201d Bloxham predicted. And because of its superiority of content \u2013 a Piper Jaffray report found that 71% of the subscribers it surveyed felt content the service had improved \u2013 the firm\u2019s analysts concluded Netflix was in a solid position to raise streaming prices on a regular basis.",

They are effectively press releases, and it is common for the recipient to not even reply. But <strong>Theresa May </strong>has replied to the letter she received from Jeremy Corbyn today (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/17/brexit-deadlock-as-theresa-may-and-jeremy-corbyn?page=with:block-5c40885ae4b0197a614f4d32#block-5c40885ae4b0197a614f4d32\">1.53pm), </a>and she does make some interesting points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>May claims that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for the government to rule out a no-deal Brexit. </strong>She says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I note that you have said \u2018ruling out\u2019 no deal is a precondition before we can meet, but that is an impossible condition because it is not within the government\u2019s power to rule out no deal. Let me explain why.</p> <p>Under article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and the Withdrawal Act 2018, we will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March unless parliament either agrees a deal with the EU or the UK revokes article 50 and chooses to stay in the EU permanently. </p> <p>So there are two way to avoid no deal: either vote for a deal, in particular a withdrawal agreement, that has been agreed with the EU, or to revoke Article 50 and overturn the referendum result. </p> <p>I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result.</p> </blockquote> <p>As a technical explanation of the situation this is correct. <strong>Simon Usherwood</strong>, deputy director of UK in a Changing EU, an academic research programme, has explained why in a bit more detail in a Twitter thread starting here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Usherwood/status/1085910248496513024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m sure someone else has explained this, but since several have asked me today, here&#39;s why May can&#39;t simply &quot;remove no-deal&quot; from the table for Corbyn:<br><br>1/</p>&mdash; Simon Usherwood (@Usherwood) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Usherwood/status/1085910248496513024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 17, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But there are some consequences from this ....</p> <ul> <li><strong>May has undermined reassurances given to business by the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, about MPs being likely to block a no-deal Brexit. </strong>Today\u2019s Daily Telegraph publishes <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/16/hammond-phone-call-full-transcript-conversation-11-business/\">a long transcript (paywall)</a> of what Hammond and other cabinet ministers told business leaders in a private conference call on Tuesday night, after May\u2019s Brexit deal is striking down. It is striking that Hammond spent much of the call telling them that parliament was likely to block a no-deal Brexit, by backing the <strong>Nick Boles </strong>initiative. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/17/brexit-deadlock-as-theresa-may-and-jeremy-corbyn?page=with:block-5c4054afe4b00173154a5d84#block-5c4054afe4b00173154a5d84\">10.17am</a> and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/17/brexit-deadlock-as-theresa-may-and-jeremy-corbyn?page=with:block-5c407cbde4b0197a614f4c6d#block-5c407cbde4b0197a614f4c6d\"> 1.05pm.)</a> Here is an extract from what Hammond said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Everyone on the call will be aware that a bill has been tabled today and amendments will be tabled on Monday by backbenchers from across the House which would have the effect of removing the threat of no deal. </p> <p>I can simply as a parliamentarian say it is clear to me there is a large majority in the Commons that is opposed to no deal in any circumstances ...</p> <p>I can only emphasise what I have already said. This is a backbench initiative but it\u2019s backed by some very senior parliamentarians. It will as I understand it run its parliamentary course over the next 10 days or so. By the end of next week we will have a clearer view ...</p> <p>My understanding is that because the bill being brought forward will simply and solely rescind the article 50 notice, the legal opinion that they have is that that will meet the test that the European court of justice has laid down for unilateral recision of an article 50 notice. </p> <p>It is not within their power to mandate any future course of action, that would be for a government to do. Their process simply and their bill simply withdraws the article 50 notice. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>May\u2019s letter implies she has found a flaw in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat?page=with:block-5c3f0684e4b03740e8745d1e#block-5c3f0684e4b03740e8745d1e\">the Boles initiative. </a></strong>The Boles initiative is being presented as one that would block a no-deal Brexit, but <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2017-2019/0314/18314.pdf\">his bill (pdf) </a>would only require the government to seek an extension of article 50 until the end of 2019 if the Commons did not pass a Brexit deal. May\u2019s letter does not mention the Boles bill, but it is reminder that his bill would not automatically stop a no-deal Brexit; it might just delay it for nine months. And May makes another argument that implies the Boles plan would fail ...</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>May claims that EU would not agree to extend article 50 just to give the UK more time to debate Brexit. </strong>This is in line with what EU leaders have been saying publicly. But it is thought that, in practice, the EU might be willing to agree to extend article 50 just to \u201cstop the clock\u201d, and allow a bit more time for a solution to emerge. At the every least, this would allow more time for no-deal planning. May\u2019s letter implies that this is not an option she is willing to pursue. (But it is also noteworthy that she is now at least discussing the practicalities of an article 50 extension. Until recently, when the topic was raised, she just used to say the UK was going to leave the EU on 29 March come what may.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>May makes a subtle jibe about Corbyn\u2019s willingness in the past to speak to groups like Hamas without pre-conditions</strong>.

But, referring to what would happen next, Corbyn said in his speech that the \u201cfirst option\u201d would be try to get MPs to vote for Labour\u2019s alternative Brexit plan. Only if that failed would the party consider the case for a second referendum, he said. In his speech he added:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But if the government remains intransigent, if support for Labour\u2019s alternative is blocked for party advantage, and the country is facing the potential disaster of no deal, our duty will then be to look at other options which we\u2019ve set out in our conference motion, including the option of a public vote.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said there were three key elements to Labour\u2019s Brexit policy.</strong> Describing the Labour plan that the party will be tabling in the form of amendments, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour will put down our own amendment next week, setting out our alternative plan based around a permanent customs union with a British say in future trade deals; a strong single market relationship; and a guarantee at least to keep pace with EU rights at work, environmental protections, and consumer standards.</p> <p>Those three elements provide the essential building blocks of a sensible deal with the clear potential to win majority support in parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is nothing new about these proposals, but I don\u2019t think Labour has simplified its policy as a three-point package in this way before. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/10/brexit-latest-news-corbyn-speech-may-press-conference-reaches-out-to-labour-by-welcoming-workers-rights-amendment-politics-live?page=with:block-5c370627e4b072dc52e6be09#block-5c370627e4b072dc52e6be09\">Downing Street has hinted that it has some sympathy with the third one</a> (dynamic alignment with EU rules on workers\u2019 rights).

Labour wants the advantages of being in the single market, without being a full member - something the EU says is not on offer.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn hinted that he may table further motions of no confidence in the government.</strong> He said in his speech:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We believe that the best outcome for the country remains a general election to break the deadlock and find a solution that works for the whole country.</p> <p>And that is why I tabled a motion of confidence, and we will come back with it again if necessary.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to say what Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit would be in the event of an early election, claiming that he personally would not have the final say on the manifesto.</strong> Asked about this in the Q&amp;A, he said the party would decide. He went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have to say, Labour is a very large, very open and very democratic party. Our policy going into the general election, our manifesto, will not be decided by me alone. I will be one person in the room that will be deciding what goes in that manifesto. There will be many, many others there. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is not untrue, but not exactly wholly honest either. Under Labour rules, the party manifesto is agreed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/11/labours-clause-v-meeting-what-is-it-and-what-will-it-decide\">a \u201cclause V\u201d meeting,</a> which includes the whole of the shadow cabinet and the national executive committee, plus some others. But it would discuss a draft manifesto actually written in Corbyn\u2019s office, members of the shadow cabinet are appointed by Corbyn, and the NEC is largely loyal to him too. The idea that the party leader is just \u201cone person in the room\u201d isn\u2019t an accurate description of the influence he would wield.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn also refused to say what Labour\u2019s position would be if there were a second referendum, saying that would be a matter for the party to decide at the time.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He restated his opposition to entering talks with Theresa May until she has ruled out a no-deal Brexit. </strong>He said May\u2019s offer of talks was \u201csimply a stunt, not the serious attempt to engage with the new reality that\u2019s needed\u201d.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He implied that May could not be trusted to honour commitments that she had made, suggesting that this might be a factor in his decision not to enter talks with her.</strong> During the Q&amp;A, when it was put to him that he should be meeting May, he restated his desire for her to rule out a no-deal Brexit. But then he went on to say he did meet May in December to discuss the procedure for the Brexit vote, and they agreed a five-day debate, followed by a vote on 11 December.

Analysis of polls involving more than 6,700 voters suggested that majorities in nine out of 10 Conservative-held constituencies back a so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Conservative MP <strong>Phillip Lee</strong>, who resigned as a minister in Theresa May\u2019s government last year over Brexit, said that Tory support for a fresh poll was \u201cunderestimated\u201d and was \u201cgrowing fast\u201d among the party\u2019s MPs. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The data provided by Best For Britain\u2019s research shows that people have been underestimating Conservative support for a referendum giving people the final say on Brexit. </p> <p>I know from private conversations at Parliament that backing among my colleagues for a referendum is there and is growing fast. We aim to accelerate that with today\u2019s launch of the Conservative-led Right to Vote campaign. </p> <p>Conservative politicians need to pay attention to today\u2019s findings. Across all Conservative-held parliamentary seats, 55.8% of voters in Conservative seats want a referendum if parliament is deadlocked over Brexit, as it continues to be.</p> </blockquote> <p>As the Press Association reports, the analysis was conducted by market research company FocalData for the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum and the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate, using a method called \u201cmultilevel regression and post-stratification\u201d.

He took issue with something John Humphrys, the Today presenter, said earlier, about Jeremy Corbyn not having a position on Brexit. Labour does, Gardiner said. It was <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/labour-manifesto-2017.pdf\">in the Labour manifesto (pdf),</a> on page 24, Gardiner said.</p> <p>Gardiner also complained about the radio news headlines at 8.30am featuring Tony Blair saying Corbyn should be meeting Theresa May to discuss Brexit (ie, a line critical of Corbyn), but not feature Blair saying a no-deal Brexit should be taken off the table (a line supportive of Corbyn).</p> <p>And Gardiner said Labour frontbenchers would not be meeting members of the government for talks on Brexit. Asked if those talks would be happening, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No. I have not had any approach myself from my counterpart in government. And, to the best of my knowledge, none of my colleagues have. Let me be clear; in the Labour party, as a shadow cabinet, we operate as a team. We are quite clear that it is important that the prime minister shows good faith; she takes away the gun that she has been trying to hold to parliament\u2019s head by saying it is either my deal or no deal. Even the chancellor is saying that that no deal should [be ruled out].</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked why Corbyn was setting conditions for talks with May, when he had been prepared to meet others, sometimes \u201cunsavoury people\u201d (a reference to Hamas), without setting conditions, Gardiner said in this case Labour needed to know that the prime minister was serious about talks. And, to get a deal through parliament, May would have to abandon some red lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4341928fb9e6e232c268107f7759e77cba0f56d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4341928fb9e6e232c268107f7759e77cba0f56d0/0_107_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Gardiner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barry Gardiner</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4040f9e4b0197a614f49b2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-17T08:55:40.968Z\">8.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Blair criticises May for sticking to her Brexit red lines, but says Corbyn should talk to her anyway</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tony Blair</strong> has called for a series of indicative votes on various options for Brexit to help break the parliamentary deadlock.</p> <p>Speaking to the Today programme he urged Theresa May to become a \u201cfacilitator and arbiter\u201d for the options put forward by MPs.

Possible but not all that plausible, given that it would require breaking up the euro, more autonomy for individual countries to intervene in the running of their economies, and a simultaneous philosophical U-turn in the big member states.</p> <p>Much more likely is that the pressure for change will dissipate and the real grievances of those who voted for Brexit will be quietly forgotten. The softer the Brexit, the more convinced the EU will be that it has been doing the right thing all along. Britain will not go up in flames, but there will still be consequences. Leave voters will feel they have been victims of an establishment stitch-up. The anger will not go away and will eventually resurface.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/17/rupture-eu-brexit-reform\">Only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c400f54e4b00173154a5bfb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-17T06:10:46.657Z\">6.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog as well follow the twists and turns of UK politics.</p> <p>Well, she may have survived the no-confidence vote yesterday, but Theresa May is by no means out of the woods.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now, so thanks for reading and for all the comments. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, asked his MPs not to engage with the prime minister, who is attempting to come up with an EU withdrawal deal Parliament can accept, until she rules out a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn also wrote an open letter to Theresa May saying he would take no part in discussions until such a time. Many Labour MPs complied with his request, though some senior party members did appear to enter discussions with the government. In response to the open letter, May claimed it was impossible for the UK government to take no-deal off the table. In so doing, the prime minister undermined the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who had been quoted as telling business leaders a no-deal Brexit would be blocked by Parliament. You can read a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events here. And, for those wishing to read more, here\u2019s our main politics story this evening: The public is \u201caghast\u201d at the \u201cBrexit pantomime\u201d in Westminster, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s deputy leader, Michelle O\u2019Neill, has told the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, in what the former termed a \u201cfrank discussion\u201d. With each passing day, our business community, our farmers, our community and voluntary sector are growing more concerned at where this shambles will ultimately end up. And it is they who will pay the price of a no-deal crash Brexit. Unfortunately, that is where we are likely to end up if Karen Bradley\u2019s government pursues a solution by attempting to placate and appease the DUP and the hard Brexiteers. O\u2019Neill added a plea that the backstop remained in any new withdrawal deal agreed between the UK and EU. It is crucial, now more than ever, that the Dublin Government and the EU27 stand firm on the position that there can be no agreement without a backstop that prevents a hard border in Ireland and protects our peace and political process. Earlier, Downing Street said a second referendum \u2013 were one to be held \u2013 would take a year (see 4.27pm). The Lib Dem leader, Sir Vince Cable, has rejected that claim, saying: This is completely wrong. One of the useful outcomes from the first round of the discussions with the government was around the practicalities of a People\u2019s Vote. These discussions brought to the surface the complete misunderstanding in government circles about the timeline to bring it about. As Lord Tyler demonstrated today, it would be perfectly possible to organise a People\u2019s Vote to take place as early as May without trampling on constitutional and practical requirements. Moving away from this evening\u2019s events, if perhaps not all that far, the latest edition of the Today In Focus podcast with Anushka Asthana sounds interesting: A little insight into what appears to be happening inside Downing Street and elsewhere on Whitehall this evening. Firstly, this from my colleague Jessica Elgot: And, secondly, this from the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson: It\u2019s understood Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely to reply to the prime minister\u2019s letter to him (see 5.12pm). However, a Labour spokeswoman says: The prime minister is in denial about the consequences of the scale of the defeat of her deal on Monday. To win support in Parliament, any new deal must ditch her red lines. As opposition MPs who have met with the government today have discovered, the prime minister is not yet prepared for serious talks to find a way forward. The starting point for any talks must be that she commits to rule out no deal. Corbyn made a similar demand in an open letter to Theresa May earlier this afternoon (see 1.53pm). In her response, May claimed it was impossible for the UK government to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The former home secretary, David Blunkett, has backed calls for a new Brexit referendum, telling the BBC: After a very, very agonising time I have come to the conclusion that we probably will have to have a second referendum. I think there could be a referendum in May. I think that Article 50 would have to be delayed until the last possible moment, which is the end of June. And then, if the referendum was not carried in terms of staying in, then that would be that. Asked how long such a referendum would take to organise, the former Labour frontbencher said: \u201cYou need three weeks to legislate, and two-and-a-half months to have a campaign.\u201d When politicians send public letters to each other, normally the content is not particularly interesting. They are effectively press releases, and it is common for the recipient to not even reply. But Theresa May has replied to the letter she received from Jeremy Corbyn today (see 1.53pm), and she does make some interesting points. May claims that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for the government to rule out a no-deal Brexit. She says: I note that you have said \u2018ruling out\u2019 no deal is a precondition before we can meet, but that is an impossible condition because it is not within the government\u2019s power to rule out no deal. Let me explain why. Under article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and the Withdrawal Act 2018, we will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March unless parliament either agrees a deal with the EU or the UK revokes article 50 and chooses to stay in the EU permanently. So there are two way to avoid no deal: either vote for a deal, in particular a withdrawal agreement, that has been agreed with the EU, or to revoke Article 50 and overturn the referendum result. I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result. As a technical explanation of the situation this is correct. Simon Usherwood, deputy director of UK in a Changing EU, an academic research programme, has explained why in a bit more detail in a Twitter thread starting here. But there are some consequences from this .... May has undermined reassurances given to business by the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, about MPs being likely to block a no-deal Brexit. Today\u2019s Daily Telegraph publishes a long transcript (paywall) of what Hammond and other cabinet ministers told business leaders in a private conference call on Tuesday night, after May\u2019s Brexit deal is striking down. It is striking that Hammond spent much of the call telling them that parliament was likely to block a no-deal Brexit, by backing the Nick Boles initiative. (See 10.17am and 1.05pm.) Here is an extract from what Hammond said: Everyone on the call will be aware that a bill has been tabled today and amendments will be tabled on Monday by backbenchers from across the House which would have the effect of removing the threat of no deal. I can simply as a parliamentarian say it is clear to me there is a large majority in the Commons that is opposed to no deal in any circumstances ... I can only emphasise what I have already said. This is a backbench initiative but it\u2019s backed by some very senior parliamentarians. It will as I understand it run its parliamentary course over the next 10 days or so. By the end of next week we will have a clearer view ... My understanding is that because the bill being brought forward will simply and solely rescind the article 50 notice, the legal opinion that they have is that that will meet the test that the European court of justice has laid down for unilateral recision of an article 50 notice. It is not within their power to mandate any future course of action, that would be for a government to do. Their process simply and their bill simply withdraws the article 50 notice. May\u2019s letter implies she has found a flaw in the Boles initiative. The Boles initiative is being presented as one that would block a no-deal Brexit, but his bill (pdf) would only require the government to seek an extension of article 50 until the end of 2019 if the Commons did not pass a Brexit deal. May\u2019s letter does not mention the Boles bill, but it is reminder that his bill would not automatically stop a no-deal Brexit; it might just delay it for nine months. And May makes another argument that implies the Boles plan would fail ... May claims that EU would not agree to extend article 50 just to give the UK more time to debate Brexit. This is in line with what EU leaders have been saying publicly. But it is thought that, in practice, the EU might be willing to agree to extend article 50 just to \u201cstop the clock\u201d, and allow a bit more time for a solution to emerge. At the every least, this would allow more time for no-deal planning. May\u2019s letter implies that this is not an option she is willing to pursue. (But it is also noteworthy that she is now at least discussing the practicalities of an article 50 extension. Until recently, when the topic was raised, she just used to say the UK was going to leave the EU on 29 March come what may.) May makes a subtle jibe about Corbyn\u2019s willingness in the past to speak to groups like Hamas without pre-conditions. Rightwingers have been using this line to attack Corbyn all day on social media. May does not put it like that, but her letter does say allude to this argument, with the line: \u201cYou have always believed in the importance of dialogue in politics.\u201d That\u2019s is all from me for this evening. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over Downing Street has released Theresa May\u2019s reply to the letter she received from Jeremy Corbyn (see 1.53pm) saying he would only join cross-party talks if she rules out a no-deal Brexit. Here is the full text. May claims it impossible for the government to rule out a no-deal Brexit. I will post more on this in a moment. ITV\u2019s Dominique Heckels has posted on Twitter a picture of the one-page government memo arguing that it would take a year to organise a second Brexit referendum. (See 4.27pm.) John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, is urging people to join him in praying for MPs. \u201cThe weight of their calling is too much to bear in their own strength,\u201d he says. Which is one way of explaining our current crisis ... The Labour MPs Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper, who chair the Brexit and home affairs select committees respectively, said the government should rule out a no-deal Brexit as they left the Cabinet Office after cross-party talks with David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister. Benn said: The government has to rule out no deal. That\u2019s the first step. Secondly, the prime minister needs to change her red lines. And Cooper said: The most important thing now is that the government actually listens and it doesn\u2019t just think that a defeat that was that huge can simply be dismissed. Although Jeremy Corbyn has asked Labour MPs not to take part in the cross-party talks process (see 3.53pm), the two MPs said they attended as chairs of cross-party committees. Asked if Corbyn should meet May to discuss Brexit, Benn said: That is a decision for Jeremy to take. He\u2019s demonstrating that it\u2019s not just the prime minister who can be stubborn - there is a step she can take and Jeremy Corbyn is quite right to say to her, as all of us have, you must take no deal off the table. According to Sky News, the Labour MPs Stephen Kinnock and Lucy Powell were also going in for talks this afternoon. They have been two of the most prominent supporters of the \u201cNorway plus\u201d Brexit option, which would involve keeping the UK in the single market and the customs union. Theresa May will not be attending the Davos summit in Switzerland next week, Downing Street has said. The prime minister was reportedly included on a list of expected participants in the annual World Economic Forum summit, the Press Association reports. Downing Street declined to say whether she had been scheduled to take part, but a spokeswoman said: She will not be going to Davos. She will be focused on matters here. Earlier I said the Labour MP John Mann had been in for talks with the government on Brexit. But, although he was in the Cabinet Office today, I\u2019m told that he was not there for the cross-party Brexit talks. I\u2019m sorry for the mistake. Downing Street produced a briefing on a possible second referendum to inform the Brexit talks with MPs, journalists were told at the afternoon lobby briefing. But it wasn\u2019t very long - and it said holding a second referendum would take a year, from start to finish. This is from my colleague Dan Sabbagh. That does seem rather long. A report from the Constitution Unit (pdf) published last year said that, at a minimum, it would take 22 weeks to hold a second referendum, taking into account the time needed to pass the legislation and organise the campaign The Ministry of Defence has said that reservists may be called up to help the nation cope with a no-deal Brexit. The defence minister Mark Lancaster has announced the move in a written ministerial statement. He says reservists could help out in a variety of roles, especially at regional command centres. In a written ministerial statement to MPs he says: A new order has been made under section 56(1B) of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 to enable reservists to be called into permanent service in support of the HMG contingency planning for a no deal EU exit scenario. Defence is committed to assisting the Cabinet Office coordinated work programme to ensure that there are effective and proportionate contingency plans in place to mitigate the potential immediate impacts leaving the EU, under a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, might have on the welfare, health and security of UK citizens and economic stability of the UK. Reserve forces will be on standby to deliver a range of defence outputs such as: reinforcement of regular sub-units, liaison officer roles and the provision of specialist skills. A particularly important role may be the planned reinforcement of regional points of command, to enable their 24/7 operation and resilience. We would also expect reserves to be drawn upon to support the implementation of contingency plans developed by other government departments. The order shall take effect from the beginning of 10 February 2019 and shall cease to have effect at the end of 9 February 2020. Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti has got the full text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s message to Labour MPs asking them not to talk to the government about Brexit until no deal has been ruled out. This letter went out to Labour MPs this morning. The vast majority of them seem to be complying, but Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper, who both chair select committees, have been in to speak to the government. (See 2.59am.) Benn defended his decision to attend the talks this morning. (See 10.34am.) Asked about their actions, a Labour source said that Corbyn\u2019s letter was \u201cjust a request\u201d and that Labour MPs had been very vocal in rejecting no deal. Nicola Sturgeon is keeping her options open on how and when she will ratchet up pressure for a second Scottish independence referendum because the chaos over Brexit makes it impossible for forecast what may happen, her spokesman has said. The Scottish first minister pledged on Wednesday, during a day trip to London in the wake of the crushing defeat on Brexit for Theresa May in the Commons, she would make a long-awaited statement on her project \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. With hardline independence campaigners outside Holyrood urging her to press on today, her spokesman told reporters in Edinburgh after first minister\u2019s questions she was still waiting for the Brexit crisis to resolve itself. We\u2019re in the biggest political crisis in the UK probably in living memory, certainly post second world war. We don\u2019t know at this stage whether there\u2019s going to be an election, a second EU referendum, an extension of article 50, a Norway-plus, a Norway-minus, a Canada-plus-plus \u2013 any one or all of these things could happen. The situation is by definition, very, very unpredictable. But the FM is clear she will give an update on her thinking on independence and a referendum in the coming weeks, notwithstanding that still considerable uncertainty. Sturgeon has been promising for more than 18 months to deliver a definitive statement, including a timetable for a second referendum, ever since the Scottish National party lost 21 Westminster seats in 2017 when voters rebelled against her efforts to tie independence to the leave vote in June 2016. She fuelled expectations the could come last autumn but has since blamed \u201cthe fog of Brexit\u201d for the delay in setting out her independence strategy; that in turn has been overtaken by her decision to swing the SNP behind calls for a second EU referendum. In Holyrood, Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party\u2019s parliamentary leader, pressed Sturgeon on whether she had raised with independence when she spoke to Theresa May earlier this week. Sturgeon did not answer yes to that specific question, instead saying May knew very well what her views were. She said: There is obviously some water to go under the Brexit bridge over the next few weeks, but let me be very clear: as Patrick Harvie said, the case and support for independence grow with every day that passes. Jeremy Corbyn has now contacted all Labour MPs asking them not to talk to the government about Brexit until no deal has been ruled out, ITV\u2019s Paul Brand reports. The Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn have been to the Cabinet Office today for talks with the government about Brexit. As Benn said this morning, they both chair cross-party select committees. (See 10.34am.) On his way in, Benn said: The really important question is, there\u2019s an open door, is there an open mind to a change? And Cooper said: We want to see if the government is actually prepared to make some changes. This is from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming, quoting what Mararitis Schinas, the European commission\u2019s spokesman, told journalists at a briefing earlier. Downing Street has again insisted the prime minister is determined to stick to her Brexit \u201cprinciples\u201d, including rejecting a customs union and a second referendum, as she embarks on cross-party talks to try to salvage her Brexit deal. Jeremy Corbyn has dismissed the talks as a \u201cstunt\u201d and confirmed that Labour will not take part unless Theresa May rules out a no-deal Brexit. In a speech in Hastings, he also confirmed that, despite losing the no confidence motion in the Commons last night, the party is not moving quickly to supporting a second referendum. (See 12.44pm.) MPs are expected to have the opportunity on 29 January to vote on whether to hold a second referendum, after a Conservative backbencher pledged to put down an amendment to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, told business leaders that the threat of a no-deal Brexit would be taken off the table within days after MPs rejected the prime minister\u2019s proposals earlier this week, according to leaked details of a conference call. France has triggered a \u20ac50m contingency plan for a no-deal Brexit following parliament\u2019s overwhelming rejection of Theresa May\u2019s deal, the French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, has said. Jeremy Corbyn has written an open letter to Theresa May confirming that he will only enter Brexit talks with her if she rules out leaving the EU with no deal. Here is an extract. After the unprecedented and unnecessary delay to the meaningful vote last month, entering into talks while the clock continues to run down, and the threat of a chaotic \u2018no deal\u2019 increases, would be a reckless leap in the dark. The chancellor and the business secretary were both open to ruling out \u2018no deal\u2019 in the recent conference call with business leaders. Therefore, on behalf of the Labour party, I ask you to rule out \u2018no deal\u2019 and to immediately end the waste of hundreds of millions of pounds of public money preparing for a \u2018no deal\u2019 outcome. The \u00a34.2bn currently allocated to \u2018no deal\u2019 planning could significantly improve many of cash-starved public services on which people rely and could transform the lives of those struggling on universal credit. Labour is open to meaningful discussions. But following the decisive rejection of the government\u2019s deal by MPs on Tuesday, those cannot be on the basis of your existing red lines. It is clear that no tweaks or further assurances are going to win support for the government\u2019s Brexit deal in parliament. Luciana Berger, the Labour MP, has claimed that Jeremy Corbyn was ignoring party policy in what he said about a second referendum this morning. (See 12.44pm.) In a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, she said: After the vote of confidence was defeated, we now know a general election is off the table and any chance of Labour negotiating its own Brexit deal has gone. Labour needs to decide to follow its democratically-agreed conference policy of campaigning for a new public vote. If it instead backs some version of a Brexit deal which is worse than the deal we already have inside the EU and would leave the country worse off, it risks losing millions of supporters and alienating a whole generation of young voters. Germany is not going to come to the rescue of the UK in the Brexit crisis, the German blogger Alan Posener writes in a new article for the Guardian. Here\u2019s an extract. Germany has land borders with nine countries: Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Holland and Denmark \u2013 and they are all open. (Switzerland is not an EU member, but belongs to the Schengen passport-free area.) With populist parties in power or on the rise in many of these countries, Merkel\u2019s government has zero incentive to offer Britain the kind of deal-sweetener that populists could point to as proof that leaving the EU needn\u2019t be so bad after all. Germany doesn\u2019t want to punish Britain, although there is a certain amount of schadenfreude floating about in Berlin. But the prospect of nine different border regimes subject to the whims of nationalist parties is much more frightening than anything coming out of London. It wasn\u2019t pure bleeding-heart whimsy that led Merkel to keep the borders open at the height of the refugee crisis. Trucks piling up at border crossings while factories send workers home is something no German leader wants to see on TV. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. And here is a group of Tory Brexiters heading up Whitehall earlier today to give their views on Brexit. A snap poll conducted in the wake of the crushing defeat of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan found a 12-point lead for remaining in the EU - the largest margin since the 2016 referendum, the Press Association reports. The YouGov survey of more than 1,000 voters found 56% would now vote to stay in the EU, against 44% who want to leave. Exactly the same proportion of voters said they wanted a second EU referendum - three points higher than recorded in a similar poll before Christmas. Backing for a so-called People\u2019s Vote among Labour supporters stood at 78%. In a statement on the poll released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, the Labour MP Chuka Umunna said: This snap poll shows more than ever why the government needs to change course and hand this decision on Brexit back to the people. There is now a clear and expanding majority for staying in the EU and an even bigger one when voters have the chance to look at the real options for leaving. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, has confirmed that his party will not back Labour in future no-confidence motions until Labour backs a second referendum. (See 9.34am.) He said: Since he appears to be determined to play party political games rather than acting on the wishes of his own members and MPs, he will no longer be able to rely on our support for further no-confidence motions. I believe other parties are taking the same view. It\u2019s time Mr Corbyn got off the fence and made his position plain. Speaking after his own Brexit talks with Theresa May, the Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, said: We focused on what we believe is the surest way of breaking the parliamentary gridlock, which is to go for a people\u2019s vote. We had a fairly lengthy discussion about that and we set out some of the criteria which could be adopted. We are available to continue those discussions.\u201d Taking no deal off the table is essential in the short term, we believe, but also we have to end no progress, so it\u2019s good to talk. Up to 20 ministers may resign if ordered to vote against the Nick Boles plan intended to stop the government taking the UK out of the EU without a deal in 2019 (see 10.17am), Boles has told the Evening Standard. Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, has said the government should legislate now to protect the rights of EU nationals living in the UK after Brexit, regardless of what happens. Here are the main points from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A. Corbyn confirmed that, even though Labour lost the no-confidence motion in the Commons last night, the party is not moving quickly to committing itself to backing a second referendum. Many people have interpreted the Brexit policy agreed at party conference as meaning, if Labour could not trigger a second referendum, it would instead back a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d (although the actual text of the motion is much more non-committal). But, referring to what would happen next, Corbyn said in his speech that the \u201cfirst option\u201d would be try to get MPs to vote for Labour\u2019s alternative Brexit plan. Only if that failed would the party consider the case for a second referendum, he said. In his speech he added: But if the government remains intransigent, if support for Labour\u2019s alternative is blocked for party advantage, and the country is facing the potential disaster of no deal, our duty will then be to look at other options which we\u2019ve set out in our conference motion, including the option of a public vote. He said there were three key elements to Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. Describing the Labour plan that the party will be tabling in the form of amendments, he said: Labour will put down our own amendment next week, setting out our alternative plan based around a permanent customs union with a British say in future trade deals; a strong single market relationship; and a guarantee at least to keep pace with EU rights at work, environmental protections, and consumer standards. Those three elements provide the essential building blocks of a sensible deal with the clear potential to win majority support in parliament. There is nothing new about these proposals, but I don\u2019t think Labour has simplified its policy as a three-point package in this way before. Downing Street has hinted that it has some sympathy with the third one (dynamic alignment with EU rules on workers\u2019 rights). Some in cabinet are sympathetic to the first one (staying in the customs union), but not May. But the second one is problematic, because it is the most nebulous. Labour wants the advantages of being in the single market, without being a full member - something the EU says is not on offer. Corbyn hinted that he may table further motions of no confidence in the government. He said in his speech: We believe that the best outcome for the country remains a general election to break the deadlock and find a solution that works for the whole country. And that is why I tabled a motion of confidence, and we will come back with it again if necessary. He refused to say what Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit would be in the event of an early election, claiming that he personally would not have the final say on the manifesto. Asked about this in the Q&amp;A, he said the party would decide. He went on: I have to say, Labour is a very large, very open and very democratic party. Our policy going into the general election, our manifesto, will not be decided by me alone. I will be one person in the room that will be deciding what goes in that manifesto. There will be many, many others there. This is not untrue, but not exactly wholly honest either. Under Labour rules, the party manifesto is agreed at a \u201cclause V\u201d meeting, which includes the whole of the shadow cabinet and the national executive committee, plus some others. But it would discuss a draft manifesto actually written in Corbyn\u2019s office, members of the shadow cabinet are appointed by Corbyn, and the NEC is largely loyal to him too. The idea that the party leader is just \u201cone person in the room\u201d isn\u2019t an accurate description of the influence he would wield. Corbyn also refused to say what Labour\u2019s position would be if there were a second referendum, saying that would be a matter for the party to decide at the time. He restated his opposition to entering talks with Theresa May until she has ruled out a no-deal Brexit. He said May\u2019s offer of talks was \u201csimply a stunt, not the serious attempt to engage with the new reality that\u2019s needed\u201d. He implied that May could not be trusted to honour commitments that she had made, suggesting that this might be a factor in his decision not to enter talks with her. During the Q&amp;A, when it was put to him that he should be meeting May, he restated his desire for her to rule out a no-deal Brexit. But then he went on to say he did meet May in December to discuss the procedure for the Brexit vote, and they agreed a five-day debate, followed by a vote on 11 December. He went on: Two days before that, she changed her mind, cancelled the vote and delayed things for over a month. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, are speaking to reporters outside Number 10 after a meeting with Theresa May. Dodds says May is in \u201clistening mode\u201d. That is vital, what happened in recent days. Foster says the DUP want a deal that works for the whole of the UK. The way to do that is to deal with the backstop, he says. In response to a question about crime, Corbyn says the last Labour government introduced police community support officers. That was a good initiative, he says. But, to reduce crime, you also need to improve services. He says the next Labour government will introduce a national education service, so that education is a human right for everyone. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Corbyn says the problem of divisions in society are very serious. We saw some of that in the ways Anna Soubry and Owen Jones were treated outside parliament. And no one has had to put up with this more than Diane Abbott. She has been able to deal with it because she is strong. Corbyn says language is important. He says he does not want any racism or antisemitism. He says we have to come together as a country. Q: You got a big round of applause here when you mentioned a second referendum. If there were a second referendum, how would you vote? Corbyn says he has been quite clear about party policy is. He says, if there were a referendum, the party would have to decide what its position was. Q: Are you also banning shadow ministers from meeting May to discuss Brexit? And what will happen to Labour MPs who do meet May? This question, from a journalist, also provokes some jeering from the audience. Corbyn says he can understand why some Labour MPs might take a different view. But he says the Labour party has been united. It was united in the votes on Tuesday night and on Wednesday night. He again appeals to May to take the no-deal option off the table. Corbyn is taking questions now. He will deal with media ones first, then some from members of the audience. Q: If there were an election, would it still be Labour policy to leave the EU? He says at an election Labour will put forward what it wants. But Labour is a large organisation. The Labour manifesto will be decided by many people. He says he will just be one person in the room. He refers to Labour\u2019s Brexit policy agreed at the conference in Liverpool. Corbyn claims that he personally would not have final say on party\u2019s Brexit policy at an election, because it would be decided collectively. Q: As leader of the opposition, at a time of crisis, if the PM asks you to talk, shouldn\u2019t you go? Otherwise don\u2019t you end up making her look reasonable, and yourself like a wrecker? This question provokes jeering from Labour supporters in the audience. Corbyn says Labour has clearly said what it wants from Brexit. Over the last month the government has been threatening people with a no-deal Brexit. That is why he said May had to take a no-deal Brexit off the table first. That is entirely reasonable, he says. He says he did meet the PM in December. They agreed five days of debate, and a vote on 11 December. But then May cancelled the vote. He says he is happy to put forward Labour\u2019s point of view. It will do that in parliament, in amendments. Corbyn suggests a meeting with May of limited value because she went back on what she agreed on a December vote. Q: Will Labour support a move in the Commons to extend article 50? Corbyn suggest is may be necessary to extend article 50. Corbyn says the government has survived a confidence vote \u201cfor now\u201d - implying he may table further confidence motions. He says, if the government presses ahead with a no-deal Brexit, Labour will look at other options, including a people\u2019s vote. Labour is the party that wants to bring people together, he says. He says the real divide in the country is not between leave and remain, but between the many and the few. (This was the theme of a major speech Corbyn delivered a week ago.) Corbyn says Tuesday in the Commons, when MPs voted on Brexit, was chaotic. But he says on that day the Department for Work and Pensions (which is headed by the Hastings MP Amber Rudd) announced changes to pension rules that could cost some pensioners thousands of pounds. And he ends by challenging the government to deliver a society that will work for all. Corbyn says we have \u201ca government in name only\u201d. The government\u2019s authority has been shredded, he says. He says the best solution for the country is a general election. Corbyn says May has suffered the most devastating defeat in parliament, on her main policy. It is the biggest defeat any government has suffered in history. Her deal is now dead, he says. He says May is \u201ccompletely unable to grasp what actually happened\u201d. Corbyn urges May to \u201cditch her red lines\u201d and \u201cget serious\u201d about considering alternative options. He says May offered talks, but then the government confirmed she would not take no deal off the table. Corbyn renews his call for May to rule out a no-deal Brexit before engaging in talks. He says, with no deal still on the table, the talks will be phoney. She would just be running down the clock, with the intention of forcing MPs into backing her option when a no-deal Brexit becomes imminent. He says the government is spending \u00a34.8bn preparing for no-deal, even though that cannot take place. (The government disputes this; it says some of that spending is necessary whatever type of Brexit occurs.) Corbyn says Hastings it the town the inspired the writing of the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. It is a book that inspired him, he says, and a generation of people to look at the world differently. Jeremy Corbyn is just about to start giving a speech in Hastings. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has said the Scottish National party will demand that a second EU referendum can only take place with a \u201cfour nation lock\u201d, where the referendum result will be valid only if all four parts of the UK vote the same way. In an opinion piece for the Scotsman, the first minister called for legislation to be tabled enabling a second EU referendum but added protections were needed to prevent Scotland, and Northern Ireland, if they yet again voted for EU membership, being taken out of the EU because England voted leave. In 2016, Scotland voted 62% in favour of remain, and Northern Ireland by 56%, but their votes were outweighed by the significant pro-leave result in England and Wales. May, however, seemed not to recognise that split, Sturgeon said. The sheer scale of the prime minister\u2019s historic defeat does not seem to have registered with her, but the nature of that loss means the whole approach of the UK government has to change. Sturgeon carefully avoided saying that SNP support for a putative second EU referendum would be conditional on that being accepted, since the party accepts it would not win majority support at Westminster, but she wrote: A second referendum would not guarantee that Scotland\u2019s wishes will prevail, although SNP members would seek to amend any legislation with a \u201cfour-nation lock\u201d so that the UK could only leave with the agreement of all the UK\u2019s nations. The only way to ensure that democratic guarantee, of course, is for Scotland to be an independent country. Sturgeon floated that measure before the 2016 referendum, but it was rejected by David Cameron, then UK prime minister. The convention in the UK is that referendums treat the UK as a single constituency. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, told the Observer in October last year the party was mooting it again as one potential price for backing the \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d campaign. Sturgeon set out the SNP\u2019s three key demands for Theresa May in the cross-party talks on resurrecting the prime minister\u2019s fatally-wounded Brexit deal. She said those were: ruling a no-deal exit from the EU; an immediate application to the EU to \u201cstop the clock\u201d by extending the article 50 deadline well beyond 29 March; and May must also bring forward legislation preparing for a second EU referendum. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, has been saying more about her talks with Theresa May this morning about Brexit. (See 8.06am and 10.28am.) She said that they had a \u201crobust discussion\u201d but that May did listen to what she had to say. I think the prime minister was in listening mode - the meeting overran by about 15 minutes which is a good sign. I still remain really concerned that this reaching out across parliament is happening far too late and I\u2019m not convinced she\u2019s willing to loosen any of the red lines she\u2019s set herself. She still thinks it\u2019s going to be possible to tweak this deal sufficiently to get the 230 MPs that voted against it to swing behind it - I remain pretty sceptical about that. That\u2019s why she\u2019s going to have to come back and take a look at the possibility of a people\u2019s vote again. Lucas said she had repeatedly urged May to rule out a no-deal Brexit. And she said she concluded that May was \u201cnot hugely receptive\u201d to the idea of extending article 50. In business questions in the Commons Sir Christopher Chope, the Tory Brexiter, has just accused unnamed cabinet ministers of \u201ctreacherous comments\u201d. He said they should abide by the 2017 Conservative party manifesto, which said the UK would be leaving the single market and the customs union, and he seemed to be referring to ministers like the justice secretary David Gauke, who yesterday indicated that he would be willing to see the UK stay in the customs union. Here is the Labour MP Mike Gapes criticising Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to set conditions before he agrees to meet Theresa May to discuss Brexit. (Corbyn says May should rule out a no-deal Brexit first.) Nigel Evans is another Tory Brexiter who has had a meeting with the PM this morning to discuss Brexit. According to the Press Association, on his way in Evans said: We are leaving the EU. That\u2019s number one. The prime minister is listening to the 17.4m people and the red line that\u2019s most important is that we are leaving the EU. Some MPs need to accept that. We need to do trade deals throughout the world. We want to do them with the EU, but we should do them with the rest of the world as well. Leadsom tells MPs that the arrangements for the Brexit \u2018plan B\u2019 debate (my characterisation of it, not hers) will be subject to a business of the House motion, and that that motion will be amendable. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs that on Monday Theresa May will make a statement to MPs about what happens next in the Brexit process, and that she will table a motion. The debate will be held on Tuesday 29 January, she said. She said it would last a full day. MPs will debate what happens next with Brexit on Tuesday 29 January. This is the debate where MPs will push for votes on \u2018plan B\u2019 amendments. And Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics a few minutes ago that he would be meeting David Lidington, the Cabinet Office meeting, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, and Gavin Barwell, the PM\u2019s chief of staff, to discuss Brexit. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, has been invited too. The Labour frontbench is boycotting these meetings until Theresa May rules out a no-deal Brexit, but Benn said he was going because he chaired a cross-party committee. Asked if he was demanding that the government rules out a no-deal Brexit, Benn said he had been calling for this for some time. The Tory Brexiters David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith, Mark Francois, Owen Paterson and Steve Baker, went into the Cabinet Office this morning for talks with the government about Brexit, the Press Association reports. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said that when she met Theresa May to discuss Brexit this morning, May refused to rule out no deal. Lucas said: I repeatedly urged her again and again to take no deal off the table because I think it completely skews the talks because you know that cliff edge is there. She also said that May was resisting the option of extending article 50. Last night Nick Boles, the Conservative MP who has tabled a bill intended to ensure MPs can vote to prevent a no-deal Brexit happening in 2019, has admitted that he will have to change it. Under the original plan, if the Commons fails to pass a Brexit deal by 11 February, the Commons liaison committee would be asked to come up with an alternative plan. But the liaison committee met last night and decided it does not want to take on the task of resolving Brexit. So Boles has said he will amend his bill. But the rest of the bill still stands. The key provision in it is that, if MPs don\u2019t agree a Brexit plan, the government would then be obliged to ask the EU to extend article 50 until the end of the year. The text of it is here (pdf). Conservative supporters of a second EU referendum have launched a \u201cRight to Vote\u201d campaign, as new figures suggested that a majority of voters in Tory seats want the public to have the final say on Brexit, the Press Association reports. Analysis of polls involving more than 6,700 voters suggested that majorities in nine out of 10 Conservative-held constituencies back a so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Conservative MP Phillip Lee, who resigned as a minister in Theresa May\u2019s government last year over Brexit, said that Tory support for a fresh poll was \u201cunderestimated\u201d and was \u201cgrowing fast\u201d among the party\u2019s MPs. He said: The data provided by Best For Britain\u2019s research shows that people have been underestimating Conservative support for a referendum giving people the final say on Brexit. I know from private conversations at Parliament that backing among my colleagues for a referendum is there and is growing fast. We aim to accelerate that with today\u2019s launch of the Conservative-led Right to Vote campaign. Conservative politicians need to pay attention to today\u2019s findings. Across all Conservative-held parliamentary seats, 55.8% of voters in Conservative seats want a referendum if parliament is deadlocked over Brexit, as it continues to be. As the Press Association reports, the analysis was conducted by market research company FocalData for the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum and the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate, using a method called \u201cmultilevel regression and post-stratification\u201d. Its findings suggested that a majority in 290 of 317 Tory-held seats (91.5%) back a public vote if parliament is unable to break the deadlock on Brexit. On Good Morning Scotland David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, confirmed that, in her talks with opposition MPs about an alternative approach to Brexit, Theresa May would not countenance a second referendum. This is from the BBC\u2019s Gary Robertson. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, says unless May drops this red line, the SNP won\u2019t take part in these talks. UPDATE: Here is the full quote from Mundell. He said: She\u2019s not going down a route to stop Brexit, she is willing to discuss anything people want to put on the table to get us to a point where we can get a majority in parliament to support a deal to allow an orderly Brexit. Everything is up for discussion but what isn\u2019t going to be an outcome is arrangements that seek to stop Brexit, which I believe the People\u2019s Vote is designed to do. Not only that it would be extremely divisive in our country. We\u2019ve had a people\u2019s vote, people voted across the United Kingdom and a United Kingdom-wide vote to leave the EU, and we are respecting the result of that and seeking to deliver Brexit, but an orderly Brexit. Over in Strasbourg, MEPs are predicting that in the immediate future a lot will depend on the stance of the Labour party. \u201cWe all know that the Tory party is traditionally divided, which is why those of us who feel it is of great strategic importance to the EU that the UK remains are now looking to the Labour party,\u201d said the Greek MEP Giorgos Kyrtsos, a conservative who sits on the European Parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs committee. If the Labour party changes policy, comes out against Brexit and moves in favour of a second referendum it will find solidarity on the European side. There is a growing tendency among MEPS that we should give remainers a second chance. There are European forces, though not organised at this stage, who want to help them. A lot of things depend on Labour\u2019s stance. Kyrtsos, a member of the European People\u2019s party working group dealing with Brexit, said it was now clear the EU\u2019s more powerful members wanted to be done with Brexit once and for all. He said: Germany, France and other more powerful members of the Union are keen now to move forward with Brexit, albeit for obvious reasons in an organised way. They want to be rid of this issue. The Lib Dems have suggested they may not back Labour in future confidence votes if Jeremy Corbyn does not back a second referendum, suggesting any further attempts would only be in order to evade the issue. The leaders of the Lib Dems, SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru wrote to the Labour leader last night saying the failure to force a general election meant the party must endorse a public vote on Brexit. A Lib Dem source said later that the party would not back any attempts at no confidence votes unless they appeared to be a genuine change of circumstance. \u201cWe will support any real opportunity to take down the Tories with relish,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe will not be party to Corbyn using spurious means to avoid Labour policy, by pursuing unwinnable no confidence votes.\u201d Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has just been on the Today programme. He took issue with something John Humphrys, the Today presenter, said earlier, about Jeremy Corbyn not having a position on Brexit. Labour does, Gardiner said. It was in the Labour manifesto (pdf), on page 24, Gardiner said. Gardiner also complained about the radio news headlines at 8.30am featuring Tony Blair saying Corbyn should be meeting Theresa May to discuss Brexit (ie, a line critical of Corbyn), but not feature Blair saying a no-deal Brexit should be taken off the table (a line supportive of Corbyn). And Gardiner said Labour frontbenchers would not be meeting members of the government for talks on Brexit. Asked if those talks would be happening, he said: No. I have not had any approach myself from my counterpart in government. And, to the best of my knowledge, none of my colleagues have. Let me be clear; in the Labour party, as a shadow cabinet, we operate as a team. We are quite clear that it is important that the prime minister shows good faith; she takes away the gun that she has been trying to hold to parliament\u2019s head by saying it is either my deal or no deal. Even the chancellor is saying that that no deal should [be ruled out]. When asked why Corbyn was setting conditions for talks with May, when he had been prepared to meet others, sometimes \u201cunsavoury people\u201d (a reference to Hamas), without setting conditions, Gardiner said in this case Labour needed to know that the prime minister was serious about talks. And, to get a deal through parliament, May would have to abandon some red lines. Tony Blair has called for a series of indicative votes on various options for Brexit to help break the parliamentary deadlock. Speaking to the Today programme he urged Theresa May to become a \u201cfacilitator and arbiter\u201d for the options put forward by MPs. He said: She can take a step back and say look we haven\u2019t got an agreement in parliament here are the options, here\u2019s the pros and cons of each option, and yes you run a series of indicative votes. It is obvious thing to do. That\u2019s when people are justified in saying to parliament you\u2019ve got make up your minds. Blair backs calls for MPs to be given indicative votes on alternative approaches to Brexit. The Commons Brexit committee also called for this yesterday. Blair again said the best option would be a second referendum because a hard Brexit would be too \u201cpainful\u201d to the economy and a soft Brexit would be \u201cpointless\u201d because it would hand over power, without influence, to the EU. Blair said extending Article 50 was \u201calmost inevitable\u201d. He added: If I was in government now I would already be having discussions nows about the terms of an extension. I would be saying we need further time to clarify what parliament wants. Blair says extending article 50 \u201calmost inevitable\u201d. But he also urged the EU to make changes. Blair said: In a rational world, Britain would think again and Europe would think again. Over the last 30 months European politics has been in turmoil all over Europe on the very issues that gave rise to Brexit: anxiety around immigration, anxiety around communities left behind, that is what has been producing political convulsion all over Europe. In a rational world Europe would think again on the fundamental questions that gave rise to Brexit and are giving rise to these political convulsions in Europe. I would say is there a way you can meet our anxieties over the questions of immigration and over the questions of integration and you can do that on European wide basis that deals with the problems underlying Brexit. Asked if Corbyn should enter talks with May, Blair said: Of course. If in a moment of national crisis the prime minister asks the leader of the opposition to come and talk, of course he should. Blair says Corbyn should be willing to discuss Brexit with May without preconditions. But he also criticised May\u2019s approach to the consultation. When I hear her sometimes talk about the consultation the next moment she lays down a whole lot of red lines, which make that consultation pretty nugatory. Blair criticises May for imposing her own conditions on Brexit talks. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has said Theresa May expressed a willingness to carry on talking when he met her on Wednesday night to discuss the way forward on Brexit. \u201cI think in the current state of crisis that is a positive,\u201d he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. He said he told the prime minister that his party wanted the prospect of no-deal taken \u201coff the table\u201d and a second referendum. He went on: The fact that my team are willing to continue talking to her team of senior ministers this morning suggests that at least there is a willingness to explore these things. The Green MP, Caroline Lucas, is to use her meeting with Theresa May to call for the convening of a citizens assembly to help break the Brexit deadlock. Lucas said: I want to use this opportunity to try to break open this gridlocked process and let different voices be heard. I\u2019ll tell the prime minister loud and clear that she must urgently rule out the threat of a no-deal Brexit and I\u2019ll make the case for the public to have a say on what happens next. I want to use this meeting to open up the debate about our shared future to the whole country - not restrict it to the corridors of Westminster - so I\u2019ll also urge her to consider the role a citizens\u2019 assembly might play as a complement to a people\u2019s vote. Here\u2019s what Ukip makes of Hammond\u2019s reassurance about a no-deal. The shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, has defended Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to refuse talks with the prime minister unless she rules out a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News Gardiner used Hammond\u2019s leaked remarks about MPs blocking a no-deal to back Corbyn\u2019s stance. Gardiner said: The chancellor himself is saying that actually no-deal could be taken off the table within a matter of days. If the chancellor of the exchequer is saying it then it seems to me that is not an impossibility at all. We have senior members of the cabinet threatening to resign unless no-deal is taken off the table, so you need to give some credence to the possibility that it might happen. European Union and World Trade Organization checks would be mandatory on both sides of the Irish border in the event of no-deal Brexit, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on customs has said. Michael Lux, a former head of customs legislation and procedures at the European commission, said the UK would have to impose customs checks and tariffs on the northern side of the border, despite claims to the contrary by Brexiters. Under WTO rules, the UK could opt for zero tariffs, but it would be obliged to offer this free-trade deal to every other country. This would mean cheap food and dairy products, which currently attract high tariffs, from countries such as Brazil or New Zealand, and might also lead to chlorinated chicken from the US ending up on British supermarket shelves. \u201cIt would kill UK farming,\u201d said Lux. He also said Brexiters who claim the UK won\u2019t impose checks in Northern Ireland are naive. Anna Soubry, the pro-EU Tory MP, is frustrated by the government\u2019s continued refusal to compromise. Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis has played down that leaked recording of Chancellor Philip Hammond suggesting to business leaders that MPs could block a no-deal. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said: \u201cParliament can rule out a no deal and the way it does that is to agree a deal.\u201d Asked if he agreed with Hammond that MPs could stop a no-deal Brexit, Lewis said: I don\u2019t quite take that view. What I\u2019m saying is that I accept parliament has an ability to do a whole range of things, what I\u2019m saying is the best way to avoid no deal is to agree a deal. Lewis refused to say what the government would compromise on to get a deal. He appeared to rule out both joining a customs union and a second referendum. On a customs union he said: \u201cWe are determined to deliver on the referendum and that means having an international trade policy that is independent.\u201d That restates what Downing Street and Theresa May were saying yesterday - but it does amount to ruling out the UK staying in the customs union for good, which is one of Labour\u2019s main Brext demands. (If the UK were in the customs union, it would not be able to strike its own trade deals.) Tory chair Brandon Lewis restates government\u2019s objection to staying in customs union. And Lewis dismissed a second referendum as a \u201cbetrayal of democracy\u201d. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said Theresa May faced having to take the risk of potentially splitting the Conservative Party in order to break the parliamentary deadlock. He told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: If she wants to negotiate with all parties in parliament, and if she wants to do that in good faith, she has to say \u2018Okay, I\u2019m not sticking to every single one of the red lines that I\u2019ve established\u2019. We are saying let\u2019s do this in the best interests of the British people, in the way that every industry, every trade union, every manufacturing association - and even some people in her own cabinet - are saying is the sensible way forward. Take no deal out of the equation and let\u2019s get down to doing a solid deal. Business leaders call on Theresa May to back a second referendum More than 170 leading business figures have called for Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to back a second referendum on withdrawal from the European Union. The group, including the world-renowned architect Lord Foster, Nobel Prize winner Sir Paul Nurse and lastminute.com co-founder Baroness Lane-Fox, warned MPs \u201cmust not waste any more time on fantasies\u201d. The business figures\u2019 letter, which is published in the Times, calls for the leaders of the main parties to back a so-called People\u2019s Vote and ask the public if they still wish to leave the EU. \u201cMany businesses backed the Prime Minister\u2019s Brexit deal despite knowing that it was far from perfect,\u201d said the letter. \u201cBut it is no longer an option. The priority now is to stop us crashing out of the EU with no deal at all. The only feasible way to do this is by asking the people whether they still want to leave the EU. \u201cWith the clock now ticking rapidly before we are due to quit, politicians must not waste any more time on fantasies. We urge the political leadership of both the main parties to support a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d The front pages of the papers today all lead with Brexit news, and while all agree there is political chaos, they disagree about who is to blame: is it Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn or MPs in general? Our full papers wrap is here. And because we all need a little something to cheer us up... The Guardian\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott writes that it is not likely that Brexit in name only or no exit at all will lead to radical reform of our broken system. Brexit, the gilets jaunes protesters in France, the terrible pain inflicted on Greece and the support for the League/Five Star government in Italy all tell their own story. Europe is alive with political discontent that reflects the demand for deep and urgent reform, but the chances of getting it are less likely if the status quo prevails. Why? Because the forces of conservatism are strong. Change comes about only when the pressure for it becomes too great to resist. The financial crisis provided one such opportunity to reform an economic system that for many people clearly wasn\u2019t working; Brexit was a second. The left\u2019s case for Brexit has always been based on the following notions: the current economic model is failing; socialism is needed to fix it; and the free-market ideology hardwired into the EU via the European Central Bank, judgments of the European court of justice and treaty changes will make that process all but impossible without a break with the status quo. It is theoretically possible that in the event of a \u201cBrexit in name only\u201d or no Brexit at all, policymakers will push ahead with what\u2019s needed in order to make a reality of the slogan \u201ca reformed Britain in a reformed Europe\u201d. Possible but not all that plausible, given that it would require breaking up the euro, more autonomy for individual countries to intervene in the running of their economies, and a simultaneous philosophical U-turn in the big member states. Much more likely is that the pressure for change will dissipate and the real grievances of those who voted for Brexit will be quietly forgotten. The softer the Brexit, the more convinced the EU will be that it has been doing the right thing all along. Britain will not go up in flames, but there will still be consequences. Leave voters will feel they have been victims of an establishment stitch-up. The anger will not go away and will eventually resurface. Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog as well follow the twists and turns of UK politics. Well, she may have survived the no-confidence vote yesterday, but Theresa May is by no means out of the woods. The PM has to present a new (\u201cPlan B\u201d) Brexit deal by Monday. Yesterday, the beleaguered prime minister suggested she was keen to pursue a more collaborative approach to Brexit, saying \u201cI\u2019m inviting MPs from all parties to come together to find a way forward, one that both delivers on the referendum and can command the support of parliament. This is now the time to put self-interest aside.\u201d This invitation has had a somewhat mixed reaction. Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not meet with her to discuss a new Brexit deal until she agrees to remove the threat of a no-deal Brexit, a request May has refused. The Scottish National party\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, met May last night, as did Plaid Cymru leader Liz Saville Roberts. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, also accepted her invitation and Greens MP Caroline Lucas is due to meet with May at 9am this morning. We will be bringing you all the news and analysis as the day\u2019s events unfold. If you\u2019ve got a question, comment, or the answer to this Brexit stalemate, please get in touch via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com) or on Twitter (@mskatelyons). Thanks for reading. Off we go!",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn could face up to a dozen resignations from the Labour frontbench if the party backs a second referendum as a way out of the Brexit crisis. A string of junior shadow ministers have told the Guardian they are strongly opposed to the idea of a second referendum, which they fear would expose Labour to a vicious backlash in leave-voting constituencies. The development follows another tense day of brinkmanship in Westminster between Theresa May and the Labour leader as they seek a way out of the crisis that has engulfed both major parties. Corbyn refused to enter talks with Theresa May on Thursday until she ruled out the idea of a no-deal departure, and demanded that his party\u2019s MPs refuse similar invitations. Later May wrote to Corbyn telling him that ruling out no-deal was \u201can impossible condition\u201d and calling on him to join cross-party discussions. With no sign of the impasse being broken, pressure is growing on Labour to consider a so-called people\u2019s vote as the UK prepares to leave the EU on 29 March. With Corbyn\u2019s hopes of a general election fading with the prime minister\u2019s narrow victory in the no-confidence vote, some Labour supporters are raising pressure on Corbyn to support a second referendum. A snap poll conducted after the crushing defeat of May\u2019s Brexit plan has found a 12-point lead for remaining in the EU \u2013 the largest margin since the 2016 vote. But the Guardian has contacted several senior shadow ministers from constituencies that voted to leave the EU who say they would consider their positions if Corbyn conceded to pressure to back a second referendum. One said: \u201cI would be in a really difficult position if we backed a second referendum. I would have little choice but to stand down if I was to have any hope of retaining my seat and representing my constituents.\u201d Another said they had made their views clear to Corbyn\u2019s office and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. \u201cI would feel deeply uncomfortable about going into a people\u2019s vote at this stage. Given all the commitments that we made in the general election, we have to carry them out. This concept of blocking Brexit is wrong and would break a link with millions of our traditional voters who expect us to keep our word,\u201d the shadow minister said. Anti-Brexit campaign group Labour for a People\u2019s Vote published a list of 71 Labour MPs who support its cause on Wednesday, and claimed many more were privately supportive. But backbench MPs who have been canvassing opinion claim that number is matched by vehement opponents of a referendum, some of whom would be prepared to break the whip rather than support it. Several shadow cabinet ministers, including the Labour chair, Ian Lavery, and the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, are also sceptical, believing the party\u2019s first priority must be to keep up the pressure for a general election. Lavery made a passionate intervention against a new referendum at last week\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite trade union, has also said it would be a \u201cbetrayal\u201d to seek to reverse the 2016 result. Gloria De Piero, the shadow justice minister, told the Guardian she was not in favour of a second referendum. \u201cI stood on a manifesto that promised to respect the referendum result,\u201d she said. Other shadow cabinet ministers, including the deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, are more sympathetic towards a second referendum. Labour strategists have not ruled out a free vote on a second referendum, believing that whipping MPs either to support or oppose a referendum would open a deep rift. Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said that with no agreed Brexit deal in place, it was unclear what options would be offered on a second referendum \u2013 and referendums were the wrong way to resolve the complex situation. \u201cI think they\u2019re terrible ways to make rational decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a swathe of the public who would never forgive us.\u201d At a meeting in Hastings, East Sussex, Corbyn remained uncommitted on the idea of a second referendum, saying again that it remained one of several options if an election did not happen. Explaining why he was the only opposition leader not to meet May for one-to-one talks, Corbyn dismissed the cross-party discussions as a \u201cstunt\u201d, adding that May appeared unable to grasp the fact that her withdrawal agreement was now \u201cdead\u201d. \u201cShe seems to be prepared to send the country hurtling towards a cliff-edge,\u201d he said. But Labour\u2019s former prime minister Tony Blair said Corbyn was wrong to refuse to meet May. \u201cIf, in a moment of national crisis, the prime minister asks the leader of the opposition to come and talk, of course he should,\u201d Blair told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Another former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, called for the Brexit deadline to be extended by a year, as he said the country was now \u201cmore divided\u201d than at the time of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s poll tax. MPs should force the government to extend article 50 and then give the public the final say on a renegotiated Brexit deal, he said. Speaking in Edinburgh on Thursday evening, Brown condemned the \u201cparalysed and immobilised\u201d parliament in Westminster and said there was rising anger from the public who wanted to be involved in the decision-making process. In a further development, a poll conducted by YouGov of more than 1,000 voters on Wednesday found 56% would now vote to stay in the EU, against 44% who want to leave. Exactly the same proportion of voters said they wanted a second EU referendum \u2013 three points higher than recorded in a similar poll before Christmas.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 18 January. Top stories Queensland looks set to be overrun with federal politicians as the major parties make the state battleground central ahead of the federal election. On Thursday, Bill Shorten announced, \u201cFor the next nine days, the headquarters for me is Queensland\u201d as his \u201cBill bus\u201d took off on a 1,400km odyssey across more than half of Queensland\u2019s federal electorates. Meanwhile, the Coalition has moved its campaign headquarters to Brisbane and Scott Morrison will hold a cabinet meeting in the sunshine state within the next couple of weeks. Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has insisted he \u201cnever said there was no collusion\u201d between Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential election campaign and Russia \u2013 only that Trump himself was not involved. Giuliani told CNN he did not know if others involved in the campaign had worked with Russia, and said: \u201cIf the collusion happened, it happened a long time ago.\u201d But he once again defended the president. \u201cThere is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States committed the only crime you can commit here, conspiring with the Russians to hack the DNC,\u201d he said, referring to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and leaking the emails of senior Democrats during the 2016 campaign. As the royal commission into aged care begins in Adelaide, personal carer Kim Barwise has appealed for it to recommend improving staff ratios in aged care facilities, recalling how she felt while scrambling to serve breakfast to 16 elderly nursing home residents, while also trying to comfort a dying woman. \u201cShe had no family or anyone in the room,\u201d Barwise told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt just seemed so heartless. There was no dignity.\u201d When she had formerly worked as an enrolled nurse, staff to resident ratios were 1:5. As a personal carer today, the ratios are 1:16. Slater and Gordon\u2019s general manager for civil liability, Nunzio Tartaglia, said poor staff ratios were often a factor in aged care-related litigation cases coming across his desk. World Theresa May has told the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, his demand that she rule out a no-deal scenario before any Brexit talks is \u201can impossible condition\u201d, and called on him to join cross-party discussions immediately. May has been meeting other party leaders in the aftermath of the resounding defeat for her Brexit plan earlier this week, as the public urges Britain\u2019s politicians to \u201cstop messing about\u201d. At least nine people have been killed and another 22 injured in a car bombing at a Colombian police academy in Bogot\u00e1, recalling the high-profile attacks associated with the bloodiest chapters of the country\u2019s guerrilla and drug conflicts. Authorities have yet to suggest who was behind the attack, but attention has focused on leftist rebels from the National Liberation Army, ELN. The Trump administration may have separated thousands more migrant children from their families than previously known, with a damning report saying the practice was going on for more than a year before it became publicly known. \u201cThe total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities is unknown,\u201d the report said. The Italian town of Sambuca is selling homes for less than the price of a coffee. The deal is a bid to revive an area that has undergone depopulation in recent years, with residents moving to bigger cities. New owners must commit to refurbishing their new homes within three years. The Brazilian model Gisele B\u00fcndchen has hit back at the country\u2019s agriculture minister, who called her a \u201cbad Brazilian\u201d for her environmental activism and said she did not know \u201cthe facts\u201d. B\u00fcndchen said the \u201cbad Brazilians\u201d were those responsible for Brazil\u2019s worst deforestation figures in a decade. Opinion and analysis Australia\u2019s beaches haven\u2019t always been a safe space for the LGBTI community, writes Gary Nunn, and are still conservative compared to European beaches such as Sitges in Spain. But people like DJ Dan Murphy have certainly made their mark in \u201ccamping things up\u201d. Murphy is one of more than 1000 Lifesavers with Pride and has made two viral videos on Bondi beach featuring drag queens. Nudist beaches in Sydney such as Little Congwong, Lady Jane and Obelisk have long had a gay subculture, but Australia has a way to go before becoming as uninhibited as Berlin, \u201cwhere you can shed all your clothes in the Tiergarten\u201d and no one bats an eyelid. Uber Pool is riding in cars with strangers \u2013 for Brigid Delaney this offers the potential for new friends, business partners, maybe even marriage. Instead she finds herself sitting in car after car with silent strangers scrolling their phones. Is the problem actually Sydney? \u201cAfter the fifth ride, the atmosphere in the car was so consistently frosty that I downgraded my pool expectations from \u2018creating a new start-up together\u2019 and \u2018perhaps marriage\u2019 to \u2018a hello would be nice\u2019,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe experience was really getting me down. Yes, it was only $3.50 to get from Bondi to Redfern, but my fellow passengers were awful.\u201d Sport The first time Alex de Minaur played Rafael Nadal, at Wimbledon last year, he was walloped in straight sets.

The British ultrarunner Jasmin Paris is celebrating after becoming the first woman to win the gruelling 268-mile Montane Spine Race along the Pennine Way. Paris shattered the course record by 12 hours \u2013 while also expressing breast milk for her baby at aid stations along the route. Thinking time: Road kill \u2013 the truest free-range? Alaskans have been enjoying free, organic meat for the past 50 years: is it time for other societies to stop turning their noses up? Every year, between 600 and 800 moose are killed in Alaska by cars, leaving hundreds of pounds of organic, free-range meat on the road. State troopers who respond to these collisions keep a list of charities and families who have agreed to drive to the scene of an accident at any time, in any weather, to haul away and butcher the body. In Alaska, not eating the meat is viewed as an embarrassment, and a waste of precious resources. \u201cAlaska\u2019s geography, demographics and can-do spirit make it uniquely fit for salvaging roadkill.

And Lleyton Hewitt has accused Bernard Tomic of blackmail and making physical threats against his family, the ABC reports. Hewitt slammed Tomic as a \u201cclown\u201d and said the tennis star would never play in the Davis Cup again for Australia while he was captain.

However, speaking on a conference call with business leaders alongside the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted that the government was \u201cnot in control\u201d of the process and suggested Boles\u2019 amendment could lead to article 50 being \u201crescinded\u201d, according to a transcript obtained by the Daily Telegraph. Boles said the transcript of the call \u201cmade quite plain that [Hammond] thought this was fantastic\u201d. Boles had originally intended for parliament\u2019s liaison committee of select committee chairs, headed by the Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, to take submissions from MPs on the future of the Brexit process, but that aspect has now been shelved because of objections from the committee. The MP tweeted on Thursday that the liaison committee was \u201cnot keen to take the role that is proposed for it\u201d. Boles said that part had been an \u201coptional extra\u201d and the focus was taking no deal off the table.",

      "bodyText": "The manslaughter prosecution against David Duckenfield, the former South Yorkshire police officer in command at Hillsborough when 96 people were killed in a crush, is \u201cunfair\u201d, his barrister has argued. Ben Myers QC, setting out the issues on which he will base Duckenfield\u2019s defence, said he was being \u201csingled out unfairly\u201d, that many other people made mistakes, and other factors contributed to the disaster \u2013 including the behaviour of some Liverpool football club supporters. \u201cBy virtue of bad stadium design, bad planning and some aspects of crowd behaviour, some aspects of police behaviour, mistakes by various individuals and genuine human error, this tragedy happened,\u201d Myers told the 12-person jury at Preston crown court. Duckenfield, now 74, was promoted to chief superintendent and appointed to take charge of the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest just 19 days before the match took place on 15 April 1989. He had \u201climited experience of Hillsborough, and none as a match commander\u201d, Myers said. He told the jury that Duckenfield\u2019s case is that \u201che wasn\u2019t negligent and did his best in extraordinary circumstances\u201d. Myers questioned whether the risk of death by crushing in the central \u201cpens\u201d of the Leppings Lane terraces, which the prosecution has described as \u201cobvious and ever present\u201d, was foreseeable. He said: \u201cWhere the tragedy at Hillsborough is concerned, a lot of people have been very wise after the event.\u201d Myers acknowledged that it is \u201cterrible\u201d to think of the crush that caused the deaths and said his questions on behalf of Duckenfield were not asked out of \u201clack of sympathy with those who have suffered\u201d. He said: \u201cIn no way do we seek to insult Liverpool football club or its supporters, or the city of Liverpool itself.

Matthews said Duckenfield was accused of an \u201cextraordinarily bad\u201d series of failings at Hillsborough, where the risk of death by crushing, if the crowd in the pens became seriously overcrowded, was \u201cobvious and serious\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the kind of price tag usually associated with discount stores such as Poundland, but an entire Scottish shopping centre is to go under the hammer with a reserve price of just \u00a31. The Postings mall in Kirkcaldy, in which 14 of the 21 shops currently lie empty, is being auctioned by its City pension fund owner next month, according to the auctioneer\u2019s website. That a shopping centre could change hands for less than the cost of a short stay in its rooftop car park underlines the current high street crisis. While locals may worry about the growing number of empty stores in their town centre, the other side of the coin is the devastating impact on retail property values. When it opened in 1981 the Postings, which cost \u00a34.25m to build, promised to be a magnet for shoppers. Each store opening prompted local news, with 1980s TV celebrity and Generation Game presenter Isla St Clair even dropping in to cut the ribbon at the William Low store (a supermarket chain bought by Tesco in 1994) when it opened. But the now dated precinct, in what is Gordon Brown\u2019s former constituency, has fallen on hard times. It was dealt a big blow in 2015 when Tesco \u2013 despite personal protestations from Brown \u2013 closed the superstore which anchored the mall and also doubled as the town\u2019s post office. But the cost of the annual upkeep of the Postings is now thought to be higher than the \u00a3152,000 it brings in from rent, making its ultimate parent Columbia Threadneedle Investments eager to offload it after more than 15 years of ownership. Columbia Threadneedle said the Postings had been acquired for its rental income stream but that it had now been repositioned as a development opportunity that \u201cdoes not fit the holding fund\u2019s investment strategy\u201d. Quite who would see it as a development opportunity is another matter. Famed as the birthplace of the 18th-century economist Adam Smith, Kirkcaldy once had coal, textiles, linoleum and electronics.

      "bodyText": "Not long after Kirsten Gillibrand arrived in Congress more than a decade ago, she was nicknamed \u201cTracy Flick\u201d in a reference to the calculating and aggressive blond high school student played by Reese Witherspoon in the 1999 film Election. It was not a term of endearment, but rather a derisive attempt to put down what Gillibrand\u2019s colleagues \u2013 many of them men \u2013 complained was her unbridled ambition. \u201cIt was a put down to me and other ambitious women, meant to keep us in our place,\u201d Gillibrand wrote in her 2014 book, Off the Sidelines. \u201cYes, I\u2019m competitive. I fight for what I believe in, and I drive hard toward my goals. Does that make me ruthless and crazed? No.\u201d This week, Gillibrand furthered her quest to dispel the notion that ambition was something for women to fear by declaring, during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, that she was forming an exploratory committee about a run for the White House. And with women voters now making up nearly 60% of the Democratic base, Gillibrand is betting they hold the keys to her pathway to the party\u2019s nomination for president. An outspoken critic of the current administration, Gillibrand, 52, has cultivated the most anti-Trump voting record for any Democrat in the US Senate. She called on the president to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct by as many as 17 women, and infamously told a crowd of Trump\u2019s White House tenure: \u201cHas he kept his promises? No. Fuck no.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s very fierce and fearless about her that is empowering and could be a good quality in a candidate,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and author of the book Dear Madame President. \u201cShe takes on fights that are controversial and that sometimes gets her into hot water. But she keeps at it anyway.\u201d First elected to Congress in 2006, Gillibrand defeated three-term Republican incumbent John Sweeney to represent what was, at the time, a heavily conservative district in upstate New York. She was appointed in 2009 to fill the New York Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton \u2013 after the latter became Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state \u2013 and was re-elected on three occasions, most recently in the 2018 midterms. As she prepares to formally launch her 2020 campaign, Gillibrand will join a crowded and diverse field of Democratic primary contenders. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary under Obama, are among those who have confirmed their intention to run. Expected to soon follow are Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, while others mulling a bid include former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. Gillibrand is poised to spend the weekend courting Democratic party activists and donors in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state considered vital to securing the nomination. Gillibrand is regarded as a formidable contender whose focus on issues aimed at advancing women in the workplace and combating sexual violence earned her a nickname as the \u201c#MeToo Senator\u201d. A former lawyer, Gillibrand was at the forefront of pushing legislation that would take the prosecution of sexual assault cases in the military outside the chain of command \u2013 a years-long campaign that ultimately failed.

But there was little sense \u2013 in an invite list that stretched from the anti-European Tory right and the DUP to pro-Europeans in the opposition parties \u2013 that this was a process which recognised that the politics of Brexit crossed a watershed on Tuesday night when Mrs May\u2019s deal was so humiliatingly defeated.</p> <p>The first problem is that Mrs May is in denial about what actually happened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-loses-brexit-deal-vote-by-majority-of-230\" title=\"\">on Tuesday</a>. She was trounced. She was around 120 votes short of a Commons majority. So she needs to win over at least 120 MPs. She won\u2019t do that by trying to chisel the odd vote out of the leaver right with marginal concessions. That\u2019s what she tried in December and again this week. It was a doomed quest. It still is. She will only get 120 votes by engaging with other parties and agreeing to Brexit policy compromises.</p> <p>The second problem is that this is a minimalist exercise conducted entirely on Mrs May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/may-will-stick-to-brexit-principles-in-cross-party-talks-says-no-10\" title=\"\">pre-existing terms</a>. Inviting MPs to discuss the crisis is fine. But this crisis requires a trust-based process. It needs planning and structure \u2013 and some privacy for negotiation. It should be a series of reciprocal conversations, with proposals on the table, followed by considered responses on both sides. Whether she likes it or not, Mrs May is in a political horse trade. Instead she is hurrying through multiple meetings before launching her plan B on Monday. This way of cobbling things together at the last minute has let her down <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44749993\" title=\"\">in the past</a>. It seems very likely to do so again next week. This time, though, the country\u2019s future is at stake, not just hers.</p> <p>The third problem is that time is running out. There are only 10 weeks to go before a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/hammond-tells-business-leaders-no-deal-brexit-will-be-stopped\" title=\"\">no-deal crash-out</a> on 29 March. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/what-are-the-alternatives-to-mays-rejected-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">much to solve</a> and a lot to legislate. The EU also has to agree to any new approach. Though Mrs May will unveil plan B on Monday, the debate on it will not be until 29 January. By then, 10 weeks will nearly have shrunk to eight. The suspicion is that Mrs May is still trying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/just-stop-messing-about-hastings-aghast-at-brexit-impasse\" title=\"\">to run down the clock</a>. She did it in December when she postponed the meaningful vote. Now she seems to be doing it again.</p> <p>This is not just dangerous but duplicitous. It implies she is still politically focused on the leavers sitting behind her for those missing 120 votes when she should be looking across the Commons for them. Her whole strategy, both on the clock and on talking to opposition MPs, appears to be to use the prospect of no-deal to scare MPs into the government fold and keep her party together. This is the strategy that failed so conclusively on Tuesday. Mrs May needs to learn from her mistakes, not to repeat them \u2013 a warning that applies in spades to any reckless thoughts she may be harbouring of calling an early election.</p> <p>If a thing is worth doing \u2013 and preventing a no-deal Brexit is certainly that \u2013 then it is worth doing properly. Even now, this means measured but innovative thinking, not quick fixes. The indispensable precondition of this is time. That is why the first thing that opposition leaders and MPs of all parties should press for, on Monday, is to extend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\" title=\"\">the article 50 process</a>, with the EU-27\u2019s agreement, for a period of several months. The purpose would not be to drag the process out. It would be to give MPs and Mrs May the necessary space to reach a reasoned solution to the impasse if they can, without the threat of an imminent crash-out from the EU. It would also enable the search for a solution to go beyond parliament, with the inclusion of the citizens\u2019 assembly that could help to deepen the democratic credibility of what in any event will be a controversial outcome. Extending article 50 is the necessary foundation of a collective national effort to save Britain from an approach to Brexit that, since Tuesday, is now dead and buried.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government was accused of watering down plans for a total ban on police conferring after the deaths of suspects, after it approved new rules for officers following the most controversial cases. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, on Thursday approved revised rules first drawn up by the police watchdog in 2014, but changed after fierce opposition from the police and claims that armed officers would lay down their weapons in protest. They are meant to cover cases such as the Mark Duggan shooting in 2011, when officers were cleared of wrongdoing but police involved in the incident sat together in a room writing up parts of their statements for eight hours afterwards. This undermined confidence in their accounts. A complete ban on conferring about any issue after an incident, which some had called for, was rejected, as was mandatory separation of officers immediately after an incident such as a shooting, use of a stun gun or death in custody. Instead officers will be told they should not confer but, if they do, they need to state the reason why and any conversation should be recorded on body-worn video or be conducted with an independent observer present. The wrangling over the rules started when the then Independent Police Complaints Commission published the proposed draft guidance for consultation in 2014. The dispute went on so long the IPCC was abolished and is now the Independent Office for Police Conduct. On conferring, the revised IOPC guidance approved by the home secretary stresses the need to ensure public confidence. It states: \u201cOur preference for achieving this is to keep key policing witnesses separate from the moment it is operationally safe to do so, until after they have provided their personal initial account.\u201d The police say conferring covers only the lead-up to the use of force, and, for instance, an officer who opens fire would not confer about why they had taken a decision to do so. Critics, including the high court, have said conferring is an opportunity for collusion. The new guidance says after a shooting or death in custody the assumption from IOPC investigators should be that officers are treated as a witness, not a suspect, unless evidence emerges to the contrary. Police, especially firearm officers, said they felt criminalised after events, which is unfair as they are public servants exercising their lawful powers to protect the public. Families of those who have died felt IOPC investigations needed to be more robust and were too soft on the police. Both families and police agreed the investigations take too long, with distress to officers and grieving relatives. Deborah Coles from Inquest, which supports families whose loved ones have died after police contact, said: \u201cOfficers not conferring is vital to the truth. Anything less undermines confidence that the police can be held to account. This is watered down and the government and IOPC appear to have caved to the police.\u201d The original guidelines put out for consultation called for the immediate separation of officers and for them to make a full statement immediately after the incident instead of 48 hours later. Officers will make an initial account and then have 48 hours to make their full account under the new guidelines. The guidelines immediately separating and standing down officers would not apply in cases such as police shooting a suspect in a terror attack when officers would still be needed on operational duty. Shaping government thinking was the fear that firearms officers would surrender their guns in protest. Ministers needed more officers to volunteer to carry guns because of the rising threat of a terrorist gun attack in the UK, similar to that suffered by Paris in November 2015. Former prime minister David Cameron said he had commissioned a review about the protections for firearms officers. Ch\u00e9 Donald, the lead on firearms for the Police Federation, was scathing about the review: \u201cThat is cold comfort for officers out there doing the job, knowing that if they are forced to pull the trigger their lives will probably be overturned while they are under investigation, often for years. Where\u2019s the evidence to show this has been looked into diligently, as we would expect for such a responsible role in policing?

Javid said: \u201cAny use of force by the police must be proportionate and necessary and the public must have confidence that investigations following a police shooting incident are independent and robust. \u201cBut we must also make sure armed officers feel empowered to use their skills and experience in order to save lives in the most dangerous situations.\u201d The government hailed an increase in firearms officers in response to the terrorist threat.

Production at Glemsford, which currently makes products including baby bottles, will transfer to Drachten in the Netherlands next year. A spokesperson for the company said the closure of the factory would have happened regardless of Brexit, but acknowledged that the current political situation in the UK would have been a factor in executives\u2019 thinking.

The health department then works to place them in the home of a sponsor, usually a relative or someone close to their family.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration may have separated thousands of migrant children from their parents at the border for up to a year before family separation was a publicly known practice, according to a stunning government review of the health department\u2019s role in family separation. A report by the health department\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) published on Thursday said officials at the health department estimated \u201cthousands of separated children\u201d were put in health department care before a court order in June 2018 ordered the reunification of 2,600 other children. \u201cThe total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities is unknown,\u201d the report said. This report shows that not only did the US government probably separate thousands more children from their parents than previously thought, but it was separating families well before the policy was made public in April 2018. In the summer of 2017, one year before the general public knew mass family separations were taking place, officials at the health department\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) observed a steep increase in the number of children referred to ORR care who had been separated from their parents or guardians by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), according to the report. Usually, children put in health department care have traveled to the border without a parent or guardian. The health department then works to place them in the home of a sponsor, usually a relative or someone close to their family. If a sponsor cannot be found, children are put in foster care. Occasionally, children would be separated from the adult who they traveled with but, the OIG report said: \u201cHistorically, these separations were rare and occurred because of circumstances such as the parent\u2019s medical emergency or a determination that the parent was a threat to the child\u2019s safety.\u201d In response to the unusual increase in children whom the government separated from their families, officials began informally tracking separations using an Excel spreadsheet that was later processed into a database. This process was not formalized. This informal tracking revealed that in 2016, of all the children in ORR care, 0.3% had been separated from a parent or guardian. By August 2017, the proportion of separated children had risen to 3.6%, according to the report. \u201cThousands of children may have been separated during an influx that began in 2017, before the accounting required by the court, and HHS has faced challenges in identifying separated children,\u201d the report said. It was not until April 2018, however, that the Trump administration publicly announced it was changing the law to make more family separations possible. That month, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced the \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy that would allow parents to be held in immigration detention while children were put in health department custody. Advocacy groups had been warning for months that family separations were already taking place, but widespread public outcry against the practice did not emerge until after Sessions announced the policy. Facing significant public pressure, the Trump administration on 20 June ended the family separation policy it had created. A week later, a federal judge ordered 2,600 children to be reunited with their parents in response to a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project and lead attorney on the family separation case, said the civil rights group would return to court in response to the OIG report. \u201cThis policy was a cruel disaster from the start,\u201d Gelernt said. \u201cThis report reaffirms that the government never had a clear picture of how many children it ripped from their parents.\u201d There had not been a centralized system in place to identify, track or connect separated families, according to the report, but the government had to create a process to identify quickly and reunite families in compliance with the court order. In the OIG report, the health department said in the five months following the order, it was still identifying children who should have been considered separated but were not being clearly tracked in government systems. So far, 2,737 separated children have been identified. Those children are separate from the new estimate included in Thursday\u2019s report, which said: \u201cThe Court did not require HHS to determine the number, identity, or status of an estimated thousands of children whom DHS separated during an influx that began in 2017.\u201d The health department\u2019s Administration of Children and Families (ACF), which oversaw care of separated children, emphasized its role in family separation was the care of children, not in enforcement of separations. Lynn Johnson, assistant secretary for ACF, wrote in a letter included with the report that the agency has also introduced new processes to track separated children. Despite the OIG\u2019s findings, warnings from child advocates and public outcry, the Trump administration has not ruled out bringing family separation back in a different form. In November, Trump\u2019s nominee to run US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), Ronald Vitiello, declined to rule out the possibility that the US could again separate families at the border. And the Trump administration has reportedly weighed family separation alternatives including a \u201cbinary choice\u201d plan that would give parents the option to separate voluntarily or be detained together for years.",

Prior to the Spurs game, many said \u201cManchester United haven\u2019t played anyone yet\u201d but the Norwegian quickly showed how far his side have come in defeating a title-challenging Tottenham team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/17/jose-mourinho-rejects-criticism-of-manchester-united-tenure\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho says Manchester United not ready for modern football</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s been no secret that Solskj\u00e6r was appointed on an interim basis but if an interim manager does really well should it always follow that he becomes appointed permanently? Of course, Solskj\u00e6r more than deserves to be considered but I believe that the decision of the board to appoint the next Manchester United manager cannot be made based on emotion and short-term feelgood nostalgia of a former player taking the team back to the \u201cgood old days\u201d. Rather the board need to make a decision with a three- to five-year strategy in mind where United can challenge for the Premier League and Champions League every season.</p> <p>For me, more importantly than looking at the great results now, the board should be asking: \u201cCan Solskj\u00e6r lead the team to win the Champions League in the future?\u201d I think if you asked many United fans this question now, many would be unsure. In comparison, if you asked the same hypothetical question, if a candidate such as Zinedine Zidane was appointed in his first role after winning three consecutive Champions League titles at Real Madrid, there would be more certainty among United fans.</p> <p>All of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s rhetoric so far has been about bringing the good days back to Old Trafford. It is all very romantic and nostalgic but this could possibly blind the United board from making a decision in looking forward rather than constantly looking back.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve been intrigued to see the reaction to Manchester United\u2019s win against Spurs at the weekend, with lots of supporters and pundits already making a case for why Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r should be given the job full-time. Prior to the Spurs game, many said \u201cManchester United haven\u2019t played anyone yet\u201d but the Norwegian quickly showed how far his side have come in defeating a title-challenging Tottenham team. It\u2019s been no secret that Solskj\u00e6r was appointed on an interim basis but if an interim manager does really well should it always follow that he becomes appointed permanently? Of course, Solskj\u00e6r more than deserves to be considered but I believe that the decision of the board to appoint the next Manchester United manager cannot be made based on emotion and short-term feelgood nostalgia of a former player taking the team back to the \u201cgood old days\u201d. Rather the board need to make a decision with a three- to five-year strategy in mind where United can challenge for the Premier League and Champions League every season. For me, more importantly than looking at the great results now, the board should be asking: \u201cCan Solskj\u00e6r lead the team to win the Champions League in the future?\u201d I think if you asked many United fans this question now, many would be unsure. In comparison, if you asked the same hypothetical question, if a candidate such as Zinedine Zidane was appointed in his first role after winning three consecutive Champions League titles at Real Madrid, there would be more certainty among United fans. All of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s rhetoric so far has been about bringing the good days back to Old Trafford. It is all very romantic and nostalgic but this could possibly blind the United board from making a decision in looking forward rather than constantly looking back. In many games the TV cameras are panning to Sir Alex Ferguson every few minutes and, for me, this represents looking into the past rather than the future. I understand that there is an entrenched playing philosophy that brought unprecedented success to the club. To this extent I agree with Gary Neville\u2019s comments this week that the philosophy at United is crucial but I disagree that no one should be allowed to shape their own version of it. The beauty of football is that there are several ways to win, so to give Solskj\u00e6r the job on the basis of replicating what has been successfully done in the past could prevent a successful evolution that United may need.

He retired six years ago so at what point is the club going to move on and say: \u201cWe need to create a new history?\u201d I understand why there is so much nostalgia with Solskj\u00e6r because things became very toxic under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and it was also hard under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal but I think that a long-term strategy based on nostalgia is a recipe for disappointment. Perhaps I am influenced by philosophies like the one at Chelsea which was \u201cIf it isn\u2019t broken, change it\u201d which saw us win three league titles in five years playing three different formations and tactical strategies so that the opposition could never keep up with our evolution at the time. Solskj\u00e6r is an inexperienced manager who has become the first person to win his first six games at Manchester United. It\u2019s an incredible achievement. However is that really enough to give him one of the biggest jobs in the world at a time when the club really need to make a \u201chead\u201d rather than \u201cheart\u201d decision?

As a public sector pensioner I am dependent on the state for my pension, and what scares me most is the prospect of a no-deal Brexit leading to a major economic downturn. If that happened government revenues would collapse and the government would have to make major savings. One obvious source of such savings would be pensions \u2013 the largest item in the social security budget. I don\u2019t welcome the prospect of a Greece-like scenario in which a desperate government makes swingeing pension cuts in an effort to balance the books.

Not so. The Tory party will have to rationalise its internal position, so the party can formulate a single position regarding our relationship with the rest of the world. Similarly, Labour will have to rationalise its position regarding our trade deficit and the scope for public spending.

As a public sector pensioner I am dependent on the state for my pension, and what scares me most is the prospect of a no-deal Brexit leading to a major economic downturn. If that happened government revenues would collapse and the government would have to make major savings. One obvious source of such savings would be pensions \u2013 the largest item in the social security budget. I don\u2019t welcome the prospect of a Greece-like scenario in which a desperate government makes swingeing pension cuts in an effort to balance the books. Rather than rely on the predictions of members of either the visionary left of Larry Elliott or right of Roger Bootle, I would prefer some continuation of the status quo that would guarantee my pension income for the indefinite future. Derrick Joad Leeds \u2022 Larry Elliott writes that only a rupture with the EU will alter the failed status quo. Not so. The Tory party will have to rationalise its internal position, so the party can formulate a single position regarding our relationship with the rest of the world. Similarly, Labour will have to rationalise its position regarding our trade deficit and the scope for public spending. Britain needs a politics that reflects our diminished status in the world, and the fact that Britain is now owned by foreign interests. Martin London Henllan, Denbighshire \u2022 Theresa May cannot construct a solution to Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn cannot construct a solution to Brexit. Responsible MPs must work across party boundaries and build a coalition with a six-month mission to find a softer Brexit or facilitate a people\u2019s vote. Kenneth Clarke and Margaret Beckett, as respected and immensely experienced figures representing no threat to the political ambitions of their younger colleagues, are the dream ticket to head up the administration to solve this mess. Mike Shearing Southall, London \u2022 The interests of the nation come a long way behind those of the Conservative party (Letters, 17 January).

While the official al-Shabaab explanation is that it is retaliatory action for Kenya\u2019s military intervention in southern Somalia and its participation in Amisom, there is a masking of the broader al-Shabaab strategy. This is to destabilise the states neighbouring Somalia which have Somali-speaking minority populations, in order to establish a sharia-defined east African caliphate.</p> <p>You report that Kenya\u2019s president said the country would \u201crelentlessly pursue\u201d the planners of the assault. The 2 million-plus ethnic Somali Kenyans (in the Nairobi suburb of Eastleigh, as well as Wajir, Mandera and Garissa counties) may well feel the heavy hand of the Kenyan security forces; the international community should counsel against this, in order not to alienate this important ethnic and religious segment of the Kenyan state.</p> <p>The threat of al-Shabaab can only be ignored by the west at its peril. It has been described as the world\u2019s largest and most effective jihadist group; almost half of all Islamist-related violence in Africa may be attributed to it, according to the US-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies. Renewed international effort from western countries to support the African Union, Somalia and Kenya in their campaign against al-Shabaab is in effect an extension of their duty of care to their own populations, given the credible level of linked terrorist threat to migrant communities.

      "bodyText": "The massacre of 20-plus civilians by al-Shabaab fighters at a hotel in Nairobi (SAS hero is hailed as Kenyatta orders hunt for hotel terrorists, 17 January) is the third major attack on the Kenyan state within the last five years; two previous being the Westgate shopping mall (71 fatalities) and the Garissa University College (148 fatalities). While the official al-Shabaab explanation is that it is retaliatory action for Kenya\u2019s military intervention in southern Somalia and its participation in Amisom, there is a masking of the broader al-Shabaab strategy. This is to destabilise the states neighbouring Somalia which have Somali-speaking minority populations, in order to establish a sharia-defined east African caliphate. You report that Kenya\u2019s president said the country would \u201crelentlessly pursue\u201d the planners of the assault. The 2 million-plus ethnic Somali Kenyans (in the Nairobi suburb of Eastleigh, as well as Wajir, Mandera and Garissa counties) may well feel the heavy hand of the Kenyan security forces; the international community should counsel against this, in order not to alienate this important ethnic and religious segment of the Kenyan state. The threat of al-Shabaab can only be ignored by the west at its peril. It has been described as the world\u2019s largest and most effective jihadist group; almost half of all Islamist-related violence in Africa may be attributed to it, according to the US-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies. Renewed international effort from western countries to support the African Union, Somalia and Kenya in their campaign against al-Shabaab is in effect an extension of their duty of care to their own populations, given the credible level of linked terrorist threat to migrant communities. The Trump administration may also have second thoughts about running down its troop commitment to the Africa Command.

It was perhaps the best match of the tournament so far, watched by a handful of diehard fans and friends in the small hours of Friday morning in an echoing Margaret Court Arena when, but for a smattering of seagull droppings that rendered an alternative outside court unusable, it might have started and finished at a civilised hour.</p> <p>The Spaniard, irritable and rattled for much of the two hours and 42 minutes it lasted after they got under way at 12.30am, dredged up two glorious shots to finish it at 3.12am for a 6-4, 6-7 (3), 7-5 win that put her into the third round on Saturday. But Konta can be proud of her contribution to a memorable if very odd occasion.</p> <p>\u201cShe started better than I did, but I think I did a good job of raising my level to make it a competitive match,\u201d Konta said later. \u201cThere were only a few points in it at the end. It\u2019s not ideal for anyone to do any physical activity when it\u2019s bedtime, but it is what it is and both of us were in the same boat.</p> <p>\u201cOnce [Alexander] Zverev and [J\u00e9r\u00e9my] Chardy\u2019s match went to a fifth set [on the same court], we were actually going to go out to Court No 3 to start, but there was seagull poo everywhere and they had to clean the court. That would have taken 10 to 15 minutes and we were in the same boat anyway.</p> <p>\u201cIdeally, both of us would have wanted to play earlier, but we don\u2019t make the schedule and we both dealt with the same challenge. I think it\u2019s more important to focus on the level of the match we had. It was actually a very good match. It was unfortunate that more people couldn\u2019t enjoy it during the day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/18/confident-alex-de-minaur-unruffled-by-prospect-of-facing-rafael-nadal-again\">Confident Alex De Minaur unruffled by prospect of facing Rafael Nadal again | Simon Cambers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think I played a great match. That had a lot to do with the chemistry between us and the way our game styles match up. Garbi\u00f1e and I, every single match has been three sets.

      "bodyText": "Johanna Konta became the last of eight British players to leave the 2019 Australian Open, and in the most bizarre circumstances, sharing the record for the latest ever start to a grand slam match with her opponent, Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza. Their second-round battle was also a wonderful spectacle, full of rich, ripped ground strokes from all quarters, dogged defence and high passion. It was perhaps the best match of the tournament so far, watched by a handful of diehard fans and friends in the small hours of Friday morning in an echoing Margaret Court Arena when, but for a smattering of seagull droppings that rendered an alternative outside court unusable, it might have started and finished at a civilised hour. The Spaniard, irritable and rattled for much of the two hours and 42 minutes it lasted after they got under way at 12.30am, dredged up two glorious shots to finish it at 3.12am for a 6-4, 6-7 (3), 7-5 win that put her into the third round on Saturday. But Konta can be proud of her contribution to a memorable if very odd occasion. \u201cShe started better than I did, but I think I did a good job of raising my level to make it a competitive match,\u201d Konta said later. \u201cThere were only a few points in it at the end. It\u2019s not ideal for anyone to do any physical activity when it\u2019s bedtime, but it is what it is and both of us were in the same boat. \u201cOnce [Alexander] Zverev and [J\u00e9r\u00e9my] Chardy\u2019s match went to a fifth set [on the same court], we were actually going to go out to Court No 3 to start, but there was seagull poo everywhere and they had to clean the court. That would have taken 10 to 15 minutes and we were in the same boat anyway. \u201cIdeally, both of us would have wanted to play earlier, but we don\u2019t make the schedule and we both dealt with the same challenge. I think it\u2019s more important to focus on the level of the match we had. It was actually a very good match. It was unfortunate that more people couldn\u2019t enjoy it during the day. \u201cI think I played a great match. That had a lot to do with the chemistry between us and the way our game styles match up. Garbi\u00f1e and I, every single match has been three sets. So we obviously do feed off each other\u2019s game quite well, to play at a high level. It doesn\u2019t guarantee we will have epic battles every time but it shows some game styles match up better than others.\u201d She was disappointed with the result but encouraged by the performance, adding: \u201cI look to take every opportunity to learn from every single match. I would have liked to have won and learned, but it didn\u2019t go my way.\u201d The thousand or so fans who had waited for the match soon dwindled to a couple of hundred but, at the end, they stood and cheered in appreciation of players who accepted their chore with the stoicism of professional athletes used to such things \u2013 even though they could easily have had the match moved to the smaller, empty Court No 3. Konta struggled to read the Spaniard\u2019s rhythm in the early exchanges, shoving a backhand long from the baseline to surrender the first set. However, her level rose sharply in the second and stayed there until the end. She had the sniff of a break-back in the fourth game then saved two break points for four-all. By the time they got to the tie-break \u2013 with the roof now shut to keep out light rain \u2013 Muguruza\u2019s confidence had dipped and Konta cashed in to force a decider. They went shot-for-shot in the third but the pressure was on Konta, behind in the serving cycle. As the clock ticked past 3am, the British No 1 held to love to stay in the tournament, but Muguruza brought up match point moments later with a wondrous backhand winner, then sealed it with another. Next up for Muguruza is the unpredictable Swiss Timea Bacsinszky, who played way above her world ranking of 145 to beat the Russian qualifier Natalia Vikhlyantseva. Serena Williams is still the raging favourite to win her eighth Australian title, and bring her total to 24, equal with Margaret Court\u2019s career tally. She hit 20 clean winners in only an hour and 10 minutes to dismiss the Canadian Eugenie Bouchard for the loss of four games, and is likely to be equally ruthless against the Ukrainian teenager Dayana Yastremska, who took an hour and half to beat the No 23 seed Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro, confirming that her first-round win over Sam Stosur was no fluke.

      "bodyText": "The credit agency Moody\u2019s has said Debenhams will struggle to refinance its debts without raising new funds from shareholders as it warned creditors of a higher risk they would not be paid back by the retailer. The department store chain, which last week said it had net debt of \u00a3286m, is battling to reach a new deal with its banks this month after a difficult Christmas capped off a lacklustre 2018 during which it issued three profit warnings. In a note explaining its decision to cut Debenhams\u2019 credit outlook to negative from stable, which will make it harder for the company to borrow money, Moody\u2019s said the action by two key shareholders after a dive in the company\u2019s share price was a mark of dissatisfaction among investors that could hinder access to fresh capital. It added that the purchase of House of Fraser out of administration by Sports Direct had only ramped up pressure on Debenhams because it had resulted in the rival chain\u2019s stores continuing to trade with heavy discounts. \u201cToday\u2019s change in outlook reflects our view that there is a risk that refinancing negotiations may not result in a timely and cost-effective solution and thus the process could ultimately culminate in losses for financial creditors,\u201d said David Beadle, a Moody\u2019s vice-president. The Debenhams note came on the same day that Moody\u2019s downgraded the struggling fashion chain New Look\u2019s credit rating on \u00a31bn of debt to C, its lowest possible junk bond status. The downgrade came as New Look prepares a refinancing package that would involve a debt for equity swap and cash raising that could result in bondholders owning up to a 92% stake in the company. Another ratings agency, S&amp;P, also downgraded New Look\u2019s debt on Thursday ahead of the restructuring, saying New Look would face a liquidity crisis if the move was not approved next week. Debenhams has put on hold its plan to raise cash by selling its Danish Magasin du Nord chain after failing to receive strong enough offers. It has not ruled out any options to secure its future, including an insolvency process that could speed up a plan to close up to 50 of its 165 UK stores. Pressure on the company ramped up last week when the chairman, Sir Ian Cheshire, and chief executive, Sergio Bucher, were ousted from the boardroom by major shareholders Sports Direct and Dubai-based retail billionaire Micky Jagtiani\u2019s Milestone Resources, which voted against them at the retailer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. Cheshire stepped down immediately and was replaced by the interim chairman, Terry Duddy, the former boss of the now defunct Argos and Homebase owner Home Retail Group. Bucher will stay on but not as a director. After weak sales and pressure on profit margins over Christmas, Moody\u2019s said it expected Debenhams\u2019 underlying profits to fall by up to \u00a320m this year, having previously predicted they would be similar to last year.",

      "bodyText": "The Prince of Darkness is set to add a small corner of the Spanish city of Segovia to his temporal portfolio after a judge rejected complaints that a proposed statue of the devil was an affront to religious sensibilities that could make the city a focus of satanic worship. The local council commissioned the statue to celebrate the legend that its Roman aqueduct was built by the devil in a single night \u2013 and to get tourists into less-visited neighbourhoods. But a judge temporarily halted the statue\u2019s installation after a local group launched an online petition claiming the paunchy, selfie-taking effigy was overly jovial and insufficiently repulsive to constitute an accurate representation of Satan. The group also expressed fears that the bronze statue could prove a magnet for people inclined towards diabolical veneration. On Thursday, however, the city council was informed that the judge had dismissed the complaint and ordered the complainants to pay \u20ac500 (\u00a3440) in legal costs. Segovia\u2019s heritage councillor, Claudia de Santos, said the decision meant the statue could be installed as early as next week on the intended spot 200 metres from the aqueduct. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a time when people and groups can use social media to amplify their grievances when they feel their rights are being attacked,\u201d said De Santos. \u201cBut I think the great majority of Segovians would see what they\u2019ve done as irrational. We don\u2019t understand how they can claim that this statue somehow violates their religious sensibilities.\u201d She said the council\u2019s aim had always been to use the legend and statue to attract more visitors to other examples of the city\u2019s Roman and medieval splendours. Asked how the council felt about suggestions that the statue could make Segovia a pilgrimage site for satanists, De Santos replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any possible answer to that question. I don\u2019t have the intellectual capacity to counter it and I doubt there is such a thing as satanic tourism.\u201d The statue\u2019s sculptor, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abella, said he was delighted at the judge\u2019s decision and hoped it would end the media frenzy of the past few days. Abella said he was angry that his son had been abused online for politely asking people to sign a counter-petition to get the statue up. \u201cWhat a load of nonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve even ended up talking to CNN about all this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Unai Emery has made it clear that bringing a loan signing to Arsenal this month will be difficult, although the manager suggested the impending departure of the club\u2019s head of recruitment, Sven Mislintat, would have no effect on their efforts in the transfer market. Emery said last week that Arsenal were exploring loan deals only \u2013 the club spent heavily by their standards last summer \u2013 and he has an interest in Barcelona\u2019s Denis Su\u00e1rez, who would bring a fresh option on the wing. Emery has other targets such as the Sevilla midfielder \u00c9ver Banega as the club look to plan for the end-of-season departure of Aaron Ramsey to Juventus on a free transfer. It has so far proved tough for Mislintat and his team to persuade potential selling clubs to part with players on loan and Arsenal would seemingly have to offer assurances that they would make any deals permanent in the summer. It is unclear whether they would be prepared to do that with Su\u00e1rez. Emery sounded a little downbeat when asked for a progress update and he seemed to suggest it would be one incoming loan, at best. \u201cThis transfer window is not easy to take players that can help us with better performances than the players we have now,\u201d Emery said. \u201cThe club is working and I spoke with Sven, with Ra\u00fal [Sanlleh\u00ed, the director of football] about different possibilities with players. \u201cThey are working but it is not easy to take players that can help us with big performances now. We are looking, the club is working with the possibility to loan players and if we can take [somebody] for helping us in a different position on the team, then maybe we can.\u201d Emery was tight-lipped on the subject of Su\u00e1rez. \u201cThey are conversations between us, privately,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say to you this private conversation with the club.\u201d Emery also gave nothing away with regard to Mislintat\u2019s future, adopting his now standard feign of ignorance on weighty issues, but he maintained it had been business as usual with his colleague. Mislintat, who has grown frustrated very quickly \u2013 he joined from Borussia Dortmund in November 2017 \u2013 will continue to give his all until such time as he departs. \u201cI was working with him over the last two weeks,\u201d Emery said. \u201cWe had two or three meetings together and we are working normally. I don\u2019t know another different issue to him. Is he leaving? I don\u2019t know. When I spoke with him it was all normal. My relationship with him for transfers in the last two or three weeks \u2013 we are speaking about that. Today, for me, the normality is working with him.\u201d Arsenal entertain Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday in a pivotal game in their battle for a Champions League finish. They trail their fourth-placed rivals by six points and, after three defeats in their last six Premier League matches, they can ill afford another loss. Emery, who described the Chelsea game as a \u201csmall final\u201d, said that Mesut \u00d6zil was fit and available for selection after knee trouble but it was also the case at West Ham last Saturday, when Arsenal lost 1-0, and he left him out of the squad entirely. \u00d6zil has not played since the 1-1 draw at Brighton on Boxing Day and he faces an uncertain future under Emery. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about that,\u201d Emery said, when asked whether \u00d6zil could leave the club this month. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about how he can help us this year with good performances. He\u2019s had injuries and not been OK to play matches but now after these two weeks maybe this Saturday will be OK for him. He\u2019s training consistently with his work over the past two weeks and I think he can be [available]. \u201cI want consistency. He\u2019s had some injuries and these injuries mean that sometimes he is OK and sometimes he isn\u2019t. I want every player to give the same work every day to be OK for every match. With Mesut, it\u2019s the same.\u201d",

Golf?\u201d The TV and radio presenter is not principally known for her political comment, but it was clear, more than 30,000 likes and 5,000 retweets later, that she had captured something of the public mood. As his successor as prime minister endured an unprecedented drubbing in parliament with the rejection of her deal with the EU, where was the man who had set the Brexit boulder careering downhill in the first place? The answer came the following morning, when Cameron, wearing shorts and warmly tanned from a recent family holiday at a \u00a31,728-a-night resort in Costa Rica, was stopped by reporters on the doorstep of his Notting Hill home. No, he said, he didn\u2019t regret calling the referendum, though he did regret losing it. \u201cAnd obviously regret the difficulties and the problems we\u2019ve been having trying to implement the result.\u201d And off he went for his morning jog, his security car trailing behind him. Anger at Cameron has been widespread since the referendum, as underlined by the response to actor Danny Dyer\u2019s dismissal of him last summer as a \u201ctwat\u201d who had scuttled off to Europe \u201cwith his trotters up\u201d. But it has arguably only deepened as the Brexit crisis unfolded, with even the Washington Post this week pointing out that 58% of Britons have a negative opinion of the former PM, and noting his lack of any sheepishness about his role. His now notorious tweet of May 2015, predicting \u201cstability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband\u201d, has been retweeted ironically more than 20,000 times, and this week was even posted to a billboard in north London by a campaign group calling itself Led By Donkeys. Cameron had promised that he would stay on as prime minister to implement the referendum result, but less than three months later, having stood down as PM, he was gone from parliament as well, saying he did not want to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d to Theresa May. His principal pastime, in the 16 months since, has been to work on his \u00a3800,000 memoirs, as yet untitled and reportedly already topping more than 400,000 words, having purchased a \u00a325,000 designer shed last year in which to put down his thoughts. (He has since bought another one, and a holiday house \u2013 to add to his London and Cotswolds homes \u2013 in Cornwall.) The book, heavily predicted to round on former friend Michael Gove for backing Brexit, is now more than three-quarters written, he reportedly said in December, \u201cbut there\u2019s no great hurry \u2013 I want to get it right\u201d. Events have undoubtedly played a part in pushing back its original publication date last year; it is now pencilled in for September and friends say he is determined to stick to schedule, but a delay in article 50 could see it set back further. Tapping out his memories, however, has left the chillaxing former PM with plenty of time on his hands \u2013 and famously \u201cbored shitless\u201d, according to a friend. He knocked back rumours in November that he was hankering for a return to frontline politics, perhaps as foreign secretary, though he was careful to let it be known he had not ruled out a role in public service in future.

With John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, he will co-chair an initiative to set up protected marine areas. Last month it was confirmed that the parliamentary authorities had cleared Cameron to lead a new \u00a3750m UK-China investment fund, whose backers include Lord Chadlington, a Tory peer and close friend of the former PM. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 January 2019.

For now it was enough for them to have provided a safe space where no one could be harassed or bullied.</p> <p>They realised it was a tough call to get others on board, but if people felt shy about sharing in meetings they were welcome to just come along and listen.

Call it a dry run.</p> <p>Meanwhile back in Downing Street, the prime minister was having talks about Brexit in which nothing she didn\u2019t want to talk about could be mentioned.

Call it a dry run. Meanwhile back in Downing Street, the prime minister was having talks about Brexit in which nothing she didn\u2019t want to talk about could be mentioned. We are now in a dystopia of parallel worlds in which everyone is pursuing their own personal growth programme for which there is no parliamentary majority. We\u2019d have more chance sorting the whole thing out with tarot cards.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, European stock markets have ended the day lower (but not dramatically so) Trade war fears, Brexit uncertainty and the impact of the US government shutdown (approaching its one-month anniversary!) are all weighing on investors. Another blow to the UK economy: Philips has announced plans to shut a UK factory with the potential loss of 430 jobs. The Dutch company plans to close its baby bottle plant at Glemsford in Suffolk in 2020 and transfer most of the work to its home country. Newsflash: Theresa May will not be trekking to Davos next week to scoff fondue with the global elite. The PM\u2019s office has just announced that she\u2019s staying in London to focus on Brexit talks with MPs across the House of Commons, in the hope of reaching a breakthrough. That\u2019s the third high-profile withdrawal in a week. French president Emmanuel Macron is remaining in Paris, where he\u2019ll focus on the Yellow Vest protests. Donald Trump is also staying at home, perhaps concluding that swanking around a ski resort during a government shutdown isn\u2019t a great look. Back in the markets, one of Apple\u2019s key suppliers has sent shivers through the tech sector. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world\u2019s largest independent semiconductor-maker, has slashed its revenue forecast by 14%, and is also reining in investment. It comes two weeks after Apple shocked the markets with a profits warning, as growth in the once-booming smartphone sector slows. The US shutdown is causing considerable pain to federal workers, whose pay checks are on hold. But it doesn\u2019t seem to be driving up unemployment, yet anyway. New figures show that the number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits unexpectedly fell last week, by 3,000 people to 213,000. That suggests the labour market is still robust, extending a long run of impressive \u2018initial claims\u2019 figures dating back to Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Over in Greece, where the government has survived a late-night confidence vote, fears of snap elections have been put on the back burner. However, ministers\u2019 relief is being clouded by warnings that, once again, Athens is dragging its feet on reforms. A jubilant Alexis Tsipras may have survived the vote - welcoming his narrow 151-148 ballot victory as \u201ca vote of confidence in stability \u201d - but the challenges before him are far from over. The first is passage of the landmark Macedonia name-change accord that prompted the leftist leader to call the confidence motion after the Independent Greeks party, his coalition\u2019s junior partner, quit in protest over it. Pulling the same hat trick is far from certain. With the centrist Potami party wavering, it remains unsure if he will win a decisive majority. Although Tsipras has touted the renewal of confidence in his government as the card he needs to push ahead with other initiatives \u2013 from increasing the minimum wage to implementing a new payment scheme for unpaid social security contributions - his government faces growing pressure from the creditors who have bailed out the debt-stricken country to keep up with reforms. Addressing the Greek-French chamber of commerce and industry in Athens on Wednesday night, the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said it was crucial that politicians stayed the course. \u201cGreece has not yet reached the end of the road,\u201d he said insisting that five months after exiting its third international bailout, foreign auditors were still watching the country closely. \u201cThe coming weeks will be decisive \u2026 it is very important that politicians don\u2019t disengage from the agenda of reforms.\u201d Auditors, who return to Greece next week, are especially worried about Tsipras\u2019 pledge to push ahead with handouts \u2013 not least raising the minimum wage \u2013 and the high stock of nonperforming loans in Greek banks which have played a central role in impeding Athens\u2019 hopes of returning to capital markets. Like every government before it, the Tsipras administration faces immense anger over enforcement of reforms with thousands of teachers taking to the streets- and civil servants walking off the job - today. Ouch. Over in New York, Morgan Stanley has just missed Wall Street forecasts. The bank posted profit of 80 cents per share, below the 89 cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Revenue declined by 10% to $8.55bn -- analysts expected $9.3bn. Both its trading and wealth management divisions missed forecasts. UK lenders have become pickier about who they hand credit cards to, the Bank of England\u2019s credit conditions survey shows. It also highlights that risk appetite has been declining for the last couple of years: Economist Howard Archer of the EY ITEM Club says economic uncertainty is hitting demand for credit: Brexit is having an even bigger impact on credit card lending than the financial crisis of 2008, points out Andy Bruce from Reuters: NEWSFLASH: Demand for mortgages and credit is sliding as UK consumers brace for Brexit. The Bank of England has just reported that demand for new house loans in January-March is likely to fall at the fastest pace since 2011. Demand for credit card lending is also shrivelling, and expected to fall at the fastest rate since records began in 2007, the BoE adds. This suggests that worried consumers are putting house moves and purchases on hold, as they worry about the UK\u2019s future, with parliament still deadlocked the way forward. This data comes from the Bank\u2019s latest credit conditions survey, just released. It\u2019s based on data from bank and building society lenders. The Bank says says: Lenders reported that demand for secured lending for house purchase decreased significantly in Q4, and was expected to decrease further in Q1. However, demand for secured lending for remortgaging increased slightly in Q4, but demand was expected to decrease slightly in Q1. Overall demand for unsecured lending increased significantly again in Q4; this was solely driven by a significant increase in demand for credit card lending. However, lenders expected a significant decrease in the demand for credit card lending in Q1, with demand for other unsecured lending expected to be unchanged. Here are the key charts: Overnight, we learned that UK house prices are now falling at the fastest rate for six years - another sign that exiting the EU is affecting the economy. The UK energy\u2019s strategy has been plunged into a \u201cfull-blown crisis\u201d, as Hitachi suspends plans to build a nuclear power station in Wales. China\u2019s Ministry of Finance has hit out at US authorites for launching a criminal probe into Huawei. MOFa spokesperson Hua Chunying has told reporters that China is concerned by the \u201cunusual handling\u201d of the case by US prosecutors, suggesting it was driven by political considerations. Hua added that if civil cases are used \u201carbitrarily to suppress Chinese enterprises then this is not only a violation of free and fair business competition but a violation rule of law.\u201d China\u2019s media are also critical of the move, giving another insight into Beijing\u2019s thinking. Global Times wrote in an editorial today in response to the WSJ story and the proposal from US lawmakers to ban chip sales to Huawei that the \u2018persecution of Huawei\u2019 is a form of \u2018technological McCarthyism\u201d. It says: \u201cAmerica\u2019s treatment of Huawei is full of geopolitical daggers\u2026 The US is angry because of China\u2019s progress. If China wants to keep developing, China needs to bear these kinds of setbacks.\u201d \u201cThe US has prevented these companies from remaining separate from politics. The US has branded Huawei and ZTE as political, and this is a technological Mccarthyism.\u201d Trade war concerns are weighing on the markets today. China\u2019s Shanghai composite index has dropped by 0.5%, following the news that Huawei is being probed by US authorities. European markets have also opened lower, with the FTSE 100 losing 0.35% (or 24 points to 6,838). Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: The negative start follows reports that US Federal Prosecutors are investigating Huawei Technology for allegedly stealing trade secrets. The move comes as US - Sino relations were improving amid a 90-day truce. It goes right to the heart of the unresolved IP issues with China. China are unlikely to shrug this off which is creating a risk off environment. Signs of retaliation from China could see stocks sink further. Chinese technology giant Huawei is at the heart of the dispute between Washington and Beijing. Overnight, the Wall Street Journal reported that US authorities are in the \u201cadvanced\u201d stages of a criminal probe into the company. Citing anonymous sources, the WSJ said the Department of Justice is examining allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from US business partners, including a T-Mobile robotic device used to test smartphones. AFP says: Huawei and the Department of Justice declined to comment on the media report. However, Huawei noted that \u201cHuawei and T-Mobile settled their disputes in 2017 following a US jury verdict finding neither damage, unjust enrichment nor willful and malicious conduct by Huawei in T-Mobile\u2019s trade secret claim.\u201d Earlier this week, Huawei\u2019s founder gave a rare interview in which he denied that his company spies for China, and also praised president Trump. Ren Zhengfei\u2019s daughter Meng is fighting attempts to extradite her to the US to face charges of breaching US sanctions. Newsflash: One of China\u2019s top political leaders will head to Washington later this month to continue trade talks. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on January 30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington, China\u2019s commerce ministry says. Aso\u2019s comments came as one of Japan\u2019s many tech companies revealed it had been hurt by the US-China trade dispute. Nidec, a Japanese precision motor maker, slashed its profit forecast by a quarter and warned that the trade war is deterring clients from spending. Nidec warned (via Reuters): \u201cThe company is seeing an adverse ripple effect of the current U.S.-China trade friction on its operations in many countries, particularly in China,\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in pools this summer \u2013 Uber pools. The ride sharing app now allows (in parts of Australia) the option of splitting rides with strangers, often for less than the cost of a bus ticket. In the last week I\u2019ve had a dozen trips using Uber pool, and each time been excited about the possibility of meeting new people who live in my area, while starting new conversations, connections and friendships. I mean, yes I already have friends. But who doesn\u2019t want more? So how many friendships did I make in my 12 Uber pool rides? Zero. Naught. After the fifth ride, the atmosphere in the car was so consistently frosty that I downgraded my pool expectations from \u201ccreating a new start up together\u201d and \u201cperhaps marriage\u201d to \u201ca hello would be nice\u201d. The experience was really getting me down. Yes, it was only $3.50 to get from Bondi to Redfern but my fellow passengers were awful. This is how a typical ride went. Sprint to random corner \u2013 the app tells me I have \u201ctwo minutes\u201d to get there before the Uber arrives. Do not want to keep my new friends and potential business partners waiting! Make it just in time. Sit in front seat. Say hi to fellow passengers in the back. They are scrolling. They don\u2019t say hello back. Say hello again. Driver says hello. Passengers in back don\u2019t look up to look at me. Ask, \u201cso, where\u2019s everyone off to today?\u201d No answer. Tell car that I am going to Redfern to meet friends for dinner then try to talk about house prices, which is guaranteed to appeal to eastern suburbs riders. Silence. Driver who feels sorry for me talks about the traffic. We talk about the traffic for a bit. Then silence. It is awkward silence. Can\u2019t handle it. What are they scrolling? Instagram? Really? Is it that interesting? Won\u2019t you get a crick in your neck from looking at the screen? Ask the driver if we can turn on the radio. Smooth FM. It\u2019s just like being in a normal Uber. Pointless. Get dropped off first. Turn and look at the two people in the back. Make intense eye contact at the top of their heads. \u201cGoodbye. Have a good night.\u201d They. Do. Not. Respond. At the dinner is a woman who used to own a chain of restaurants. She tells a fabulous story of how a few years ago her dog was kidnapped in Kings Cross. She took all her delivery drivers off the road to search for George and plastered every pole with pictures of his face. Rather than be upset that they couldn\u2019t get their meals delivered, her customers enthusiastically became involved in the search (and eventual rescue) of George. It was like the whole city was invested in George\u2019s safe return. For a few brief days while George was missing, Sydney wasn\u2019t the bad place. It was a big, friendly country town. The conversation switched from George to Uber pool. My friend who had half of Sydney looking for her dog had strong opinions. \u201cI get in them and I,\u201d she waved her arms in front of her face indicating an invisible partition between herself and the other passengers. \u201cI am like \u2013 DO. NOT. TALK. TO. ME. OKAY?\u201d \u201cBut why not?\u201d \u201cI do not want to talk to people. Even if there are other people in the car I pretend I am in an Uber by myself.\u201d A few more Uber pools later, I come to the conclusion that maybe the problem isn\u2019t Uber pool. The problem is Sydney. A line leapt out of Helen Garner\u2019s Tower Diaries that felt particularly true. She was living in Bellevue Hill at the time: \u201cI am invisible in this apartment building. I enter through the front door. Coming out across the carpeted, panelled lobby are three young women, dressed for the office in heels, tight skirts and little sleeveless tops. My neighbours! I want to be greeted and to greet. The first two pass me with heads down, expressionless. The third makes as if to do the same, but I force the issue. I say in a quiet, firm tone \u2018Good morning.\u2019\u201d I also spent years living in Bellevue Hill apartments, and greeted and was greeted by my neighbours the same way \u2013 eyes cut to the ground, blank facial expression, terrified that someone would talk to me. To make eye contact was somehow an intimacy, or an infringement of privacy. Best keep your head down. Best keep scrolling. When a school friend came to visit me from Warrnambool she greeted everyone she encountered on the Bondi to Bronte coastal walk, and only had one or two responses. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very friendly city, is it?\u201d was her conclusion. I thought at the time, but did not verbalise \u2013 \u201cto say \u2018hello\u2019 to strangers is to do a violence to them.\u201d In 2016 I went from Bellevue Hill to spending part of the year in a country town in central Victoria. A violence was done to me on a daily basis. People would greet me and I would scowl and then remember I was here, not there, and here people said hello. It took a long time before I could say hello back. And now that I can say it back, I can\u2019t stop. There\u2019s no Uber pool in the country. There is a taxi service that I take several times a week. When you ring you are put directly through to the taxi over the radio so anyone in the cab can hear the call. There\u2019s a natural pool with this taxi service. If it\u2019s raining, they might ask if I\u2019m okay to share with someone who might be stranded at the station. In the cab, there\u2019s always chatter. I\u2019m back in Sydney for the summer \u2013 a summer spent floating alone in the Uber pool. But life has a funny way of upending your presumptions. Just as I was adjusting to the chilly temperatures of my fellow riders (and by extension damning the whole city as unfriendly scrolling zombies) I lost my laptop. I had put it on the ground outside an apartment building while waiting for one of the Uber pools and in the race to get to the random corner to get the ride, I must have either left it on the ground or it fell out of my bag. I went back the next day. I was, to put it mildly, devastated. Another laptop gone. All that work \u2026 One of the people in the apartment \u2013 a stranger \u2013 was helping me find it. We knocked on all the doors. Then we saw a sign \u201cLAPTOP FOUND\u201d. And an apartment number and phone number. We both got so excited we jumped up and down. It was just like looking for George.

Ngo travels each year to Vietnam to brush up on his language and cultural connections, but says he feels Australian in Vietnam, and Vietnamese in Australia, never quite fitting into either country. \u201cI\u2019m on the outside looking in,\u201d he says. \u201cI won\u2019t give up because I\u2019ve got it easy. My parents have succeeded to allow my generation the right to political thought and political freedom.\u201d When he finishes, he will celebrate with chrysanthemum tea, the first drink his parents were offered when their boat landed. It will make a nice change from the condensed milk and water he intends to drink in the meantime, as a homage to his brother. \u201cNot the most delightful beverage ever,\u201d he concedes.

With Bill Shorten designating Queensland Labor HQ for the next nine days, travelling across the state on a bus, Morrison has called a cabinet meeting in Queensland before the end of the month, as both major parties attempt to lock down the battleground state. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Of all the states, Queensland\u2019s 30 seats are considered to be the most critical. The Coalition needs to hold all 21 electorates it currently claims to have any chance of winning the next election. MPs are putting in wish lists for electorates, while ministers are scouting for announcement and media opportunities in marginal seats, which include Bonner, Dickson, Petrie, Forde, Leichhardt, Capricornia, Dawson and Flynn. While Labor plans to focus much of its campaign operations in Queensland, the Coalition has gone one step further, moving its federal campaign headquarters from Victoria (and last year, Canberra) to Brisbane. Labor established its office in Parramatta early last year and has been conducting test runs for the campaign over the past two days. Coalition MPs are preparing for an election in just over 100 days, while keeping one eye on the possibility it could be called for March. Queensland is no stranger to torrents of attention from federal politicians during election campaigns. Both Malcolm Turnbull and Shorten began their campaigns in Queensland in 2016, when Turnbull hit three electorates in the first day. Shorten admitted on Thursday that he considered the election campaign to be under way as he embarked on the first of a nine-day, 1,400km bus trip across the state. One of Morrison\u2019s first acts as prime minister, following the leadership spill in August, was to launch a Queensland campaign of his own, complete with his own bus, although the tour went slightly off-road when it was revealed he would not be on the personalised vehicle for the majority of the trip, and was instead flying in a bid to reach more seats. The LNP claims its polling shows Morrison to be a more popular choice than Turnbull in marginal seats, although there are fears support is waning the closer it gets to an election, as political fatigue sets in. But Queensland, which held in 2016, when the rest of the nation swung against the government, is still considered the Coalition\u2019s best shot at, if not maintaining government, limiting the loss to one which could potentially be overcome in an election cycle. Morrison is understood to be heading to Queensland almost as soon as he wraps up his Fiji visit. Western Australia, the other focus of the Coalition campaign, was treated to a roaming cabinet meeting in November, as the government attempts to sandbag the seats of ministers Christian Porter, Ken Wyatt and Michael Keenan.",

Internal documents show the Registered Organisations Commission, which investigates union malfeasance, received a tip-off about the conduct of a \u201csenior official\u201d last year. The whistleblower, who worked for an unknown union or employee association, had expressly asked the ROC not to contact their organisation, amid fears their identity could be compromised. But in attempting to send an email to the whistleblower in May, an ROC official mistakenly entered a single wrong character in the email address. The email \u2013 which contained details of the ROC\u2019s conversations with the whistleblower and the identity of the \u201csenior official\u201d \u2013 was forwarded to a random recipient with the same surname but a different first initial. The ROC would not say whether the mistaken recipient worked for the same organisation as the whistleblower. Internal emails show how the ROC scrambled to fix its error the next morning.

Can I urge you to pls. urgently delete it and someone will be in contact with you,\u201d the ROC wrote in an email dated 11 May 2018. The ROC was then forced to apologise to the whistleblower. \u201cI am writing to apologise that the ROC appears to have sent an email, intended for you, to another email address (a person apparently based in [redacted]),\u201d an unidentified ROC official wrote. \u201cIt seems this was because a difference of one character between the two email addresses.\u201d It also disclosed its mistake to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner as a potential privacy breach. The ROC told the information commissioner that the email had contained \u201cemployment-related information including allegations about a senior official in the organisation\u201d. \u201cSteps have already been taken to have the incorrect recipient delete the email, which they confirm that they have done,\u201d the ROC told the information commissioner. Asked what steps have been taken to prevent a repeat of the incident, the ROC reported that: \u201cStaff will be required to verify the correct each [sic] email address input before an email is sent.\u201d The internal emails and documents were obtained through freedom-of-information laws and published earlier this month on the Right to Know website, which champions transparency and accountability of government. It is unclear which union or employer association the case relates to and the ROC has a policy of not publicly discussing protected disclosures. An ROC spokesman told Guardian Australia the person who mistakenly received the email was an \u201cunrelated addressee\u201d to the whistleblower. The spokesman said the incident had been referred to the OAIC, and no further action was deemed to be required. The ROC would not say how it was sure the email had been deleted. \u201cThe ROC had advised the OAIC of the steps it had taken and the OAIC subsequently advised that it did not require any further action from the ROC,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ROC takes the privacy of its stakeholders very seriously, and has a Privacy Policy and Privacy Breach Guide which all staff are required to acknowledge that they have read and understood. The ROC conducts regular and ongoing training to all staff regarding their obligations under the Privacy Act 1988.\u201d Sally McDow, who became an advocate for whistleblowers after revealing wrongdoing at her past employer, Origin Energy, said enormous damage can be done to whistleblowers if their confidentiality is not respected. Any act that threatens the anonymity of the whistleblower can cause \u201ccareer ending impacts\u201d, she said. That included the \u201closs of professional reputation, isolation, harassment and in some cases termination\u201d. \u201cThere is a broad spectrum of performance in this area- some Australian organisations are doing a fantastic job of encouraging employees to speak out and managing whistleblower reports with rigour and independence to maximise best outcomes for those reporting issues and the organisation itself,\u201d she said. \u201cOther organisations are digging their heads in the sand hoping if they keep ignoring the reports and stifling communication channels that the problem will somehow magically disappear.\u201d The ROC was handed a significant budget boost by the Coalition in last year\u2019s budget. The government said the extra $8.1m would help the ROC investigate whistleblower disclosures, among other things. The watchdog was handed broad, coercive powers in 2017 allowing it to investigate the internal governance of unions and other registered organisations. New whistleblower laws are currently before parliament, which will give greater protections to individuals who want to disclose misconduct. The bill includes tougher protections to protect a whistleblower\u2019s identity.",

      "bodyText": "Serbia gave Vladimir Putin a hero\u2019s welcome on Thursday as the Russian president\u2019s plane arrived in Belgrade escorted by an honour guard of MiG-29 fighter jets that he recently donated to the country. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be able to visit friendly, brotherly Serbia,\u201d Putin told the Serbian leader, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, at the airport. Ceremonial cannons fired and church bells rang out to herald Putin\u2019s arrival, and billboards posted around the city bore Serbian and Russian flags. For Putin, who presented Vu\u010di\u0107 with a high state award during the visit, it was a chance to shore up one of the few strong bilateral relationships Russia has in Europe and reinforce Moscow\u2019s claims to maintaining influence in the Balkans. \u201cAlthough Serbia is not a very large country geographically, you can rely on us,\u201d Vu\u010di\u0107 told Putin before the pair went into talks. In a ceremony, Putin presented Vu\u010di\u0107 with the Order of Alexander Nevsky, which in the past has been awarded to the autocratic leaders of Kremlin-friendly, post-Soviet countries. The bonhomie continued as Vu\u010di\u0107 gifted Putin a Sarplaninac puppy. Putin is popular in Serbia, where Russian opposition to the Nato bombing of the country in 1999 and the subsequent independence of Kosovo is still recalled fondly. Vu\u010di\u0107, a former nationalist firebrand who now styles himself as a westerniser, has played a delicate balancing act in recent years, courting Europe while attempting to maintain good relations with Moscow. In interviews with Serbian media on the eve of his visit, Putin lashed out at the west for trying to push Russian influence out of the Balkans. \u201cThe policy of the United States and some other western nations aimed at asserting their dominant role remains a serious destabilising factor here,\u201d he said. Western nations have expressed unease at what they believe to be Russian meddling in the region, including an apparent coup attempt in Montenegro, attempts at destabilisation in Bosnia and a humanitarian centre in southern Serbia that some western intelligence agencies believe has been a front for spying. Putin claimed the EU was forcing Serbia to make an \u201cartificial choice\u201d between Moscow and the west. He complained about the expansion of Nato into the Balkans, with Montenegro joining the military alliance in 2017 after a knife-edge referendum, and Macedonia now closer to joining after recently ratifying an agreement to change its name to North Macedonia and end a long-running dispute with Greece. Vu\u010di\u0107, in an interview with the Guardian in Belgrade last year, said Serbia\u2019s priority was further integration with the EU but that he wanted to maintain warm relations with Putin. \u201cWe are militarily neutral, we have no aspirations to join either Nato or the Russian alliance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a good relationship with Russia and we have no problems with Russia but we are on our EU path.\u201d The big issue for Vu\u010di\u0107 and Putin to discuss on Thursday was an EU-brokered settlement between Serbia and Kosovo, possibly involving an exchange of territories, that Vu\u010di\u0107 has been attempting to sign with his Kosovan counterpart, Hashim Tha\u00e7i. Both leaders are keen to sign a deal despite widespread opposition among their populations and unease among much of the international community about redrawing borders.

Perhaps. And yet, perhaps not. As we know, Gwyneth is the high priestess of selling you shit to heal the ailments that other shit you bought off her may conceivably have caused. I always imagine the classic satisfied customer\u2019s letter. \u201cDear Goop. Thank you for selling me <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/6/17826924/goop-yoni-egg-gwyneth-paltrow-settlement\" title=\"\">the $66 jade egg to put up my vagina</a> and walk around with, which I loved. In an unexpected development I have yet to ascribe to any particular cause, I began to have lower back pain shortly after the purchase. But I love the $89 fascia blaster I purchased to help with this. For whatever reason, I now have long-lasting bruising on my back, and wonder if you have anything in the $100-$200 range that might assist in the treatment of this? Yrs in wellness.\u201d What an end-to-end service it is.</p> <p>Still, until they literally start harvesting our blood, perhaps the chance to boggle at their self-satirising anti-ageing treatments is what we want from our more preposterous celebrities. Consider the gaiety added to various nations by the vanity quests of Simon Cowell, whose reliance on Botox dates back almost to the start of botulism. I could never believe he <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2130318/Simon-Cowell-cancelled-engagement-Mezhgan-Hussainy-string-rows--let-5million-home.html\" title=\"\">broke up his love affair with his own makeup artist</a>. It was just so perfect. I guess you\u2019re only as good as your last contouring palette.</p> <p>As far as the secret of eternal youth went, Cowell was always a restless searcher. I am drawn back to a passage in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/26/sweet-revenge-simon-cowell-review\" title=\"\">Tom Bower\u2019s biography of him</a>, with which he collaborated heavily. At one point, Cowell is \u201cforced to fire a half-deaf woman who had visited weekly to cover him with oil, wrap him in cellophane and squeeze him into a tube with the promise that the paralysing discomfort and itching were guaranteed to detoxify and oxygenate him\u201d. Fair play to her.</p> <p>Cowell\u2019s next obsession was spending five grand for one hour\u2019s treatment in a \u201cbubble\u201d. \u201cThree men had carried the contraption to his bedroom,\u201d noted Bower. It promised to detox, induce weight loss and prolong life. \u201cI hated it,\u201d Cowell tells him. Apparently, \u201cthe German applying the treatment had spent the entire hour promoting his ideas for new TV shows, with the captive patient forced to listen\u201d. Poor Simon. That said, he\u2019ll be begging to go back to \u201cthe bubble\u201d when he finds out what the afterlife has in store for him.</p>",

But I love the $89 fascia blaster I purchased to help with this. For whatever reason, I now have long-lasting bruising on my back, and wonder if you have anything in the $100-$200 range that might assist in the treatment of this? Yrs in wellness.\u201d What an end-to-end service it is. Still, until they literally start harvesting our blood, perhaps the chance to boggle at their self-satirising anti-ageing treatments is what we want from our more preposterous celebrities. Consider the gaiety added to various nations by the vanity quests of Simon Cowell, whose reliance on Botox dates back almost to the start of botulism. I could never believe he broke up his love affair with his own makeup artist. It was just so perfect. I guess you\u2019re only as good as your last contouring palette. As far as the secret of eternal youth went, Cowell was always a restless searcher. I am drawn back to a passage in Tom Bower\u2019s biography of him, with which he collaborated heavily. At one point, Cowell is \u201cforced to fire a half-deaf woman who had visited weekly to cover him with oil, wrap him in cellophane and squeeze him into a tube with the promise that the paralysing discomfort and itching were guaranteed to detoxify and oxygenate him\u201d. Fair play to her. Cowell\u2019s next obsession was spending five grand for one hour\u2019s treatment in a \u201cbubble\u201d. \u201cThree men had carried the contraption to his bedroom,\u201d noted Bower. It promised to detox, induce weight loss and prolong life. \u201cI hated it,\u201d Cowell tells him. Apparently, \u201cthe German applying the treatment had spent the entire hour promoting his ideas for new TV shows, with the captive patient forced to listen\u201d. Poor Simon. That said, he\u2019ll be begging to go back to \u201cthe bubble\u201d when he finds out what the afterlife has in store for him.",

Tim Davie, the chief executive of BBC Studios, turned down the Premier League\u2019s advances on Wednesday, forcing the governing body to turn once again to their shortlist of candidates. Their first choice, Susanna Dinnage, pulled out of replacing Scudamore at the end of last year just weeks before she was meant to start the job. The five-person recruitment panel chaired by the Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck, which is working with the executive search firm Spencer Stuart, has now widened the search and has accepted it could take many months for them to have a new chief executive in place. With the broadening of the search it is not clear whether Tom Betts, ITV\u2019s director of strategy who was on the original shortlist, is still in the Premier League\u2019s sights or even still interested in the job following the recruitment debacle. The hunt has become embarrassing for the Premier League, albeit not its fault. Dinnage was praised by Buck as the outstanding choice when her appointment was announced in November but she pulled out at the end of December. In broadening the search, industry sources point to potential candidates including Dawn Airey, one of the UK\u2019s most experienced media executives who recently returned to the UK after running Getty Images in New York for three years. Airey built her career on a string of high-profile TV roles \u2013 including two stints at Channel 5 where she was famously quoted as saying its strategy was based on the three Fs, \u201cfilms, football and fucking\u201d \u2013 and top roles at ITV and Sky. The 58-year old also spent two years at Yahoo as its top European executive. It is not known if Airey has been approached about the role.

The deal marked the end of hyperinflation in the UK market with the rivalry between Sky and BT pushing the Premier League\u2019s take up 70% at each of the previous two auctions. The total cost of the rights has rocketed from \u00a31.78bn for 2010-13 to \u00a35.13bn for 2018-19. The Premier League\u2019s attempts to draw deep-pocketed Silicon Valley giants into bidding, to continue to drive rights inflation in the face of a dearth of new competition from traditional TV broadcasters, has not been considered overly successful. The restructuring of the auction to include two live streaming packages, a first for the Premier League, failed to achieve the price it was seeking. In the end Amazon did pick up a package, as part of its wider experiment with exclusive live sport streaming in the UK, with BT eventually adding the other outstanding package to its portfolio. Another factor for candidates to consider is the complex politics of factions within the 20-club Premier League with the big six \u2013 Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham \u2013 pushing for a bigger share of the rights revenues in recognition of their pulling power. Richard Masters, the league\u2019s managing director, is acting as the interim chief executive. Scudamore stepped down in June, although he retains an advisory role, with a widely criticised \u00a35m golden leaving present over three years signed off by the clubs \u201cin recognition of the outstanding work he has carried out\u201d. Scudamore is estimated to have been paid more than \u00a326m since taking over the role in 1999.",

      "body": "<h2>34. Athena (1982)</h2> \n<p>Pinball Wizard-ish guitars decorated the first single from 1982\u2019s reviled <a href=\"http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-who-its-hard-turns-30/\">It\u2019s Hard</a>, but this is haunted by the sense that the Who were running out of steam. There is not much of a song behind them, and \u2013 with respect to <a href=\"http://underthebridge.co.uk/events/kenney-jones-the-jones-gang/\">Kenney Jones</a>, handed perhaps the least enviable gig in rock \u2013 an audible Keith Moon-shaped hole in the rhythm track.</p> \n<h2>33. The Last Time (1967)</h2> \n<p>More important as a gesture of solidarity than a piece of music, the Who\u2019s cover of the Rolling Stones\u2019 1965 hit is oddly muted and was evidently recorded in haste, to be released as a protest against the jail sentences given to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards for drugs charges.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvWwtfKiGUk\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LvWwtfKiGUk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>32. Don\u2019t Let Go the Coat (1981)</h2> \n<p>The vaguely country rock-influenced sound was oddly bloodless by the Who standards, but lyrically Don\u2019t Let Go the Coat unsparingly depicted guitarist Pete Townshend, utterly shattered by Moon\u2019s death despite breezy public pronouncements to the contrary, thrashing around in a desperate haze of drugs and booze, pleading with someone \u2013 spiritual leader <a href=\"https://www.meherbaba.co.uk/\">Meher Baba</a>? His bandmates? \u2013 not to forsake him.</p> \n<h2>31. It\u2019s Not Enough (2006)</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/oct/27/popandrock.who\">Endless Wire</a>, the Who\u2019s first album in 24 years, was a remarkably strong effort, but it was better taken as whole \u2013 replete with another Townshend mini-opera, Wire and Glass \u2013 rather than sampled via It\u2019s Not Enough, a decent enough song that made for an unspectacular single.</p> \n<h2>30. Let\u2019s See Action (1971)</h2> \n<p>The sentiment of Let\u2019s See Action \u2013 equal parts post-60s free-your-mind idealism and proto-punk get-off-your-arse agitating \u2013 is pretty inarguable, but there is something plodding and hoary about its brand of blues-rock boogie \u2013 with session man Nicky Hopkins\u2019s piano to the fore \u2013 that works against the lyrics and makes it sound less urgent, more complacent.</p> \n<h2>29. La-La-La-Lies (1966)</h2> \n<p>Yet another track awkwardly promoted to single status in an attempt to milk debut album My Generation for all it was worth, La-La-La-Lies made clear the influence of Moon favourites the Beach Boys on the Who. Released in the wake of Substitute and I\u2019m a Boy, however, it sounded pleasantly insignificant and failed to chart.</p> \n<h2>28. A Legal Matter (1966)</h2> \n<p>There was a certain irony about the title of A Legal Matter, an old album track unofficially released by producer Shel Talmy to sabotage the release of the band\u2019s chosen single Substitute. Its examination of why \u201cmarrying\u2019s no fun\u201d is more subtle than it first appears, but why it was chosen over its brilliant, previously unreleased B-side Instant Party is a mystery.</p> \n<h2>27. See Me, Feel Me (1970)</h2> \n<p>Tommy\u2019s episodic seven-minute grand finale We\u2019re Not Gonna Take It was fantastic, but not the ideal candidate for a single. The version released as such renamed it and lopped off the opening section, changing the track from a story of rejection into something more straightforwardly euphoric. It failed to chart.</p> \n<h2>26. Long Live Rock (1979)</h2> \n<p>Recorded in 1972, but not released as UK single until eight years later \u2013 prompted by its appearance in the Who documentary <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/TheWhotheKids_are_alrightfilm1979\">The Kids Are Alright</a> \u2013 Long Live Rock sounds like another of Townshend\u2019s attempts to come up with a latterday Who anthem, although its view of rock-star excess is more jaundiced and nuanced than the title suggests. Note the pampered artiste who finds \u201cthe distance to the stage too far\u201d.</p> \n<h2>25. Dogs (1968)</h2> \n<p>The power chords of You Really Got Me inspired the Who\u2019s early sound, and the influence of Ray Davies in English character-study mode is audible on this charming, beautifully written if inessential tale of love blossoming at a greyhound track. Its stagey Cockney vocals and blokey, anthemic chorus \u2013 \u201cThere was nothing in my life bigger than beer\u201d \u2013 seem to presage Britpop-era Blur.</p> \n<h2>24. Eminence Front (1982)</h2> \n<p>A song that realised Townshend\u2019s promise of a new-sounding post-Keith Moon Who. Taut, spacey and funky, Eminence Front gained an afterlife as a Balearic DJ favourite. A genuinely great song in its own right, its downfall was that it fulfilled Townshend\u2019s brief too thoroughly: to fans\u2019 horror, it didn\u2019t sound like the Who <em>at all</em>.</p> \n<h2>23. Squeeze Box (1976)</h2> \n<p>Both ridiculous and oddly charming, Squeeze Box\u2019s array of snickering double-entendres was a world away from the thoughtful complexity of Substitute or I\u2019m a Boy. In truth, Townshend was wracked by self-doubt, plagued by alcoholism and creatively running on empty, but the sheer exuberance with which the Who launch themselves at the song carried it through.</p> \n<h2>22. Be Lucky (2014)</h2> \n<p>Out of nowhere, Townshend and Roger Daltrey came back with a classic Who single, appended to a 50th-anniversary hits compilation. Thundering power chords, Daltrey\u2019s voice sounding stronger than a decade earlier, Townshend\u2019s lyrics casting an alternately optimistic and jaundiced eye over a modern pop landscape he had predicted decades before, complete with reference to Daft Punk and attendant burst of vocoder.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx-QkUhz5Oc\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xx-QkUhz5Oc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>21. The Seeker (1970)</h2> \n<p>No one\u2019s idea of a hippy, Townshend nevertheless went big on spiritual fulfilment, eventually finding it via self-styled avatar Meher Baba. This informed The Seeker, a single that unexpectedly framed his journey as a fraught, \u201cdesperate\u201d exercise, set to crunching hard rock and sung by Daltrey as if he was offering the listener out for a fight.</p> \n<h2>20. Ready Steady Who (1966)</h2> \n<p>Ostensibly a filler release comprised of offcuts, this five-track EP is worth it for the superb Circles; a cover of Barbara Ann that the band often resorted to in order to mollify Keith Moon\u2019s love of surf music; and their version of the Batman theme, conceived, one suspects, in the spirit of Warholian pop art.</p> \n<h2>19. Happy Jack (1966)</h2> \n<p>For all the Who\u2019s confrontational modernity, a strain of nostalgia ran through Townshend\u2019s writing, as on this evocation of a childhood beach holiday, although the mood of charming but lightweight wistfulness had a dark undertow. The titular hero \u2013 either a local eccentric or a donkey \u2013 is tormented by mean-spirited children, while Moon\u2019s drums sound apocalyptic throughout.</p> \n<h2>18. Real Good Looking Boy (2004)</h2> \n<p>Most people assumed John Entwistle\u2019s death marked the end of the Who: in fact, it spurred their recording career back to life. Suffused with nostalgia and beautifully elegiac, Real Good Looking Boy hymned the arrival of Elvis in characteristic Townshend style, with a hint of homoeroticism and a gush of adolescent confusion and self-doubt.</p> \n<h2>17. Who Are You (1978)</h2> \n<p>Already convinced he was too old to be a rock star at 30, punk seemed to provoke a full-on existential crisis in Townshend, as evidenced by Who Are You, inspired by a day spent drinking with Sex Pistols pair Steve Jones and Paul Cook. Its sound was closer to proggy stadium rock than punk, but there is a power about its desperate urgency, and bite in Daltrey\u2019s vocals.</p> \n<h2>16. You Better You Bet (1981)</h2> \n<p>After Moon\u2019s death in 1978, the Who talked expansively about continuing, exploring new musical territory. From its synth intro to its backing vocals, however, their first post-Moon single suggested business as usual. Still, there is little arguing with the song itself, a bouncy paean to blossoming love, tinged with lines hinting at darkness and grief: the narrator drinks himself blind \u201cto the sound of \u2026 Who\u2019s Next\u201d.</p> \n<h2>15. Summertime Blues (1970)</h2> \n<p>There is a persuasive argument that the Who\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thewho.com/music/live-at-leeds/\">Live at Leeds</a> is the greatest live album ever. Certainly, there was a rare, thuggish power about its rereading of Eddie Cochran\u2019s 1958 hit. Proof that, at the height of their rock-opera era, the Who\u2019s ability to deliver short, sharp bursts of raw power was undiminished.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afam2nIae4o\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/afam2nIae4o?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>14. The Kids Are Alright (1966)</h2> \n<p>Easily the best of the unofficial spoiler singles hastily released by Brunswick Records after the Who jumped ship, The Kids Are Alright is a fantastic song, a thoughtful, downcast, depiction of a young marriage in terminal crisis, its narrator torn and distraught, its melody beautiful.</p> \n<h2>13. Magic Bus (1968)</h2> \n<p>As close as the Who got to taking the wow-man hippy shilling \u2013 acoustic guitar, festival singalong vocals, frequent cries of \u201ctoo much!\u201d \u2013 Magic Bus was actually written in 1965. Three years later, it sounded oddly like a response to Tom Wolfe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/may/02/tom-wolfe-electric-kool-aid-acid-test\">The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test</a>, the saga of Ken Kesey\u2019s Merry Pranksters published a couple of months before the single\u2019s release.</p> \n<h2>12. Relay (1972)</h2> \n<p>Another cast-off from 1971\u2019s <a href=\"http://albumsthatneverwere.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-who-lifehouse-soniclovenoize.html\">Lifehouse</a>, the aborted rock opera follow-up to Tommy, Relay is among the best of the Who\u2019s 70s singles, its lyrics testament to the way Lifehouse predicted (albeit vaguely) the rise of the internet, its music powered by a desire to look forward. The riff was achieved by feeding Townshend\u2019s guitar through a synthesiser\u2019s voltage controlled filter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HDMCCLlGl4\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_HDMCCLlGl4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>11. Join Together (1972)</h2> \n<p>Throughout the early 70s, Townshend was clearly possessed by the desire to write a new calling-card for the Who. Strident, in possession of a hefty chorus and underpinned by a curious combination of jew\u2019s harp, harmonica and pulsing synthesised drone, Join Together might be the best of his efforts.</p> \n<h2>10. I Can\u2019t Explain (1965)</h2> \n<p>Confusion and inarticulacy has never sounded so anthemic as it did on the Who\u2019s debut single. The self-doubt of the lyrics \u2013 about someone unable to express themselves after taking too much dexedrine, although it might as well just be about the turmoil of adolescence \u2013 chafes against the music\u2019s confident, take-it-or-leave-it strut: the dichotomy of teenage life neatly summed up.</p> \n<h2>9. Pictures of Lily (1967)</h2> \n<p>Trust Pete Townshend to turn the psych era\u2019s interest in Edwardiana into a psychosexual drama about adolescent erotic turmoil. He also coined the term \u201cpowerpop\u201d to describe its sound, which fits perfectly. More controlled than earlier singles, it is still ferociously potent, replete with a French horn solo designed to sound like an air-raid siren.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYOxim6dUSU\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&amp;list=PLMS_zTiDnOGySSuqhk9OrXeVmWxQczTPa\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>8. Pinball Wizard (1969)</h2> \n<p>The calling-card of rock-opera Tommy was so musically irresistible that the ungainly weirdness of the lyrics \u2013 which even their author called \u201cclumsy\u201d \u2013 passed under the radar. It says plenty about both Townshend\u2019s pop smarts and the Who\u2019s performance that a song about envying a messianic deaf blind mute with an aptitude for pinball could become a perennial rock classic.</p> \n<h2>7. Anyway Anyhow Anywhere (1965)</h2> \n<p>Clumsily eager to capture the mod scene zeitgeist, the High Numbers\u2019 solitary single I\u2019m the Face/Zoot Suit made them sound like arrivistes. A year later, as the Who, they got it right: Anyway Anyhow Anywhere doesn\u2019t mention mods per se, but its peacocking, amphetamine arrogance nails their ethos. The chaotic, feedback-strafed breakdown, meanwhile, was unlike anything that had been heard in British pop.</p> \n<h2>6. 5:15 (1974)</h2> \n<p>Quadrophenia saw the Who re-examining their mod roots, and its lead-off single marked a return to the topics that had fuelled Townshend\u2019s 60s writing \u2013 confused sexuality, identity, how drugs both calmed and exacerbated the angst of adolescence \u2013 albeit at a slightly more sedate pace. Still, this song\u2019s brass-bedecked arrangement was impressively forceful and punchy.</p> \n<h2>5. I\u2019m a Boy (1966)</h2> \n<p>If you want proof of how ahead of the game the early Who were, it is worth noting that they took a song about the topic of gender dysphoria to No 2, a full 53 years ago. The thrillingly propulsive burst of drumming as Daltrey takes over the vocal, 22 seconds in, is a neat reminder of Moon\u2019s extraordinary intuitive creativity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdCySh8lW2E\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DdCySh8lW2E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>4. I Can See for Miles (1967)</h2> \n<p>The Who were not a comfortable fit among the psychedelic set, too aggressive, troubled and cynical for flower power\u2019s beatific platitudes. Accordingly, their psych masterpiece is four cacophonous minutes of pent-up fury and bitterness that mixes the knowing superiority of the acid initiate with sexual jealousy. Among the revelations LSD affords its narrator is the knowledge he\u2019s been cheated on.</p> \n<h2>3. My Generation (1965)</h2> \n<p>The Who\u2019s manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/21/who-kit-lambert-chris-stamp-roger-daltrey-film\">Kit Lambert</a> lauded them as \u201ca new form of crime, aimed against the bourgeoisie\u201d, typical hyperbole allowed to pass as fact in the wake of My Generation. Now blunted by familiarity, the lyrics must have seemed impossibly confrontational 54 years ago. The music turned familiar pop tropes \u2013 R&amp;B riff, Motown handclaps, Beach Boys harmonies \u2013 into something that sounded like a bombardment.</p> \n<h2>2. Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again (1971)</h2> \n<p>The embittered cynicism of the dawning 70s suited the Who more than the late 60s\u2019 pie-eyed optimism. Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again was a tense, muscular howl of disenchantment at the prevailing order and counterculture alike. It was also remarkably forward-thinking, its synthesizer integral, rather than mere embellishment. The band played along to sequenced loop. Decades later, all records would be made this way.</p> \n<h2>1. Substitute (1966)</h2> \n<p>The Who hit the ground running at such an astonishing pace, it is almost impossible to pick one of their mid-60s run of singles over the rest. Even with their spoilsport first label releasing vast chunks of their debut album on 45 following the band\u2019s defection to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/05/robert-stigwood\">Robert Stigwood</a>\u2019s Reaction Records, virtually every seven-inch with their name on it from the era is superb. But Substitute just edges it: a complex, frustrated exploration of modern identity into which Townshend boldly stirred class, race, sexuality and even a bit of Freudian psychology. The band, meanwhile, sound incredible: a breezy acoustic guitar riff sandwiched between Daltrey\u2019s screw-you vocal and a rhythm section that feels as if it is raining blows on the listener.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "34. Athena (1982) Pinball Wizard-ish guitars decorated the first single from 1982\u2019s reviled It\u2019s Hard, but this is haunted by the sense that the Who were running out of steam. There is not much of a song behind them, and \u2013 with respect to Kenney Jones, handed perhaps the least enviable gig in rock \u2013 an audible Keith Moon-shaped hole in the rhythm track. 33. The Last Time (1967) More important as a gesture of solidarity than a piece of music, the Who\u2019s cover of the Rolling Stones\u2019 1965 hit is oddly muted and was evidently recorded in haste, to be released as a protest against the jail sentences given to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards for drugs charges. 32. Don\u2019t Let Go the Coat (1981) The vaguely country rock-influenced sound was oddly bloodless by the Who standards, but lyrically Don\u2019t Let Go the Coat unsparingly depicted guitarist Pete Townshend, utterly shattered by Moon\u2019s death despite breezy public pronouncements to the contrary, thrashing around in a desperate haze of drugs and booze, pleading with someone \u2013 spiritual leader Meher Baba? His bandmates? \u2013 not to forsake him. 31. It\u2019s Not Enough (2006) Endless Wire, the Who\u2019s first album in 24 years, was a remarkably strong effort, but it was better taken as whole \u2013 replete with another Townshend mini-opera, Wire and Glass \u2013 rather than sampled via It\u2019s Not Enough, a decent enough song that made for an unspectacular single. 30. Let\u2019s See Action (1971) The sentiment of Let\u2019s See Action \u2013 equal parts post-60s free-your-mind idealism and proto-punk get-off-your-arse agitating \u2013 is pretty inarguable, but there is something plodding and hoary about its brand of blues-rock boogie \u2013 with session man Nicky Hopkins\u2019s piano to the fore \u2013 that works against the lyrics and makes it sound less urgent, more complacent. 29. La-La-La-Lies (1966) Yet another track awkwardly promoted to single status in an attempt to milk debut album My Generation for all it was worth, La-La-La-Lies made clear the influence of Moon favourites the Beach Boys on the Who. Released in the wake of Substitute and I\u2019m a Boy, however, it sounded pleasantly insignificant and failed to chart. 28. A Legal Matter (1966) There was a certain irony about the title of A Legal Matter, an old album track unofficially released by producer Shel Talmy to sabotage the release of the band\u2019s chosen single Substitute. Its examination of why \u201cmarrying\u2019s no fun\u201d is more subtle than it first appears, but why it was chosen over its brilliant, previously unreleased B-side Instant Party is a mystery. 27. See Me, Feel Me (1970) Tommy\u2019s episodic seven-minute grand finale We\u2019re Not Gonna Take It was fantastic, but not the ideal candidate for a single. The version released as such renamed it and lopped off the opening section, changing the track from a story of rejection into something more straightforwardly euphoric. It failed to chart. 26. Long Live Rock (1979) Recorded in 1972, but not released as UK single until eight years later \u2013 prompted by its appearance in the Who documentary The Kids Are Alright \u2013 Long Live Rock sounds like another of Townshend\u2019s attempts to come up with a latterday Who anthem, although its view of rock-star excess is more jaundiced and nuanced than the title suggests. Note the pampered artiste who finds \u201cthe distance to the stage too far\u201d. 25. Dogs (1968) The power chords of You Really Got Me inspired the Who\u2019s early sound, and the influence of Ray Davies in English character-study mode is audible on this charming, beautifully written if inessential tale of love blossoming at a greyhound track. Its stagey Cockney vocals and blokey, anthemic chorus \u2013 \u201cThere was nothing in my life bigger than beer\u201d \u2013 seem to presage Britpop-era Blur. 24. Eminence Front (1982) A song that realised Townshend\u2019s promise of a new-sounding post-Keith Moon Who. Taut, spacey and funky, Eminence Front gained an afterlife as a Balearic DJ favourite. A genuinely great song in its own right, its downfall was that it fulfilled Townshend\u2019s brief too thoroughly: to fans\u2019 horror, it didn\u2019t sound like the Who at all. 23. Squeeze Box (1976) Both ridiculous and oddly charming, Squeeze Box\u2019s array of snickering double-entendres was a world away from the thoughtful complexity of Substitute or I\u2019m a Boy. In truth, Townshend was wracked by self-doubt, plagued by alcoholism and creatively running on empty, but the sheer exuberance with which the Who launch themselves at the song carried it through. 22. Be Lucky (2014) Out of nowhere, Townshend and Roger Daltrey came back with a classic Who single, appended to a 50th-anniversary hits compilation. Thundering power chords, Daltrey\u2019s voice sounding stronger than a decade earlier, Townshend\u2019s lyrics casting an alternately optimistic and jaundiced eye over a modern pop landscape he had predicted decades before, complete with reference to Daft Punk and attendant burst of vocoder. 21. The Seeker (1970) No one\u2019s idea of a hippy, Townshend nevertheless went big on spiritual fulfilment, eventually finding it via self-styled avatar Meher Baba. This informed The Seeker, a single that unexpectedly framed his journey as a fraught, \u201cdesperate\u201d exercise, set to crunching hard rock and sung by Daltrey as if he was offering the listener out for a fight. 20. Ready Steady Who (1966) Ostensibly a filler release comprised of offcuts, this five-track EP is worth it for the superb Circles; a cover of Barbara Ann that the band often resorted to in order to mollify Keith Moon\u2019s love of surf music; and their version of the Batman theme, conceived, one suspects, in the spirit of Warholian pop art. 19. Happy Jack (1966) For all the Who\u2019s confrontational modernity, a strain of nostalgia ran through Townshend\u2019s writing, as on this evocation of a childhood beach holiday, although the mood of charming but lightweight wistfulness had a dark undertow. The titular hero \u2013 either a local eccentric or a donkey \u2013 is tormented by mean-spirited children, while Moon\u2019s drums sound apocalyptic throughout. 18. Real Good Looking Boy (2004) Most people assumed John Entwistle\u2019s death marked the end of the Who: in fact, it spurred their recording career back to life. Suffused with nostalgia and beautifully elegiac, Real Good Looking Boy hymned the arrival of Elvis in characteristic Townshend style, with a hint of homoeroticism and a gush of adolescent confusion and self-doubt. 17. Who Are You (1978) Already convinced he was too old to be a rock star at 30, punk seemed to provoke a full-on existential crisis in Townshend, as evidenced by Who Are You, inspired by a day spent drinking with Sex Pistols pair Steve Jones and Paul Cook. Its sound was closer to proggy stadium rock than punk, but there is a power about its desperate urgency, and bite in Daltrey\u2019s vocals. 16. You Better You Bet (1981) After Moon\u2019s death in 1978, the Who talked expansively about continuing, exploring new musical territory. From its synth intro to its backing vocals, however, their first post-Moon single suggested business as usual. Still, there is little arguing with the song itself, a bouncy paean to blossoming love, tinged with lines hinting at darkness and grief: the narrator drinks himself blind \u201cto the sound of \u2026 Who\u2019s Next\u201d. 15. Summertime Blues (1970) There is a persuasive argument that the Who\u2019s Live at Leeds is the greatest live album ever. Certainly, there was a rare, thuggish power about its rereading of Eddie Cochran\u2019s 1958 hit. Proof that, at the height of their rock-opera era, the Who\u2019s ability to deliver short, sharp bursts of raw power was undiminished. 14. The Kids Are Alright (1966) Easily the best of the unofficial spoiler singles hastily released by Brunswick Records after the Who jumped ship, The Kids Are Alright is a fantastic song, a thoughtful, downcast, depiction of a young marriage in terminal crisis, its narrator torn and distraught, its melody beautiful. 13. Magic Bus (1968) As close as the Who got to taking the wow-man hippy shilling \u2013 acoustic guitar, festival singalong vocals, frequent cries of \u201ctoo much!\u201d \u2013 Magic Bus was actually written in 1965. Three years later, it sounded oddly like a response to Tom Wolfe\u2019s The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, the saga of Ken Kesey\u2019s Merry Pranksters published a couple of months before the single\u2019s release. 12. Relay (1972) Another cast-off from 1971\u2019s Lifehouse, the aborted rock opera follow-up to Tommy, Relay is among the best of the Who\u2019s 70s singles, its lyrics testament to the way Lifehouse predicted (albeit vaguely) the rise of the internet, its music powered by a desire to look forward. The riff was achieved by feeding Townshend\u2019s guitar through a synthesiser\u2019s voltage controlled filter. 11. Join Together (1972) Throughout the early 70s, Townshend was clearly possessed by the desire to write a new calling-card for the Who. Strident, in possession of a hefty chorus and underpinned by a curious combination of jew\u2019s harp, harmonica and pulsing synthesised drone, Join Together might be the best of his efforts. 10. I Can\u2019t Explain (1965) Confusion and inarticulacy has never sounded so anthemic as it did on the Who\u2019s debut single. The self-doubt of the lyrics \u2013 about someone unable to express themselves after taking too much dexedrine, although it might as well just be about the turmoil of adolescence \u2013 chafes against the music\u2019s confident, take-it-or-leave-it strut: the dichotomy of teenage life neatly summed up. 9. Pictures of Lily (1967) Trust Pete Townshend to turn the psych era\u2019s interest in Edwardiana into a psychosexual drama about adolescent erotic turmoil. He also coined the term \u201cpowerpop\u201d to describe its sound, which fits perfectly. More controlled than earlier singles, it is still ferociously potent, replete with a French horn solo designed to sound like an air-raid siren. 8. Pinball Wizard (1969) The calling-card of rock-opera Tommy was so musically irresistible that the ungainly weirdness of the lyrics \u2013 which even their author called \u201cclumsy\u201d \u2013 passed under the radar. It says plenty about both Townshend\u2019s pop smarts and the Who\u2019s performance that a song about envying a messianic deaf blind mute with an aptitude for pinball could become a perennial rock classic. 7. Anyway Anyhow Anywhere (1965) Clumsily eager to capture the mod scene zeitgeist, the High Numbers\u2019 solitary single I\u2019m the Face/Zoot Suit made them sound like arrivistes. A year later, as the Who, they got it right: Anyway Anyhow Anywhere doesn\u2019t mention mods per se, but its peacocking, amphetamine arrogance nails their ethos. The chaotic, feedback-strafed breakdown, meanwhile, was unlike anything that had been heard in British pop. 6. 5:15 (1974) Quadrophenia saw the Who re-examining their mod roots, and its lead-off single marked a return to the topics that had fuelled Townshend\u2019s 60s writing \u2013 confused sexuality, identity, how drugs both calmed and exacerbated the angst of adolescence \u2013 albeit at a slightly more sedate pace. Still, this song\u2019s brass-bedecked arrangement was impressively forceful and punchy. 5. I\u2019m a Boy (1966) If you want proof of how ahead of the game the early Who were, it is worth noting that they took a song about the topic of gender dysphoria to No 2, a full 53 years ago. The thrillingly propulsive burst of drumming as Daltrey takes over the vocal, 22 seconds in, is a neat reminder of Moon\u2019s extraordinary intuitive creativity. 4. I Can See for Miles (1967) The Who were not a comfortable fit among the psychedelic set, too aggressive, troubled and cynical for flower power\u2019s beatific platitudes. Accordingly, their psych masterpiece is four cacophonous minutes of pent-up fury and bitterness that mixes the knowing superiority of the acid initiate with sexual jealousy. Among the revelations LSD affords its narrator is the knowledge he\u2019s been cheated on. 3. My Generation (1965) The Who\u2019s manager Kit Lambert lauded them as \u201ca new form of crime, aimed against the bourgeoisie\u201d, typical hyperbole allowed to pass as fact in the wake of My Generation. Now blunted by familiarity, the lyrics must have seemed impossibly confrontational 54 years ago. The music turned familiar pop tropes \u2013 R&amp;B riff, Motown handclaps, Beach Boys harmonies \u2013 into something that sounded like a bombardment. 2. Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again (1971) The embittered cynicism of the dawning 70s suited the Who more than the late 60s\u2019 pie-eyed optimism. Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again was a tense, muscular howl of disenchantment at the prevailing order and counterculture alike. It was also remarkably forward-thinking, its synthesizer integral, rather than mere embellishment. The band played along to sequenced loop. Decades later, all records would be made this way. 1. Substitute (1966) The Who hit the ground running at such an astonishing pace, it is almost impossible to pick one of their mid-60s run of singles over the rest. Even with their spoilsport first label releasing vast chunks of their debut album on 45 following the band\u2019s defection to Robert Stigwood\u2019s Reaction Records, virtually every seven-inch with their name on it from the era is superb. But Substitute just edges it: a complex, frustrated exploration of modern identity into which Townshend boldly stirred class, race, sexuality and even a bit of Freudian psychology. The band, meanwhile, sound incredible: a breezy acoustic guitar riff sandwiched between Daltrey\u2019s screw-you vocal and a rhythm section that feels as if it is raining blows on the listener. \u25cf This article was corrected on 17 January.

She returns deep to take control of the rally and breaks Konta\u2019s defences down with a storming backhand into the corner, bringing an excellent match to a close.

Only the US and Aussie Opens do this, and it\u2019s obviously just about making more ticket money.

      "bodyText": "Day four is finally over. We\u2019ve had plenty of drama, with Simona Halep surviving a scare against Sofia Kenin, Alexander Zverev taking five sets to beat Jeremy Chardy, Aussie youngster Alexei Popyrin beating Dominic Thiem and Garbine Muguruza beating Johanna Konta in an absurd night finish. It was the latest a match has ever started at this tournament and it ended with Britain losing their last representative in the singles. Oh well. Anyway that\u2019s all from me. We\u2019ll be back with more live coverage tomorrow. Like Muguruza, though, I\u2019m off for a long lie down. Bye! Garbine Muguruza can\u2019t believe people were still watching them at 3.15am local time. \u201cWho cares?\u201d she says with a big grin on her face. \u201cWe play for you guys. Otherwise why were we here? For what? I will go for breakfast now. No, I will be concentrated. The tournament is not over.\u201d Johanna Konta wears a disappointed expression as she leaves the court. She was the last Brit standing. Konta is serving with new balls as she looks to stay in the tournament. The first two points are shared. Muguruza goes big and moves to 15-30, taking her two points from victory. Konta responds by stooping to scoop a stunning low forehand winner away for 30-all. Muguruza, however, attacks a second return with a fizzing return to earn a match point. She returns deep to take control of the rally and breaks Konta\u2019s defences down with a storming backhand into the corner, bringing an excellent match to a close. That\u2019s it: the British No1 is out of the Australian Open in the second round. Third set: Konta 4-6, 7-6, 5-6 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Muguruza holds to 15. Konta will serve to force a deciding tie-break. Third set: Konta* 4-6, 7-6, 5-5 Muguruza (*denotes server): There\u2019s barely anyone in the stands now, which is such a shame. It is very late in Melbourne, though, and these two are still slugging it out with ferocious intensity. At 15-0, Konta challenges an errant out call. Once again it\u2019s in. The point\u2019s replayed. Konta wins it with a pinpoint forehand for 30-0. Soon it\u2019s 40-0. She holds again. We move closer to a tie-break. Third set: Konta 4-6, 7-6, 4-5 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Muguruza remains rock solid on serve. She\u2019s a game from the third round. And bed. Third set: Konta* 4-6, 7-6, 4-4 Muguruza (*denotes server): Konta moves to 40-0. Back comes Muguruza, a couple of winners making it 40-30. Yet Konta holds when the Spaniard nets a backhand. Third set: Konta 4-6, 7-6, 3-4 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Muguruza rams a forehand away for 40-30. Konta was nowhere near it. This really is a quality match. Muguruza holds here, relief rising as Konta sends a return long. Third set: Konta* 4-6, 7-6, 3-3 Muguruza (*denotes server): Muguruza\u2019s in charge of a Konta service game for the first time in a while, a backhand pass taking her to 15-30. Konta has to be strong - and she is, dealing with some powerful groundstrokes and a difficult slice before putting a smash away for 30-all. She moves to 40-30 and holds with a backhand down the line. Third set: Konta 4-6, 7-6, 2-3 Muguruza* (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all. Muguruza bangs an ace down the middle for 40-30. Konta sends a backhand return wide and Muguruza holds. Third set: Konta* 4-6, 7-6, 2-2 Muguruza (*denotes server): Konta knocks a forehand down the line to hold to love. She\u2019s looking very cool. Third set: Konta 4-6, 7-6, 1-2 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Muguruza skips into a 40-0 lead, volleying well. That should be that. But Konta somehow reels her in, three straight points dragging it to deuce. She can\u2019t carve out any break points, though, and Muguruza holds again. \u201cThis is a terrific match, but why oh why do the organisers insist on starting matches so late?\u201d Tony Wawryk says. \u201cSince tennis is not a time-limited sport - one of it\u2019s strengths - it happens too often, and is caused primarily by having two sessions of play per day. Only the US and Aussie Opens do this, and it\u2019s obviously just about making more ticket money. It\u2019s ridiculous to expect world-class sportspeople to perform - with so much at stake - at stupid o\u2019clock in front of almost no spectators. And the likelihood is that whoever wins this match will lose their next one as they simply won\u2019t have enough recovery time. Bonkers.\u201d Third set: Konta* 4-6, 7-6, 1-1 Muguruza (*denotes server): Konta begins the game with an ace. Another crisp forehand makes it 30-0. It\u2019s a routine hold. Third set: Konta 4-6, 7-6, 0-1 Muguruza* (*denotes server): It\u2019s roughly 2.25am in Melbourne when this set begins. You\u2019d imagine it isn\u2019t finishing before 3am. There\u2019s no hint of a break here, Mugurza holding to 15 with an ace. Second set tie-break: Konta 7-3 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Konta hits a deep forehand off a second serve. Muguruza nets a forehand, just as Konta\u2019s shot\u2019s called out. Konta challenges and finds her forehand clipped the baseline. Which means the second set belongs to her! The British No1 has taken this to a decider! Second set tie-break: Konta* 6-3 Muguruza (*denotes server): Konta pings an ace down the middle to earn three set points. Second set tie-break: Konta* 5-3 Muguruza (*denotes server): Muguruza nets a forehand. Konta holds on to the mini-break. Second set tie-break: Konta 4-3 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Muguruza stays in touch with an ace. Second set tie-break: Konta 4-2 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Konta absorbs some frightening shots before arrowing a brilliant backhand from left to right beyond Muguruza\u2019s reach. Second set tie-break: Konta* 3-2 Muguruza (*denotes server): Muguruza sends a forehand return long. Second set tie-break: Konta* 2-2 Muguruza (*denotes server): Konta swipes a volley away after excellent hitting from the baseline. Second set tie-break: Konta 1-2 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Once we resume, Muguruza stays firm. Second set tie-break: Konta 1-1 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Konta nets a backhand return. Now we\u2019ll have a brief pause. You\u2019ll never believe it: it\u2019s raining in Melbourne, so they\u2019re closing the roof. Won\u2019t take long. Second set tie-break: Konta* 1-0 Muguruza (*denotes server): A lengthy baseline rally ends with Muguruza hitting a backhand wide. Second set: Konta 4-6, 6-6 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Muguruza holds to 15. Tie-break. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 6-5 Muguruza (*denotes server): Konta serves well to establish a 30-0 lead. A blistering forehand makes it 40-0. She holds to love, thrusting the focus back on to Muguruza. Second set: Konta 4-6, 5-5 Muguruza* (*denotes server): It\u2019s a shame this has started so late. Rod Laver Arena\u2019s pretty empty at this late hour and a lot of fans are missing some top tennis. Serving to stay in the set, Muguruza makes it 40-30 with a huge backhand down the line. She holds. Just. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 5-4 Muguruza (*denotes server): At 15-all, Konta sends a forehand long at the end of a tense rally. Muguruza spies an opportunity, a skidding forehand into the left corner drawing a backhand error from Konta, who suddenly finds herself 15-40 down. Konta serves wide and hopes it\u2019s an ace. Out! She asks Hawkeye. Still out. Second serve. Konta does well to push Muguruza into a backhand error for 30-40. Then, somehow, she stands up to a vicious Muguruza forehand and makes it deuce with a backhand pass. Great shot, though Muguruza should have killed the rally. Konta clings on against all the odds. That was clutch. Second set: Konta 4-6, 4-4 Muguruza* (*denotes server): A strange moment at 40-15. With Johanna Konta not ready to receive, an unwitting Garbine Muguruza looks down and slams a serve in her direction, much to everyone\u2019s surprise. Muguruza was in a world of her own there. Konta looks a little annoyed and surprised as she has a quick word with the umpire. She\u2019s feeling better when she wins the next two points to force deuce. Less so when she lets Muguruza hold. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 4-3 Muguruza (*denotes server): The first two points are shared. Soon it\u2019s 30-all, nobody giving an inch. It\u2019s good tennis, not least because it\u2019s the middle of the night in Melbourne. Konta does enough. She holds in efficient fashion. Second set: Konta 4-6, 3-3 Muguruza* (*denotes server): This is very impressive serving from Muguruza, who stomps into a 40-0 lead in no time. A love hold quickly turns the spotlight back on to Konta. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 3-2 Muguruza (*denotes server): Konta looks in control at 30-all. Back comes Muguruza, forcing 30-all. Konta\u2019s relieved to see Muguruza knock a return long for 40-30. Konta holds once again. Second set: Konta 4-6, 2-2 Muguruza* (*denotes server): The game goes to deuce, offering Konta further encouragement. There\u2019s plenty of pop and fizz to her groundstrokes right now and it\u2019s starting to rush Muguruza, who goes for too much with a forehand, pushing it long to give Konta a break point. Muguruza challenges to no avail. Then she gives Konta a second serve to examine. They rally briefly, but Konta screws a forehand just wide. Muguruza produces a spectacular backhand lob to hold, similar to the one that won her the French Open in 2016. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 2-1 Muguruza (*denotes server): It\u2019s only been that break for Muguruza in the very first game of the match. Konta definitely has a chance here, though it may well depend on Muguruza dropping her guard during this set. Second set: Konta 4-6, 1-1 Muguruza* (*denotes server): There are signs Konta\u2019s warming up, trading blows with Muguruza and drilling a backhand down the line for deuce. Muguruza holds, though, knuckling down on serve. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 1-0 Muguruza (*denotes server): It must be said that Konta didn\u2019t do much wrong in the first set, but she\u2019s going to need to lift her game here, because Muguruza is in the zone. She makes a good start, holding to love. Konta looks to keep the momentum going, ramming a backhand away for 0-15. Muguruza looks annoyed. She\u2019s a little ragged now, a forehand going long to make it 15-30. Yet her previous high level returns and soon she has a set point. A thumping serve forces Konta to knock a backhand return long, handing Muguruza a deserved lead. First set: Konta* 4-5 Muguruza (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Konta\u2019s under pressure after netting a backhand to make it 30-all. It\u2019s important Konta wins the next rally and she does so by forcing Muguruza wide and pushing a forehand into the open court for 40-30. But the game goes to deuce when Muguruza wrongfoots Konta with a forehand winner \u2013 and Muguruza earns set point when Konta hits an erratic backhand long. Konta saves it. She holds with a forehand that clips the line. Over to you, Garbine. First set: Konta 3-5 Muguruza* (*denotes server): As hard as Konta tries to stay with Muguruza, it\u2019s mostly proving a futile task. At 30-15 the aggression\u2019s too much from Muguruza, leaving Konta stranded as a backhand volley sails into the open court. Muguruza closes out the game easily, holding to 15. First set: Konta* 3-4 Muguruza (*denotes server): Konta sticks a fine backhand down the line to make it 40-30. Yet the game goes to deuce when Muguruza picks Konta off at the net with a backhand pass. Is Muguruza about to break? No, as it transpires. Konta keeps hitting it hard enough to keep the Spaniard at bay. First set: Konta 2-4 Muguruza* (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all, Konta forcing Muguruza to net a defensive backhand. Then an error hands Konta a break point. Muguruza cancels it out with some serve-volley. \u201cCome on!\u201d she cries. She\u2019s very fired up. She holds. An opening disappears for Konta, but she\u2019ll be feeling more encouraged now. First set: Konta* 2-3 Muguruza (*denotes server): Konta slams down an ace to make it 30-0. She holds to love, hitting the ball crisply. Her level isn\u2019t bad at all here. The problem is how well Muguruza\u2019s playing. First set: Konta 1-3 Muguruza* (*denotes server): Muguruza continues to dominate, holding to love. The world No1 cruises into the third round, where he\u2019ll face Canada\u2019s Denis Shapovalov. That should be entertaining. First set: Konta* 1-2 Muguruza (*denotes server): Looking to assert herself, Konta races through three quick points, a venomous forehand making it 40-0. Muguruza responds with a forehand winner for 40-15. 40-0 turns into deuce. Konta is having to absorb a lot here. Muguruza\u2019s emerged with all guns blazing - but Konta manages to get herself on the board with a couple of clinical shots. First set: Konta 0-2 Muguruza* (*denotes server): This is a terrifying level from Muguruza, who consolidates the break with a rollocking hold to love. She\u2019s absolutely battering the ball early on. It\u2019s too much for Konta at the moment. First set: Konta* 0-1 Muguruza (*denotes server): Jo Konta won the toss and elected to serve first. Eager beaver. She\u2019s off to a fast start, too, ripping a forehand volley away to make it 15-0. Muguruza responds in kind, though, and earns two break points with a huge forehand return. Konta\u2019s knocked off her stride and drops her serve when she sends a backhand long. Some start from Muguruza. On Eurosport Annabel Croft isn\u2019t impressed with how late this is starting. It\u2019s gone midnight in Melbourne. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019ve had a good cup of coffee. That\u2019s how athletes prepare, isn\u2019t it? Presumably they\u2019ve both downed a couple of cans of Relentless too (other energy drinks are available). I\u2019m not sure Garbine Muguruza will be delighted about facing Johanna Konta in the second round. Konta\u2019s a former top 10 player and has been a semi-finalist here; her ranking\u2019s dropped in the last year but her form\u2019s been encouraging in recent weeks. However the British No1 will have to be very focused to beat Muguruza - the Spaniard, seeded 18th here, is a two-time grand slam champion. Konta and Muguruza are on court and are warming up. To take you through to the bitter end is Jacob Steinberg. Zverev speaks on beating Chardy and taking on Australia\u2019s Alex Bolt in the third round. He said: \u201cWhat an amazing match. Jeremy fought so hard, he\u2019s an unbelievable player, he has caused so much damage to all the top players and he showed today what a top player and top person he is, I wish him all the best. He\u2019s someone I\u2019m very close to on the Tour. It was always going to be an entertaining match and hopefully I\u2019ll see him on court again very soon.\u201d World No 155 Bolt has never reached this stage in his home Grand Slam and took a nine-month hiatus from the sport in 2016. He beat Gilles Simon 2-6, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6, 6-4 in his second round match. Zverev added: \u201cNice. They were playing the fifth set when I walked on court, he came back from 2-1 down. He\u2019ll be the home crowd favourite, I wont be mad at you guys (gestures to crowd), I understand. I don\u2019t want to say I wish him nothing but the best, because I want to win, but hopefully it\u2019ll be a fun match.\u201d Three aces and a fourth serve that Chardy could only stretch to paddle long over the German\u2019s shoulder. Zverev dug deep and got the job done but really didn\u2019t need for this to go on so long. A battling display but he really shouldn\u2019t be playing five-setters at this stage in the competition when two sets up. The PA declares Konta v Muguruza will start, \u201cvery, very soon\u201d. Chardy has seen that bagel staring him in the face and doesn\u2019t fancy it, breezing through a service game to allow Zverev to serve for the match. On Rod Laver, Djokovic has sealed that second set against Tsonga 7-5 and is 2-0 up. The Serb could finish his match off before Konta and Muguruza have even completed their first set. Chardy was a little livelier in that game, in what was a little weird and perhaps symbolic of Zverev\u2019s mercurial/frustrating nature. Chardy opened up a 0-30 and 15-40 lead but his first break point attempt was a wayward baseline backhand and he then spurned the second as Zverev clubbed a low top-spinning forehand which the Frenchman struggled to get his feet in position for. After five lots of deuce, and three Zverev double faults, the German then whipped a couple of groundstrokes past his opponent and it\u2019s 5-0 in what has been a limp end to an epic contest. There was some talk that Konta v Muguruza was going to be moved to Court No3 but the court isn\u2019t in a sufficient state for a match (jokes among the Eurosport commentary team that the cleaners have gone home) so it will be on Margaret Court after Zverev-Chardy. We wait. Zverev now 4-0 and should polish this off in the next 10 minutes. Chardy has lost all sense of aggression and zip to his game. The end is nigh. Just returning to Konta v Muguruza. The last time they played each other in a Grand Slam was at the US Open in 2015 and the match lasted three hours and 23 minutes. Over on Rod Laver, at the fourth time of asking Djokovic has broken Tsonga for 6-5 and is serving for the second set. Zverev is pushing the accelerator down, serving to love to move 3-0 ahead. Chardy looks a little fatigued, his backhand uncharacteristically loose. And the game is summed up as he send a lazy forehand long on Zverev\u2019s second serve. Good evening/afternoon all. As Zverev breaks to move 2-0 up in the fifth, Johanna Konta and 18th seed Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza are waiting patiently in the locker room for their second-round match on Margaret Court Arena. Or maybe not *too* patiently as their encounter is will be the latest start in Australian Open history, beating the 11.59pm mark set by Daria Gavrilova and Elise Mertens last year. I\u2019m off to grab some lunch before Konta v Muguruza. James Piercy will take you to the end of this five-set epic. A big serve from Jeremy Chardy brings up his fourth set point. Zverev serves, Chardy\u2019s backhand return is good and he\u2019s delighted to see the German send a backhand long! This one\u2019s going the distance. Chardy, who was two sets down, has forced a decider after taking this tense tie-break. Up 5-3 in the tie-break, Jeremy Chardy turns reckless on serve. Zverev\u2019s able to fight to 5-5. It\u2019s been that sort of match. With one more serve at his disposal, a boulder from Zverev forces Chardy to net a return. Match point Zverev, his first of the evening. Yet Chardy, who\u2019s back on serve, stays strong and does enough to force Zverev to hit a forehand long. 6-6. Over on Rod Laver Arena, it\u2019s tight in the second between Djokovic and Tsonga, who\u2019s had a few chances to break the world No1. They\u2019re level at 3-3 as Tsonga tries to get over the disappointment of losing the first set. Now\u2019s the time for Chardy to turn up the temperature - and soon he has two set points, two points to force an unlikely fifth set. Zverev, so talented, knows he has to produce his best now. And he does, making it 30-40 with a beautiful winner, then smashing for deuce. Crisis averted, right? Think again. Chardy attacks with a forehand and earns a third chance. But with Zverev doing little more than keep the ball in play, Chardy nets a backhand. Zverev holds from there and forces a tie-break. Chardy holds to 15 to lead 6-5 in this error-strewn fourth set. Zverev will have to hold again. Serving immaculately, Zverev holds for 5-5 in the fourth set. It feels like a tie-break to me. Serving at 4-4, Jeremy Chardy smacks a forehand down the line for 30-all. An ace makes it 40-30. It\u2019s Chardy\u2019s 14th so far. Naturally, though, the game goes to deuce. A look for Zverev - but Chardy holds on to lead 5-4. Zverev will serve to avoid a fifth set. Jeremy Chardy holds! He\u2019s 4-3 up in the fourth set. Zverev\u2019s frustration grows. Konta and Muguruza are never getting on court. This one\u2019s more straightforward. Jeremy Chardy does Alexander Zverev a favour, dumping a volley into the net to give the German two break points. This is an absurd match, though. Zverev fluffs the first break point, knocking a dismal forehand long, then Chardy rips a winner away for deuce. Another rushed error from Chardy gives Zverev another opening. Another opening that\u2019s scrubbed out, this time with a big serve. The irascible Zverev is so frustrated. Ivan Lendl, his coach, must be getting flashbacks of his time with Andy Murray. On they go. Meanwhile... Having got himself back into the set, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga throws away his serve again. A long forehand sees Djokovic break for 4-2. You fear Tsonga just isn\u2019t going to be consistent enough here. Less predictable now on Rod Laver Arena. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga breaks straight back when a Djokovic backhand drops wide in the fifth game of the first set. All very predictable so far on Rod Laver Arena. Novak Djokovic\u2019s already a break up against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. A horrible game from an agitated Alexander Zverev lets Jeremy Chardy back into the contest! Serving to stay in the third set, a few horrible misses from Zverev sees him fall to 15-40. Chardy can\u2019t take the first set point, but he only has to wait for Zverev to smack another backhand wide to take the third set 7-5! Zverev leads 7-6, 6-4, 5-7 \u2013 but he needs to regain his composure quickly. Novak Djokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga have arrived on Rod Laver Arena. Tsonga barely played because of injuries last year and is past his entertaining peak at the age of 33. The French wild card\u2019s extravagant game could cause a few problems for the world No1, but it\u2019s difficult to see him being strong enough to push Djokovic far. Alexander Zverev was in a bit of trouble in the third set on Margaret Court Arena, but he\u2019s just broken back against Jeremy Chardy. Johanna Konta and Garbine Muguruza will be hoping Zverev can get this done now. Next on Rod Laver Arena: Novak Djokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Serena Williams speaks! \u201cit wasn\u2019t an easy match tonight. Genie has been to the finals of Wimbledon and the semis of other slams. I haven\u2019t had many matches since last year but it\u2019s ok, I got some time to spend with my daughter. It was great. I literally spent every day with her. I\u2019ve always been told they grow up so fast. It meant a lot to me. I was really happy I was able to do that.\u201d Nothing to see here, just another snooze of a win for the American great. Bouchard was no match for her and she\u2019s helpless to stop Williams sealing her place in the third round with a drive volley. Williams\u2019s next opponent is the Ukraine\u2019s Dayana Yastremska, who beat Carla Suarez Navarro earlier. Eugenie Bouchard\u2019s out of her depth whenever Serena Williams steps it up. Williams seizes the initiative, moving forward to place her opponent under pressure at 0-40, and Bouchard drops her serve with a weak backhand. Williams leads by a set and a break: 6-2, 3-2. A pounding serve from Alexander Zverev takes him into a 7-6, 6-4 lead against Jeremy Chardy. Hard to see anything other than a three-set Zverev win now. Just nipped off to get an apple and a coffee. While I was away Alex Zverev broke to lead 7-6, 4-3 against Jeremy Chardy. The German\u2019s looking good. A big serve down the middle, a smash at the net. It\u2019s been a stroll so far. Eugenie Bouchard punches a forehand wide on a break point. She challenges but it was well out. Serena Williams breaks again to lead 5-2 in the first set Eugenie Bouchard is on a mission to restore some dignity on Rod Laver Arena - and who knows, maybe she\u2019ll make a match of this yet after cancelling out the double break for Serena Williams, who still leads 4-2. That\u2019s a great win for Alex Bolt, who\u2019s sent Gilles Simon on his way, beating the No29 seed 2-6, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6, 6-4. His reward is a third-round match against Jeremy Chardy or Alexander Zverev. Probably Zverev - he\u2019s growling away after winning a first-set tie-break on Margaret Court Arena, turning up the heat when it mattered most. Here\u2019s a piece wot I did on Eugenie Bouchard last year. Alexander Zverev contrives not to convert a set point before handing Jeremy Chardy the game with a horrible miss at the net. Chardy\u2019s forced a first-set tie-break and Zverev\u2019s body language could be better. Another break for Serena Williams against Eugenie Bouchard. It\u2019s a woeful mismatch so far. Serena Williams appears to be in a hurry, breaking in the very first game on Rod Laver Arena. This could be a swift workout against Eugenie Bouchard, which would be good news for Novak Djokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Jeremy Chardy squares it up on Margaret Court Arena, capitalising on a dip from Alexander Zverev to break back in the first set. Over on Court 3, meanwhile, Australia\u2019s Alex Bolt has broken Gilles Simon in the fifth set. Serena Williams and Eugenie Bouchard make their entrance on Rod Laver Arena. It\u2019s hard not to back Williams, who leads 2-0 in the head-to-head. A former Wimbledon finalist in 2014, Bouchard languishes at 79 in the rankings these days. Alexei Popyrin knows his third-round opponent now. Lucas Pouille, the 28th seed, has beaten Maximilian Marterer of Germany 7-6, 7-6, 5-7, 6-4. Alexander Zverev isn\u2019t hanging around. He\u2019s broken already against Jeremy Chardy. Meanwhile Alex Bolt has forced a fifth set against Gilles Simon after winning a fourth-set tie-break. To Margaret Court Arena, where Alexander Zverev is about to duke it out with Jeremy Chardy. The world No4 starts as the big favourite here and leads 2-1 in his head-to-head with Chardy. Having trailed 4-2 in the decider, now Halep\u2019s serving for it. Three match points quickly come her way. Kenin, not ready to give up yet, makes it 40-15 with a brilliant forehand. But a big serve down the middle from Halep\u2019s enough to do the job and see off a spirited challenge from her very good 20-year-old opponent. That was a cracking match, but it\u2019s the world No1 who goes through to face Venus Williams. Sofia Kenin saves two break points - but the pressure from Simona Halep is relentless and the world No1 breaks when she watches a backhand from the wearied American sail wide. This has been a brilliant battle, but Halep is going to serve for the match at 6-3, 6-7, 5-4. By the way, David Goffin saw off Marius Copil in four sets. The 21st seed\u2019s likely opponent in the next round is Daniil Medvedev, who leads Ryan Harrison by two sets on Court 8. Simona Halep breaks back to get the third set back on serve. Too many double faults from Sofia Kenin. There goes that lead. Are they heading for a deciding tie-break? Thiem, who hasn\u2019t looked right for much of this encounter, throws in the towel after losing his serve at the start of the third set. Oh dear. He played a five-setter the other day and is clearly struggling with something. But don\u2019t take anything away from Alexei Popyrin, a mightily talented and hugely gutsy 19-year-old Australian who more than deserves this win over the seventh seed. He\u2019ll play Lucas Pouille or Maximilian Marterer next. Potential shock alert! Potential shock alert! Simona Halep hits long and Sofia Kenin, who\u2019s been threatening to do so, breaks to lead 3-6, 7-6, 4-2 on Rod Laver Arena! The unseeded American\u2019s two games from knocking out the world No1! Dennis Shapovalov cruises into round three, beating Taro Daniel 6-3, 7-6, 6-3. The young Canadian plays Novak Djokovic or Jo-Wilfried Tsonga next. That\u2019s how you deal with a third set. Williams will play Simona Halep or Sofia Kenin in the third round. Potential shock alert! Potential shock alert! Alexei Popyrin now finds himself two sets to the good against the flailing Dominic Thiem! The Australian wild card leads the No7 seed 7-5, 6-4! Alexei Popyrin comes through deuce to hold for a 7-5, 5-4 lead on Hisense Arena. Dominic Thiem is being drive to distraction by the 19-year-old, who fancies his chances of pulling off one hell of an upset. Venus Williams is back in control on Margaret Court Arena, breaking twice to lead 6-3, 4-6, 3-0 against Alize Cornet. As for Alex Bolt, he\u2019s lost the third set to Gilles Simon, who leads 6-2, 4-6, 6-4, 1-1 against the Australian wild card on Court 3. Simona Halep is placing Sofia Kenin under immense pressure at the start of the third set, forcing the American to save four break points. After more than 10 minutes, though, Kenin holds to lead 1-0 in the decider. Venus Williams will have to do it the hard way. Alize Cornet levels it up on Margaret Court Arena, winning the second set 6-4. Denis Shapovalov\u2019s making cool progress against Taro Daniel. The 25th seed, who could play Novak Djokovic next, leads 6-3, 7-6. In other Next Gen news, the No15 seed Daniil Medvedev took the first set 6-3 against the unseeded American Ryan Harrison on Court 8. Having taken the first set 7-5, Alexei Popyrin had 0-40 in Dominic Thiem\u2019s first service game in the second set. Thiem\u2019s managed to cling on, though. Still on serve, then, with Popyrin leading 7-5, 2-1. A brilliant backhand winner gives Sofia Kenin a 6-5 lead in the tie-break. Set point. It\u2019s Simona Halep to serve. A lengthy rally ensues - but Kenin\u2019s always in control, thumping that forehand, and heavy hitting eventually forces Halep to send a backhand long! Kenin celebrates wildly! She\u2019s got the world No1 on the run here! Halep led 6-3, 3-0 \u2013 but now look! Over on Rod Laver Arena, it\u2019s 3-3 in the tie-break between Simona Halep and Sofia Kenin, who\u2019s still giving nothing away. Tense stuff. Back to Hisense Arena, where Alexei Popyrin finds himself with a 0-30 lead against Dominic Thiem, who\u2019s serving to stay in the set. Excitement builds amongst the Aussie fans. Thiem\u2019s under big pressure here and he doesn\u2019t deal with it well. He\u2019s nowhere to be seen as Popyrin carves out three set points with forceful play. Popyrin, wearing his baseball cap back to front, reaches a Thiem drop shot and sends a forehand down the line. Can Thiem do anything with his backhand? Nope. He plops it into the net and Popyrin, the 19-year-old wild card, takes the first set 7-5 off the rather flummoxed No7 seed! An upset\u2019s brewing! Sofia Kenin holds through deuce on Rod Laver Arena to force a second-set tie-break. Simona Halep could yet be dragged into a decider. Dominic Thiem is struggling to hide his annoyance on Hisense Arena, flinging his racket to the floor at the end of one really. Alexei Popyrin is proving to be a very stubborn opponent as he serves at 5-5 in the first set \u2013 and now he bangs down an ace to wipe out a Thiem break point. Popyrin holds for 6-5. \u201cHere we go Aussies, here we go!\u201d the fans chant. Serving to stay in the match on Rod Laver Arena, Sofia Kenin deepens Simona Halep\u2019s frustration with an easy hold for 5-5 in the second set. Halep\u2019s being pushed harder than she would have anticipated. Over on the atmospheric Hisense Arena, Aussie wild card Alexei Popyrin is locked in a marathon game with Dominic Thiem, the 7th seed, at 4-4 in the first set. He\u2019s had to save a few break points. A double fault gives Thiem another. Popyrin saves it with a big forehand for deuce. The 19-year-old is fighting so hard and he eventually holds to lead 5-4, much to Thiem\u2019s frustration. Having beaten Mischa Zverev in the first round, Popyrin is not to be underestimated. Simona Halep, who was given a few problems by Kaia Kanepi in the first round, isn\u2019t having it all her own way today. The world No1 led Sofia Kenin 6-3, 3-0 - but Kenin has managed to fight back to 3-3 in that second set. Halep\u2019s looking a bit flustered. Alex Bolt, the Australian wild card, looked out of luck not so long ago. He trailed Gilles Simon, the 29th seed, by a set and a break. But he\u2019s only gone and snatched that second set 6-4! Meanwhile David Goffin, the 21st seed, has levelled his match against Romania\u2019s Marius Copil at one set apiece. Let\u2019s round up some of the day\u2019s notable results so far, starting with Milos Raonic\u2019s gritty win over Stan Wawrinka. Raonic has had quite the draw so far. He landed Nick Kyrgios in the first round and it didn\u2019t get any easier in round two as he locked horns with the 2014 champion. Wawrinka\u2019s still feeling his way back from injury, though, and Raonic had the nerve and steel to win 6-7, 7-6, 7-6, 7-6. The 16th seed\u2019s next opponent is Pierre-Hugues Herbet, who knocked out South Korean\u2019s Hyeon Chung, conqueror of Novak Djokovic last year. The No11 seed Borna Coric also made it safely through after beating Marton Fucsovics and there was a dramatic victory for the No8 seed Kei Nishikori, who needed five sets to see off the experienced Croatian Ivo Karlovic. In the women\u2019s draw, meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen wins for Karolina Pliskova and Camila Giorgi over Madison Brengle and Iga Swiatek respectively. Naomi Osaka, the US Open champion, beat Tamara Zidansek and will play Hsieh Su-wei after the 29th seed\u2019s win over Laura Siegmund. And we head straight to Rod Laver Arena, where world No1 Simona Halep\u2019s crushing it against Sofia Kenin of the USA. Halep leads 6-3, 3-0. Elsewhere Venus Williams is a set up against Alize Cornet, Dominic Thiem\u2019s taking on an Aussie qualifier Alexei Popyrin right now, Gilles Simon\u2019s up a set and a break against Aussie wild card Alex Bolt, and Canadian whizzkid Dennis Shapovalov has just taken the first set 6-3 against Taro Daniel. Hello. Sorry for the slightly later start than usual \u2013 I was so engrossed in my book I didn\u2019t realise I was on the wrong train this morning (District Line instead of Hammersmith &amp; City; crisis averted when I got off at Cannon Street, made my way to Moorgate and got on the Northern Line \u2013 and I hope that charming little tale means something to people who don\u2019t, er, live in London). Not to worry, though, because we\u2019ve still got plenty of great tennis on the way. Pick of the bunch? Hard to call. But it\u2019s going to be hard to take your eyes off Novak Djokovic taking on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a repeat of the 2008 final. Djokovic won that one to take his first grand slam title and he\u2019ll probably win this one too - but you can\u2019t count out a player as unpredictable as Tsonga, who\u2019s been given a wild card here after missing most of 2018 with injuries. Then there\u2019s Serena William meeting Eugenie Bouchard, who once reached a Wimbledon final. Not to mention Johanna Konta, the British No1, against former Wimbledon and French Open champion Garbine Muguruza. And much, much more! In fact, they\u2019re playing tennis right now!",

The film, never before seen in public, was played on Thursday at the Old Bailey, where the jet\u2019s pilot, Andrew Hill, is standing trial on 11 charges of manslaughter by gross negligence. Hill, who denies the charges, was performing a stunt when the 1950s Hawker Hunter plummeted on to the A27 in West Sussex and exploded into a fireball on 22 August 2015. As relatives of the victims sat quietly in the packed public gallery, the court was told the footage from a GoPro camera positioned behind the pilot\u2019s seat showed Hill performing a flypast parallel to Shoreham airport\u2019s runway, inverting the aircraft and then performing a stunt called a Derry turn. The A27 comes into view before the camera shows the sky as Hill begins the fatal loop manoeuvre. Initially, nothing can be heard other than the sound of the engine, before the aircraft begins to judder. Tom Kark QC, prosecuting, told jurors there was a \u201ccatalogue of errors\u201d on Hill\u2019s part, including a failure to take evasive action to carry out an escape manoeuvre. Jurors were also shown footage shot by spectators at the side of the road, showing the plane performing the stunt and then crashing on to the A27. Hill, of Sandon, Hertfordshire, lowered his head in the dock when the moment of impact was shown, and then looked at the jury. Karim Khalil, defending, told the court that the pilot, a Royal Air Force instructor and British Airways commercial captain, had been unfairly maligned.

But, at what he described as \u201cmy lovely age of 82\u201d, the billionaire former Italian prime minister and media mogul Silvio Berlusconi has announced his intention to stand for the European parliament. \u201cI\u2019ve decided out of a sense of responsibility to head for Europe, where there is a lack of deep thinking about the world,\u201d he said in Quartu in southern Sardinia. Berlusconi served a community service order for corporate tax fraud in 2015, and has been embroiled in a long series of court cases over his career, not least having his conviction overturned on appeal for paying an underage woman for sex. It appears that Berlusconi regards the EU\u2019s parliament as a possible way back into the corridors of power and is set to run for a seat in the 23-26 May European elections. Berlusconi, as leader of the centre-right Forza Italia party, was three times an Italian prime minister, and recently claimed to light a candle every day while praying for the UK to change its mind on Brexit. But he has been without a parliamentary seat after his 2013 election to the Senate was invalidated because of his fraud conviction. Citing his good conduct, a court last year ruled that he could once again run for public office. The Milan-born businessman has consistently sought to convince the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, to drop his coalition with the Five Star Movement (M5S) since the last Italian elections. Forza Italia and Salvini\u2019s party have formed coalitions in the past. As he made the announcement, Berlusconi hit out at the anti-establishment M5S, currently in government with the anti-immigration League. \u201cWe need to change this government, which includes Five Star, that is led by people who have no experience and no competence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are like the gentlemen of the communist left of 1994, and in addition they have this big problem.\u201d Some of Berlusconi\u2019s most combustible moments as Italian prime minister occurred on the European stage. While leaders engaged in discussions on the location of a new EU food standards agency in 2001, he backed Parma over Finland, saying it was \u201csynonymous with good cuisine \u2013 the Finns don\u2019t even know what prosciutto is\u201d. During a group photo of EU leaders in 2002 he made the horned gesture behind a Spanish minister.

The annual report of the Office of the Schools Adjudicator (OSA) says more than 52,000 children were registered as being home schooled in 2017-18, using figures supplied by the 152 local education authorities in England. But it notes that, because there is no requirement on parents to register, the figure is an underestimate of the real total. The figure represents a steep increase from a similar survey in 2015-16 that estimated about 37,000 school-aged children were registered as home educated. Shan Scott, the chief schools adjudicator, said some local authorities had reported substantial increases \u201cof between 40% to 70% in recent years in the numbers of children electively home educated\u201d. One local authority told the OSA it had received more than 1,000 new registrations in the course of the 2017-18 academic year, and said \u201cmany of these are instantly identifiable as inappropriate\u201d. Councils reported that parents had a variety of reasons for home education, including the failure to secure a place at a preferred school. One local authority said that alone accounted for 9% of all home schooling decisions. But \u201coff-rolling\u201d \u2013 the practice of a school shifting pupils off its rolls without using formal exclusion processes \u2013 was also said to be widespread. \u201cIn a story echoed by other local authorities, one said \u2018it is reported by parents that they have been coerced to become electively home educated\u2019 with some reported instances of schools preparing a standard letter for parents to sign advising of their intention to electively home educate,\u201d the OSA report says. Scott added: \u201cI was told that that there tended to be an increase in moves towards elective home education during the key stage 4 years.\u201d Key stage 4 \u2013 years 10 and 11 \u2013 are when pupils study for and sit GCSE exams. The OSA report is the latest evidence of increasing concerns over off-rolling, whether for behavioural or academic reasons. Earlier this week Ofsted announced it would use data to spotlight schools that appeared to be off-rolling pupils, with schools doing so at risk of being downgraded by inspectors. An investigation by the Guardian found that a high-flying grammar school in Bromley, St Olave\u2019s, had been acting unlawfully by pushing out pupils in its sixth form whom it feared might not get top A-level grades and so damage its league table ranking. The OSA also said parents opted for home education because of their child\u2019s anxiety or unhappiness at school, especially as a result of bullying, or concerns about the standard of education. Others said they did so because their child\u2019s special education needs were not being met. One local authority told the OSA: \u201cIt is felt to be too easy for parents to elect for home education. This is often done by parents who have no idea of what home education involves, often done in haste after a minor falling-out with the school.\u201d The Department for Education last year called for evidence on home schooling practices, and is soon to publish guidance for parents and local authorities that may include compulsory registration. \u201cIt was clear to me that many local authorities believe that a requirement for home educating parents to register with the local authority would do much to safeguard children,\u201d Scott said. The report also suggested grammar schools were still not doing enough to recruit pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, despite 118 selective schools now giving priority to pupils on free school meals in their admissions process. \u201cIn some \u2013 but not all \u2013 cases, there is concern that the proportion of children eligible for the pupil premium securing places at the schools has not increased in the ways hoped for,\u201d Scott said.",

While Proper Journalists were taking time out from trying to procure and publish sneak previews of England team-sheets to pontificate about the Corinthian spirit of fair play, our cousin took time out of boring us with his batting average and bowling figures to regale us with stories about the man they call El Loco.</p> <p>There was the time he started supporting Newell\u2019s Old Boys because his dad was a fan of bitter rivals Rosario Central. There was the time he said he would cut off one of his own fingers if it would guarantee Newell\u2019s a win over Rosario Central. And then there was the time he threatened a group of his own team\u2019s fans who had gathered in protest outside his house with a hand grenade. And the time. And the time. <em>And the time</em>.

OH, THERE YOU GO One of the few benefits of being related to this tea-timely email\u2019s book-writing, cricket-playing, pyramid-inverting, tactics-obsessed Wearside cousin Mackem Lobanovskyi 4-2-3-1 False Nine Wilson Fiver, is that we\u2019ve been looped in on the whole Marcelo Bielsa phenomenon since before it became fashionable on Wednesday. While Proper Journalists were taking time out from trying to procure and publish sneak previews of England team-sheets to pontificate about the Corinthian spirit of fair play, our cousin took time out of boring us with his batting average and bowling figures to regale us with stories about the man they call El Loco. There was the time he started supporting Newell\u2019s Old Boys because his dad was a fan of bitter rivals Rosario Central. There was the time he said he would cut off one of his own fingers if it would guarantee Newell\u2019s a win over Rosario Central. And then there was the time he threatened a group of his own team\u2019s fans who had gathered in protest outside his house with a hand grenade. And the time. And the time. And the time. The stories of Bielsa\u2019s myriad eccentricities are legion. Until a couple of days ago, most people with little more than a passing interest in English football knew Bielsa as that foreign bloke who was doing quite well at Dirty Leeds while sitting on an upturned blue bucket, but now they are a little wiser. For when he is not doing quite well at Dirty Leeds while sitting on an upturned blue bucket, the Argentinian appears to spend every single minute of every single day on doing even better. Having been accused of \u2013 and subsequently admitting to \u2013 sending an envoy to peek at Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County training before their league match last Friday, Bielsa was rather bewildered by the reaction when FLDC, along with assorted doyens of the English press pack and numerous former players collectively gasped, clutched their pearls and swooned like Victorian ladies at this outrageous breach of \u2026 no rules whatsoever. A man with form for quitting clubs at the drop of a hat, Bielsa opted to call a press conference, but instead of announcing his resignation treated those lucky enough to be present to a 66-minute PowerPoint presentation showing: a) his meticulous preparation for games; and b) anyone in the world who was interested how to beat Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County. While Bielsa appeared genuinely bemused at being accused of skulduggery, his decision to go to extraordinary lengths to point out that those accusing him of it didn\u2019t know the half of it has elevated him to the status of National Treasure. \u201cI feel ashamed to have to tell you all this,\u201d said Bielsa, before declaring that \u201cI\u2019m not cheating, I knew everything I needed to know\u201d and leaving the room.

Sometimes you don\u2019t realise and you\u2019ll be yourself and obviously that came out in the documentary.

      "bodyText": "Fox Norton, the second-favourite for the three-runner Clarence House Chase at Ascot on Saturday, is expected to go to post for the Grade One event even if the ground dries out to good, Colin Tizzard, the chaser\u2019s trainer, said on Thursday. Un De Sceaux, the winner for the last three seasons, was taken out at the final declaration stage on Thursday morning, leaving just Fox Norton and Paul Nicholls\u2019s Diego Du Charmil to take on the outstanding Altior, who is expected to set off as one of the strongest favourites for a Grade One jumps event for many years. Fox Norton has not run since suffering a pulled tendon in the King George VI Chase in December 2017 and the possibility of fast ground has been a concern for connections ahead of his belated return to action. Tizzard, though, expects him to line up even if the rain forecast for the track on Friday evening does not materialise. \u201cWe\u2019ve declared him on good-to-soft ground and we\u2019re running,\u201d Tizzard said on Thursday, \u201cand good ground is fine. If it\u2019s good ground, we\u2019ll run and I\u2019m sure they will have it right. They\u2019ve got Altior there and lots of other good horses, so I\u2019m pretty confident that they will do everything they can to get it right.\u201d Un De Sceaux has options at Newbury, Ascot and Leopardstown over the coming weeks after the dry weather robbed him of a chance to make history with a fourth consecutive win in Saturday\u2019s race. Colm O\u2019Connell, Un De Sceaux\u2019s part-owner, said on Thursday that the Clarence House had been the chaser\u2019s aim since last summer. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t meant to be,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cI wish the next generation all the best in trying to achieve four wins in the Clarence House, unfortunately it won\u2019t be us.\u201d Saturday\u2019s race will have the smallest field for a Grade One chase in Britain since Oscar Whisky, at 1-6, beat two opponents to win the Scilly Isles Novice Chase at Sandown in February 2014. Altior is no bigger than 1-8 to win on Saturday and seems certain to set off as the shortest-priced favourite for a British Grade One over jumps in the last 15 years. That status is currently held by Sprinter Sacre, his predecessor as the sport\u2019s top two-miler, who was 1-7 when successful in the Maghull Novice Chase at Aintree in 2012.",

      "bodyText": "Whitehall\u2019s Brexit department has enforced seven \u201cgagging orders\u201d on outsourcing firms and suppliers working on no-deal preparations, despite Theresa May\u2019s previous criticism of such contracts. The disclosure comes as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), run by Michael Gove, confirmed for the first time that it had also asked suppliers to sign non-disclosure agreements [NDAs] as it geared up for the possibility of the UK crashing out of Europe. Six government departments have now admitted using NDAs on more than 62 partners working on no-deal preparations, preventing them from revealing any information related to contingency plans. The latest disclosure comes as business leaders implore the government to lift the veil of secrecy surrounding the UK\u2019s EU exit. The details about the Department for Exiting the EU\u2019s use of NDAs emerged from parliamentary questions asked by the Labour MP Rushanara Ali. The DExEU junior minister Chris Heaton-Harris replied saying the department had seven NDAs with providers for \u201cmedia monitoring, consultancy and research\u201d and defended their use. \u201cThe use of NDAs is limited to standard contractual arrangements with those providing services to support our work and are necessary to protect commercial considerations,\u201d he said during no-deal discussions. David Rutley, a Defra minister, has also confirmed the use of NDAs. Ali said: \u201cIt is unacceptable that the government continues to pursue a policy of silencing businesses and industry from speaking out about the disastrous implications of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cLeaving the EU without a deal will cause irrevocable damage to the UK\u2019s economy and people\u2019s lives. The government must stop hiding the truth, and take no deal off the table immediately.\u201d The Guardian revealed in December that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had imposed 26 NDAs, which were signed by pharmaceutical organisations planning to maintain medical supplies in the event of no deal. It also emerged last month that the Department for Transport has 28 NDAs in force, forbidding firms and organisations from discussing plans on managing haulage in Kent, the border and customs. Official figures show DExEU has paid \u00a34,049,995 for services from big firms such as McKinsey, KPMG and PwC since it was founded in 2016. The department has been in turmoil because of a high staff turnover and is recruiting more analysts. One advert seeks seven analysts, on salaries between \u00a349,000 and \u00a370,000, who will \u201cplay a critical role\u201d in analysis shaping decisions before the UK leaves the EU and in the negotiations after. The prime minister has previously condemned the use of NDAs by employers. She told parliament in October that it was clear they were being used unethically. Whitehall is being so secretive that information is only being provided to some firms orally, or via hard copies of documents that must be returned at the end of meetings. The government has been in close contact with the pharmaceutical industry, which is stockpiling drugs to ensure access to vital medicines if supply routes are disrupted by delays at the border. A template NDA, published by the DHSC in response to another written parliamentary question from Labour, says the government \u201cwill need to share confidential and sensitive information about customs and border arrangements and supply routes\u201d. People attending meetings with civil servants are required not to divulge what they have heard, \u201cnot to take or make a copy of any papers provided for a meeting\u201d, and \u201cto return at the end of each meeting where requested any papers or material provided by the department\u201d.",

Richard Matthews QC, opening the prosecution\u2019s case on the trial\u2019s third day at Preston crown court, took the jury through the moment when David Duckenfield agreed to the opening of exit Gate C to relieve potentially-fatal overcrowding which had built up outside the ground. Duckenfield, who was promoted and appointed match commander shortly before the semi-final on 15 April 1989, is accused of a series of \u201cextraordinarily bad\u201d failures, amounting to gross negligence manslaughter, which led to the crush that killed 96 people. These alleged failures, Matthews has said, included Duckenfield lacking detailed knowledge of the ground and how 24,500 people with tickets to support Liverpool would be admitted through the 23 turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end; a failure to monitor the numbers of people building up outside the \u201cbottleneck\u201d at the turnstiles, or to take any action, including delaying the 3pm kick-off, to relieve that buildup. The jury has heard that due to changes from the identical FA Cup semi-final the previous year, between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, 10,100 people with standing tickets at the Leppings Lane end had to be admitted through only seven turnstiles. When Duckenfield finally agreed to open Gate C, having been warned that people would die outside if he did not, it was inevitable that the people allowed in would head for a tunnel facing them, which led directly to the overcrowded \u201cpens\u201d on the terrace, Matthews said. \u201cHe [ordered the gate to be opened] having failed to take any action himself, or tasked anyone else with any action in good time, to prevent crushing to persons in \u2018pens\u2019 three and four, by the inevitable flow of spectators through the central tunnel. Not before, not during or after the five minutes or more that Gate C was opened, and the inexorable flow of more than 2,000 people through Gate C, did David Duckenfield do anything to prevent, to hinder, discourage the flow of people down the central tunnel, nor did he do anything to avert the inevitable result.\u201d Expert evidence to be given by an experienced structural engineer, John Cutlack, has calculated that in pen three, which had a \u201ctheoretical capacity\u201d of 1,062 people, there were 1,430 people inside after the gate was opened. That escalated the risk of injury \u201cinto the realm of disaster\u201d, Matthews said. Of the period when the gate was opened, he alleged that Duckenfield\u2019s failures continued: \u201cEach was compounded by successive failures, each was contributed to by earlier failures and each was, and flowed from, his own decision-making and fell squarely within his personal responsibility as match commander.\u201d \u201cUltimately it will be a matter for you to decide,\u201d Matthews told the jury, \u201cbut the prosecution allege that the evidence you will hear and see will demonstrate to you that these failings went beyond error or even serious error; they\u2019re rightly to be viewed as extraordinarily bad \u2013 in the face of an obvious and serious risk of death.\u201d Colour footage of the crowd, shown to the jury, identified several of the 96 people who died in the crush.

The law in 1989 stipulated that no charges relating to a death could be brought if the victim died longer than a year and a day after the alleged criminal acts. Duckenfield and Graham Mackrell, the former Sheffield Wednesday secretary and safety officer at the time of the disaster who is accused of criminal breaches of safety legislation, have already pleaded not guilty in pre-trial hearings.

While traditional advertising is at a remove from everyday life, a personal photostream in which every shot is carefully curated has an \u201cintegrity\u201d that broader branding can\u2019t reach. In this scenario, the enjoyment of an experience is secondary to that of selling of it down the chain to one\u2019s own followers, with the subsequent admiration and envy it\u2019s hoped to cause. It doesn\u2019t matter if the experience is fake, nor if the artifice is fully on show. All that matters, as someone as unlikely as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez observed on Twitter recently, is that \u201cthe brand is so strong\u201d. McFarland\u2019s festival failed, but the delusion underpinning it rages on unabated. \u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist",

This was the year they separated. In a small room at London\u2019s Whitechapel Gallery, Genzken stands with her bare back to us \u2013 and to Richter \u2013 with her thin body and short hair. She hangs her head downward, as if commanded by the artist, or perhaps in despair. Her expression is anyone\u2019s guess. This painting, as is Richter\u2019s custom, was copied from a photograph. His smooth brushwork emphasises qualities of the photo \u2013 a Polaroid? \u2013 that reveal depths of anxiety and estrangement. She\u2019s harshly lit and blurred.

      "body": "<p>Beyond the academic rigour of a law degree, students are expected to think about their careers at an increasingly early stage. As we know, the legal graduate job market is flooded \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/law-careers/becoming-a-solicitor/entry-trends/\">18,850 law students were accepted</a> on to undergraduate courses last year. The result is a pressure that begins to mount from the first term. Commitment to demanding extracurricular activities and CV-driven work is standard, which means the modern law degree is all about time management.</p> <p>I graduated this year from the University of Bristol, studying their three-year LLB law programme. Throughout my final year I decided to share my experiences through my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM8qRGoiaLwmMv31L7xeeEQ\">YouTube channel</a>, and have recently produced a collection of videos called The Law Series. I wanted to help current and prospective law students survive law school \u2013 and hopefully get a job. Here are some of my top tips.</p> <h2> <strong>Starting your degree</strong></h2> <p>The number one mistake I made in my first year was inefficiency. I would spend hours poring over textbooks while taking away little critical understanding of the subject matter. Use your lecture notes and basic textbook reading as context to the topic, and then read (briefly) academic journals to help you not only understand other viewpoints, but form your own opinion.</p> <p>Outside of studying, throw yourself into as much as you can. Trust me when I say you will never have so much free time again. Of course, it\u2019s important to establish your CV-building extracurriculars such as debating or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/jun/28/advice-for-law-students-how-to-moot\">mooting</a>, but also take time out of the law bubble.

      "bodyText": "Beyond the academic rigour of a law degree, students are expected to think about their careers at an increasingly early stage. As we know, the legal graduate job market is flooded \u2013 18,850 law students were accepted on to undergraduate courses last year. The result is a pressure that begins to mount from the first term. Commitment to demanding extracurricular activities and CV-driven work is standard, which means the modern law degree is all about time management. I graduated this year from the University of Bristol, studying their three-year LLB law programme. Throughout my final year I decided to share my experiences through my YouTube channel, and have recently produced a collection of videos called The Law Series. I wanted to help current and prospective law students survive law school \u2013 and hopefully get a job. Here are some of my top tips. Starting your degree The number one mistake I made in my first year was inefficiency. I would spend hours poring over textbooks while taking away little critical understanding of the subject matter. Use your lecture notes and basic textbook reading as context to the topic, and then read (briefly) academic journals to help you not only understand other viewpoints, but form your own opinion. Outside of studying, throw yourself into as much as you can. Trust me when I say you will never have so much free time again. Of course, it\u2019s important to establish your CV-building extracurriculars such as debating or mooting, but also take time out of the law bubble. Join the trampoline society, the Saturday running club or even beginners hip-hop (and no, I still can\u2019t dance). Maintaining a social life As any student knows, balancing studying and a social life is tough. I would highly recommend joining your law society on campus, as they held a number of social events in my first term that allowed me to meet fellow coursemates and take some time off. An easy trap you can fall into is immediately feeling guilty about not working, but something that really helped me was timetabling my days and weeks: mark up when you want to work, and strike out time for when you want to escape the library and meet with friends.

The party that took away child benefit for families with more than two children, unless the mother could prove she was raped? The party that cut funding to women\u2019s shelters and appointed an anti-choice campaigner to party vice-chair for women? The government that hopped into bed with the DUP, a similarly backwards-looking party whose oppression of Northern Irish women through the denial of their reproductive rights would have made any other party appropriately squeamish? While society as a whole is arguably not much better at protecting the rights of women or those who are pregnant \u2013 whether at work, in the home or simply out on the street \u2013 we rightly expect parliament to do better, and to lead us to a place where the rights of the marginalised and disadvantaged are robustly protected and not treated as bargaining chips. But parliament was built by and for men \u2013 the evidence is everywhere \u2013 and nowhere will one find stauncher defenders of this ignominious status quo than in the Conservative party. Certainly, a party that restores the whip to two MPs suspended while under investigation for harassment and other sexual offences in order to win a vote, is not one that can be trusted to bring the interests of women and pregnant people to the fore. The refusal to implement a proxy vote system is another symptom of the Conservative problem with women, and their willingness to put parliamentary maths above human rights and dignity. \u2022 Elizabeth Nelson is an activist with the Belfast Feminist Network",

      "bodyText": "Borrowing on credit cards is expected to plunge to the lowest levels since 2007 in the three months before Brexit, according to the Bank of England, in another indication of stresses facing the UK economy. According to the latest quarterly health check on credit conditions from Threadneedle Street, high street banks forecast borrowing on plastic will decline in the first quarter by the most since records began 12 years ago. It comes amid growing concern over consumer spending on the high street after the worst Christmas for retailers since the financial crisis, setting the economy up for a weak first quarter. The Bank said its measure of demand for credit card lending over the three months to the end of March dropped to -20.7 from -7.2. Its gauge for mortgage lending also dropped to -17.5 in the final quarter of 2018, from -0.2 in the third quarter, its lowest level since the end of 2010. The survey also points to a slight fall in demand over the next three months. The looming threat of a no-deal Brexit in less than 80 days dragged down the UK property market further in December, according to a report from Britain\u2019s top surveyors, with prices falling at the fastest rate in six years and the outlook for sales the weakest in two decades. Economists said that the drop in mortgage lending likely reflected banks reining in their lending in response to the risk of a no-deal Brexit, with Threadneedle Street warning that prices could drop by almost a third. Despite the warnings, prices have continued to rise sharply in some parts of the UK, including Manchester and Birmingham, even as the value of homes in London stalls or declines. Most barometers of housing market activity have suggested national price growth is at the lowest levels in several years amid Brexit uncertainty. Still, the latest snapshot from Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, said prices had risen sharply in December. Economists, however, said that delays in the Brexit process \u2013 now increasingly likely after Theresa May\u2019s Commons defeat this week \u2013 could extend the period of uncertainty until at least the middle of the year, acting as a drag on house price inflation. While the sharp drop in demand for credit cards will sound alarm bells for the British economy, as it could indicate a likely drop in spending among consumers, it comes as a sign that households are cutting their borrowing after a rapid rise in debt levels over the past few years. Borrowing on credit cards, personal loans and car finance has risen above \u00a3200bn to surpass the levels seen before the financial crisis, with analysts blaming the increase on weak pay growth in the past decade, government austerity and cuts to benefits. The precarious position of household finances meant families spent about \u00a3900 more on average than they had received in income during 2017, pushing their finances into deficit for the first time since the credit boom of the 1980s. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, said: \u201cWhile the Bank has been keen to see the rate of consumer borrowing slowing, it will not want to see unsecured lending dry up as it will weigh down on economic activity.\u201d",

Instead, I moved to Berlin and opened a bookshop and then a creative consultancy there. I have consistently worked better, harder and smarter in order to land my current role as publisher of my imprint Dialogue Books in the Little, Brown division of Hachette UK. Understanding the challenges that people from minorities have faced in the industry, Dialogue is entirely dedicated to publishing people from LGBTQI+, disability, working-class and BAME backgrounds. Part of my job is to co-chair Changing the Story, our diversity and inclusion initiative to combat inequality. We have a range of outreach programmes that connect with local communities in London and across the country and we aim to empower all our employees to make positive, inclusive decisions. Our Fresh Chapters scheme \u2013 a year-long paid internship for BAME individuals to work across all areas of the business \u2013 has actively increased the number of people from BAME backgrounds working in full-time roles in the company within just two years. But the Publishers Association report is a vital resource, as it shows us the current rate of change. Hopefully it will encourage everyone to do more to ensure that we are an industry for all.",

About 3.3 million viewers were watching BBC One\u2019s coverage of Southampton v Derby at 10pm as both sides pushed for a winner, with the prime minister attracting 2.5 million for live coverage of her address on BBC Two. Roger Mosey, a former head of BBC television news, said: \u201cNo matter the bad luck of extra time in the football, the BBC News should have been on BBC One tonight at 10pm.

May had scheduled her Downing Street speech to hit the top of the 10pm news bulletins, a slot coveted by politicians due to its substantial audience. However, No 10 aides were left frustrated when Derby\u2019s Martyn Waghorn equalised to push the match into extra time and then penalties, meaning it would not finish before the scheduled news broadcast and the prime minister\u2019s speech. BBC One controllers then decided to stick with the game until its conclusion rather than switch the sports coverage to BBC Two. As a result, the main News at Ten bulletin was postponed until 10.35pm, with Edwards instead introducing a rapidly scheduled special programme on BBC Two, which covered Theresa May\u2019s call for all parties to \u201cput aside self-interest\u201d and take part in Brexit discussions. Viewing figures suggest only about 600,000 people switched over from the football to the news coverage.

The giant plants provide steady electricity, 24 hours a day. But there can be blips. The plants are incredibly complex and technical problems can cause long shutdowns. They also need vast amounts of cooling water, which causes problems when drought strikes.</p> <p>The ability to provide \u201cbaseload power\u201d is not always an advantage either.

      "bodyText": "All sources of electricity face the same trilemma in the 21st century: carbon emissions, continuity of supply and cost. The UK government has placed a big bet on nuclear power, but reactors meet only two of the three challenges. Nuclear power is low carbon and a secure source of electricity \u2013 but it is hugely expensive. In the era of climate change, generating power without belching out carbon emissions is vital. While building nuclear plants and fuelling them requires concrete, transport and so on, the overall emissions are similar to wind and solar power. All produce far less carbon than coal or gas-powered stations. Nuclear power also largely passes the security of supply test. The giant plants provide steady electricity, 24 hours a day. But there can be blips. The plants are incredibly complex and technical problems can cause long shutdowns. They also need vast amounts of cooling water, which causes problems when drought strikes. The ability to provide \u201cbaseload power\u201d is not always an advantage either. Modern electricity grids with growing amounts of renewable energy need flexibility and nuclear power is anything but. Nuclear\u2019s reputation for stability is also being challenged by the crashing cost of energy storage, through new technologies such as banks of batteries and compressed air. These can keep electricity from solar and wind power for times when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. More interconnectors between nations would also allow greater security \u2013 the wind is usually blowing somewhere. Nuclear power\u2019s big problem is its price tag. Building extraordinarily complicated plants and keeping them safe is extremely expensive. Solar and onshore wind power prices have plummeted in recent years and are now about one-third that of nuclear. What\u2019s more, renewable energy\u2019s costs continue to fall, while those for nuclear only seem to go up. The Hinkley nuclear power plant is a decade behind schedule and billions over budget. How to deal with nuclear waste in the long term is another expensive, and as yet unresolved, headache. The industry hopes \u201csmall modular reactors\u201d could be cheaper and faster to build. But to fight global warming the world needs low carbon energy now, and no SMR is likely to be generating power in the next 10 years due to lengthy and rigorous safety checks.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has reiterated his refusal to discuss Brexit options with Theresa May until she rules out the idea of a no-deal departure, saying that he can no longer trust the prime minister after she postponed the key Brexit vote in December. Answering a question after a speech in Hastings, East Sussex, the Labour leader was asked why he was the only party leader in the Commons to refuse one-on-one talks with May, an offer she extended after a failed no-confidence vote in the Commons and in the wake of her Brexit deal being overwhelmingly rejected by MPs the day before. Corbyn said May was still threatening people with the idea of no deal, and thus there was no option but to refuse the offer, which he called \u201ca stunt\u201d. Corbyn said he last met May in early December before the initially planned date for the main Brexit vote, which she delayed at the last minute. \u201cI did discuss with her the parliamentary process and we agreed there would be a vote and it would be on 11 December,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo days before that she cancelled the vote and delayed things for over a month in order to continue this idea of running down the clock by threatening everyone with no deal unless we voted for her deal.\u201d However, Corbyn said he was \u201cmore than happy to put forward Labour\u2019s point of view, and will continue to do that\u201d \u2013 saying this would mainly take place in parliament. Corbyn was speaking in Hastings, the highly marginal seat of the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd \u2013 a day after a Labour no-confidence motion in May was voted down in the Commons. On Thursday Corbyn pledged to push again for a general election, and the Labour leader remained uncommitted on the idea of a second referendum, saying again that it remained one of several options if an election did not happen. In response to another question, Corbyn said again that he thought it likely that article 50 would need to be extended beyond 29 March to give more time for a deal. \u201cQuite clearly, if no agreement has been reached within the time that it could be implemented before the end of March then obviously the idea of extending the date, extending article 50, does come into play, and indications are that may well be the case,\u201d he said. Asked if a Labour manifesto would include a pledge to stay in the EU, Corbyn reiterated that this would be a communal matter, saying: \u201cOur manifesto will not be decided by me alone. I will be one person in the room.\u201d In his speech, Corbyn made a fresh attack on May for her response to the defeat of her deal. \u201cThe scale of Tuesday\u2019s vote against it was so great there can now be no question of tweaks or sweeteners from Brussels to bring it back to life,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government\u2019s deal is dead.

But they are outnumbered by women who do accuse Kelly of abuse.

Jim DeRogatis, the Chicago-based journalist who has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/7/24/16019646/r-kelly-surviviing-lifetime-sex-cult-jim-derogatis\" title=\"\">doggedly reported on Kelly for 17 years</a>, has said that the saga has taught him: \u201cNobody matters less in society than young black women.\u201d Or, as Mikki Kendall put it in Surviving R Kelly: \u201cNo one cared because we were black girls.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThese black girls and women were not \u2018ideal victims\u2019,\u201d says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/divafeminist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Treva Lindsey</a>, a professor at Ohio State University whose research focuses on violence against black women. She has found \u201ca particular kind of venom that is relatively normalised\u201d towards them, which starts from the top: \u201cSome of Trump\u2019s most vicious attacks on individuals have come at the expense of black women, whether that\u2019s [congresswoman] Maxine Waters or [journalist] April Ryan.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4b866efda9e273cd52332cafe0eb93e7f65000c3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b866efda9e273cd52332cafe0eb93e7f65000c3/0_475_2784_2712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"His ex-wife Andrea Kelly, who last year claimed he choked her almost to death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"974\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">His ex-wife Andrea Kelly, who last year claimed he choked her almost to death.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chance Yeh/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Kelly case itself, she says, is compounded by \u201ca narrative around black women and girls being hypersexual. It\u2019s such a fraught, racist history, specifically around sexual violence \u2013 black men being accused of raping white women being one of the primary factors in lynching, and black women being seen, legally, as unrapeable.\u201d Lindsey believes that these ideas have become internalised by some African Americans: \u201c\u2018Oh, those girls knew what they were doing.\u2019 And that is part of why it becomes difficult to see a 14-year-old girl on a child abuse sex tape as wholly a victim.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chance the Rapper <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/chance-the-rapper-says-r-kelly-collaboration-was-a-mistake/\" title=\"\">pointed to another reason</a> why some have been slow to condemn R Kelly, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re programmed to really be hypersensitive to black male oppression.\u201d Lindsey adds: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely black folks of all genders defending Kelly, who are fearful of what this means for this larger historical narrative of black men being inherently criminal and aggressive. In the context of a racist country, one black person\u2019s actions become illustrative of the depravity of an entire community. Harvey Weinstein isn\u2019t an indictment of white men. But R Kelly can be used by some as an indictment of black men.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the rapper French Montana later said he supported the alleged victims, when asked about Kelly, he <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/14/entertainment/french-montana-r-kelly/index.html\" title=\"\">grumbled</a> that \u201cthey don\u2019t let nobody have their legendary moments\u201d \u2013 a sentiment shared by another rapper, Waka Flocka Flame, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/01/04/waka-flocka-nonsense-about-bill-cosby/?utm_term=.514e84a42be2\" title=\"\">who, in the wake of the Bill Cosby scandal, said</a>: \u201cEvery time a famous minority make it, they throw salt in the game.\u201d Kelly has tried to leverage this sentiment \u2013 a representative described the #MuteRKelly campaign as the \u201cattempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"204c81e5646df97cfd83d06c9c52afb752ef977e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/204c81e5646df97cfd83d06c9c52afb752ef977e/0_0_3000_2177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Even collaborators such as Lady Gaga, here performing onstage with Kelly in 2013, now believe the rapper\u2019s accusers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even collaborators such as Lady Gaga, here performing onstage with Kelly in 2013, now believe the rapper\u2019s accusers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Tran/FilmMagic</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is precisely these contributions that are Kelly\u2019s most potent weapon. Listening to him can feel like a struggle between two impulses \u2013 to condemn the abuser but adore the artist whose best work touches greatness. She\u2019s Got That Vibe, his debut single from 1992, roared joyously out of the New Jack Swing scene and immediately established a core part of his appeal: the ability to sing lecherous lines (\u201cThe tight miniskirt you wear \u2026 I can\u2019t help but stare\u201d) with such earnestness that they almost appeared romantic. That earnestness was intensified on his biggest hit, I Believe I Can Fly, a ballad of self-determination so structurally perfect that the words didn\u2019t feel outlandish or silly.</p> \n<p>Kelly\u2019s first US No 1, Bump N\u2019 Grind, acknowledged the moral wrongness of his desires, but framed himself as helplessly in thrall to them \u2013 a cornily manipulative trick that the excellence of the songwriting makes seductive. Kelly had to present himself as defined and ruled by his sexuality, both to enhance his sex appeal and to absolve him of his problematic libido. Ignition (Remix) was one of the greatest pop songs of the 00s, its double entendres, car horns and atmosphere of three-drink tipsiness so potent that it became a global hit a mere four months after Kelly was indicted on 10 counts of child pornography.</p> \n<p>Fans don\u2019t want Kelly to be a paedophile or rapist because that would ruin the music. As Common said in the wake of the documentary: \u201cInstead of trying to be like, \u2018Let\u2019s go and try to resolve this situation and free these young ladies and stop this thing that\u2019s going on,\u2019 we were just like, \u2018Man, we rocking to the music\u2019.\u201d That effect has endured even now \u2013 streams of Kelly\u2019s music have increased since Surviving R Kelly aired.</p> \n<p>The love for Kelly\u2019s songs such as these is intensified by their communal appeal: they are the soundtrack to joyful memories of dancefloors and karaoke. As Lindsey says: \u201cHis music signals so many moments for us, whether it\u2019s weddings or graduations or your first kiss.\u201d Neal agrees: \u201cHe knew how to make songs that a black community would find value in, in black social life,\u201d he says. \u201cStep in the Name of Love at weddings; I Believe I Can Fly \u2013 if you\u2019re at a kindergarten graduation, you\u2019re singing this song.\u201d</p> \n<p>Less successful singles were still touched with brilliance. One lyric on I\u2019m a Flirt, \u201clike a dog on the prowl when I\u2019m walking through the mall\u201d, is even more sinister when you consider, as Lindsey says: \u201cAny of my black girlfriends from Chicago had an R Kelly story, and most of them involved a high school, or mall, these spaces where he clearly is finding vulnerable black girls.\u201d But the line is \u2013 perhaps deliberately \u2013 given a spectacularly carefree, beautiful melody.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a7d59ee01339c8923324016d6ecaeb9fd864e36\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a7d59ee01339c8923324016d6ecaeb9fd864e36/0_0_1592_1061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"#MuteRKelly supporters protesting outside his studio earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">#MuteRKelly supporters protesting outside his studio earlier this month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashlee Rezin/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Listening now to songs such as I\u2019m a Flirt, it feels as if Kelly was getting a kick out of hiding in plain sight. Many of his songs express a desire for control through marriage and impregnation in the starkest terms, such as Marry the Pussy and Pregnant. Songs such as It Seems Like You\u2019re Ready are excruciating given what we know about Kelly\u2019s penchant for underage girls.</p> \n<p>Kelly also leveraged the very iconography of R&amp;B. By brazenly embracing a cartoonishly horny image, from 1993\u2019s I Like the Crotch On You to the faceless, naked women on the cover of his 2013 album Black Panties, he made the stories of \u201csex cults\u201d seem like a joke. \u201cThis virility, sexually assertive to the point of aggressive, is a part of a particular R&amp;B persona, and R Kelly is in tradition with that,\u201d Lindsey says. Was Kelly really an abuser, audiences might wonder, or just participating in a tradition of playful lechery going back to 70s soulmen such as Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes and Teddy Pendergrass?</p> \n<p>Then there are Kelly\u2019s experiences as a victim of sexual assault: in his autobiography, he wrote that, growing up, he was repeatedly sexually abused by a family member. Was this the wellspring of his sexually aggressive lyrics, and his own alleged abusiveness as an adult?</p> \n<p>Kelly\u2019s case is complex: a knot of tensions around race, gender, sex and artistry that must be unravelled in order to ask hard questions about how it might have been allowed to flourish, and to bring justice to his alleged victims. \u201cWhat would it mean to hold R Kelly accountable now?\u201d Lindsey wonders aloud. It will surely take far more than removing his duets from Spotify, as Lady Gaga has done, in penance but also as a means of erasing the historical record. As Lindsey says: \u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake for us not to figure it out.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Surviving R Kelly airs in the UK on 5 February, 10pm, on Crime and Investigation.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cYo, Pac!\u201d You can almost feel the spittle as Gary Oldman launches into his soliloquy. It is 2012, and he is performing in a skit on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s US talkshow, reciting from R Kelly\u2019s autobiography with the plummy majesty he later brought to the role of Churchill. \u201cWhat up, baby?\u201d he utters as the audience collapses in giggles. The joke is twofold: English people are so white! But also: R Kelly is so ridiculous! For years, Robert Kelly, now aged 52, was seen, as Kimmel put it that night, as \u201cgreat and inexplicable\u201d. He was one of the US\u2019s most brilliant entertainers, beloved for his uproariously carnal R&amp;B tracks and stratospheric ballads. But there was something that set him apart from his musical peers: a knowing ridiculousness, which would prompt him to cast himself in a 33-part television opera centering around a well-endowed dwarf, describe himself as a \u201csexasaurus\u201d, and make Same Girl, his duet with Usher, so hammy it would inevitably be spoofed by Flight of the Conchords in a song called We\u2019re Both in Love With a Sexy Lady. This sense of self-mockery gained him a new, white hipster audience \u2013 Pitchfork booked him to play its festival in 2013 \u2013 and also helped insulate him from criticism. Until now. It has been alleged for more than 20 years that Kelly has had abusive relationships with women. He wrote and produced Aaliyah\u2019s debut album, then was reported to have married the R&amp;B star illegally when she was 15. The album was titled \u2013 chillingly, in retrospect \u2013 Age Ain\u2019t Nothin\u2019 But a Number. In 1996, Tiffany Hawkins sued Kelly for \u201cpersonal injuries and emotional distress\u201d during a three-year relationship that began when she was 15 and he was 24.

Kelly has only appeared before a judge once, in 2008, when he was accused of making child abuse images by filming sexual encounters, including one in which he urinated over an underage girl. A jury couldn\u2019t identify the man or the girl in the video without doubt, and Kelly was acquitted. Throughout all this, Kelly\u2019s career flourished. Mark Anthony Neal, professor of black popular culture at Duke University, calls him \u201cthe most visible R&amp;B star of the 1990s \u2026 we haven\u2019t seen an R&amp;B figure emerge post-R Kelly that has the kind of gravitas that he or Luther Vandross or Marvin Gaye had.\u201d Kelly created radio hits that united races and generations, and wrote commercially blockbusting albums such as R, which in 1998 sold 216,000 copies in a single week in the US alone, and boasted duets with both Jay-Z and Celine Dion. \u201cHe had a really good ear,\u201d Neal says. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t read or write music, but he was able to mimic these larger traditions: R&amp;B, soul and gospel, adding a contemporary feel so that it felt urgent and vital. And he knew how to record raunch.\u201d Over the past two years, that success has been replaced with a flood of fresh accusations, including claims that he had sex with girls as young as 14 while running a cult-like harem.

Jim DeRogatis, the Chicago-based journalist who has doggedly reported on Kelly for 17 years, has said that the saga has taught him: \u201cNobody matters less in society than young black women.\u201d Or, as Mikki Kendall put it in Surviving R Kelly: \u201cNo one cared because we were black girls.\u201d \u201cThese black girls and women were not \u2018ideal victims\u2019,\u201d says Treva Lindsey, a professor at Ohio State University whose research focuses on violence against black women. She has found \u201ca particular kind of venom that is relatively normalised\u201d towards them, which starts from the top: \u201cSome of Trump\u2019s most vicious attacks on individuals have come at the expense of black women, whether that\u2019s [congresswoman] Maxine Waters or [journalist] April Ryan.\u201d The Kelly case itself, she says, is compounded by \u201ca narrative around black women and girls being hypersexual. It\u2019s such a fraught, racist history, specifically around sexual violence \u2013 black men being accused of raping white women being one of the primary factors in lynching, and black women being seen, legally, as unrapeable.\u201d Lindsey believes that these ideas have become internalised by some African Americans: \u201c\u2018Oh, those girls knew what they were doing.\u2019 And that is part of why it becomes difficult to see a 14-year-old girl on a child abuse sex tape as wholly a victim.\u201d Chance the Rapper pointed to another reason why some have been slow to condemn R Kelly, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re programmed to really be hypersensitive to black male oppression.\u201d Lindsey adds: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely black folks of all genders defending Kelly, who are fearful of what this means for this larger historical narrative of black men being inherently criminal and aggressive. In the context of a racist country, one black person\u2019s actions become illustrative of the depravity of an entire community. Harvey Weinstein isn\u2019t an indictment of white men. But R Kelly can be used by some as an indictment of black men.\u201d Although the rapper French Montana later said he supported the alleged victims, when asked about Kelly, he grumbled that \u201cthey don\u2019t let nobody have their legendary moments\u201d \u2013 a sentiment shared by another rapper, Waka Flocka Flame, who, in the wake of the Bill Cosby scandal, said: \u201cEvery time a famous minority make it, they throw salt in the game.\u201d Kelly has tried to leverage this sentiment \u2013 a representative described the #MuteRKelly campaign as the \u201cattempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture\u201d. It is precisely these contributions that are Kelly\u2019s most potent weapon. Listening to him can feel like a struggle between two impulses \u2013 to condemn the abuser but adore the artist whose best work touches greatness. She\u2019s Got That Vibe, his debut single from 1992, roared joyously out of the New Jack Swing scene and immediately established a core part of his appeal: the ability to sing lecherous lines (\u201cThe tight miniskirt you wear \u2026 I can\u2019t help but stare\u201d) with such earnestness that they almost appeared romantic. That earnestness was intensified on his biggest hit, I Believe I Can Fly, a ballad of self-determination so structurally perfect that the words didn\u2019t feel outlandish or silly. Kelly\u2019s first US No 1, Bump N\u2019 Grind, acknowledged the moral wrongness of his desires, but framed himself as helplessly in thrall to them \u2013 a cornily manipulative trick that the excellence of the songwriting makes seductive. Kelly had to present himself as defined and ruled by his sexuality, both to enhance his sex appeal and to absolve him of his problematic libido. Ignition (Remix) was one of the greatest pop songs of the 00s, its double entendres, car horns and atmosphere of three-drink tipsiness so potent that it became a global hit a mere four months after Kelly was indicted on 10 counts of child pornography. Fans don\u2019t want Kelly to be a paedophile or rapist because that would ruin the music. As Common said in the wake of the documentary: \u201cInstead of trying to be like, \u2018Let\u2019s go and try to resolve this situation and free these young ladies and stop this thing that\u2019s going on,\u2019 we were just like, \u2018Man, we rocking to the music\u2019.\u201d That effect has endured even now \u2013 streams of Kelly\u2019s music have increased since Surviving R Kelly aired. The love for Kelly\u2019s songs such as these is intensified by their communal appeal: they are the soundtrack to joyful memories of dancefloors and karaoke. As Lindsey says: \u201cHis music signals so many moments for us, whether it\u2019s weddings or graduations or your first kiss.\u201d Neal agrees: \u201cHe knew how to make songs that a black community would find value in, in black social life,\u201d he says. \u201cStep in the Name of Love at weddings; I Believe I Can Fly \u2013 if you\u2019re at a kindergarten graduation, you\u2019re singing this song.\u201d Less successful singles were still touched with brilliance. One lyric on I\u2019m a Flirt, \u201clike a dog on the prowl when I\u2019m walking through the mall\u201d, is even more sinister when you consider, as Lindsey says: \u201cAny of my black girlfriends from Chicago had an R Kelly story, and most of them involved a high school, or mall, these spaces where he clearly is finding vulnerable black girls.\u201d But the line is \u2013 perhaps deliberately \u2013 given a spectacularly carefree, beautiful melody. Listening now to songs such as I\u2019m a Flirt, it feels as if Kelly was getting a kick out of hiding in plain sight. Many of his songs express a desire for control through marriage and impregnation in the starkest terms, such as Marry the Pussy and Pregnant. Songs such as It Seems Like You\u2019re Ready are excruciating given what we know about Kelly\u2019s penchant for underage girls. Kelly also leveraged the very iconography of R&amp;B. By brazenly embracing a cartoonishly horny image, from 1993\u2019s I Like the Crotch On You to the faceless, naked women on the cover of his 2013 album Black Panties, he made the stories of \u201csex cults\u201d seem like a joke. \u201cThis virility, sexually assertive to the point of aggressive, is a part of a particular R&amp;B persona, and R Kelly is in tradition with that,\u201d Lindsey says. Was Kelly really an abuser, audiences might wonder, or just participating in a tradition of playful lechery going back to 70s soulmen such as Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes and Teddy Pendergrass? Then there are Kelly\u2019s experiences as a victim of sexual assault: in his autobiography, he wrote that, growing up, he was repeatedly sexually abused by a family member. Was this the wellspring of his sexually aggressive lyrics, and his own alleged abusiveness as an adult? Kelly\u2019s case is complex: a knot of tensions around race, gender, sex and artistry that must be unravelled in order to ask hard questions about how it might have been allowed to flourish, and to bring justice to his alleged victims. \u201cWhat would it mean to hold R Kelly accountable now?\u201d Lindsey wonders aloud. It will surely take far more than removing his duets from Spotify, as Lady Gaga has done, in penance but also as a means of erasing the historical record. As Lindsey says: \u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake for us not to figure it out.\u201d \u2022 Surviving R Kelly airs in the UK on 5 February, 10pm, on Crime and Investigation.",

Another feature is the use of social media. Activists have actively documented confrontations and flooded social media with footage that they claim is \u201cexposing\u201d Bashir\u2019s government. Observers say the protests have united people from different tribes and ethnicities. Women have joined in, even as the protests escalated into bloody confrontations. Dressed in headscarves, they can be seen in nearly all the footage shared on social media, which in turn has helped to convince even more women to take to the streets. All of which has led some, including Hafiz Ismail, an analyst at Justice Africa Sudan, to argue that the demonstrations are likely to have sustained momentum. \u201cThe protests won\u2019t stop,\u201d Ismail said, \u201cbecause the regime doesn\u2019t have any solution for the problem, which is as much political as economic\u201d. Ismail expects the regime to offer concessions \u2013 as happened after protests in 2013 \u2013 but said they may not go far enough for Bashir\u2019s opponents. Particularly problematic for the regime has been the involvement of the Sudanese Professionals Association, a new and broad movement, representing middle-class professions, that has spearheaded the protests, stepping into the vacuum created by the arrest of many opposition leaders. Mohammed Yousif al-Mustafa, a spokesman for the association and professor at Khartoum University, and a relative of the president, described the moment he realised that the burgeoning protest movement had created a new reality. \u201cWe can\u2019t be behind the people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would laugh at us if we stuck to our position of handing a memorandum to the parliament and asking for a raise in the minimum wage. Our position is opposing the regime and its policies.\u201d Which raises the question: what next? \u201cThe longer the protests go on, the more violence and abuses we might see the Sudanese government use,\u201d said Jehanne Henry, of Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe government uses the same sorts of tactics every time there are protests. The risk is that it will get bloodier.\u201d Experts are divided about likely outcomes. The International Crisis Group suggested three potential scenarios in a recent briefing paper. \u201cOne is that the president survives, though without funds to offer protesters significant reforms, he will likely have to subdue them by force,\u201d said the group. \u201cA second scenario could see protests gathering pace and prompting the president\u2019s ousting by elements within his party or security elites \u2026 A third scenario would see Bashir resign. This would allow for a leadership change that could mollify protesters.\u201d For Henry, the outcome hinges on the regime\u2019s response. \u201cThe key question is how much the government feels it is facing an existential threat, and that is hard to predict.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "MPs are expected to have the opportunity on 29 January to vote on whether to hold a second referendum, after a Conservative backbencher pledged to put down an amendment to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan. Sarah Wollaston had previously withheld her amendment because Jeremy Corbyn would not support it, but she said it was time to put it to a vote of MPs when Brexit was next debated in the Commons, and called on the Labour leader to back her. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, announced on Thursday that MPs would again debate Brexit for a full day on 29 January \u2013 eight days after the prime minister is due to spell out her next steps in a statement. MPs will be free to lay a string of amendments to May\u2019s statement, in a debate that is likely to see a range of options put before the Commons for the first time, including Labour\u2019s alternative plan and, almost certainly, an amendment opposing a no-deal Brexit. Any no-deal amendment would be expected to carry a majority in the Commons, after an amendment submitted by Yvette Cooper to the finance bill earlier this month was carried despite government opposition. Wollaston\u2019s second referendum amendment, which could attract the support of a dozen rebel Tories, will not be able to pass the Commons unless the Labour leadership backs it. She said: \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that now we start to test this, and if we\u2019re not successful the first time we could bring it back at a later stage.\u201d The Tory MP indicated she was not certain of success at the first time of asking. Wollaston added: \u201cI very much hope Labour will finish going through their process and Jeremy Corbyn will come out and stick to their commitment that he will back a second vote, which is what a majority of his members want.\u201d The Labour leader is showing no immediate signs of backing a second referendum, and on Thursday, Corbyn said his party would submit its own Brexit amendment, calling for a customs union, a close relationship with the single market and enhanced protection for workers and consumer rights after leaving the EU. Wollaston was speaking at the launch of Right to Vote, a campaign group made up of Conservatives supporting a second referendum, which was attended by half a dozen MPs including Philip Lee, Heidi Allen and Sam Gyimah. Lee said he believed the second referendum faction in the Conservative party would gradually grow in strength, once other options have been exhausted. \u201cWe know cabinet ministers, junior ministers, backbenchers whose head and heart are over here,\u201d the former minister said. The MP added that May had little room for manoeuvre in the latest round of cross-party talks, because the Tories could split if she moved too far towards a centrist position. \u201cThe idea that we could enter the customs union and the ERG [European Research Group] won\u2019t explode?

Ofsted reports for the Frome and Bristol Steiner academies are due to be published later this week and have been shared with parents. Copies seen by the Guardian reveal inspectors\u2019 concerns about a wide range of issues including safeguarding, bullying and lack of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The Frome report accuses leaders and governors of failing to provide pupils with a safe and effective education, due to a lack of understanding about the current statutory requirements.

Hinds called in November for additional scrutiny of Steiner schools by Ofsted after the chief inspector of schools in England, Amanda Spielman, raised concerns about safeguarding in the sector on the back of two earlier inspections. In a letter to Spielman, Hinds said while there was evidence of effective safeguarding in some Steiner schools in both the state and independent sectors, the incidence of safeguarding issues in the independent Steiner schools appeared to be higher than average for the sector. He commissioned Ofsted to carry out a series of inspections and report back to him at the end of the spring term. Meanwhile, the School Inspection Service \u2013 an independent organisation with expertise in Steiner methods, which has in the past inspected private Steiner schools \u2013 has now closed.

Even before the cold war had properly started, it prevented him from getting a job with the BBC. In 1945, he applied for a full-time post making educational broadcasts to help servicemen adjust to civilian life after a long period in the forces. The BBC found him \u201ca most suitable candidate\u201d, but the appointment was swiftly vetoed by MI5. Hobsbawm was, it warned, \u201cnot likely to lose any opportunity he may get to disseminate propaganda and obtain recruits for the Communist party\u201d. </p> <p>By 1947 he had managed to secure employment as a lecturer in history at Birkbeck College, London, then something of a haven for leftwingers whose academic careers had got into difficulties because of their political views. Although he had produced some specialised academic articles, his other publication plans had been frustrated by the same kind of suspicion that had blocked his career in the BBC. In 1955 his book The Rise of the Wage-Worker was rejected on the recommendation of two anonymous academic reviewers who found it lacking in objectivity because it was Marxist. The book remains unpublished to this day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some of the prejudice against Hobsbawm was clearly based on a feeling that he was somehow not quite British</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite his growing reputation as an economic historian, Hobsbawm was for a long time unable to obtain promotion at Birkbeck. His applications for academic positions in economic history at Oxford and Cambridge were turned down on political grounds. In 1972, his problems with the BBC resurfaced after his broadcast on why America was losing the Vietnam war, delivered as part of a series called <em>A Personal View</em>, ran into trouble because of its support for the Vietnamese cause. The Americans pressured the BBC into commissioning a rebuttal by a former British intelligence officer, who argued somewhat implausibly that America was not losing the war at all. Of course, hostility to communism was, as Hobsbawm himself pointed out, much milder in Britain than it was in, say, the US. Still, it had a clearly discernible effect on his career.</p> <p>Was Hobsbawm really the dangerous communist, the Stalinist apologist, the unrepentantly hardline Marxist that so many have assumed him to be? A careful reading of his autobiography, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview4\" title=\"\">Interesting</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview4\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview4\" title=\"\">Times</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview4\" title=\"\">,</a> published in 2002, as well of his other published work, will do a lot to dispel this simplistic view. But it is in the vast mass of private papers, including diaries, letters and unpublished personal reminiscences that the real answers are to be found. They can be supplemented by other sources, including the many files MI5 kept on him for several decades. What is the story this material tells?</p> <p>Some of the prejudice against Hobsbawm was clearly based on a feeling that he was somehow not quite British (in contrast to real enemies of the country such as the Cambridge spies, who were graduates of public schools and therefore above suspicion). Born in Alexandria, he had spent his childhood in Vienna. This aroused suspicion in establishment circles. He was also Jewish by origin, a further black mark against his reputation (one Special Branch report described his uncle Harry, with whom he lived for a time in his teens, as \u201ca sneering, critical type of person, harsh of speech, half Jew in appearance, having a long nose, thinning hair and blue eyes\u201d). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a0ed3e8fe777221e614a9a40707a1fadacba98f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0ed3e8fe777221e614a9a40707a1fadacba98f2/0_217_3757_2254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A National Socialist demonstration in Berlin, 1931.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A National Socialist demonstration in Berlin, 1931.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was, and still is, widely thought that Hobsbawm was a refugee who fled with his family from Germany to England in 1933 in order to escape Hitler. In fact his father was British, and so he was a British citizen by birth. His mother, a passionate anglophile and professional translator, insisted on English being spoken at their home in Vienna. He was known by his fellow pupils at school as \u201cthe English boy\u201d. There is no doubt, however, about his early commitment to the communist cause. In 1931, when he was sent to live in Berlin with an uncle and aunt following the premature death of his parents (his father from a heart attack, his mother from tuberculosis), he encountered an overheated political atmosphere that presented the young with a stark choice between communism and nazism. As an English boy from a liberal Jewish family, Hobsbawm had no option but to commit himself to communism.</p> <p>But there were other, more personal reasons for his choice, reasons that help explain why he never abandoned the communist ideals he acquired in Berlin. The genteel poverty in which he had grown up in Vienna, and the miserable financial position of his uncle in Berlin, who had lost his job in the Depression as a result of laws restricting the numbers of foreign employees in German businesses, contrasted sharply with the relative prosperity of his fellow pupils at his high school. He felt ashamed of his shabby appearance and the straitened circumstances in which he lived. \u201cOnly by turning this completely around,\u201d he confessed to his diary, \u201cand becoming proud of it did I conquer the shame.\u201d The real attraction of the communists was that they turned poverty into a virtue.</p> <p>In these, his teenage years, following the death of his parents, Hobsbawm was engaged in a desperate search for a sense of family and belonging that was only partially satisfied by living with his uncle and aunt. For a short while he found it in the unlikely form of the Scouts, but it was the communist movement that really met all these deep emotional needs. He read a few basic Marxist texts, involved himself in the activities of the Socialist School Students\u2019 League, and took part in the last great Communist party demonstration in Berlin, on 25 January 1933. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jan/31/archive-hitler-forms-first-government\" title=\"\">A few days later, Hitler was appointed chancellor</a>. Life became increasingly dangerous for communists and Jews. But it was for economic rather than political reasons that Hobsbawm\u2019s uncle Sidney decided to move the family to Britain, after the failure of yet another business venture, this time in Barcelona. So many of Hobsbawm\u2019s relatives were failed businessmen that it is hardly surprising he saw little future in capitalism.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Hobsbawm began reading the major Marxist texts. 'Drown yourself in Leninism,' was his note to himself. 'Let it become your second nature'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The German Communist party had continued to grow even while, towards the end of 1932, the Nazis were starting to lose support. Here was a movement that had 100 representatives in the national legislature. When Hobsbawm encountered the Communist party of Great Britain, the contrast could not have been greater. With not a single MP in Westminster until 1935, and a membership that made it little more than a sect, it did not impress Hobsbawm in the least. What\u2019s more, it was an aggressively working-class organisation that had no time for intellectuals. Writing his diaries at home, in German, every day, Hobsbawm concluded it was not for him. He had already decided quite self-consciously that, as he put it, \u201cI am an intellectual through and through.\u201d He was beginning to realise that he was unusually clever, but he was already haunted by the feeling that he was physically unattractive. His cousin Denis said to him brutally he was \u201cugly as sin, but you have a mind\u201d. Hobsbawm began reading voraciously, week by week, all the major Marxist texts. \u201cDrown yourself in Leninism,\u201d was his note to himself. \u201cLet it become your second nature.\u201d After reading 12 pages of Lenin he noted in his diary: \u201cAstonishing how that cheers me up and clears my mind. I was in a total good mood afterwards.\u201d This is not the feeling that most people have after ploughing through works such as <em>Materialism and Empirio-Criticism</em>. As for Stalin, Hobsbawm barely mentioned him at all.</p> <p>He was also a political realist. The only mass movement of the left in Britain in the 1930s was the Labour party, and so Hobsbawm shunned the Communists and volunteered to help Labour in the local elections of 1934 (as he did in the general election of 1945). And he was far from narrow in his interests, visiting the major London galleries and museums, and reading numerous works (in English, French and German) of fiction, poetry and drama, as well as developing an enthusiasm for jazz, at a time when it was anathematised by the official cultural policy of the Communist party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fac69c731af34d7477a922d9f7e24ccc392949e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fac69c731af34d7477a922d9f7e24ccc392949e3/0_436_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tragic necessity? \u2026 The invasion of Hungary by the USSR in 1956 was backed by the British Communist party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tragic necessity? \u2026 The invasion of Hungary by the USSR in 1956 was backed by the British Communist party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This breadth of pursuits only increased after he became an undergraduate at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, in 1936. It was at this point, finding a growing number of students committing themselves to communism as a result of the Labour party\u2019s failure to support the republic in the Spanish civil war, that he finally joined the Communist party, in the form of the university\u2019s Socialist Club. But he quickly became bored with the club\u2019s political dogmatism. He found its activities and especially its regular Bulletin, which he was charged with editing, \u201cbarren\u201d, so he abandoned it for the non-political student periodical the Granta, duly becoming its editor, too. Here he had the scope for writing about cinema, a particular passion, but also producing profiles of leading Cambridge characters and visiting politicians.</p> <p>After the war, he continued as a member of the party and did some work in supporting sister parties in central Europe, at least until they began to fall victim to a ruthless process of Stalinisation at the end of the 1940s. But in truth, Hobsbawm never behaved as a Communist was supposed to. He was not an activist, he did not sell Communist party literature on the street corner and he wrote regularly for non-Communist (\u201cbourgeois\u201d) publications, earning the party\u2019s disapproval. He confessed himself an \u201coutsider in the movement\u201d. His main focus was on the work of the Communist Party Historians\u2019 Group (CPHG), a relatively short-lived organisation of the late 1940s and early 50s largely confined to \u201ctheoretical discussions\u201d. MI5 operatives, monitoring bugged conversations at Communist party HQ in London, noted that despite its attempts to make him behave like a loyal member, one senior official complained that \u201che had just ceased to answer any letters!\u201d</p> <p>What Hobsbawm was committed to was an ideal of communism with a small \u201cC\u201d, an ideal he had imbibed as an adolescent more through reading the Marxist classics than through taking an active part in the real politics of the movement. He also remained convinced, as he had been in the 1930s, that Communists would have to cooperate with other leftist parties in the struggle for power: hence his enthusiasm for the French Popular Front, which established a socialist and liberal government in 1936 with the support of the Communist party.</p> <p>In the 50s, however, the chances of collaborating were minimal. The British Communist party was obdurately Stalinist, and without mass support. As time went on, Hobsbawm\u2019s disillusion with it steadily grew. How could he, for example, possibly support Stalin\u2019s policies when these involved show trials of \u201ccosmopolitans\u201d, or in other words, Jewish members, in Czechoslovakia and other communist-dominated countries in eastern Europe? After all, he knew a good number of them, and was aware that they were innocent of the charges brought against them.</p> <p>Not long after the death of Stalin in 1953 the international communist movement was plunged into a deep crisis. On 25 February 1956, at the 20th congress of the Communist party of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin for the \u201ccult of personality\u201d that had grown up around him, and for the numberless murders and atrocities he had committed. As the contents of the speech found their way to the west, the British party leadership tried to ignore them. But in April 1956 the historians\u2019 group, led by Hobsbawm, Thompson and Hill, issued a stinging rebuke to the party for its failure to express regret for its \u201cpast uncritical endorsement of all Soviet polities and views\u201d. An impassioned debate broke out in the party periodical World News, with Hobsbawm in particular calling for an open confrontation with the party\u2019s past, its errors and its lies. He demanded that it had to be open to democratic change from below; simply imposing a \u201cparty line\u201d from above was unacceptable. He met with delaying tactics and obfuscation from the leadership.</p> <p>The crisis deepened in October 1956 when a liberal communist government came to power in Hungary on the back of mass popular demonstrations after months of stonewalling by the Stalinist regime in Budapest. On 4 November, Moscow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/nov/10/1956-hungarian-revolution-in-pictures\" title=\"\">responded with a military invasion, suppressing the new regime</a> and killing at least 2,500 Hungarians who had tried to resist. These events, Hobsbawm declared, shocked party intellectuals and \u201cpierced the core of their faith and hope\u201d. Attempting to avoid an open confrontation with the leadership in London, which had backed the invasion, he conceded that the invasion was \u201ca tragic necessity\u201d in view of the threat of a reactionary rightwing government taking over, but demanded that \u201cthe USSR should withdraw its troops as soon as this is possible\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1e1e4a3db685d607a6e079fd907361464e0c0132\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e1e4a3db685d607a6e079fd907361464e0c0132/0_0_2964_4469/663.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair, whom Hobsbawm called \u2018Thatcher in trousers\u2019.\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair, whom Hobsbawm called \u2018Thatcher in trousers\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A furious debate broke out within the party as the leadership refused to budge. \u201cHobsbawm,\u201d a phone conversation monitored by MI5 recorded one member as saying, \u201cwants to call for the overthrow of the leadership and a new policy\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The historian Eric Hobsbawm, who was born in 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution, and died in 2012 at the age of 95, was widely regarded as an unrepentant Stalinist, a man who, unlike other Marxist historians such as EP Thompson and Christopher Hill, never resigned his membership of the Communist party, and never expressed any regret for his commitment to the communist cause. In the later part of his long life he was most probably the world\u2019s best-known historian, his books translated into more than 50 languages and selling millions of copies across the globe (about a million in Brazil alone, for example). Yet when the BBC invited him on to the radio programme Desert Island Discs in 1995, the presenter Sue Lawley addressed him distantly as \u201cProfessor Hobsbawm\u201d, left his books more or less unmentioned, and focused her attention so unremittingly on his lifelong commitment to communism that the programme turned from the usual comfortable chat into a hostile interrogation. Many of the reviews of his bestselling history of the 20th century, The Age of Extremes, a work translated into 30 languages, charged him with playing down the evils of Stalinism, and the influential anti-communist French historians Pierre Nora and Fran\u00e7ois Furet were so successful in preventing its publication in France that it was eventually translated into French by an obscure publishing house based in Belgium. The label \u201cStalinist\u201d dogged Hobsbawm throughout his adult life and affected his career in numerous ways. Even before the cold war had properly started, it prevented him from getting a job with the BBC. In 1945, he applied for a full-time post making educational broadcasts to help servicemen adjust to civilian life after a long period in the forces. The BBC found him \u201ca most suitable candidate\u201d, but the appointment was swiftly vetoed by MI5. Hobsbawm was, it warned, \u201cnot likely to lose any opportunity he may get to disseminate propaganda and obtain recruits for the Communist party\u201d. By 1947 he had managed to secure employment as a lecturer in history at Birkbeck College, London, then something of a haven for leftwingers whose academic careers had got into difficulties because of their political views. Although he had produced some specialised academic articles, his other publication plans had been frustrated by the same kind of suspicion that had blocked his career in the BBC. In 1955 his book The Rise of the Wage-Worker was rejected on the recommendation of two anonymous academic reviewers who found it lacking in objectivity because it was Marxist. The book remains unpublished to this day. Despite his growing reputation as an economic historian, Hobsbawm was for a long time unable to obtain promotion at Birkbeck. His applications for academic positions in economic history at Oxford and Cambridge were turned down on political grounds. In 1972, his problems with the BBC resurfaced after his broadcast on why America was losing the Vietnam war, delivered as part of a series called A Personal View, ran into trouble because of its support for the Vietnamese cause. The Americans pressured the BBC into commissioning a rebuttal by a former British intelligence officer, who argued somewhat implausibly that America was not losing the war at all. Of course, hostility to communism was, as Hobsbawm himself pointed out, much milder in Britain than it was in, say, the US. Still, it had a clearly discernible effect on his career. Was Hobsbawm really the dangerous communist, the Stalinist apologist, the unrepentantly hardline Marxist that so many have assumed him to be? A careful reading of his autobiography, Interesting Times, published in 2002, as well of his other published work, will do a lot to dispel this simplistic view. But it is in the vast mass of private papers, including diaries, letters and unpublished personal reminiscences that the real answers are to be found. They can be supplemented by other sources, including the many files MI5 kept on him for several decades. What is the story this material tells? Some of the prejudice against Hobsbawm was clearly based on a feeling that he was somehow not quite British (in contrast to real enemies of the country such as the Cambridge spies, who were graduates of public schools and therefore above suspicion). Born in Alexandria, he had spent his childhood in Vienna. This aroused suspicion in establishment circles. He was also Jewish by origin, a further black mark against his reputation (one Special Branch report described his uncle Harry, with whom he lived for a time in his teens, as \u201ca sneering, critical type of person, harsh of speech, half Jew in appearance, having a long nose, thinning hair and blue eyes\u201d). It was, and still is, widely thought that Hobsbawm was a refugee who fled with his family from Germany to England in 1933 in order to escape Hitler. In fact his father was British, and so he was a British citizen by birth. His mother, a passionate anglophile and professional translator, insisted on English being spoken at their home in Vienna. He was known by his fellow pupils at school as \u201cthe English boy\u201d. There is no doubt, however, about his early commitment to the communist cause. In 1931, when he was sent to live in Berlin with an uncle and aunt following the premature death of his parents (his father from a heart attack, his mother from tuberculosis), he encountered an overheated political atmosphere that presented the young with a stark choice between communism and nazism. As an English boy from a liberal Jewish family, Hobsbawm had no option but to commit himself to communism. But there were other, more personal reasons for his choice, reasons that help explain why he never abandoned the communist ideals he acquired in Berlin. The genteel poverty in which he had grown up in Vienna, and the miserable financial position of his uncle in Berlin, who had lost his job in the Depression as a result of laws restricting the numbers of foreign employees in German businesses, contrasted sharply with the relative prosperity of his fellow pupils at his high school. He felt ashamed of his shabby appearance and the straitened circumstances in which he lived. \u201cOnly by turning this completely around,\u201d he confessed to his diary, \u201cand becoming proud of it did I conquer the shame.\u201d The real attraction of the communists was that they turned poverty into a virtue. In these, his teenage years, following the death of his parents, Hobsbawm was engaged in a desperate search for a sense of family and belonging that was only partially satisfied by living with his uncle and aunt. For a short while he found it in the unlikely form of the Scouts, but it was the communist movement that really met all these deep emotional needs. He read a few basic Marxist texts, involved himself in the activities of the Socialist School Students\u2019 League, and took part in the last great Communist party demonstration in Berlin, on 25 January 1933. A few days later, Hitler was appointed chancellor. Life became increasingly dangerous for communists and Jews. But it was for economic rather than political reasons that Hobsbawm\u2019s uncle Sidney decided to move the family to Britain, after the failure of yet another business venture, this time in Barcelona. So many of Hobsbawm\u2019s relatives were failed businessmen that it is hardly surprising he saw little future in capitalism. The German Communist party had continued to grow even while, towards the end of 1932, the Nazis were starting to lose support. Here was a movement that had 100 representatives in the national legislature. When Hobsbawm encountered the Communist party of Great Britain, the contrast could not have been greater. With not a single MP in Westminster until 1935, and a membership that made it little more than a sect, it did not impress Hobsbawm in the least. What\u2019s more, it was an aggressively working-class organisation that had no time for intellectuals. Writing his diaries at home, in German, every day, Hobsbawm concluded it was not for him. He had already decided quite self-consciously that, as he put it, \u201cI am an intellectual through and through.\u201d He was beginning to realise that he was unusually clever, but he was already haunted by the feeling that he was physically unattractive. His cousin Denis said to him brutally he was \u201cugly as sin, but you have a mind\u201d. Hobsbawm began reading voraciously, week by week, all the major Marxist texts. \u201cDrown yourself in Leninism,\u201d was his note to himself. \u201cLet it become your second nature.\u201d After reading 12 pages of Lenin he noted in his diary: \u201cAstonishing how that cheers me up and clears my mind. I was in a total good mood afterwards.\u201d This is not the feeling that most people have after ploughing through works such as Materialism and Empirio-Criticism. As for Stalin, Hobsbawm barely mentioned him at all. He was also a political realist. The only mass movement of the left in Britain in the 1930s was the Labour party, and so Hobsbawm shunned the Communists and volunteered to help Labour in the local elections of 1934 (as he did in the general election of 1945). And he was far from narrow in his interests, visiting the major London galleries and museums, and reading numerous works (in English, French and German) of fiction, poetry and drama, as well as developing an enthusiasm for jazz, at a time when it was anathematised by the official cultural policy of the Communist party. This breadth of pursuits only increased after he became an undergraduate at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, in 1936. It was at this point, finding a growing number of students committing themselves to communism as a result of the Labour party\u2019s failure to support the republic in the Spanish civil war, that he finally joined the Communist party, in the form of the university\u2019s Socialist Club. But he quickly became bored with the club\u2019s political dogmatism. He found its activities and especially its regular Bulletin, which he was charged with editing, \u201cbarren\u201d, so he abandoned it for the non-political student periodical the Granta, duly becoming its editor, too. Here he had the scope for writing about cinema, a particular passion, but also producing profiles of leading Cambridge characters and visiting politicians. After the war, he continued as a member of the party and did some work in supporting sister parties in central Europe, at least until they began to fall victim to a ruthless process of Stalinisation at the end of the 1940s. But in truth, Hobsbawm never behaved as a Communist was supposed to. He was not an activist, he did not sell Communist party literature on the street corner and he wrote regularly for non-Communist (\u201cbourgeois\u201d) publications, earning the party\u2019s disapproval. He confessed himself an \u201coutsider in the movement\u201d. His main focus was on the work of the Communist Party Historians\u2019 Group (CPHG), a relatively short-lived organisation of the late 1940s and early 50s largely confined to \u201ctheoretical discussions\u201d. MI5 operatives, monitoring bugged conversations at Communist party HQ in London, noted that despite its attempts to make him behave like a loyal member, one senior official complained that \u201che had just ceased to answer any letters!\u201d What Hobsbawm was committed to was an ideal of communism with a small \u201cC\u201d, an ideal he had imbibed as an adolescent more through reading the Marxist classics than through taking an active part in the real politics of the movement. He also remained convinced, as he had been in the 1930s, that Communists would have to cooperate with other leftist parties in the struggle for power: hence his enthusiasm for the French Popular Front, which established a socialist and liberal government in 1936 with the support of the Communist party. In the 50s, however, the chances of collaborating were minimal. The British Communist party was obdurately Stalinist, and without mass support. As time went on, Hobsbawm\u2019s disillusion with it steadily grew. How could he, for example, possibly support Stalin\u2019s policies when these involved show trials of \u201ccosmopolitans\u201d, or in other words, Jewish members, in Czechoslovakia and other communist-dominated countries in eastern Europe? After all, he knew a good number of them, and was aware that they were innocent of the charges brought against them. Not long after the death of Stalin in 1953 the international communist movement was plunged into a deep crisis. On 25 February 1956, at the 20th congress of the Communist party of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin for the \u201ccult of personality\u201d that had grown up around him, and for the numberless murders and atrocities he had committed. As the contents of the speech found their way to the west, the British party leadership tried to ignore them. But in April 1956 the historians\u2019 group, led by Hobsbawm, Thompson and Hill, issued a stinging rebuke to the party for its failure to express regret for its \u201cpast uncritical endorsement of all Soviet polities and views\u201d. An impassioned debate broke out in the party periodical World News, with Hobsbawm in particular calling for an open confrontation with the party\u2019s past, its errors and its lies. He demanded that it had to be open to democratic change from below; simply imposing a \u201cparty line\u201d from above was unacceptable. He met with delaying tactics and obfuscation from the leadership. The crisis deepened in October 1956 when a liberal communist government came to power in Hungary on the back of mass popular demonstrations after months of stonewalling by the Stalinist regime in Budapest. On 4 November, Moscow responded with a military invasion, suppressing the new regime and killing at least 2,500 Hungarians who had tried to resist. These events, Hobsbawm declared, shocked party intellectuals and \u201cpierced the core of their faith and hope\u201d. Attempting to avoid an open confrontation with the leadership in London, which had backed the invasion, he conceded that the invasion was \u201ca tragic necessity\u201d in view of the threat of a reactionary rightwing government taking over, but demanded that \u201cthe USSR should withdraw its troops as soon as this is possible\u201d. A furious debate broke out within the party as the leadership refused to budge. \u201cHobsbawm,\u201d a phone conversation monitored by MI5 recorded one member as saying, \u201cwants to call for the overthrow of the leadership and a new policy\u201d. His attitude towards the party leaders was described as \u201cbellicose\u201d. As leading historians such as Thompson resigned from the CPGB in despair, Hobsbawm demanded the right to form an inner-party opposition. One leading figure in the party called him \u201ca dangerous character\u201d. He and the other historians, said another, were \u201ca clueless lot of scruffs, potentially quite dangerous\u201d. The \u201cfreedoms\u201d they demanded would lead to \u201cparty anarchy\u201d. Hobsbawm responded by attacking the CPGB\u2019s \u201cmonumental complacency\u201d. The party refused to budge. He and the other historians were \u201cbackboneless and spineless intellectuals\u201d. Hill and most of the others resigned, having achieved nothing. Hobsbawm went with them in many respects, contributing to their periodical the New Reasoner and joining with them in the New Left Club, outside the party. George Matthews, editor of the party paper, the Daily Worker, declared that \u201cit would, in his opinion, be a good thing\u201d if they \u201cprovoked Hobsbawm to leave the party\u201d. He was in any case \u201can outsider\u201d. Hobsbawm was summoned to party headquarters and told that \u201cthey wanted him to remain in the party and not do things that might put him out of it.

Marxist ideas gave his work a coherence and structure that merely empirical history was unable to achieve; they helped him to develop concepts that made sense of the inchoate material of history, and at the same time, because they were novel and controversial, provided topics for debates and discussions that are still going on among historians today \u2013 \u201cthe general crisis of the 17th century\u201d, \u201cthe declining standard of living in the industrial revolution\u201d, \u201csocial banditry\u201d, \u201cthe invention of tradition\u201d, \u201cthe long 19th century\u201d and many more. At the same time, concepts and ideas never forced the basic evidence on to the sidelines. Where fact and interpretation clashed, Hobsbawm was almost always scrupulous enough to yield to fact, as, for example, in his abandonment of Marxist theories of imperialism in his book The Age of Empire. Neither as a communist intellectual nor as a practising historian was he ever a mere propagandist. As for his confrontation with the communist past in the final two decades of his life, following the fall of the Berlin Wall, there is no sign that he concealed or passed over the many crimes and atrocities that had disfigured it. The shrill demands to repent and recant with which he was so frequently confronted deserve to be treated with contempt. Rather, what gives The Age of Extremes much of its fascination is the spectacle of a lifelong communist trying, often but not always successfully, to come to terms with the failure of the cause he had served for so long as an intellectual. \u2022 Eric Hobsbawm: A Life in History by Richard J Evans is published by Little, Brown on 7 February (RRP \u00a335).

      "bodyText": "The mayor of a Canadian town where 47 people were killed in a rail disaster in 2013 has complained to Netflix after images of the incident were used in the hit sci-fi film Bird Box. The accident happened when a train carrying crude oil exploded in Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Quebec, and the BBC reports that Netflix confirmed that footage of the disaster was included in a montage sequence illustrating an attack. Julie Morin, mayor of Lac-M\u00e9gantic said: \u201cWe are looking for assurances from Netflix that they are going to remove [the footage]. You can be sure we are going to follow up on this, and our citizens are on our side.\u201d Canadian viewers had earlier become aware that images of the disaster had also been used in another Netflix show, the science fiction series Travelers. The show\u2019s executive producer, Carrie Mudd, apologised and said the footage had been acquired from an agency called Pond 5. Morin added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for our citizens to see these images when they are used normally and respectfully on the news. Just imagine, to have them used as fiction, as if they were invented.\u201d According to the BBC, Netflix \u2013 already under fire over the \u201cBird Box challenge\u201d phenomenon \u2013 says it will not be removing the footage used in Bird Box. Mudd promised that the scene in Travelers will be replaced.",

      "bodyText": "Kenya\u2019s president has vowed to relentlessly pursue anyone involved in the Nairobi hotel complex attack, as new details of the 16-hour siege emerged. Twenty-one people have been confirmed dead, including 11 Kenyans, a Briton and an American, as well as five attackers. The Kenya Red Cross said on Thursday that all 94 cases of people reported to be missing had been \u201cclosed positively\u201d. In a televised address on Wednesday, Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, said: \u201cWe will seek out every person who was involved in the funding, planning and execution of this heinous act. We will pursue them relentlessly wherever they will be until they are held accountable.\u201d The assault on the complex, which includes the luxury dusitD2 hotel, restaurants, a spa and the offices of several international companies, was the most high-profile by terrorists in Kenya since 67 people were killed in the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi in 2013. Al-Shabaab, the Somalia-based militant Islamist organisation responsible for the attack five years ago, said it also carried out the assault on Tuesday. The head of Kenya\u2019s police service, Joseph Boinnet, said five gunmen took part in the assault, including a suicide bomber who died in the first few minutes when he detonated his device in the hotel\u2019s foyer. Boinnet said security forces killed two of the gunmen on Tuesday night and that the two others died on Wednesday morning. A heavily armed member of the British SAS who was reportedly on a training mission with Kenyan special forces was pictured helping to evacuate people during the attack. Western and international security officials have told the Guardian they warned Kenyan counterparts over Christmas and New Year about the possibility of high-profile attacks by al-Shabaab, which is an affiliate of al-Qaida. Survivors of the attack described chaos, fear and a long wait for help. Patrick Viera Nganga, 38, spent more than 12 hours hiding under a table before being rescued on Wednesday morning. \u201cI had just had lunch with friends and went to the bathroom when the explosion occurred at the entrance. Just two minutes later shooting started. I ran to the lobby and hid under a big table \u2026 Two of the attackers entered and shot two persons there. One was firing continuously every direction. His phone rang and he answered, saying something I didn\u2019t understand,\u201d Nganga said. \u201cI did not move. I played dead and was prepared to die. I stopped thinking about life. Night fell and I started praying. About 4am this morning, I heard police voices calling survivors to come out.\u201d Robert Kamau, 41, was waiting for a job interview with a local company. He said: \u201cThe first I heard was a big boom \u2026 Ten minutes later an employee at the hotel came running and told us it was a terrorist attack. Everybody ran for shelter. I saw a hotel guard who was trying to help an injured woman and we all ran to the emergency exit, but when I looked along the corridor, there was one attacker, a young, light-skinned guy with an AK47 rifle. He spotted us and began shooting.\u201d Kamau, who was led out of the complex by police on Wednesday morning, added: \u201cI thank God for being alive today. I thank those who rescued me as well.\u201d A woman rescued from the hair salon she managed also survived the Westgate attack. \u201cI was working when the attackers stormed in. It was not easy, just like today. All I can say is that I thank God,\u201d Tracy Wanjiru told Nairobi News. Relatives of the dead and missing gathered at the nearby Chiromo mortuary. The family of a missing 35-year-old man collapsed upon hearing that a body had arrived with his identification papers. \u201cHe is gone, he is gone,\u201d the father repeated into his phone as his mother wrapped a shawl around herself and wept. Another family arrived, demanding to know whether their relative was there, but were told that only police had access. As they argued, an older couple arrived in silence, bringing a freshly pressed suit to dress their dead son. Sylvia, 30, was searching for her boyfriend, who had recently arrived from Australia and booked into the dusitD2 hotel. She had identified his clothes at the mortuary, but was not allowed to view his body. \u201cWe spoke on the phone just before the attack and as we were still on the line, the explosion occurred, followed by gunfire. I have been looking for him since then,\u201d she said. Sitting nearby were relatives and friends of Abdalla Dahir and Feisal Ahmed, two development professionals working on aid projects in Somalia who were having lunch together at a restaurant in the grounds of the hotel when the attack began. Mohamed Abdillatif, a friend and colleague of Ahmed, described the pair as inseparable. \u201cHe [Ahmed] was an outgoing, funny guy, charismatic. He was loved by everybody.\u201d Mohamud Yasin, a relative, said he did not know why people claiming to be Muslims were killing other Muslims. \u201cThis is nothing to do with Islam.

In 1970 the University of Bradford created a personal post for her, to improve significantly the quality of programming in research projects. In her spare time she developed a comprehensive set of easy-to-use tools to produce a variety of technical charts. These were made freely available to universities all over the UK. When she became deluged by requests for her software from other countries, she founded the company BUSS Ltd, and the software became known as Simpleplot. Soon the company was making enough money to take on staff. They were the best people imaginable \u2013 completely committed to what Judy was doing. She published a number of academic papers, including one on drawing a smooth curve through an arbitrary set of data points, which became known as Butland\u2019s algorithm. Judy was rude, stubborn, difficult to work with, arrogant and good at her job. People loved her because she was completely transparent. She was good at thinking a problem through and finding a neat and watertight solution. She and I met in 1961 and married in 1964. We were exceedingly well suited. Judy is survived by our son, Philip, and me.",

      "body": "<p>The name of Natasha Galpin will have been in the thoughts of stable staff and racing professionals around Britain on Thursday morning, following the awful news on Wednesday that the 22-year-old had been killed by a fall on Iain Jardine\u2019s gallops. Galpin was riding there on Tuesday morning when her mount suffered a ruptured artery and fell, causing her to sustain injuries from which she did not recover.</p> \n<p>By all accounts, Galpin was a highly accomplished rider in the eventing sphere, in which she won the Scottish and Northern Novice Championships of 2017 at Hendersyde, near Kelso. As well as working for Jardine, she ran her own livery yard and showed her longstanding love of horses through postings online.</p> \n<p>Fatal accidents while riding horses are thankfully rare but the risk is always there, for those at the grassroots of the sport as much as for those in the public eye. Racing\u2019s chief executive, Nick Rust, responded to the tragedy by saying: \u201cWe must never take for granted the bravery and commitment of our workforce. Our sport relies on their dedication in providing first-class care for our horses and we are grateful to them all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Anyone within racing who has been affected by Galpin\u2019s death can contact Racing Welfare at <a href=\"https://racingwelfare.co.uk/\">racingwelfare.co.uk</a> or on 0800 6300 443, a line which is constantly open and calls to which are free.</p> \n<h2>Un De Sceaux misses Clarence House Chase</h2> \n<p>Altior will face just two rivals in Saturday\u2019s big race at Ascot, as Un De Sceaux\u2019s connections are worried about the dry ground and will not ask their horse to attempt a fourth consecutive win. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t going to be soft enough,\u201d one of his owners, Colm O\u2019Connell, has said on Thursday. \u201cThere was no real rain coming and the frost is another problem.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been aiming at this race since the summer, as we wanted to create history. Last year, he was swimming in mud coming round Swinley Bottom, and the year before the race had to be run at Cheltenham because of frost. Yesterday I was walking around without a coat, it\u2019s crazy weather.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s racing and it\u2019s a brave call from Willie [Mullins]. But that\u2019s why in my opinion he is the best in the business, because he makes calls the rest of us don\u2019t have the courage to make. He did the same when Un De Sceaux was a young horse regarding the Champion Hurdle. If he\u2019d run him, I doubt very much we\u2019d still be here talking about him as a Grade One horse as an 11-year-old.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Thursday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>Every racecourse has to have its National and today is Wincanton\u2019s turn. The Somerset National is a full mile short of Aintree version\u2019s distance and there are only nine runners but it\u2019s a race full of interest and I\u2019m getting better odds than I expected about <strong>Wandrin Star (2.25)</strong>, who has drifted to 13-2 from an opening 7-2.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/16/megan-mccann-case-throws-up-suggestion-link-bet365-skrill-horse-racing-sport-betting\">Bet365 obtained details of punter\u2019s account via Skrill in McCann case</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I could be worried about that but instead take the view he was a short price in a competitive race for a horse whose profile doesn\u2019t grip you by the lapels.

      "bodyText": "The name of Natasha Galpin will have been in the thoughts of stable staff and racing professionals around Britain on Thursday morning, following the awful news on Wednesday that the 22-year-old had been killed by a fall on Iain Jardine\u2019s gallops. Galpin was riding there on Tuesday morning when her mount suffered a ruptured artery and fell, causing her to sustain injuries from which she did not recover. By all accounts, Galpin was a highly accomplished rider in the eventing sphere, in which she won the Scottish and Northern Novice Championships of 2017 at Hendersyde, near Kelso. As well as working for Jardine, she ran her own livery yard and showed her longstanding love of horses through postings online. Fatal accidents while riding horses are thankfully rare but the risk is always there, for those at the grassroots of the sport as much as for those in the public eye. Racing\u2019s chief executive, Nick Rust, responded to the tragedy by saying: \u201cWe must never take for granted the bravery and commitment of our workforce. Our sport relies on their dedication in providing first-class care for our horses and we are grateful to them all.\u201d Anyone within racing who has been affected by Galpin\u2019s death can contact Racing Welfare at racingwelfare.co.uk or on 0800 6300 443, a line which is constantly open and calls to which are free. Un De Sceaux misses Clarence House Chase Altior will face just two rivals in Saturday\u2019s big race at Ascot, as Un De Sceaux\u2019s connections are worried about the dry ground and will not ask their horse to attempt a fourth consecutive win. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t going to be soft enough,\u201d one of his owners, Colm O\u2019Connell, has said on Thursday. \u201cThere was no real rain coming and the frost is another problem. \u201cWe\u2019ve been aiming at this race since the summer, as we wanted to create history. Last year, he was swimming in mud coming round Swinley Bottom, and the year before the race had to be run at Cheltenham because of frost. Yesterday I was walking around without a coat, it\u2019s crazy weather. \u201cThat\u2019s racing and it\u2019s a brave call from Willie [Mullins]. But that\u2019s why in my opinion he is the best in the business, because he makes calls the rest of us don\u2019t have the courage to make. He did the same when Un De Sceaux was a young horse regarding the Champion Hurdle. If he\u2019d run him, I doubt very much we\u2019d still be here talking about him as a Grade One horse as an 11-year-old.\u201d Thursday\u2019s best bets Every racecourse has to have its National and today is Wincanton\u2019s turn. The Somerset National is a full mile short of Aintree version\u2019s distance and there are only nine runners but it\u2019s a race full of interest and I\u2019m getting better odds than I expected about Wandrin Star (2.25), who has drifted to 13-2 from an opening 7-2. I could be worried about that but instead take the view he was a short price in a competitive race for a horse whose profile doesn\u2019t grip you by the lapels. But his third to Adrien Du Pont at Kempton over Christmas strikes me as being the best bit of recent form on offer in this contest and I hope he can provide a change of luck for his trainer, Kim Bailey, who had a frustrating weekend. It\u2019s less surprising that no one wants Shillingsworth (12.50), who has two \u2018F\u2019s next to his name, but he was running a big race in his second handicap when he came down at this track last month and 14-1 is too big. I have faith that his jumping will have been worked upon at Colin Tizzard\u2019s yard. There has been some interest in The Jugopolist (3.45), a veteran on a long losing run who nonetheless finds a good opportunity at the end of Rasen\u2019s card. He\u2019s been well out of the handicap in his last two runs but goes off his true mark in a weak contest and might make a fair fist of it at 20-1, down from the opening 50-1. At Newcastle, the market is obsessed with Taceec, who won at Wolverhampton 10 days ago, but 12-1 might be too big about his fellow Irish raider Our Manekineko (4.25), six times a winner at Dundalk who fared well in fourth when tried at Southwell recently. His mark has dropped a long way in recent months and he comes from a yard that has done well with a handicap hurdler in Britain this winter.",

Top story: Corbyn refuses Brexit talks until \u2018no deal\u2019 ruled out The British prime minister Theresa May has survived a vote of no confidence in her Conservative-led government despite the crushing parliamentary defeat of her Brexit deal, leaving the UK in limbo as the planned date of its departure from the EU looms.

What now? The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Peter Walker examines the options for Brexit after the collapse of May\u2019s deal. How the US shutdown affects a small rural town Among the 800,000 federal employees affected by the partial government shutdown are the 300 people who work at a federal prison in Jesup, a small town in southern Georgia. But while they struggle on without pay, Guardian reporter Khushbu Shah finds that others in Jesup are barely aware of the shutdown: a pattern that most likely applies in communities across the US. State of the Union. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has asked Donald Trump to delay his State of the Union address, scheduled for 29 January, or deliver it in writing, saying the agencies responsible for security at the event have been \u201chamstrung\u201d by the ongoing shutdown. US plans new space sensors for missile defence Trump is set to unveil plans for a new generation of space-based sensors designed to identify and shoot down missiles directed at the US from \u201crogue states\u201d such as Iran and North Korea. The plan is part of a major expansion of US missile defence stemming from an administration review \u2013 the first since 2010 \u2013 which the president will present in a speech at the Pentagon on Thursday. It is thought Trump may tie the plans to his recent proposals for the creation of a \u201cspace force\u201d branch of the military. INF pullout. The US will begin pulling out of the Cold War-era Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty with Russia in February, after the failure of talks over a new Russian missile that is suspected of violating the agreement. The plant-focused diet that could save the world An international commission has devised a \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d that could improve the health of billions of people, while also averting a global environmental catastrophe, its creators have said. The diet demands people in North America eat 84% less red meat and six times more beans and lentils. Scientists have said its health benefits would prevent at least 11 million deaths per year, while diminishing our reliance on the industrial agriculture that is devastating the natural environment. On the menu. Dale Berning Sawa takes a closer look at precisely what is allowed in the planetary health diet commissioned by the Norway-based thinktank Eat and the British medical journal the Lancet. Crib sheet Jason Spindler, a businessman and 9/11 survivor, has been named as the American who died during a terror attack in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, on Tuesday, in which at least 20 people were killed. Brazil\u2019s new environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has suspended all partnerships with non-governmental organizations as part of what has been called a \u201cwar on NGOs\u201d waged by the the country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. An Islamic State suicide bomber has killed four Americans in north-eastern Syria, weeks after Trump announced he would pull US troops out of the country claiming the group had been defeated. The first green shoot to sprout on the moon has become the first green shoot to sprout and then die on the moon, after temperatures on board China\u2019s rover, Chang\u2019e 4, plummeted during the lunar night. Must-reads How a deluge of money nearly broke English soccer The English Premier League, the world\u2019s most lucrative soccer league, has seen global expansion, staggering profits and the arrival of several ultra-wealthy club owners. Jonathan Clegg and Joshua Robinson explain how all that money almost tore it apart. Why sick migrant children get the bare minimum of care The recent deaths of two migrant children in US custody made headlines, but as Alexandra Villareal reports from a detention facility in Pennsylvania, parents are used to seeing their sick children go untreated while supposedly under the government\u2019s protection. Teenagers talk sex in acclaimed Netflix comedy Netflix\u2019s new series Sex Education centres on the 16-year-old son of a sex therapist, who counsels his classmates about their sexual issues. It\u2019s a raunchy yet sensitive depiction of how today\u2019s teenagers deal with intimacy and consent, writes Arielle Bernstein. The battle behind Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Hawaii estate Many longtime landowners on the Hawaiian island of Kauai have lost property to wealthy newcomers. So when Mark Zuckerberg got caught up in a land dispute, many locals called him \u201cthe new face of neocolonialism\u201d. Julia Carrie Wong reports from Kauai. Opinion Ethan Lou, a bitcoin creator who covered the energy industry as a journalist, says there are distinct parallels between cryptocurrency and big oil \u2013 and that bitcoin will one day be haunted by its environmental footprint. Bitcoin mining uses as much power as a small country, according to some estimates. Miners compete for limited coins, resulting in an arms race, and that power usage increases constantly and rapidly. Sport in 2014, the UFC president, Dana White, took a strong stance against domestic violence, insisting: \u201cYou don\u2019t bounce back from putting your hands on a woman.\u201d But MMA fighters remain almost four times as likely to face domestic violence charges than NFL players, and the sport doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, as Karim Zidan reports. The professional bull rider Mason Lowe, who was ranked 18th in the world by the sport\u2019s governing organisation, PBR, has died from his injuries after he was thrown from a bull and trampled at a competition in Denver.

      "bodyText": "Ever since Tony Blair rebooted support for nuclear power 13 years ago, British governments have been committed to a new generation of reactors to secure supplies and cut carbon emissions. However, those ambitions have yielded only one project under construction, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, south-west England. The past two months have dealt serious blows to hopes for more, with Toshiba abandoning its plans for Moorside in Cumbria and Hitachi scrapping its Wylfa plant on Anglesey. Wylfa\u2019s death means a second Hitachi plant planned for Oldbury, Gloucestershire, is doomed, too. Together the three projects would have provided 15% of today\u2019s electricity demand. That begs the question: is it time to rethink plans for new nuclear or redouble our nuclear efforts? With the cost of wind, solar and batteries dropping rapidly, have renewables and smart technologies matured enough to fill the gap? What is not in question is the UK\u2019s need for more low-carbon power. Coal and old nuclear plants are shutting in the 2020s and tough climate targets are looming. The Green party and groups such as Greenpeace advocate ditching nuclear in favour of more renewables, energy efficiency and flexibility through imports, batteries and other technologies. However, most energy industry experts think the future involves some new nuclear.

It assumes 13 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity by 2035, implying three further nuclear power stations in addition to the 3.2GW plant at Hinkley. There are now only two firms in the running, which are both involved in plans for two new plants. French state-owned EDF Energy, which is behind Hinkley, wants to start building a carbon copy of that project at Sizewell, on the Suffolk coast, in 2021. Chinese state-owned CGN, meanwhile, is accelerating work on a Chinese-designed reactor for Bradwell in Essex, with the aim of being operational around 2030. Hitachi\u2019s withdrawal suggests the financing model used for Hinkley, and proposed for Wylfa, is dead. The government will likely junk that approach \u2013 of offering a guaranteed price of power for 35 years \u2013 for an alternative known as the \u201cregulated asset base\u201d (RAB) model. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has created a whole division to develop RAB, where a regulator would set a fixed sum for the power station\u2019s costs and fixed returns for the developer, paid for by energy billpayers or taxpayers. Officials are assessing RAB\u2019s viability, with a decision expected this year. But critics say the approach loads the risk of nuclear plant construction delays, such as those seen in France and Finland, on citizens. Returns would also be paid for years before any electricity was generated. EDF Energy backs the RAB model and the Chinese have said they would look at it. The influential government adviser Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, has called it \u201cplausible and preferable\u201d to the Hinkley approach if the UK wants new nuclear. Day believes it could produce the power stations that ministers want. Labour, which is pro-nuclear, has branded the approach risky and reckless but has not put forward an alternative. Given the uncertainty over new nuclear, could the UK manage without it? Maybe. The obvious route is a lot more renewable power capacity than currently planned. The government\u2019s climate change advisers last year hiked up the amount of renewables they expected four years ago, to 45-60% of electricity supplies by 2030, up from 40-55% previously. Both are a big increase from the 33% level today. The Committee on Climate Change said there is evidence the energy system could cope with as much as 60% of supplies coming from intermittent renewables. Filling the 9.2GW-sized hole left by Moorside, Wylfa and Oldbury would require 14GW of offshore wind power, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank. That is equivalent to more than 20 of the world\u2019s biggest offshore windfarm, which consists of 87 turbines. According to Atherton, the only way renewables and storage could plausibly fill the nuclear gap would be to \u201cspend a vast amount of money on saturating the UK with offshore wind\u201d. That could end up with enough turbines in enough different locations to replicate the \u201calways-on\u201d nature of nuclear. Large-scale batteries will help with the variable nature of renewables and are expanding fast. But they will not address the fact that electricity demand is much higher in winter than summer, or solve long windless spells. The other big techno fix in the arsenal of low-carbon energy options is carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, many years of government efforts to kickstart it failed and ministers have switched their focus away from CCS for power stations to CCS for industrial uses. Day said gas power stations with CCS still looked \u201cpretty promising\u201d but significant policy changes would be needed to enable firms to invest in it. Others, however, are more dismissive. Atherton said: \u201cPeople have been working on CCS gas for 20 years and nobody has got within a mile of it yet.

Yes, of course \u2013 but anything to delay the rat-king of tangled tights that emerges from my washing machine every week to be wrestled into submission. </p> <p>I may experience these frustrations more than most women, given that I exclusively wear skirts and dresses (a habit formed at school that these days passes for personal style) \u2013 but I refuse to believe I am alone in them. Tights are not comfortable to wear.

It is possible to tell the difference in quality by feel alone, says Marie-Christine Essmeier, the brand\u2019s senior product manager for women and children. \u201cWith an excellent yarn quality, a tight is more comfortable, easier to wear and to care for.\u201d She says first-time Falke customers often find \u201cthere is no need any more to go for a cheap multipack, because you just feel it on your skin\u201d.</p> <p>Darbyshire says, of Heist, that the difference is like that between \u201ccashmere and carpet\u201d, the yarn reaching 5,000 spirals an inch (a comparable measure to thread count in sheets) versus the bog-standard 300 or 400. The tights come in four styles (nude and 30, 50 and 80 denier) and two waistband heights (low and high).

      "bodyText": "It is about this point in winter that you really begin to tire of wearing tights. Yes, they are a practical necessity \u2013 but they dig in. They fall down. They pill. They tear on first wear. They develop holes at the toes. They become weirdly baggy round the knees \u2013 billowy, even \u2013 while remaining scratchy and unyielding everywhere else. They assume that height and weight observe a strictly linear relationship. They extend either laughably high or uncomfortably not high enough, and, pre-purchase, it is impossible to tell which. And don\u2019t get me started on the gusset. My aversion to tights sees me going without well into November, just to put off the associated rigmarole as long as possible. \u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d people ask me. Yes, of course \u2013 but anything to delay the rat-king of tangled tights that emerges from my washing machine every week to be wrestled into submission. I may experience these frustrations more than most women, given that I exclusively wear skirts and dresses (a habit formed at school that these days passes for personal style) \u2013 but I refuse to believe I am alone in them. Tights are not comfortable to wear. Yet I have been laboriously encasing my legs in poly-blends for as long as I can remember \u2013 easily 20 years, dating back to my winter uniform in primary school. A UK woman spends on average \u00a33,000 on tights in her lifetime, according to an Asda 2016 survey. No one is suggesting that this is the No 1 issue facing women today. But it can be a daily discomfort that men don\u2019t have to put up with, and one that women suffer mostly in silence. And not privileged women, either. Bare legs year-round have already been established \u2013 first, by the US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, in about 2000 \u2013 as signifying a level of wealth that permits you to dress without mind for such mortal concerns as weather. But this means it is not wealthy one-percenters left trying to subtly hoik their tights up, or donning with dread that uncomfortable pair they perversely keep \u201cas a spare\u201d. As with the pocketless women\u2019s clothes, the trouble with tights is not a western-world problem, it\u2019s a working- or middle-class one \u2013 and because it is obviously, objectively low-ranking by any metric of importance, it doesn\u2019t get talked about. But searching Twitter, the public void into which women scream, reveals it to be a recurring struggle: \u201cI have those really annoying tights on that keep falling down [several endless-tears emoji] help\u201d.

Bitcoin is oil.</p> <p>And one day, Bitcoin will become big oil, and all who dabble in it will be reborn as enemies of the environmental movement, seen as plunderers of the planet and the bad guys in the fight against climate change \u2013 just like oil.</p> <p>Bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint will haunt it. Nobody has pointed this out, but it is painfully clear: if we can at all predict an industry\u2019s growth by that of a different one, then oil is Bitcoin\u2019s crystal ball.</p> <p>Most cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin is the first and most valuable, are created by running servers to crunch mathematical puzzles, or \u201cmining\u201d.</p> <p>I have a facility that does that in Canada\u2019s oil capital of Calgary, and its business model is similar to that of the city\u2019s dominant industry. Both profit by generating and selling a product whose price swings with supply and demand. Some in Calgary partake in both.</p> <p>The cryptocurrency world is bigger than mining, just as the vaguely defined big oil is more than those who extract crude. But shares in either industry move in sync with the value of the underlying asset.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/04/bitcoin-after-10-wild-years-what-next-for-cryptocurrencies\">Bitcoin: after 10 wild years, what next for cryptocurrencies?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oil is considered volatile in finance. In the two years after 2014, its price <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/what-triggered-oil-price-plunge-2014-2016-and-why-it-failed-deliver-economic-impetus-eight-charts\">fell more than 70%</a>, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s crash in 2018. Layoffs swept both industries.</p> <p>While oil has tangible uses, most buying and selling is <a href=\"https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/How-Oil-Prices-Are-Held-Hostage-By-Derivatives.html\">done on paper</a> by traders seeking profit, with barrels never changing hands. Long ago, I learned cryptocurrency trading from oil professionals.</p> <p>Then there is the environment. Oil is a big offender. So is Bitcoin. Mining uses as much power as a small country, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bitcoin-electricity-1.4668768\">according to some estimates</a>. Miners compete for limited coins, resulting in an arms race, and that power usage increases constantly and rapidly.</p> <p>In China, which leads Bitcoin mining, 60% of energy comes from coal. Even if mining uses clean power, it carries the opportunity cost of not using said power for greener purposes, such as charging electric cars, which replace fossil-fuel-guzzling vehicles.</p> <p>The two industries are hardly the only environmental offenders, but they make great targets. Oil is currently the biggest one. That is in part because the industry is prominent, represented internationally by organized and high-profile groups. Attacks on it are visible.</p> <p>Environmentalists also see oil as futureless and unnecessary. Cars pollute, but <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/big-oil-neb-transcanada-kinder-morgan-oshawa-1.3650925\">few protest outside a General Motors factory</a> \u2013 one day, its products could all be electric, but oil remains forever oil.</p> <p>Those two points apply well to Bitcoin. \u201cHow to buy Bitcoin\u201d was third-ranked in Google\u2019s how-to searches for 2017. With mergers and acquisitions <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/18/crypto-deal-makers-see-opportunity-in-bitcoins-price-slump.html\">more than doubling in 2018</a>, cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly organized.</p> <p>Big cryptocurrency players have been accused of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/13/much-of-bitcoins-2017-boom-was-market-manipulation-researcher-says.html\">price manipulation</a>, and their conflicts have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/bitcoin-cash-clash-is-costing-billions-with-no-end-in-sight\">rocked the market</a>. Sounds <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/18/proposed-law-would-allow-u-s-to-sue-opec-for-manipulating-oil-market-nopec/\">just like</a> the Saudi Arabia-dominated Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel.</p> <p>Bitcoin, too, has been accused by pundits of being futureless and unnecessary. It does have great potential to revolutionize finance, but a decade after its birth, the everyday person still has no practical use for it.</p> <p>Granted, the total value of all cryptocurrencies is only one-tenth of the over-$1tn worth of oil produced every year. But the International Energy Agency has said global oil demand will <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-iea-demand/global-oil-demand-under-growing-threat-from-electric-cars-cleaner-fuel-idUSKCN1NI005\">peak by 2040</a>, as the world seeks cleaner energy.</p> <p>It is not this day, but a day may come when big oil shrinks or changes, becoming less of a target for environmentalists. Bitcoin is the natural next enemy.</p> <p>The caveat is that cryptocurrency continues to grow. Bitcoin \u2013 both the currency and industry \u2013 has endured worse crashes than 2018\u2019s and emerged stronger. But the past is no map for the future.</p> <p>The battle lines, however, are already being drawn. While academics and the media have long noted mining\u2019s electricity usage, 2018 marked the year environmental and progressive publications started sounding the alarm.</p> <p>Last December, a writer for <a href=\"https://www.treehugger.com/energy-efficiency/good-news-bitcoin-becoming-worthless.html\">the green publication Treehugger</a> gloated over the cryptocurrency\u2019s fall in price: \u201cBitcoin is a colossal waste of energy that will soon be no more. Good riddance.\u201d</p> <p>Canada\u2019s Hut 8 Mining Corp, which says it is the biggest of its kind to be publicly listed, uses so much power that a small town has a contractual right to <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hut8-medicine-hat-bitcoin-mining-1.4834027\">pull the plug</a> should residents not have enough electricity.</p> <p>Abkhazia has announced the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/government-of-abkhazia-cuts-off-power-to-15-cryptocurrency-mining-facilities\">shutdown of 15 mining sites</a> over electricity use concerns. Municipalities in Washington state have <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/rural-washington-county-utility-proposes-increased-electricity-costs-for-crypto-miners\">reined in the activity</a>. Norway has <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/norway-withdraws-electricity-subsidies-from-bitcoin-mining-farms\">excluded miners</a> from power subsidies, with one leftwing politician calling the activity \u201cthe most dirty form of cryptocurrency output\u201d.</p> <p>Miners have a lot to think about \u2013 if not for the planet, then for survival \u2013 for this is a fight that is coming.</p>",

Nobody has pointed this out, but it is painfully clear: if we can at all predict an industry\u2019s growth by that of a different one, then oil is Bitcoin\u2019s crystal ball. Most cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin is the first and most valuable, are created by running servers to crunch mathematical puzzles, or \u201cmining\u201d. I have a facility that does that in Canada\u2019s oil capital of Calgary, and its business model is similar to that of the city\u2019s dominant industry. Both profit by generating and selling a product whose price swings with supply and demand. Some in Calgary partake in both. The cryptocurrency world is bigger than mining, just as the vaguely defined big oil is more than those who extract crude. But shares in either industry move in sync with the value of the underlying asset. Oil is considered volatile in finance. In the two years after 2014, its price fell more than 70%, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s crash in 2018. Layoffs swept both industries. While oil has tangible uses, most buying and selling is done on paper by traders seeking profit, with barrels never changing hands. Long ago, I learned cryptocurrency trading from oil professionals. Then there is the environment. Oil is a big offender. So is Bitcoin. Mining uses as much power as a small country, according to some estimates. Miners compete for limited coins, resulting in an arms race, and that power usage increases constantly and rapidly. In China, which leads Bitcoin mining, 60% of energy comes from coal. Even if mining uses clean power, it carries the opportunity cost of not using said power for greener purposes, such as charging electric cars, which replace fossil-fuel-guzzling vehicles. The two industries are hardly the only environmental offenders, but they make great targets. Oil is currently the biggest one. That is in part because the industry is prominent, represented internationally by organized and high-profile groups. Attacks on it are visible. Environmentalists also see oil as futureless and unnecessary. Cars pollute, but few protest outside a General Motors factory \u2013 one day, its products could all be electric, but oil remains forever oil. Those two points apply well to Bitcoin. \u201cHow to buy Bitcoin\u201d was third-ranked in Google\u2019s how-to searches for 2017. With mergers and acquisitions more than doubling in 2018, cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly organized. Big cryptocurrency players have been accused of price manipulation, and their conflicts have rocked the market. Sounds just like the Saudi Arabia-dominated Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel. Bitcoin, too, has been accused by pundits of being futureless and unnecessary. It does have great potential to revolutionize finance, but a decade after its birth, the everyday person still has no practical use for it. Granted, the total value of all cryptocurrencies is only one-tenth of the over-$1tn worth of oil produced every year. But the International Energy Agency has said global oil demand will peak by 2040, as the world seeks cleaner energy. It is not this day, but a day may come when big oil shrinks or changes, becoming less of a target for environmentalists. Bitcoin is the natural next enemy. The caveat is that cryptocurrency continues to grow. Bitcoin \u2013 both the currency and industry \u2013 has endured worse crashes than 2018\u2019s and emerged stronger. But the past is no map for the future. The battle lines, however, are already being drawn. While academics and the media have long noted mining\u2019s electricity usage, 2018 marked the year environmental and progressive publications started sounding the alarm. Last December, a writer for the green publication Treehugger gloated over the cryptocurrency\u2019s fall in price: \u201cBitcoin is a colossal waste of energy that will soon be no more. Good riddance.\u201d Canada\u2019s Hut 8 Mining Corp, which says it is the biggest of its kind to be publicly listed, uses so much power that a small town has a contractual right to pull the plug should residents not have enough electricity. Abkhazia has announced the shutdown of 15 mining sites over electricity use concerns. Municipalities in Washington state have reined in the activity. Norway has excluded miners from power subsidies, with one leftwing politician calling the activity \u201cthe most dirty form of cryptocurrency output\u201d. Miners have a lot to think about \u2013 if not for the planet, then for survival \u2013 for this is a fight that is coming.",

In 2014 he developed his theory further in <em>La France p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique</em>, or <em>Peripheral France</em>, earning himself national fame (Lib\u00e9ration, the left-leaning daily, devoted its cover and two full pages to the work), unprecedented sales (13,000 copies in a fortnight) of a geography book and an audience with Elys\u00e9e palace advisers. His argument is not especially complicated. France, an ostensibly unified country, is in fact divided in two, between globalised, culturally vibrant cities such as Paris, Bordeaux and Lyon \u2013 where careers, investment and wealth are concentrated \u2013 and all the rest.</p> <p>This vast, depressed, \u201cperipheral\u201d France of small and medium-sized towns, un-chic suburbs, post-industrial wasteland and the all but forgotten countryside now encompasses, he reckons, roughly 60% of the country\u2019s population. Prospects, living standards and public infrastructure have eroded, unemployment, poverty and insecurity have soared, and many feel disconnected from the politics of their big-city peers \u2013 increasingly choosing either to abstain, or embrace the rightwing populist, protectionist, anti-immigration message of Marine Le Pen.</p> <p>Guilluy argued that peripheral France should be seen as a bigger concern than the country\u2019s troubled, immigration-heavy <em>banlieues</em>, traditionally seen as its major social problem, because of the sheer numbers of people struggling to make ends meet and their relative isolation from dynamic economic centres. If nothing changed, he warned, the French Socialist party, the historical defender of the underprivileged, would collapse, Le Pen\u2019s far-right Front National \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/marine-le-pen-rebrands-front-national-in-push-for-support\" title=\"\">now renamed Rassemblement National (National Rally)</a> \u2013 would soar, and France risked a popular uprising the likes of which it had not witnessed in decades, if not centuries.</p> <p>In the 2017 presidential and parliamentary elections the Socialist party, which under Fran\u00e7ois Hollande held the Elys\u00e9e palace, parliament, senate and a majority of France\u2019s regions in 2012, finished fifth in the race for the Elys\u00e9e and crashed from 280 MPs to 30, winning only a humiliating 7.4% of the vote. Le Pen, meanwhile, swept through to the second round run-off of the presidential poll, recording her party\u2019s highest ever score in the process, and managed to return eight MPs \u2013 also a record number under France\u2019s current electoral system \u2013 to the national assembly. Then last year the <em>gilets jaunes</em>, a social-media based insurrection of the underpaid and over-taxed of peripheral France, with no structure, no recognised leader and no party or union backing, erupted on to the streets, demanding everything from better living standards to direct democracy and the demise of the president.</p> <p>Guilluy, whose work is not universally admired in France, particularly by academic geographers and many on the left, seems to have seen it all coming. So there will be considerable interest in his latest work, published in French as <em>Le Cr\u00e9puscule de la France d\u2019en haut</em> in 2016 and now, by Yale. In a further development of his now-familiar argument, he tackles head on \u2013 and with great virulence \u2013 the flip side of <em>La France p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique</em>, those he considers largely responsible for the country\u2019s profound social, economic and political dislocation: hipsters, who the French call<em> bourgeois-boh\u00e8mes</em> or <em>bobos</em>.</p> <p>It is not so much \u201cbig capital\u201d that is to blame for the divide, Guilluy writes, as when \u201cprevious generations of the bourgeoisie lusted nakedly after power or money\u201d, but the \u201claid-back, unostentatious dominance \u2026 without hatred or violence\u201d of the \u201cbobo-ised upper classes\u201d in what he calls the \u201cnew citadels\u201d.

Because hipsters are also hypocrites, Guilluy argues: they denounce globalisation, but never challenge it because it serves them so well; they preach diversity, but send their children to private schools; they love the \u201cauthenticity\u201d of living in working-class areas, but contribute to their destruction through rising property prices.</p> <p>The revolution is coming, he warns: \u201cThe existing order will finally break down not as the result of some decisive event, but as the result of a slow process of social and cultural disaffiliation of the working class.\u201d It has already brought us Brexit in Britain and Trump in the US; \u201ca new form of class conflict\u201d is upon us, and a \u201cmodern slave rebellion\u201d is on its way.</p> <p>It\u2019s angry, compelling stuff, if all perhaps a bit too seamless.

Usually, the illnesses have been minor. But sometimes, when common problems have gone ignored or untreated, they have spiraled to become something more.</p> <p>\u201cIn my experience, [the staff] do the bare minimum and they don\u2019t want to do more than that unless it becomes a situation where they have to do it,\u201d Kline said. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t address things when there are minor issues, it allows them to become more serious issues.\u201d</p> <p>One Berks resident wrote to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in late 2015 that though her son\u2019s skin disease had spread to his genitals and bled when scratched, the clinical team had not provided him with medication.In May 2016, a three-year-old boy who had been suffering from fevers and loss of appetite for months was finally diagnosed with an intestinal parasitism after his mother found a worm in his diaper.</p> <p>Berks did not respond to a request for comment.

      "bodyText": "At the Berks Family Residential Center, an immigrant detention facility in Leesport, Pennsylvania, advocates and former detainees say it\u2019s normal for children held there to have health problems. One mother, who asked to use her middle name Arely, told the Guardian that children often had fevers or vomited when she was detained at Berks. She said she watched helplessly as her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter threw up blood for three days. Another woman \u2013 who asked to be referred to only by her middle name Fernanda because she still fears her antagonists in her home country \u2013 remembered children with the flu and respiratory illnesses, and how the on-site medical professionals would take their temperatures but never give out medicine. When Fernanda\u2019s own daughter had fever, she had to go to the hospital just to get Tylenol, she said. Since attorney Jacquelyn Kline began representing immigrant families detained at Berks in the summer of 2014, she said the majority of her clients have gotten sick. Usually, the illnesses have been minor. But sometimes, when common problems have gone ignored or untreated, they have spiraled to become something more. \u201cIn my experience, [the staff] do the bare minimum and they don\u2019t want to do more than that unless it becomes a situation where they have to do it,\u201d Kline said. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t address things when there are minor issues, it allows them to become more serious issues.\u201d One Berks resident wrote to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in late 2015 that though her son\u2019s skin disease had spread to his genitals and bled when scratched, the clinical team had not provided him with medication.In May 2016, a three-year-old boy who had been suffering from fevers and loss of appetite for months was finally diagnosed with an intestinal parasitism after his mother found a worm in his diaper. Berks did not respond to a request for comment. Ice\u2019s public affairs officers are out-of-office for the duration of the government shutdown, according to an automated email from the Pennsylvania officer\u2019s account. Ice confirmed that he is currently furloughed. The fact that serious medical conditions occur and go untreated for days, weeks or months while immigrant children are under the government\u2019s protection may come as a surprise to many. But advocates who have been on the ground at detention facilities under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are well acquainted with stories such as these that point to a wider trend. \u201cI am surprised that more children or parents have not died while in DHS custody, given the systemic failure on the part of the government to provide medical services,\u201d said Kathryn Shepherd, national advocacy counsel for the Immigration Justice Campaign at the American Immigration Council. In late 2018, the deaths of two migrant children while in US custody near the southern border made national headlines and refocused attention on immigrant children who are in the country illegally. First, seven-year-old Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquin died from cardiac arrest associated with dehydration on 8 December after being apprehended by DHS\u2019s Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Then, on Christmas Eve, eight-year-old Felipe G\u00f3mez Alonzo became the second child in a matter of weeks to succumb to illness after being taken into custody by CBP. It was later determined that he had the flu. At first glance, the deaths appeared an exceptional phenomenon. Homeland security secretary Kirstjen M Nielsen has said that before last December, an immigrant child had not died in CBP custody in more than a decade. But for those familiar with the ways in which DHS holds immigrant families beyond the border through Ice, the deaths felt part of a long medical history of neglect, misdiagnoses and close calls associated with undocumented children. This history dates to at least 2014, when the department ramped up mass incarceration of immigrant families under President Barack Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is a new problem,\u201d said Shepherd. \u201cI think that this is something that\u2019s been a problem for a long time.\u201d Before accepting her current post, Shepherd served as managing attorney for a pro-bono project representing asylum-seeking families at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas.

      "body": "<p>A pile of menus sat, untouched, at a table filled with Jesup Federal Correctional Institution employees at Alec\u2019s Sports Bar. A waitress, who wandered over occasionally to fill a round of water glasses lined with lemon wedges, seemed to intuitively know not to ask if anyone needs a soft drink or a plate of chicken fingers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not usually a water drinker,\u201d Hannah Gariepy, a teacher \u2013 and eight-year employee \u2013 of the federal prison pointed out, \u201cBut I was thinking, what\u2019s free?\u201d Her colleagues erupted in laughter, all of them agreeing. One has a salad in her car. Another ate before coming to the bar.</p> <p>Jesup in southern Georgia feels like an archetypical blueprint of a small American southern town, dotted with a Dollar Store and a Piggly Wiggly grocery store. Everyone knows everyone, the same few family names have shuffled in and out of local politics, and most days, its clean streets look deserted.</p> <p>But now this sense of desertion is different. For Jesup, like many other communities across America, is in the grip of a partial government shutdown affecting 800,000 American workers. And Jesup will feel the hit eventually as a large chunk of its economy relies on the federal prison \u2013 one of the town\u2019s major employers.</p> <p>In one of the town\u2019s bars, colleagues from the federal prison \u2013 which employs more than 300 people in Jesup and the surrounding Wayne county \u2013 fretted over cancelled doctor\u2019s visits and now impossible requests from children to buy video games. These workers are all now working without pay.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not rich,\u201d someone said, as colleagues continued to join the group. But sometimes it seems they are alone in their ever-expanding worries as the now-longest ever shutdown grinds on.</p> <p>Yet non-federal workers in the town say they have yet to feel the full bite of their fellow citizens\u2019 hardship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c81134b9c890da4cba6abea41eb9bd1312f0f49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c81134b9c890da4cba6abea41eb9bd1312f0f49/0_182_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Gariepy sips glass after glass of water at Alec\u2019s Sports Bar in Jesup, Georgia.

Just yesterday, she spent $100 on groceries. \u201cThe milk was six bucks,\u201d she grimaced, admitting she has just $278 left in her bank account.</p> <p>But so far, outside those directly affected federal workers and their families, many in Jesup say the shutdown remains at a distance. Some have not even heard of it at all.</p> <p>\u201cWe really haven\u2019t noticed anything, as far as an impact [of the shutdown] on the citizens,\u201d the city manager, Mike Deal, said from behind an enormous wooden desk strewn in his office on tree-lined West Cherry Street, seemingly the town\u2019s main road.</p> <p>Only one person has called in this morning, thinking if it went any longer he might be late on his water bill, Deal said. But we\u2019ll work with him if they\u2019ve been good paying customers, he added quickly. It\u2019s the first phone call his office has received from a prison employee.</p> <p>A few blocks over, a sign in English, Spanish, German and Italian welcomes customers to Cafe Euro. Christian rock blasted over the speakers. A line formed for sugar-laden smoothies and frappes. One of the employees behind the counter said she hasn\u2019t heard about the shutdown. I think it\u2019s fine, she mused, because no one is talking about it. In Jesup, she said, that\u2019s a big indicator if something is important or not.</p> <p>Other residents agreed. A cashier at the Piggly Wiggly did not know what the federal shutdown was exactly. Neither did an incoming shopper. Next door, at Surcheros, a Tex-Mex fast-food restaurant many of the prison employees say they frequent, noticed a slow lunch rush on the first unpaid payday for the prison employees. Yera Moye, who is ringing up customers said she didn\u2019t know exactly why. She also had not heard about the shutdown.</p> <p>The county administrator tried to put the implication of the shutdown in Wayne county\u2019s perspective. \u201cMy county, if you look at it, is very rural,\u201d Ed Jeffords explained, pointing to a map across from his desk. A lot of people leave the county for work daily, or sometimes, permanently. He suggests the economy has needed revitalizing for years. For example, he added: \u201cMy kids can\u2019t afford the lifestyle we gave them without leaving town.\u201d His son plans to move to Orlando.</p> <p>Just outside Jeffords\u2019 office, shuttered storefronts and near-empty stores on the town\u2019s main drag lay empty as the evidence of the flagging economy in Jesup \u2013 a trend that started long before the shutdown hit the town\u2019s main employer. The same group of teens circle three blocks for two hours one afternoon.

      "bodyText": "A pile of menus sat, untouched, at a table filled with Jesup Federal Correctional Institution employees at Alec\u2019s Sports Bar. A waitress, who wandered over occasionally to fill a round of water glasses lined with lemon wedges, seemed to intuitively know not to ask if anyone needs a soft drink or a plate of chicken fingers. \u201cI\u2019m not usually a water drinker,\u201d Hannah Gariepy, a teacher \u2013 and eight-year employee \u2013 of the federal prison pointed out, \u201cBut I was thinking, what\u2019s free?\u201d Her colleagues erupted in laughter, all of them agreeing. One has a salad in her car. Another ate before coming to the bar. Jesup in southern Georgia feels like an archetypical blueprint of a small American southern town, dotted with a Dollar Store and a Piggly Wiggly grocery store. Everyone knows everyone, the same few family names have shuffled in and out of local politics, and most days, its clean streets look deserted. But now this sense of desertion is different. For Jesup, like many other communities across America, is in the grip of a partial government shutdown affecting 800,000 American workers. And Jesup will feel the hit eventually as a large chunk of its economy relies on the federal prison \u2013 one of the town\u2019s major employers. In one of the town\u2019s bars, colleagues from the federal prison \u2013 which employs more than 300 people in Jesup and the surrounding Wayne county \u2013 fretted over cancelled doctor\u2019s visits and now impossible requests from children to buy video games. These workers are all now working without pay. \u201cWe\u2019re not rich,\u201d someone said, as colleagues continued to join the group. But sometimes it seems they are alone in their ever-expanding worries as the now-longest ever shutdown grinds on. Yet non-federal workers in the town say they have yet to feel the full bite of their fellow citizens\u2019 hardship. \u201cI hope they budgeted,\u201d the owner of Alec\u2019s Sports Bar, who goes by his initials AB, shrugged after the group left his all-wood bar, lined with televisions turned to Fox News and sports. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to tell,\u201d he added, when asked if Jesup\u2019s population of 9,754, a population that has dropped nearly 5% since 2010, has felt the effects of the unpaid employees not spending any money. The town will feel it eventually, Melvina Barnes, a reintegration and re-entry officer at the prison who lives in Jesup, concluded. \u201cBefore the shutdown, I ate out every day in Jesup,\u201d she added, sitting across from Gariepy. Just yesterday, she spent $100 on groceries. \u201cThe milk was six bucks,\u201d she grimaced, admitting she has just $278 left in her bank account. But so far, outside those directly affected federal workers and their families, many in Jesup say the shutdown remains at a distance. Some have not even heard of it at all. \u201cWe really haven\u2019t noticed anything, as far as an impact [of the shutdown] on the citizens,\u201d the city manager, Mike Deal, said from behind an enormous wooden desk strewn in his office on tree-lined West Cherry Street, seemingly the town\u2019s main road. Only one person has called in this morning, thinking if it went any longer he might be late on his water bill, Deal said. But we\u2019ll work with him if they\u2019ve been good paying customers, he added quickly. It\u2019s the first phone call his office has received from a prison employee. A few blocks over, a sign in English, Spanish, German and Italian welcomes customers to Cafe Euro. Christian rock blasted over the speakers. A line formed for sugar-laden smoothies and frappes. One of the employees behind the counter said she hasn\u2019t heard about the shutdown. I think it\u2019s fine, she mused, because no one is talking about it. In Jesup, she said, that\u2019s a big indicator if something is important or not. Other residents agreed. A cashier at the Piggly Wiggly did not know what the federal shutdown was exactly. Neither did an incoming shopper. Next door, at Surcheros, a Tex-Mex fast-food restaurant many of the prison employees say they frequent, noticed a slow lunch rush on the first unpaid payday for the prison employees. Yera Moye, who is ringing up customers said she didn\u2019t know exactly why. She also had not heard about the shutdown. The county administrator tried to put the implication of the shutdown in Wayne county\u2019s perspective. \u201cMy county, if you look at it, is very rural,\u201d Ed Jeffords explained, pointing to a map across from his desk. A lot of people leave the county for work daily, or sometimes, permanently. He suggests the economy has needed revitalizing for years. For example, he added: \u201cMy kids can\u2019t afford the lifestyle we gave them without leaving town.\u201d His son plans to move to Orlando. Just outside Jeffords\u2019 office, shuttered storefronts and near-empty stores on the town\u2019s main drag lay empty as the evidence of the flagging economy in Jesup \u2013 a trend that started long before the shutdown hit the town\u2019s main employer. The same group of teens circle three blocks for two hours one afternoon. The Strand dinner-movie theatre, showing Aquaman, The Mule and Vice, sees a few stragglers going in and out for tickets one afternoon. It\u2019s a well-known fact that a few families in town own the majority of the wealth, Hank Tucker, a senior correctional officer and the president of the prison employees\u2019 union said. Right now, he and his colleagues spend their dwindling savings on gas money to make their commute to the prison. That can\u2019t last, though. \u201cIn two weeks, federal employees won\u2019t be able to afford to show up to work because they won\u2019t be able to pay for the gas to drive there,\u201d Tucker said. Detta Dyal, who owns Shear Designs around the corner from where the group has convened, attends to her lone customer. As she brushed out her clients\u2019 blond hair, she shrugged when talking about the shutdown. One of her employees\u2019 husbands works at the prison, she says, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine, she added. \u201cI watch Fox News so I know about the shutdown,\u201d she began, continuing: \u201cI don\u2019t know the impact on her but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine because I saw on the news people are getting extensions of mortgage payments and kids are getting free lunches.\u201d The lack of understanding in the wider community hurts those workers laboring for nothing. \u201cFor the public to not know, to not care, to be so completely oblivious, to think we\u2019re undeserving, that our very livelihoods, that our children that go to school with their children, that our family members that go to church with their families, are somehow less deserving for the service that we do is like a slap in the face,\u201d Gariepy spat out, exhausted from the multiple 16-hour days she has worked in recent weeks, even during the shutdown. But she thinks her fellow citizens will notice their plight soon enough as the shutdown rolls on with little end in sight. \u201cTwo [more] weeks will absolutely crush federal employees,\u201d she said, as the waitress refilled her water glass.",

      "bodyText": "Rescuers in southern Spain are racing to reach a toddler who fell down a borehole more than 100 metres deep four days ago. Two-year-old Julen Rosell\u00f3 had gone for a picnic with his family in the countryside on Sunday when he fell down the 25cm-wide hole in Total\u00e1n, near M\u00e1laga. He has not been seen or heard from since the fall, but relatives and rescuers are desperately hoping he is still alive. Engineers and specialist miners are lining the borehole to prevent it from collapsing and have sunk parallel and horizontal shafts into the hillside to try to locate Julen. For now, they are focusing on the vertical shaft as the quickest way to gain access. Juan L\u00f3pez Escobar, a representative of M\u00e1laga\u2019s mining college, told reporters it could take two or three more days to reach Julen. \u201cUnder normal conditions, you\u2019d do a planned project using samples and soundings, and the work would take a month,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in this case, the urgency of the rescue means a different timetable.\u201d L\u00f3pez Escobar said talking about timeframes was unhelpful. \u201cWe\u2019re working to do it as soon as possible because of the health of the child.\u201d Guardia Civil police officers and firefighters are being assisted by a team of mine rescue experts from Asturias and members of the Swedish rescue firm that helped find the 33 Chilean miners who were trapped underground for 69 days in 2010. On Wednesday, regional authorities said a hair sample had been recovered from deep inside the shaft that matched Julen\u2019s DNA. Two days earlier, rescuers exploring the hole found the cup and packet of sweets he was holding when he disappeared. Efforts to get to the toddler have been thwarted by a compacted plug of hard soil under which he could be trapped. The child\u2019s father, Jos\u00e9 Rosell\u00f3, said he had rushed to the hole as soon as he heard him cry out. \u201cI pushed the stones away and heard my son crying,\u201d he told the local Sur newspaper. \u201cMy son is down there \u2013 don\u2019t let anyone try to cast doubt on that.

      "body": "<p>At what point did Ben Howard decide It\u2019s All About the Music? Probably at some point early in his career \u2013 in 2012 or 2013, perhaps, when the amiable single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWlKZ6C7cDY\">Only Love</a> seemed to be everywhere, and he was typecast in the thankless role of Devonian-surfer-who-sings-folksy-love-songs. Maybe the 329th time he heard it playing over the PA in a motorway service station stiffened his resolve to be less like Tom Odell and more like Thom Yorke.</p> <p>Certainly, there is a hefty dose of It\u2019s All About the Music at the first of four big sold-out London shows. Howard\u2019s microphone is set up as part of his nine-piece band, well away from the people who\u2019ve paid to see him. He must be 15 feet from the lip of the stage, and he never moves closer to the crowd. It\u2019s not about him, dammit. He barely talks to the crowd: four times in an hour and three of those are brief thanks, the other a mutter that one of his pedals isn\u2019t working properly.</p> <p>There\u2019s not a chance of hearing Only Love; instead we get the whole of last year\u2019s Noonday Dream album \u2013 heavy on lengthy atmospheric interludes \u2013 and a scant handful of older songs in the encore. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAnbP5ijyQs\">Towing the Line</a> is played in that traditional posture of the man who has a lofty disdain for the bagatelles of mere entertainment: sitting on a low stool, facing away from the audience. He dresses as if he\u2019s here to borrow some sugar, no intention of staying, in what appears from a distance to be a blue mac. This is not a show for those in search of breathtaking charisma; to paraphrase the old joke about Clement Attlee: \u201cAn empty tour bus pulled up, and Ben Howard alighted.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a0764370b94da89d0800f08df29e3970dad266ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0764370b94da89d0800f08df29e3970dad266ca/0_0_7283_4899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oddly chilly ...

Ben Howard and band.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Venla Shalin/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It feels, in fact, as if it\u2019s rather too much About the Music. The songs on Noonday Dream meander, and they meander even more live: the opening <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzcV8HXE_EI\">Nica Libres at Dusk</a>, a leisurely six and a half minutes on record, pushes on to 10 minutes, with both an extended ambient opening and an extended ambient ending. And those who crave extended openings and endings get treat after treat tonight. It\u2019s noticeable that the only cheer of recognition in the main set comes with a brief and heavily distorted run through the chorus of Cat Stevens\u2019 Wild World; only when the encore brings older songs do the cheers return, at recognition of the opening chords.</p> <p>At times, what Howard is grasping towards takes shape through the ambient fog: when acoustic and slide guitars combine on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bvabjcjyXw\">What the Moon Does</a>, or when the organ swells on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGz76aD2j0w\">Murmurations</a>, those textures overlaid on restless drum patterns call to mind some cross between early 70s Pink Floyd and Four Tet, and one thinks there is fertile ground to be uncovered. But too often the textures are allowed to dominate at the expense of the song: where the heart of the songs should be, there\u2019s a shimmer of treated guitar instead of something concrete. It\u2019s like walking round a perfectly designed house, full of wonderful furniture and beautiful art, then realising they forgot to put in a kitchen.</p> <p>The result is a show that feels oddly chilly and joyless. It is almost as if Howard doesn\u2019t want to open himself up, something that comes through, too, in his startlingly blank interviews. But the great artists, the ones who are loved across generations, do offer themselves to the audience. They know it\u2019s never All About the Music.</p>",

Certainly, there is a hefty dose of It\u2019s All About the Music at the first of four big sold-out London shows. Howard\u2019s microphone is set up as part of his nine-piece band, well away from the people who\u2019ve paid to see him. He must be 15 feet from the lip of the stage, and he never moves closer to the crowd. It\u2019s not about him, dammit. He barely talks to the crowd: four times in an hour and three of those are brief thanks, the other a mutter that one of his pedals isn\u2019t working properly. There\u2019s not a chance of hearing Only Love; instead we get the whole of last year\u2019s Noonday Dream album \u2013 heavy on lengthy atmospheric interludes \u2013 and a scant handful of older songs in the encore. Towing the Line is played in that traditional posture of the man who has a lofty disdain for the bagatelles of mere entertainment: sitting on a low stool, facing away from the audience. He dresses as if he\u2019s here to borrow some sugar, no intention of staying, in what appears from a distance to be a blue mac. This is not a show for those in search of breathtaking charisma; to paraphrase the old joke about Clement Attlee: \u201cAn empty tour bus pulled up, and Ben Howard alighted.\u201d It feels, in fact, as if it\u2019s rather too much About the Music. The songs on Noonday Dream meander, and they meander even more live: the opening Nica Libres at Dusk, a leisurely six and a half minutes on record, pushes on to 10 minutes, with both an extended ambient opening and an extended ambient ending. And those who crave extended openings and endings get treat after treat tonight. It\u2019s noticeable that the only cheer of recognition in the main set comes with a brief and heavily distorted run through the chorus of Cat Stevens\u2019 Wild World; only when the encore brings older songs do the cheers return, at recognition of the opening chords. At times, what Howard is grasping towards takes shape through the ambient fog: when acoustic and slide guitars combine on What the Moon Does, or when the organ swells on Murmurations, those textures overlaid on restless drum patterns call to mind some cross between early 70s Pink Floyd and Four Tet, and one thinks there is fertile ground to be uncovered. But too often the textures are allowed to dominate at the expense of the song: where the heart of the songs should be, there\u2019s a shimmer of treated guitar instead of something concrete. It\u2019s like walking round a perfectly designed house, full of wonderful furniture and beautiful art, then realising they forgot to put in a kitchen. The result is a show that feels oddly chilly and joyless. It is almost as if Howard doesn\u2019t want to open himself up, something that comes through, too, in his startlingly blank interviews. But the great artists, the ones who are loved across generations, do offer themselves to the audience. They know it\u2019s never All About the Music.",

Sergio Ag\u00fcero is another South American footballer whose body moves better on a pitch than in time to music. Here he is self consciously fronting a song about himself by the band Los Leales. Youri Djorkaeff takes his dancing far too seriously in this R&amp;B effort. And J\u00fcrgen Klopp did a bit of dad-dancing recently too. We\u2019ve seen worse. 3) US gymnast Shannon Hortman-Evans performed a brilliant floor routine at the University of Utah to the tune of the Super Mario Bros theme music. It worked a treat \u2013 she scored 9.900. But if it\u2019s a perfect 10 you\u2019re looking for, watch this by Katelyn Ohashi. Wow! And back to Mario for a moment: there was another unexpected appearance by the popular video games characters when a helicopter flew over Kansas City Royals\u2019 Kauffman Stadium and spied Mario Kart being played on the big screen by someone. 4) \u201cAnd it\u2019s good!\u201d Syracuse\u2019s Elijah Hughes nails a full court buzzer-beater. 5) Morton could probably have defended this better to be honest. Meanwhile, Charlie Kelman had quite the debut for Southend, scoring from inside his own half, as you do. 6) \u201cI have to be a little careful today because there\u2019s quite a bit of traffic on the road.\u201d Health and safety didn\u2019t appear to be much of an issue at Le Mans in 1956, when Mike Hawthorne created this on-board film of a lap round the famous course in his D-Type Jaguar, which shows motorbikes riding towards him. Our favourites from below the line last week 1) A creative free-kick routine from Manchester United Women. 2) A failed catch in the Big Bash results in a big bash to the face. 3) When Liverpool won the treble \u2026 ah \u2026 OK, a treble.

      "bodyText": "The Malaysian education ministry has ordered the removal of a page from a school textbook which warned young girls that having sex would bring shame on their families and urged them to \u201cprotect the modesty of their genitals\u201d. An illustration in the textbook, issued to all eight- and nine-year-olds in Malaysia, instructed girls to get changed behind closed doors, wear clothes that covered up their bodies, and not to visit quiet places alone. Using the example of a young girl called Amira, the page in the textbook, titled \u201csaving modesty\u201d, said the implications of young girls compromising their \u201cmodesty\u201d included bringing shame and emotional distress on themselves, being ostracised by friends and becoming a source of shame for their families. Campaign groups said the textbook perpetuated a culture of victim-blaming for sexual assault at an early age. \u201cThe infographic sexualises nine-year-old girls, places the burden on them to avoid sexual assault and shames those who experience sexual assault,\u201d said Yu Ren Chung, the advocacy manager of Women\u2019s Aid Organisation, who called for sex education and consent to be taught in Malaysian classrooms. After a picture of the page went viral, Malaysia\u2019s education minister, Teo Nie Cheng, described the illustration as sexist. \u201cWe have decided to replace that particular page,\u201d Teo said, adding that \u201ca replacement page will be sent to all the schools involved starting from 29 January\u201d. Teo said the incident had prompted a wider review of both the national curriculum and the contents of textbooks distributed in schools by the government. \u201cThis shows the lack of awareness amongst our society when it comes to sex education, which we did not take seriously in the past,\u201d said Teo. She said she would be using the incident as a platform to examine the lack of sex education in Malaysian schools, following a similar pledge by the ministry of women, family and community development last week, although she emphasised it could take time in the country\u2019s conservative society. \u201cSex education has always been a taboo in Malaysia,\u201d added Teo. \u201cBut I believe with affirmative action and engagement with experts and NGOs we will be able to see changes.\u201d",

To add to the controversy, Hardy is scheduled to compete on the same fight card as Rachel Ostovich, who suffered a broken orbital bone during an alleged attack by her husband.

The woman testified that Hardy <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/02/09/domestic-violence-charges-against-panthers-hardy-dismissed/23116685/\">threw her on a futon filled with guns and placed his hands on her throat</a>. \u201cHe looked me in my eyes and he told me he was going to kill me,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so scared I wanted to die.

Hardy <a href=\"https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/11/9/16630066/video-disgraced-ex-nfl-star-greg-hardy-wins-mma-debut-ufc-dana-white-should-keep-an-eye-on-him\">appealed the sentence and managed to get the charges expunged from his record</a> in 2015 after his ex-girlfriend failed to appear at court to give testimony. It was later reported she had <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/02/09/domestic-violence-charges-against-panthers-hardy-dismissed/23116685/\">settled a civil suit with Hardy</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/12/greg-hardy-mma-ufc-domestic-violence-allegations\">Greg Hardy fight highlights MMA's troubling history of violence outside the octagon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year, Kim A Gandy, CEO and president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/12/greg-hardy-mma-ufc-domestic-violence-allegations\">spoke to the Guardian about Hardy\u2019s case</a>. Gandy acknowledged that the charges were ultimately dropped but said that\u2019s \u201cnot the same as not having done it,\u201d adding that abusers who do not reckon with what they\u2019ve done are less likely to be rehabilitated in the long run. \u201cSomeone truly sorry who seeks to help and genuinely make amends is very different from a person who commits extraordinary violence and not only takes no responsibility for it but takes position that the person just deserved it.\u201d</p> <p>At the time of the incident, Hardy was playing for the Carolina Panthers. He later signed on with the Dallas Cowboys but was later <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/04/22/nfl-suspends-greg-hardy-10-games/\">given a 10-game suspension</a> by the NFL in relation to the alleged assault. He returned later that year but found himself out of work when the Cowboys opted not to re-sign him. Seemingly shunned from football, Hardy turned his attention to MMA.</p> <p>Starting in 2017, Hardy compiled a 3-0 amateur record in fights that lasted a combined two minutes and 22 seconds. He followed those wins with his first professional victory, and signed a developmental deal with the UFC to compete on Dana White\u2019s Tuesday Night Contender Series. After two consecutive knockout wins on the show, the UFC was ready to announce Hardy\u2019s official debut.</p> <p>The UFC\u2019s willingness to promote Hardy on a variety of their platforms, including their highly anticipated debut on ESPN+, highlights the gaping inconsistencies in their domestic violence policies. In the wake of NFL running back Ray Rice assaulting his fianc\u00e9e in 2014, UFC president Dana White took a <a href=\"http://www.mmafighting.com/2014/9/11/6134395/morning-report-ufc-ray-rice-dana-white-roger-goodell-ronda-rousey-joe-rogan-mma-news?_ga=2.28469436.1049245808.1543861555-2118265059.1543861555\">strong stance against domestic violence</a>: \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that you never bounce back from and that\u2019s putting your hands on a woman.

Speaking at the 2014 NeuLion Sports Media &amp; Technology Conference, White <a href=\"http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2014/11/06/SMT-Conference/Dana-White.aspx\">revealed </a>that the UFC \u201cscreens people for The Ultimate Fighter, and if you\u2019ve ever had a domestic violence, you can\u2019t get on. Since this whole thing happened [with Ray Rice], we\u2019re beefing up our policies with putting your hands on a woman. Of course, the way we always react is morally first then the business second.\u201d</p> <p>But the UFC\u2019s actual actions tell an entirely different tale. Will Chope was <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mma-cagewriter/will-chope-released-by-ufc-because-of-2009-assault-conviction-175139913.html\">released by the promotion</a> after news surfaced regarding a 2009 domestic assault conviction. Thiago Silva, who <a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/sports/ufc-fighter-thiago-silva-held-in-florida-jail-accused-of-threatening-wife-with-gun\">threatened his estranged wife with a gun</a> and violated a temporary protection order, was released from the promotion but re-signed again after the charges were dropped. He was once again <a href=\"https://www.mmafighting.com/2014/9/19/6567581/thiago-silva-released-again-from-the-ufc\">released two weeks later</a> after the UFC received audio and video evidence posted by Silva\u2019s ex-wife. But many other have been kept on by the promotion, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewbrennan/2016/12/28/mmas-new-years-resolution-stop-facilitating-domestic-abuse/#3669671a5a59\">despite allegations of domestic or sexual violence</a>. Most recently, Abdul Razak Alhassan was <a href=\"https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/fort-worth/article218996440.html\">indicted for the alleged rape of two women in March 2018</a>. The UFC is yet to comment on Alhassan\u2019s case.</p> <p>By December 2018, White\u2019s stance on domestic violence had dramatically changed from his zero-tolerance approach. When asked about the UFC\u2019s decision to place Hardy on the same fight card as Ostovich, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espnw/sports/article/25471068/dana-white-says-ufc-consulted-rachael-ostovich-booking-greg-hardy-event\">White doubled down on the promotion\u2019s baffling decision</a>: \u201cI called Rachael Ostovich and talked to her, walked her through the situation,\u201d White said. \u201cHer take was, \u2018His story isn\u2019t my story. Everybody\u2019s story is different. I believe in second chances. I have no problem fighting on the same card as this guy.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have anything to do with Rachael Ostovich, so she was totally cool with it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/dec/30/ufc-232-chaos-jones-gustafsson-nunes-cyborg\">The UFC is persevering as it always has: by leaning into the chaos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ostovich has since shared her thoughts on Greg Hardy in an <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/25708020/rachael-ostovich-says-comfortable-greg-hardy-competing-same-ufc-card\">interview with ESPN</a>, stating that believes in \u201csecond chances.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s making a turnaround,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope the same can happen to my husband and anyone else who has made a wrong choice.\u201d</p> <p>While Ostovich is willing to excuse Hardy, he remains a public relations concern and a controversial figure for the UFC. Ostovich\u2019s comments do not deter from the seriousness of Hardy\u2019s alleged actions and should not be misconstrued as an exoneration.</p> <p>And if White believes in second chances for Hardy, he doesn\u2019t seem keen to talk about it in any depth. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/23539181/ufc-signing-greg-hardy-major-mistake\">Despite the backlash over Hardy</a>, the UFC added fuel to the fire when it told reporters at a press conference in December \u2014 which took place the same day that the Hardy fight news broke \u2014 that they were only allowed to ask questions about the fighters competing at the upcoming UFC 231. In response to the reports, the Mixed Martial Arts Journalist Association released a statement on its website confirming that several of its members felt as though they could not ask questions freely. When journalists finally came round to asking White about the UFC\u2019s position on Hardy, the UFC boss blamed the media for stirring up controversy.</p> <p>\u201cI already covered this. I\u2019m not playing this bullshit with you guys. [Hardy] is on the UFC roster. Period. End of story,\u201d White <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhAfgeRYgYY\">said</a>. \u201cListen, you guys want to be sensitive about shit? Anyone can be sensitive about anything. You can make an issue about everything.\u201d</p> <p>The problem with White\u2019s statement is that domestic violence is a very real issue in mixed martial arts. According to <a href=\"https://www.mmafighting.com/2015/7/21/9012669/hbo-real-sports-unearths-disturbing-rate-of-domestic-violence-in-mma\">a study of arrest records since 2003 by HBO Real Sports</a>, MMA fighters have a domestic violence arrest rate (750 per 100,000) more than double the general US population (360 per 100,000) and far ahead of NFL players (210 per 100,000), who are often depicted as being at the heart of the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an attempt to stifle journalists from asking further questions about Hardy, the promotion shielded the fighter from fight-week media obligations.

It was later reported she had settled a civil suit with Hardy. Last year, Kim A Gandy, CEO and president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence spoke to the Guardian about Hardy\u2019s case. Gandy acknowledged that the charges were ultimately dropped but said that\u2019s \u201cnot the same as not having done it,\u201d adding that abusers who do not reckon with what they\u2019ve done are less likely to be rehabilitated in the long run. \u201cSomeone truly sorry who seeks to help and genuinely make amends is very different from a person who commits extraordinary violence and not only takes no responsibility for it but takes position that the person just deserved it.\u201d At the time of the incident, Hardy was playing for the Carolina Panthers. He later signed on with the Dallas Cowboys but was later given a 10-game suspension by the NFL in relation to the alleged assault. He returned later that year but found himself out of work when the Cowboys opted not to re-sign him. Seemingly shunned from football, Hardy turned his attention to MMA. Starting in 2017, Hardy compiled a 3-0 amateur record in fights that lasted a combined two minutes and 22 seconds. He followed those wins with his first professional victory, and signed a developmental deal with the UFC to compete on Dana White\u2019s Tuesday Night Contender Series. After two consecutive knockout wins on the show, the UFC was ready to announce Hardy\u2019s official debut. The UFC\u2019s willingness to promote Hardy on a variety of their platforms, including their highly anticipated debut on ESPN+, highlights the gaping inconsistencies in their domestic violence policies. In the wake of NFL running back Ray Rice assaulting his fianc\u00e9e in 2014, UFC president Dana White took a strong stance against domestic violence: \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that you never bounce back from and that\u2019s putting your hands on a woman. Been that way in the UFC since we started here. You don\u2019t bounce back from putting your hands on a woman.\u201d White maintained his stance for several months. Speaking at the 2014 NeuLion Sports Media &amp; Technology Conference, White revealed that the UFC \u201cscreens people for The Ultimate Fighter, and if you\u2019ve ever had a domestic violence, you can\u2019t get on. Since this whole thing happened [with Ray Rice], we\u2019re beefing up our policies with putting your hands on a woman. Of course, the way we always react is morally first then the business second.\u201d But the UFC\u2019s actual actions tell an entirely different tale. Will Chope was released by the promotion after news surfaced regarding a 2009 domestic assault conviction. Thiago Silva, who threatened his estranged wife with a gun and violated a temporary protection order, was released from the promotion but re-signed again after the charges were dropped. He was once again released two weeks later after the UFC received audio and video evidence posted by Silva\u2019s ex-wife. But many other have been kept on by the promotion, despite allegations of domestic or sexual violence. Most recently, Abdul Razak Alhassan was indicted for the alleged rape of two women in March 2018. The UFC is yet to comment on Alhassan\u2019s case. By December 2018, White\u2019s stance on domestic violence had dramatically changed from his zero-tolerance approach. When asked about the UFC\u2019s decision to place Hardy on the same fight card as Ostovich, White doubled down on the promotion\u2019s baffling decision: \u201cI called Rachael Ostovich and talked to her, walked her through the situation,\u201d White said. \u201cHer take was, \u2018His story isn\u2019t my story. Everybody\u2019s story is different. I believe in second chances. I have no problem fighting on the same card as this guy.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have anything to do with Rachael Ostovich, so she was totally cool with it.\u201d Ostovich has since shared her thoughts on Greg Hardy in an interview with ESPN, stating that believes in \u201csecond chances.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s making a turnaround,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope the same can happen to my husband and anyone else who has made a wrong choice.\u201d While Ostovich is willing to excuse Hardy, he remains a public relations concern and a controversial figure for the UFC. Ostovich\u2019s comments do not deter from the seriousness of Hardy\u2019s alleged actions and should not be misconstrued as an exoneration. And if White believes in second chances for Hardy, he doesn\u2019t seem keen to talk about it in any depth. Despite the backlash over Hardy, the UFC added fuel to the fire when it told reporters at a press conference in December \u2014 which took place the same day that the Hardy fight news broke \u2014 that they were only allowed to ask questions about the fighters competing at the upcoming UFC 231. In response to the reports, the Mixed Martial Arts Journalist Association released a statement on its website confirming that several of its members felt as though they could not ask questions freely. When journalists finally came round to asking White about the UFC\u2019s position on Hardy, the UFC boss blamed the media for stirring up controversy. \u201cI already covered this. I\u2019m not playing this bullshit with you guys. [Hardy] is on the UFC roster. Period. End of story,\u201d White said. \u201cListen, you guys want to be sensitive about shit? Anyone can be sensitive about anything. You can make an issue about everything.\u201d The problem with White\u2019s statement is that domestic violence is a very real issue in mixed martial arts. According to a study of arrest records since 2003 by HBO Real Sports, MMA fighters have a domestic violence arrest rate (750 per 100,000) more than double the general US population (360 per 100,000) and far ahead of NFL players (210 per 100,000), who are often depicted as being at the heart of the problem. In an attempt to stifle journalists from asking further questions about Hardy, the promotion shielded the fighter from fight-week media obligations. The UFC took this decision despite Hardy\u2019s place in the co-main event. When it comes to domestic violence, it appears that UFC thinks silence is golden. UFC did not respond to a request for comment on this story.",

Despite mounting pessimism around rights abuses and attacks on democracy by populists on both the far left and far right, the \u201cbig news\u201d of the past year was the growing trend to confront abuses by \u201cheadline-grabbing autocrats\u201d, said Human Rights Watch. The US-based group cited growing opposition in Europe and the US, including from voters and institutions, to the rhetoric and policies of figures as diverse as Donald Trump and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The organisation\u2019s 674-page World Report 2019, looking at some 100 countries and published in Berlin on Friday, is seen as one of the most authoritative digests of international trends in human rights. Highlighting the situation in China, the report pointed to Beijing\u2019s arbitrary detention of an estimated 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslims, adding that repression in the country had reached its \u201cworst levels since the 1989 massacre of protesters from the Tiananmen Square democracy movement\u201d. Also singled out for serious concern were the continuing political and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, mounting casualties from the \u201cdrugs war\u201d in the Philippines, and the impact on civilians of the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Yemen.

      "bodyText": "Hitachi has scrapped plans to build a nuclear power station in Wales, becoming the second firm in two months to abandon a major nuclear project and triggering \u201ca full-blown crisis\u201d for the UK energy\u2019s strategy. The \u00a316bn Wylfa plant on Anglesey was meant to be the next in a line of new nuclear plants behind Hinkley Point C but the Japanese conglomerate failed to reach a deal with the UK government. A Hitachi board meeting pulled the plug on mounting costs on Thursday, and the company said it would take a 300bn yen (\u00a32.14bn) hit from axing Wylfa. The move was a \u201csignificant blow\u201d to the UK\u2019s future energy supply plans, the Confederation of British Industry said. Unions expressed dismay over the cancellation, which will involve around 300 job losses at Hitachi\u2019s UK subsidiary, Horizon Nuclear Power, and about a thousand more in the supply chain. It will also mean an anticipated 9,000 construction jobs will not materialise. A second Hitachi plant at Oldbury in Gloucestershire will be shelved too. Duncan Hawthorne, CEO of Horizon Nuclear Power, said that the company had been unable to reach a deal in talks with London and Tokyo and was therefore suspending Wylfa and Oldbury. \u201cI am very sorry to say that despite the best efforts of everyone involved we\u2019ve not been able to reach an agreement to the satisfaction of all concerned.\u201d The collapse of the power stations and the Moorside project that Toshiba scrapped in November means the government has a huge hole to fill in a decade\u2019s time after old nuclear and coal plants have closed. Together the three new nuclear plants would have supplied 15% of electricity demand. Questions will be raised over whether ministers should redouble their efforts to make the numbers work for nuclear, or pivot to a new strategy that hugely expands the build-out of renewables. Business secretary Greg Clark said the government had offered the company a \u201cgenerous and significant\u201d package of support. That included providing a debt facility for the project, taking a one third stake and a guaranteed price of power of up to \u00a375 per megawatt hour for 35 years. The wholesale price is about \u00a350 per MWh. While far below the \u00a392.50 awarded to EDF Energy for Hinkley Point C, the Hitachi offer is still much higher than the \u00a357.50 for some windfarms in the early 2020s, a price that is expected to fall even lower in government auctions later this year. Clark told MPs that renewables had been getting cheaper in the past five years while nuclear had become more expensive because of safety measures. \u201cThe challenge of financing new nuclear is one of falling costs and greater abundance of alternative technologies, so that it is being outcompeted,\u201d he said. However, Clark said he was still committed to new nuclear and would be publishing details of a new approach to financing in the summer. The nuclear industry insisted it still had a key role to play. \u201cThe urgent need for further new nuclear capacity in the UK should not be underestimated, with all but one of the UK\u2019s nuclear power plant due to come offline by 2030,\u201d said Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association. Hinkley\u2019s developer, EDF Energy, said its own projects \u2013 which include plans for a site at Sizewell in Suffolk \u2013 were making good progress and showed \u201cnuclear has a strong future in the UK.\u201d Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow business secretary, said: \u201cJust two months ago, the government\u2019s lack of clarity over funding for new nuclear led Toshiba to withdraw from Moorside.

The government has blocked onshore wind power projects from competing for subsidies. The Liberal Democrats said it was time for the UK to prioritise renewables, batteries and imports over nuclear.

      "bodyText": "When all solutions are bad, it\u2019s time to reinvent the problem. Is it still possible to honour the initial Brexit referendum without crossing the EU\u2019s red lines? Yes \u2013 through semi-Brexit. The UK is divided into four nations, two of which voted remain and two of which voted leave. The British government could honour those decisions and allow Scotland and Northern Ireland to remain in the EU as the successor state to the UK, while permitting England and Wales (if it still wants to) to exit. Semi-Brexit does not mean breaking up the UK. Rather the reverse: semi-Brexit may be the only way to hold the UK together. If the UK drags Scotland and Northern Ireland out of the EU, the chances of a UK breakup are much higher. But if Scotland and Northern Ireland remain, then England and Wales would have more flexibility to negotiate a better deal. Third states \u2013 that is, states outside the EU \u2013 cannot cherry-pick the bits of the EU that they want and reject those bits they don\u2019t. But parts of EU member states that are otherwise outside the EU can. At least 35 countries and territories already have special deals with the EU that include, for example, free movement of goods into the EU without triggering the free movement of EU nationals back. Or deals that include something close to free trade without the jurisdiction of the European court of justice (ECJ). And on and on and on.

      "body": "<p>This weekend sees the release of M Night Shyamalan\u2019s Glass, the long-awaited follow-up to his 2000 superhero drama Unbreakable and his 2017 thriller Split. Like Unbreakable, Glass is interested in deconstructing the figure of the comic book superhero (and supervillain), calling attention to the tropes of its own genre while placing them in a larger historical and pseudo-scientific context. But whereas this meta-narrative examination felt fresh and exciting in Unbreakable, it now proves to be an utter bore.</p> <p>That\u2019s because deconstructionism \u2013 the form of philosophical and literary analysis that seeks to understand the relationship between a text and its meaning, often by acknowledging and/or subverting pre-existing conceptions or structural expectations \u2013 has become the modus operandi of superhero movies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/17/glass-review-m-night-shyamalan-samuel-l-jackson-james-mcavoy\">Glass review \u2013 M Night Shyamalan's superheroes assemble</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The argument could be made that such has been the case since 1989\u2019s Batman. Tim Burton\u2019s gothic vision, alongside Michael Keaton\u2019s neurotic interpretation of the character, may not have comprised a full-on deconstruction, but they both leaned heavily in that direction. (Burton\u2019s second installment, Batman Returns, went one step further, bringing to the fore the heavy undercurrent of kink intrinsic to the superhero mythos.)</p> <p>While this new, darker version of Batman took moviegoing audiences by surprise, loyal comic readers were already well acquainted with him. Starting three years earlier, two ingenious comic scribes had turned the industry upside down with their bold, complex revisionist masterworks. Frank Miller and Alan Moore plucked their heroes from out of the sky and brought them down to street level, in the process placing them in a political context that examined their role in shaping rightwing power fantasies.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95ghQs5AmNk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/95ghQs5AmNk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The revolutionary effect of these books, combined with the success of Burton\u2019s Batman films, might have kicked off a golden age of comic books and comic book movies, but it was not to be. Publishers and artists learned all the wrong lessons from Moore and Miller\u2019s example, focusing primarily on their prurient qualities (graphic violence, sexual explicitness, and a grimy aesthetic), while ignoring their deeper thematic and formalist resonance. In their attempt to appeal to more mature audiences, the industry devolved into puerile adolescence, the effect of which still lingers today.</p> <p>The movies, meanwhile, went hard in the opposite direction. Batman\u2019s crossover success didn\u2019t translate to other characters and properties and, minus <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102803/\">one or two notable exceptions,</a> the adaptations that followed were uniformly awful, so awful that even their core audience of children and teens (never the most discerning of demographics) rejected them. By the time Joel Schumacher drove the Batman franchise into the ground, comic book movies seemed destined to be regulated to the same dung-heap of forgotten schlock as video game movies and softcore porn.</p> <p>Then, in 2000, things changed. Riding the coattails of The Matrix\u2019s CGI spectacle (as well as the sleeper success of fellow Marvel adaptation, Blade), Bryan Singer\u2019s X-Men kicked open the doors of the mainstream and ushered in the era of box office supremacy that comic book and superhero movies hold to this day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"39c2bbd7ab3b1f69002a118c6f051dddb2ced098\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39c2bbd7ab3b1f69002a118c6f051dddb2ced098/0_0_2658_1683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Willis in Unbreakable\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce Willis in Unbreakable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If, during those initial years, there was a reluctance on the part of these films to fully embrace their glossy-paged origins, they expressed it by way of ironic signaling \u2013 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qw9u6moAn-Y\">\u201cWhat would you prefer, yellow spandex?\u201d</a> \u2013 rather than serious metatextual consideration. Yet 2000 was also the year of Unbreakable, which is centered entirely around the latter.</p> <p>Viewed today, Unbreakable displays a remarkable prescience, especially in the way it connects to a growing public appetite for heroic spectacle in the wake of violent national trauma (stemming, in the film as it would shortly in real life, from a horrific act of terrorism).

      "bodyText": "This weekend sees the release of M Night Shyamalan\u2019s Glass, the long-awaited follow-up to his 2000 superhero drama Unbreakable and his 2017 thriller Split. Like Unbreakable, Glass is interested in deconstructing the figure of the comic book superhero (and supervillain), calling attention to the tropes of its own genre while placing them in a larger historical and pseudo-scientific context. But whereas this meta-narrative examination felt fresh and exciting in Unbreakable, it now proves to be an utter bore. That\u2019s because deconstructionism \u2013 the form of philosophical and literary analysis that seeks to understand the relationship between a text and its meaning, often by acknowledging and/or subverting pre-existing conceptions or structural expectations \u2013 has become the modus operandi of superhero movies. The argument could be made that such has been the case since 1989\u2019s Batman. Tim Burton\u2019s gothic vision, alongside Michael Keaton\u2019s neurotic interpretation of the character, may not have comprised a full-on deconstruction, but they both leaned heavily in that direction. (Burton\u2019s second installment, Batman Returns, went one step further, bringing to the fore the heavy undercurrent of kink intrinsic to the superhero mythos.) While this new, darker version of Batman took moviegoing audiences by surprise, loyal comic readers were already well acquainted with him. Starting three years earlier, two ingenious comic scribes had turned the industry upside down with their bold, complex revisionist masterworks. Frank Miller and Alan Moore plucked their heroes from out of the sky and brought them down to street level, in the process placing them in a political context that examined their role in shaping rightwing power fantasies. The revolutionary effect of these books, combined with the success of Burton\u2019s Batman films, might have kicked off a golden age of comic books and comic book movies, but it was not to be. Publishers and artists learned all the wrong lessons from Moore and Miller\u2019s example, focusing primarily on their prurient qualities (graphic violence, sexual explicitness, and a grimy aesthetic), while ignoring their deeper thematic and formalist resonance. In their attempt to appeal to more mature audiences, the industry devolved into puerile adolescence, the effect of which still lingers today. The movies, meanwhile, went hard in the opposite direction. Batman\u2019s crossover success didn\u2019t translate to other characters and properties and, minus one or two notable exceptions, the adaptations that followed were uniformly awful, so awful that even their core audience of children and teens (never the most discerning of demographics) rejected them. By the time Joel Schumacher drove the Batman franchise into the ground, comic book movies seemed destined to be regulated to the same dung-heap of forgotten schlock as video game movies and softcore porn. Then, in 2000, things changed. Riding the coattails of The Matrix\u2019s CGI spectacle (as well as the sleeper success of fellow Marvel adaptation, Blade), Bryan Singer\u2019s X-Men kicked open the doors of the mainstream and ushered in the era of box office supremacy that comic book and superhero movies hold to this day. If, during those initial years, there was a reluctance on the part of these films to fully embrace their glossy-paged origins, they expressed it by way of ironic signaling \u2013 \u201cWhat would you prefer, yellow spandex?\u201d \u2013 rather than serious metatextual consideration. Yet 2000 was also the year of Unbreakable, which is centered entirely around the latter. Viewed today, Unbreakable displays a remarkable prescience, especially in the way it connects to a growing public appetite for heroic spectacle in the wake of violent national trauma (stemming, in the film as it would shortly in real life, from a horrific act of terrorism). While the superhero boom predates the 9/11 attacks by a little over a year, it shouldn\u2019t strain credulity to suggest a direct link between their preponderance in the years that followed and the state of the national psyche during that same period. Regardless, the fact remains that as soon as superhero films rose to a new prominence they were already busy dissecting themselves, with a number of high-profile examples following Unbreakable\u2019s lead: Ang Lee\u2019s Hulk psychoanalyzed its atomic gods, while Pixar\u2019s The Incredibles domesticated theirs. Christopher Nolan revived the dormant Batman franchise and used it as a framework on which to hang a number of hefty moral and legal considerations brought to bear by the \u201cwar on terror\u201d \u2013 domestic surveillance, enhanced interrogation, the symbiotic relationship between martial authority and violent insurgency. Bryan Singer moved on to Superman and considered (poorly) what would happen if a god-like protector wished to abandon his post, while Hancock, Kick-Ass and Super all attempted \u2013 to varying degrees of success \u2013 to show us how a superhero would fare in the \u201creal\u201d world. Then there are the films of Zack Snyder, arguably the pre-eminent (though by no means universally acclaimed) auteur of superhero deconstruction. His run of comic book adaptations (300, Watchmen, Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Justice League) acknowledge the dreadful existential implications of \u201cmetahumans\u201d living in \u2013 and tearing their way across \u2013 a vulnerable human world, even as they ultimately revel in the wanton carnage on display (it was this cognitive dissonance that made Snyder a good choice to bring Frank Miller\u2019s crypto-fascist vision to the screen, and such a terrible choice to adapt Alan Moore\u2019s scholarly, cosmically minded work). Meanwhile, Marvel became the biggest player in the game by carefully threading the needle between earnestness and irony. The company\u2019s focus on world building didn\u2019t leave much room for deconstruction at the outset, but the films did eventually get around to it. Like Nolan\u2019s Bat films, Avengers: Age of Ultron highlights the self-perpetuating cycle of destruction superheroes bring upon themselves and the world. Captain America: Civil War picks up on this thread, looking at the collateral damage wrought by its heroes\u2019 good intentions, while weighing their right to use unilateral force. All of these films coat themselves in layers of moral ambiguity \u2026 right up to their third acts, at which point they drop whatever philosophical and moral quandaries they have introduced (the most egregious example being Batman\u2019s one-time-only use of warrantless wiretapping in The Dark Knight), to focus on the final, very expensive set piece.

Pwned? What to do? <strong>Pauline</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>This is generally known either as \u201cwebcam blackmail\u201d or \u201csextortion scam\u201d and the email should have been diverted to your spam folder. Millions \u2013 perhaps billions \u2013 of similar emails have been sent over the years, but there seems to have been a flood of them over the past few months.</p> <p>Very few people ever make the requested payment. However, since the cost of sending millions of spam emails is basically zero, even a few payments are easy profits.</p> <p>While it\u2019s generally safe to ignore spam emails like this, some people will want reassurance. You can almost always get this by searching the web for one or two sentences from the email. In this case, phrases appear on two threads in the r/Scams conference on Reddit: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/8gsjba/the_blackmail_email_scam/\">The Blackmail Email Scam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/9srjen/the_blackmail_email_scam_part_2/\">The Blackmail Email Scam (part 2)</a>. Publishing all the variants of these scam emails makes them easier to find.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s on the hook?</strong></h2> <p>Random spam emails probably don\u2019t have much success, so the would-be blackmailers have been trying to personalise their attacks in various ways. The most common ones are email spoofing, including a password, and including all or part of a phone number.</p> <p>Most email services have no way of authenticating the From: and Reply to: fields in email messages, so spammers can fill these fields with anything they like. Your attacker simply made the From: address the same as the To: address, so it looked as though you had sent the email yourself. You hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>In 2012, a working group introduced a new system called <a href=\"https://dmarc.org/\">DMARC</a> (domain-based message authentication, reporting and conformance) to alleviate the problem. It helps but it\u2019s still not used widely enough. Dmarcian has a website where you can <a href=\"https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/\">check if a domain is compliant</a>. (Both google.com and outlook.com have valid records.)</p> <p>The UK\u2019s Action Fraud office provides <a href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/quad9-and-dmarc-free-cybercrime-protection\">a tutorial to help businesses set up DMARC</a>.</p> <p>Other versions of this phishing attack include one of the recipients\u2019 passwords and/or part of a phone number. These have usually been obtained from one of the security breaches that have exposed details of billions of users. In 2017, Yahoo admitted that its data breaches compromised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/03/yahoo-says-all-of-its-3bn-accounts-were-affected-by-2013-hacking\">3 billion accounts</a>. Other major breaches involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/30/marriott-hotels-data-of-500m-guests-may-have-been-exposed\">Marriott International</a> (500 million customers), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/hacker-advertises-details-of-117-million-linkedin-users-on-darknet\">LinkedIn</a> (164 million), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/adobe-password-leak-can-check\">Adobe</a> (153 million), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/21/ebay-urges-users-to-reset-passwords-after-cyberattack\">eBay</a> (145 million), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/apr/26/playstation-network-hackers-data\">Sony\u2019s PlayStation Network</a> (77 million), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/21/uber-data-hack-cyber-attack\">Uber</a> (57 million) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/19/ashley-madison-hackers-release-10gb-database-of-33m-infidelity-site-accounts\">Ashley Madison</a> (31 million).</p> <h2><strong>Password checking</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s a good chance that one of your passwords was exposed in one or more of these breaches. You can check by typing your email addresses into the website, <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned?</a> At the time of writing, this has 5.7 million pwned accounts from <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites\">339 pwned websites</a>. There\u2019s also a newer page for <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords\">pwned passwords</a>, as explained <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/\">here</a>.</p> <p>If your email address comes up in HIBP? then you must change the password that you used for all the sites that suffered data breaches. If you used the same password for any other sites \u2013 that\u2019s a bad idea, obviously \u2013 you should also change the password on those.</p> <p>If the Pwned Password page reveals that one of your passwords has been exposed, you should change that as well: you may not have been pwned, but your password is not unique. Some are quite common. For example, the password \u201c12345\u201d has been exposed 2.3m times, \u201csecret\u201d 221,972 times, \u201cgod\u201d 32,804 times and \u201carcticmonkeys\u201d 649 times.</p> <p><a href=\"https://howsecureismypassword.net/\">Dashlane</a> has a nice website that will tell you how long it would take to crack your password. However, even strong passwords are no use if they have already appeared in breaches. The <a href=\"https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength\">xkcd cartoon password</a> \u201ccorrect horse battery staple\u201d would theoretically take 15 octillion years to crack, but it has already been pwned twice in that form \u2026 and 111 times without the spaces.</p> <h2><strong>Scam reporting</strong></h2> <p>In the UK, you can use Action Fraud\u2019s website to <a href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/report-phishing\">report a phishing attempt</a> if \u201cyou have NOT lost any money or exposed your personal details. If you have lost money, you must <a href=\"https://reporting.actionfraud.police.uk/login\">report it as a crime</a>,\u201d the site says.</p> <p>Reporting phishing attempts is simple but optional: some people get several phishing emails per day, and they\u2019re unlikely to report most of them. I don\u2019t have any numbers, but I expect most people just delete and forget about them.</p> <p>Reporting a crime requires more effort, and if you are serious, you should create an account to do it. You can file a report as a \u201cguest\u201d but creating an account provides more options. You can, for example, save and resume reports, update them later, call Action Fraud to discuss your case, and get email progress reports.</p> <p>You can also report crimes by calling 0300 123 2040 on weekdays between 8am and 8pm. Businesses, charities and other organisations are urged to call this number during live cyber-attacks at any time.</p> <p>Action Fraud \u2013 which used to be the National Fraud Reporting Centre \u2013 is operated by the City of London police and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB), which is overseen by the City of London police. They don\u2019t investigate cases, but check them for \u201csolvability factors\u201d such as bank account details, phone numbers, postal addresses and so on. If there are any, they pass them on to a \u201clocal police force or other appropriate law enforcement agency\u201d.</p> <p>By which time, any money transferred is likely to have disappeared \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Safety first</strong></h2> <p>The best way to deal with phishing and other spam emails is to delete them on sight. Don\u2019t open them, don\u2019t reply to them, don\u2019t open any documents that may be attached to them, don\u2019t click any links in them, don\u2019t enter any information into websites fetched by those links, and definitely don\u2019t send them any money.</p> <p>Many of these emails will include a transparent, single-pixel image, known as a beacon. When you open the email, it fetches the tiny image.gif file from a remote server, so the spammers know they\u2019ve hit a live, working email address. (Note: Gmail and some other services pre-fetch images to avoid this problem.)</p> <p>Also bear in mind that spam and phishing emails may include attempts to infect your computer with malware. This is why you should keep your anti-virus software and operating system up to date. It can be annoying, but thousands of PCs were infected by malware such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet\">Stuxnet</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack\">WannaCry</a> months or sometimes years after the vulnerabilities they exploited had been patched.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question?

      "bodyText": "I got this email today. It says \u201cI hacked your device, because I sent you this message from your account.\u201d It goes on to claim that it has filmed me watching pornography, and demands $698 in bitcoin. Phishing? Pwned? What to do? Pauline This is generally known either as \u201cwebcam blackmail\u201d or \u201csextortion scam\u201d and the email should have been diverted to your spam folder. Millions \u2013 perhaps billions \u2013 of similar emails have been sent over the years, but there seems to have been a flood of them over the past few months. Very few people ever make the requested payment. However, since the cost of sending millions of spam emails is basically zero, even a few payments are easy profits. While it\u2019s generally safe to ignore spam emails like this, some people will want reassurance. You can almost always get this by searching the web for one or two sentences from the email. In this case, phrases appear on two threads in the r/Scams conference on Reddit: The Blackmail Email Scam and The Blackmail Email Scam (part 2). Publishing all the variants of these scam emails makes them easier to find. What\u2019s on the hook? Random spam emails probably don\u2019t have much success, so the would-be blackmailers have been trying to personalise their attacks in various ways. The most common ones are email spoofing, including a password, and including all or part of a phone number. Most email services have no way of authenticating the From: and Reply to: fields in email messages, so spammers can fill these fields with anything they like. Your attacker simply made the From: address the same as the To: address, so it looked as though you had sent the email yourself. You hadn\u2019t. In 2012, a working group introduced a new system called DMARC (domain-based message authentication, reporting and conformance) to alleviate the problem. It helps but it\u2019s still not used widely enough. Dmarcian has a website where you can check if a domain is compliant. (Both google.com and outlook.com have valid records.) The UK\u2019s Action Fraud office provides a tutorial to help businesses set up DMARC. Other versions of this phishing attack include one of the recipients\u2019 passwords and/or part of a phone number. These have usually been obtained from one of the security breaches that have exposed details of billions of users. In 2017, Yahoo admitted that its data breaches compromised 3 billion accounts. Other major breaches involved Marriott International (500 million customers), LinkedIn (164 million), Adobe (153 million), eBay (145 million), Sony\u2019s PlayStation Network (77 million), Uber (57 million) and Ashley Madison (31 million). Password checking There\u2019s a good chance that one of your passwords was exposed in one or more of these breaches. You can check by typing your email addresses into the website, Have I Been Pwned? At the time of writing, this has 5.7 million pwned accounts from 339 pwned websites. There\u2019s also a newer page for pwned passwords, as explained here. If your email address comes up in HIBP? then you must change the password that you used for all the sites that suffered data breaches. If you used the same password for any other sites \u2013 that\u2019s a bad idea, obviously \u2013 you should also change the password on those. If the Pwned Password page reveals that one of your passwords has been exposed, you should change that as well: you may not have been pwned, but your password is not unique. Some are quite common. For example, the password \u201c12345\u201d has been exposed 2.3m times, \u201csecret\u201d 221,972 times, \u201cgod\u201d 32,804 times and \u201carcticmonkeys\u201d 649 times. Dashlane has a nice website that will tell you how long it would take to crack your password. However, even strong passwords are no use if they have already appeared in breaches. The xkcd cartoon password \u201ccorrect horse battery staple\u201d would theoretically take 15 octillion years to crack, but it has already been pwned twice in that form \u2026 and 111 times without the spaces. Scam reporting In the UK, you can use Action Fraud\u2019s website to report a phishing attempt if \u201cyou have NOT lost any money or exposed your personal details. If you have lost money, you must report it as a crime,\u201d the site says. Reporting phishing attempts is simple but optional: some people get several phishing emails per day, and they\u2019re unlikely to report most of them. I don\u2019t have any numbers, but I expect most people just delete and forget about them. Reporting a crime requires more effort, and if you are serious, you should create an account to do it. You can file a report as a \u201cguest\u201d but creating an account provides more options. You can, for example, save and resume reports, update them later, call Action Fraud to discuss your case, and get email progress reports. You can also report crimes by calling 0300 123 2040 on weekdays between 8am and 8pm. Businesses, charities and other organisations are urged to call this number during live cyber-attacks at any time. Action Fraud \u2013 which used to be the National Fraud Reporting Centre \u2013 is operated by the City of London police and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB), which is overseen by the City of London police. They don\u2019t investigate cases, but check them for \u201csolvability factors\u201d such as bank account details, phone numbers, postal addresses and so on. If there are any, they pass them on to a \u201clocal police force or other appropriate law enforcement agency\u201d. By which time, any money transferred is likely to have disappeared \u2026 Safety first The best way to deal with phishing and other spam emails is to delete them on sight. Don\u2019t open them, don\u2019t reply to them, don\u2019t open any documents that may be attached to them, don\u2019t click any links in them, don\u2019t enter any information into websites fetched by those links, and definitely don\u2019t send them any money. Many of these emails will include a transparent, single-pixel image, known as a beacon. When you open the email, it fetches the tiny image.gif file from a remote server, so the spammers know they\u2019ve hit a live, working email address. (Note: Gmail and some other services pre-fetch images to avoid this problem.) Also bear in mind that spam and phishing emails may include attempts to infect your computer with malware. This is why you should keep your anti-virus software and operating system up to date. It can be annoying, but thousands of PCs were infected by malware such as Stuxnet and WannaCry months or sometimes years after the vulnerabilities they exploited had been patched.

      "bodyText": "On 22 December 2016, a retired professor of Hawaiian studies named Carlos Andrade sent a letter to dozens of his relatives informing them that he was about to sue them. The relatives were among hundreds of partial owners of four small parcels of land on the island of Kauai, the legacy of a shared ancestor named Manuel Rapozo. A neighboring landowner, Northshore Kalo LLC, was willing to pay the legal fees to clear up the title on the property \u2013 enabling Andrade to take full ownership and compensate his fellow descendants for their shares. It wasn\u2019t until nearly a month later that the Honolulu Star-Advertiser broke the news that Northshore Kalo LLC was not a taro farm, as some had assumed (\u201ckalo\u201d means \u201ctaro\u201d in Hawaiian), but a shell corporation controlled by Mark Zuckerberg. The Facebook founder was pursuing eight separate lawsuits related to parcels of land that, like the Rapozo parcels, were surrounded by his 700-acre Kauai estate. Those who had been sued had a choice: they could sell their partial shares or try to outbid a billionaire in a public auction. If they lost, they could be forced to pay Zuckerberg\u2019s legal fees. A media firestorm ensued, with some Native Hawaiians declaring Zuckerberg the \u201cface of neocolonialism\u201d and local politicians demanding reform to the state law that created the \u201cquiet title and partition\u201d process. Within days, Zuckerberg published an op-ed in the local paper apologizing for his ham-fisted approach and promising to drop the lawsuits. But beneath the headline, Zuckerberg\u2019s mea culpa included one major caveat: he would continue to support Andrade\u2019s claim to his family\u2019s parcels. Now, two years later, the quiet title process initiated by Andrade is drawing to a close and a judge has ordered a public auction of the parcels. When one of the richest men in the world has expressed an interest in the outcome of an auction, there is no real question that he will get his way. But as the process heads towards its inevitable conclusion, a small cadre of Rapozo descendants are continuing to resist the forced sale of the property. They know that they don\u2019t have a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of holding on to their tiny slice of paradise. Still, they argue that Zuckerberg\u2019s involvement in the case, even though he is no longer directly suing them, makes a mockery of an unfair system that has long seen longtime residents of Hawaii lose their land to wealthy newcomers, be they sugar barons or tech billionaires. \u201cThere\u2019s a class of person \u2013 and Zuckerberg is a poster child \u2013 that have so much money that they distort day-to-day deeds and behavior,\u201d said Wayne Rapozo, a London-based corporate lawyer who is a descendant of Manuel Rapozo\u2019s brother and is helping to coordinate and finance the holdouts\u2019 legal fight. \u201cEven if we lose, this has to be fought,\u201d Rapozo continued. \u201cI want my nieces and descendants to know that someone thought it was wrong \u2026 I want it to be known that it was resisted.\u201d \u2018My children grew up there\u2019 On a blustery afternoon last November, Shannon Buckner stood in the shadow of the 6ft stone wall that surrounds Zuckerberg\u2019s island retreat, peering through the gate. \u201cThis is our grandfather that I never knew, and I don\u2019t want it to be gone,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my kids to be able to enjoy it. I\u2019m going to fight to the end even if I lose.\u201d Buckner first learned of her inheritance \u2013 a 0.026% share of the Rapozo parcels \u2013 when she was sued by Andrade and Northshore Kalo back in 2016. The 46-year-old mother of two was living in Lihue, Kauai, at the time, just 20 minutes south of the parcels, which are located near the north shore plantation town of Kilauea. But she grew up on another island and was not familiar with her connection to the Portuguese sugar plantation worker who had purchased the property in 1894. That ancestor, Manuel Rapozo, immigrated to Kauai from the Azores in 1882, according to family lore, and eventually renounced his Portuguese citizenship to become a full-fledged citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii. When he died intestate in 1928, ownership of his land was passed to his seven children, and from there down through the generations. For Rapozo descendants who grew up on Kauai, the parcels were an important part of their birthright. Before Zuckerberg purchased the estate (and built his mile-long wall), it was owned by a local auto dealer and surrounded by a hog wire fence. Family members had keys to the gate and could visit the parcels or access Pila\u2019a beach, a stretch of white sand that can otherwise only be reached by a somewhat treacherous hike along the coast. \u201cMy children grew up on that property,\u201d said one descendant, a resident of Kilauea who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, citing concerns over her employment. \u201cI have animals buried there.

The 24-year-old Guerrero, who teaches Native Hawaiian culture and language at a resort on Maui, spoke to the Guardian in the lobby of another Maui hotel where his mother, 57-year-old Jennie Guerrero, works in the housekeeping department. Jennie Guerrero owns a 0.45% share of the property, which she said she wanted to pass on to her three sons. \u201cBoth of us had the same response,\u201d Alika Guerrero said of the day that he and his mother learned of the lawsuits. \u201cOur family name is not going to be attached to anything to do with a billionaire buying up land in Hawaii and having us sell out our ancestral land.\u201d Wayne Rapozo, who grew up on Kauai and now lives and works in London, said that Zuckerberg and Andrade have created a model for how a \u201ctag team tango of billionaire and dissident cousin\u201d can dispossess \u201cordinary middle-class families that don\u2019t have $40bn to play games with other people\u2019s lives\u201d. \u201cThis case sets a horrible precedent which is un-American and un-Hawaiian,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are making Hawaii look like a banana republic or colonial possession.\u201d \u2018Every little bit matters\u2019 To Andrade and Zuckerberg, the case is much more straightforward: Andrade is the rightful heir to the parcels, they argue, and the lawsuit is simply a legal process that will allow them to compensate partial owners for fractional shares that are otherwise useless to them. \u201cIt is not reasonable or practical for 138 parties to own and control 2.35 acres,\u201d said Harvey L Cohen, Andrade\u2019s attorney, by email. \u201cThe quiet title process exists to address such matters, so that there is a clear owner based on an individual\u2019s ownership interests and history with the land.\u201d Andrade declined to be interviewed for this article, but he provided a lengthy statement detailing his history with the land and reasons for pursuing the quiet title.

Back in 2016, Zuckerberg forecasted the outcome of that contest when he wrote about Andrade\u2019s claim to the lands. \u201cHe is 72 years old, retired, and wants to clear up the titles of these kuleana so he can pass the land on to his children,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cHe will continue his quiet title action and upon completion his family will have ownership of those kuleana. He has been a steward of his family lands and we support him in this effort.\u201d The Kilauea cousin, Buckner and the Guerreros all say that they understand why Andrade wants to pass the land on to his children. They simply point out that they have children as well \u2013 and dispute his claims that he was the only descendant to care for the properties. \u201cFor people like myself, our connection to land and ancestral property is more than just about money,\u201d said Alika Guerrero. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dispossessed for the last 150 years at least, so every little bit to us matters.\u201d To the young hotel employee, Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to pick sides in a family dispute is less about what\u2019s right and more about limiting the number of people with the right to access his properties. \u201cWe\u2019re a blemish in his sanctuary.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This is a book to get lost in. It\u2019s a memoir in which Luke Turner, best known as co-founder of the independent music website <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/sep/05/the-quietus-fifth-birthday\" title=\"\">the Quietus</a>, tries to explain \u2013 to himself as much as to us \u2013 how, over many years, he has resisted but also honoured his bisexuality. It\u2019s an account of falling out of love with London and seeking both solace and newness in nature. It\u2019s a social history of Epping Forest, a piece of woodland that, straddling London and Essex, is also bi. A disturbing trauma narrative, it\u2019s also a work of delightfully low, pants-dropping comedy, and a learned meditation, influenced by 17th-century Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico, on the nature of knowledge.</p> <p>The book begins with Turner splitting up with his long-term girlfriend even though, he insists, he still loved her. Something was troubling him. It was the same thing that was becoming a compulsion: a desire \u201cto feel the naked press of a man on top of me\u201d. Over the next few months he acts on that desire, and then some. He also sleeps with women \u2013 not a few of them. He\u2019s hungry, confused, sometimes reckless. Unmoored, he moves around the fringes of London, kipping in friends\u2019 flats and attics, and spending as much time as possible in Epping Forest. He hopes that nature will offer a cure, some clarity.</p> <p>Forests have long been seen as shelters for outlaws \u2013 and for outlaw sexuality. Some locals refer to Epping Forest as \u201cEffing Forest\u201d. Pollarding has transformed and even sexualised the trees themselves so that, according to Turner, they resemble \u201ccows\u2019 udders, a pair of buttocks climbing into a hollow, old men\u2019s balls, a phallus between thighs, great, heavy, warty growths, welts like parted vulva\u201d.</p> <p>Turner marries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/orton\" title=\"\">Joe Orton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/12/key-fourth-book-of-foucaults-history-of-sexuality-published-in-france\" title=\"\">Michel Foucault</a> in his descriptions of how, over the centuries, men have been forced \u201cby law and religious prejudice into twilighting their sexuality to find a knee-trembler under a hornbeam\u201d. They use off-paths and low branch overhangs to create \u201ca private network, beyond cartography, beyond nature\u201d. Discarded tissues and condoms become \u201cterritorial markers of a queer autonomous zone where heterosexuals might be advised not to tread\u201d. But this is no sylvan utopia; having asked a forest keeper why so many fires have been blazing in parts of its grassland, Turner is told: \u201cIt\u2019s people trying to burn out the gays.\u201d</p> <p>Turner is not ashamed of being bisexual. He says he struggles against \u201cthe binary rules of heteronormative love\u201d. Why then does he feel so messed up? He ponders his upbringing and evokes an adolescence many readers will recognise: the fear of getting an erection in the changing room showers, the glee at finding a sports holdall full of copies of Club International, the silent drama of giving a classmate (whom he later dubs \u201cTippex Boy\u201d) a hand job under the desk during a chemistry lesson, the struggle to make sense of our shifting, seemingly aberrant desires.</p> <p>Art can be a lifeline at these times. It can name our dilemmas, legitimise our weird feelings. Turner found solace and possibilities in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/14/favourite-film-withnail-and-i\" title=\"\"><em>Withnail and I</em></a>.

His mother grew up in a fundamentalist sect that forbade most forms of 20th\u2011century mass culture, and the self-lacerating language of guilt and shame and unworthiness comes easily to him. Yet he respects their Methodism, is introduced to a lineage of English radicalism (Gerrard Winstanley, the Levellers) through it, and draws on its heightened ways of seeing as he immerses himself in the life of the forest and the altered states of consciousness it engenders. For him, forests, though often portrayed by theologians as pagan or Dionysian, are churches without walls, fecund in spirituality.</p> <p><em>Out of the Woods</em> (parts of it first appeared on the <a href=\"https://www.caughtbytheriver.net/2016/09/roger-deakin-waterlog-walnut-tree-farm/\" title=\"\">Caught by the River</a> website, which has become a reliable treasure trove of contemporary natural history) reads both like a seance and an act of exorcism, a necessary purging. Will Ashon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/06/strange-labyrinth-by-will-ashon-review\" title=\"\"><em>Strange Labyrinth</em></a> (2017), also about Epping Forest, devoted chapters to the anarcho-punk bank Crass, whose members Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher have long maintained an open house there. Turner\u2019s reference points are more eldritch: English occultist and draughtsman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/06/austin-osman-spare-phil-baker\" title=\"\">Austin Osman Spare</a>, the band Coil, whose music he describes as \u201cnarcotic and queer; it blurs the boundaries between our expectations of sonic urbanism and the pastoral psychedelic\u201d.</p> <p>At times, as he chafes against his background \u2013 its emphasis on sport, hearty masculinity, middle-Englishness (he admits to having campaigned for Tory MP Peter Lilley at a school election) \u2013 he recalls Stephen, the vicar\u2019s son in David Rudkin\u2019s visionary drama <em>Penda\u2019s Fen</em> (1974) who discovers that he is \u201cnothing pure! My sex is mixed. I am woman and man! I am mud and flame!\u201d Like <em>Penda\u2019s Fen</em>, <em>Out of the Woods</em> is animated by deep trauma: Turner\u2019s confusion and shame about how, as a teenager, he was drawn to the public toilets in his home town and had oral sex with someone he guesses was five times his age. Was this abuse? If so, he wonders, what later drew him back to those places?</p> <p>Turner\u2019s memoir succeeds at many levels. It explores the kinds of questions about identity and interconnectedness that academics such as Eduardo Kohn (how do forests think?) and Catriona Sandilands (are plants queer?) have been asking in recent years. It does so without jargon and without self-absorption (it\u2019s peopled by sketches of outsider artists and eccentric forest dwellers). It offers no fake epiphanies or grand statements. But, as all gastroenterologists know, it suggests it would be a grave error to think of forests as external to us. We carry the forest with us, inside us.

      "body": "<p>A damning interim review has highlighted Oxfam\u2019s failure to tackle an environment at the charity that allowed sexual misconduct and bullying to go unchecked.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://independentcommission.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Interim-Report-Listening-to-people-Rebuilding-trust-.pdf\">report</a>, produced by an independent commission, warned that no uniform system exists for dealing with complaints and said there are \u201cdrastic inconsistencies\u201d in the way safeguarding issues are handled across the 90-plus countries in which Oxfam International operates.</p> <p>The review added that multiple staff across different Oxfam offices believe bullying is pervasive, and highlighted concerns about a lack of confidentiality in investigation processes.</p> <p>\u201cAt the heart of this issue is how power is managed and trust is earned and kept. The risks associated with reporting allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse are often high,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The interim review, by a team of policy and legal experts, was set up by Oxfam following reports that the charity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti\">covered up allegations</a> that its staff paid for sex during a relief mission in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.</p> <p>Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International, said the report came at a crucial time for the charity, and pledged that the recommendations would be used to bolster ongoing improvements to safeguarding.</p> <p>The commission welcomed the steps taken by Oxfam to strengthen its policies, but warned efforts had so far focused on protecting staff in the workplace, and not on the communities it served.</p> <p>\u201cOxfam has seemingly imposed reporting systems that have not been developed alongside, or with the input of, communities,\u201d the report\u2019s authors said. They added that, in some cases, community members had not been given enough information about the processes for reporting abuse.</p> <p>The interim report concentrates on policies relating to staff, since its research addressing the concerns of communities and partner organisations remains ongoing. The independent commission is expected to conclude its work in May 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9bbbd5f74f6c4128d8ef2e7e05b3fd667e50c55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9bbbd5f74f6c4128d8ef2e7e05b3fd667e50c55/0_89_5666_3399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oxfam International\u2019s executive director, Winnie Byanyima\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is painfully clear that Oxfam is not immune from sexual and other forms of abuse\u2019: Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/charity-commission-agrees-terms-for-independent-review-of-oxfam-gbs-safeguarding-arrangements\">separate investigation</a> by the Charity Commission, which is examining Oxfam GB\u2019s governance, management and safeguarding policies, is also still in progress.</p> <p>According to the review, sexual misconduct is only one of the issues reported by staff, who also raised concerns about elitism, racism, colonial behaviour and sexism. These issues, said staff, affect relationships among employees, partners and the communities Oxfam serves.</p> <p>Some employees whose English is a second, third, or fourth language, believe they go unheard, the review added.</p> <p>The commission acknowledged Oxfam\u2019s introduction of a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for sexual misconduct, including a rule that states investigations will continue even if the accused resigns.

      "bodyText": "A damning interim review has highlighted Oxfam\u2019s failure to tackle an environment at the charity that allowed sexual misconduct and bullying to go unchecked. The report, produced by an independent commission, warned that no uniform system exists for dealing with complaints and said there are \u201cdrastic inconsistencies\u201d in the way safeguarding issues are handled across the 90-plus countries in which Oxfam International operates. The review added that multiple staff across different Oxfam offices believe bullying is pervasive, and highlighted concerns about a lack of confidentiality in investigation processes. \u201cAt the heart of this issue is how power is managed and trust is earned and kept. The risks associated with reporting allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse are often high,\u201d the report said. The interim review, by a team of policy and legal experts, was set up by Oxfam following reports that the charity covered up allegations that its staff paid for sex during a relief mission in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International, said the report came at a crucial time for the charity, and pledged that the recommendations would be used to bolster ongoing improvements to safeguarding. The commission welcomed the steps taken by Oxfam to strengthen its policies, but warned efforts had so far focused on protecting staff in the workplace, and not on the communities it served. \u201cOxfam has seemingly imposed reporting systems that have not been developed alongside, or with the input of, communities,\u201d the report\u2019s authors said. They added that, in some cases, community members had not been given enough information about the processes for reporting abuse. The interim report concentrates on policies relating to staff, since its research addressing the concerns of communities and partner organisations remains ongoing. The independent commission is expected to conclude its work in May 2019. A separate investigation by the Charity Commission, which is examining Oxfam GB\u2019s governance, management and safeguarding policies, is also still in progress. According to the review, sexual misconduct is only one of the issues reported by staff, who also raised concerns about elitism, racism, colonial behaviour and sexism. These issues, said staff, affect relationships among employees, partners and the communities Oxfam serves. Some employees whose English is a second, third, or fourth language, believe they go unheard, the review added. The commission acknowledged Oxfam\u2019s introduction of a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for sexual misconduct, including a rule that states investigations will continue even if the accused resigns. But it added that former staff, including survivors and whistleblowers, felt \u201cdeeply frustrated and saddened at the lack of accountability they experienced\u201d. In some cases, staff believed they had been pushed out of the organisation after reporting an incident. The commission added that there were concerns accused employees had not been held accountable. Instead, they were either protected by senior managers, moved around the organisation, or their contracts were simply not renewed. The report added that Oxfam should do more to recognise that men, LGBTQ people, and those who see themselves as non-binary, can also be victims of misconduct. Byanyima said the charity recognised that it must do more to improve its work. \u201cIt is painfully clear that Oxfam is not immune from sexual and other forms of abuse that stem from the abuse of power. To those who have experienced such unacceptable behaviour: we are sorry, I am sorry, and we will follow up on any cases passed to us by the commission as a matter of urgency.\u201d Oxfam added in a statement that it had made progress in implementing a 10-point plan to strengthen safeguarding. This included recruiting 15 extra staff safeguarding experts across its confederation in recent months. In addition, it has improved its recruitment and central referencing system, and is providing new tools to partner organisations to help improve safeguarding. The charity has also committed to almost tripling the amount it spends on its gender justice programming worldwide, from 5.3% of its budget to 15%, or more than \u20ac54m (\u00a348m).",

The EU has invested so much political capital in the backstop that abandoning it now would have politically damaging consequences for EU unity. Overriding the wishes of Ireland would send a message that those of a \u201cdifficult\u201d country that has chosen to leave count for more than a member state. \u201cWe stand by the backstop, as long as Ireland stands by the backstop,\u201d one EU diplomat said.</p> \n<p>Some have speculated that the EU could be persuaded to return to its original version of the backstop, the Northern Ireland-only plan favoured by the bloc until October. But that implies a different government: Theresa May and her Democratic Unionist supporters have ruled out that option many times.</p> \n<h2>Go for Canada-plus</h2> \n<p>Ardent Brexiters have claimed that May has a simple option. \u201cThe PM must go straight back to the EU\u2019s [free-trade agreement] offered by Tusk in March,\u201d said the former cabinet minister Owen Paterson.</p> \n<p>This ignores the fact that the EU will only agree a free-trade deal if the UK signs the existing withdrawal agreement, which includes the Irish backstop. When the EU talks of \u201cpluses\u201d in any Canada-style deal, it means other non-trade deals on security, fisheries and foreign policy. When Brexiters talk of pluses, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/24/iea-brexit-proposals-the-main-points\">Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Canada</a>, they have been looking for advantages that Brussels has repeatedly ruled out.</p> \n<h2>Switch to Norway</h2> \n<p>MPs who favour a soft Brexit used the Commons defeat to increase calls for a Norway-style relationship that would keep the UK in the European Economic Area and allow it to enter the European Free Trade Association (Efta)<strong>.</strong> Now rebranded as \u201cCommon Market 2.0\u201d, this would be the least economically damaging form of Brexit. Proponents may have been heartened by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/brexit-at-a-standstill-after-theresa-may-commons-defeat-says-barnier\">statement from the EU\u2019s chief negotiator</a>, Michel Barnier, that the EU was ready to change its Brexit offer if the UK changed its red lines.</p> \n<p>From the EU\u2019s point of view, nothing in the withdrawal agreement or political declaration needs to be changed to embark on negotiations for a Norway-style relationship.

      "bodyText": "After MPs\u2019 crushing rejection of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, the EU response was swift and coordinated. In several languages, but usually English, leaders and politicians made plain the EU had no intention of conjuring up a plan to break the deadlock. \u201cThe ball is now in the court of the British lower house,\u201d said Austria\u2019s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, echoing a widely held view in national capitals and the EU institutions. So what are the options for the prime minister and parliament and how will the European Union react? Try again and seek concessions from the EU May\u2019s first instinct is to resurrect a version of the deal that preserves her red lines. The EU27 has already ruled out changing the deal unless the UK alters those red lines. The bloc, in a \u201cletter of reassurance\u201d sent by EU leaders Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk on Monday, raided its cupboard of legal devices and goodwill promises in an attempt to convince parliamentarians. EU officials feel there is nothing more to give and see further talks as pointless until the UK has a plan. Scrap the backstop The government has been facing renewed calls from Brexiters to scrap the contested Irish backstop, despite MPs voting down an amendment to May\u2019s deal to this effect. This plan is destined to fail. The EU has invested so much political capital in the backstop that abandoning it now would have politically damaging consequences for EU unity. Overriding the wishes of Ireland would send a message that those of a \u201cdifficult\u201d country that has chosen to leave count for more than a member state. \u201cWe stand by the backstop, as long as Ireland stands by the backstop,\u201d one EU diplomat said. Some have speculated that the EU could be persuaded to return to its original version of the backstop, the Northern Ireland-only plan favoured by the bloc until October. But that implies a different government: Theresa May and her Democratic Unionist supporters have ruled out that option many times. Go for Canada-plus Ardent Brexiters have claimed that May has a simple option. \u201cThe PM must go straight back to the EU\u2019s [free-trade agreement] offered by Tusk in March,\u201d said the former cabinet minister Owen Paterson. This ignores the fact that the EU will only agree a free-trade deal if the UK signs the existing withdrawal agreement, which includes the Irish backstop. When the EU talks of \u201cpluses\u201d in any Canada-style deal, it means other non-trade deals on security, fisheries and foreign policy. When Brexiters talk of pluses, or Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Canada, they have been looking for advantages that Brussels has repeatedly ruled out. Switch to Norway MPs who favour a soft Brexit used the Commons defeat to increase calls for a Norway-style relationship that would keep the UK in the European Economic Area and allow it to enter the European Free Trade Association (Efta). Now rebranded as \u201cCommon Market 2.0\u201d, this would be the least economically damaging form of Brexit. Proponents may have been heartened by the statement from the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that the EU was ready to change its Brexit offer if the UK changed its red lines. From the EU\u2019s point of view, nothing in the withdrawal agreement or political declaration needs to be changed to embark on negotiations for a Norway-style relationship. While the EU would be open to adjusting the non-binding political declaration to help the UK achieve this goal, other pitfalls lie ahead. EU officials have noted they cannot compel Norway and other Efta members to accept the UK into their club. Insiders have also cast doubts on British expectations of being able to be \u201ca rule-shaper\u201d while outside the EU. Ask for more time A British request to extend Brexit talks is increasingly been seen as a matter of when, not if. French and German ministers say the UK should have more time if needed; diplomats say they cannot see any of the EU27 objecting if the UK has a good reason. \u201cGood\u201d reasons would include to strike a deal after receiving a realistic proposal from the UK, or to hold an election or second referendum, not simply to prolong the pain of the departure. However, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, noted that prolonging article 50 would not be easy because of European elections in late May. A new European parliament is due to be sworn in in July. Having the UK as a member state beyond then could be legally tricky, although some think the problem could be fixed by a special clause in the withdrawal agreement to allow British MEPs to sit for a few months. \u201cThere are thousands of political problems, but from a legal point of view everything is possible,\u201d a diplomat said. Other officials stress that the first priority for Brussels is ensuring the EU is correctly \u201clegally constituted\u201d, meaning no one would welcome a barrage of legal challenges from British citizens just as the EU is attempting to launch a new work programme. Cancel Brexit The clock is ticking, but the UK remains a member state, with the right to withdraw its article 50 letter without permission from the EU.",

The initial report presents a flexible daily diet for all food groups based on the best health science, which also limits the impact of food production on the planet.</p> <p>To anyone who has spent any time trying to figure out how to eat healthily, economically, ethically and compassionately, this might sound too good to be true. Indeed, the debate around how one should eat is so fraught as to now be dubbed the nutrition wars. Should one eat omnivorously, organic and local, or go vegan? Is dairy milk production worse than California almond milk in terms of fresh water usage and carbon miles \u2013 and what about in terms of calcium? Which is better, farmed fish, wild fish or no fish?

From the numbers quoted alone, it is hard to disagree: more than 2 billion people are micronutrient deficient, and almost 1 billion go hungry, while 2.1 billion adults are overweight or obese. Unhealthy diets are, it says, \u201cthe largest global burden of disease\u201d, and pose a greater risk to morbidity and mortality than \u201cunsafe sex, alcohol, drug, and tobacco use combined\u201d. The planet isn\u2019t faring any better. Introducing the commission under the title <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30681-X/fulltext\" title=\"\">Acting in the Anthropocene</a>, the Lancet firmly places that global food system within the framework of human impact on both climate and the environment that has caused geologists to rethink how they work: we are not (yet) extinct, but we have an era named after us. And what we are eating has a lot to do with that. Food production, the report states, \u201cis the largest source of environmental degradation\u201d.</p> <p>So how does the commission propose to fix this?</p> <p>It has identified a daily win-win diet \u2013 good for health, good for the environment \u2013 that is loosely based on the much-lauded Mediterranean diet, but with fewer eggs, less meat and fish, and next to no sugar. Dairy is, for western populations anyway, going to be a sticking point, because the suggested diet does not include much. Crucially, it does include a range of foodstuff types that are adaptable, in theory, to the cuisines (potato or cassava; palm-oil-based, say, or soy-rich) and primary dietary restrictions (omnivore, no pork, pescatarian, vegetarian, vegan) found across the world. It can most likely be made to work for other free-froms, although the list of what to eat clearly needs to be road-tested by everyone to be proved to be workable \u2013 or not. The diet also omits many things people cook with, from alcohol and seaweed to dried fruit and coconut milk (botanists call the coconut a drupe, and nutritionists, variously, a nut, a fruit and a seed, so go figure which category its milk fits into).</p> <p>The following, therefore, is a rough estimate of what someone in Britain might eat over a seven-day period. A full month\u2019s diet plan would be a better illustration, given that the daily ration of red meat stands at 7g (with an allowable range of 0-14g); unless you are creative enough to make a small steak feed two football sides and their subs, you will only be eating one once a month. Similarly, you are allocated little more than two chicken breast fillets and three eggs every fortnight and two tins of tuna or 1.5 salmon fillets a week. Per day, you get 250g of full-fat milk products (milk, butter, yoghurt, cheese): the average splash of milk in not very milky tea is 30g.</p> <p>The diet functions on the basis of 2,500 kcal daily, which corresponds, the report says, to the average energy needs of a 70kg (11st) man and a 60kg (9\u00bdst) woman, both aged 30, with moderate to high levels of physical activity.

      "bodyText": "The Greens will introduce legislation to establish a royal commission into the mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin when parliament returns in February, in the wake of the massive fish kill at Menindee last week. The Greens environment and water spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said she would move to set up the inquiry, which will have power to compel testimony from bureaucrats and ministers. The call has been backed by the Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations (NBAN), which claims native title holders have been left out of important decision-making about the Darling River. But to have any chance of passing, the private member\u2019s bill will need the support of Labor, which has so far backed the Murray-Darling Basin plan as the best way forward. Labor\u2019s spokesman on the environment and water is Tony Burke, who was minister in 2007 when the plan was finalised. He was responsible for sealing the agreement with the states, and agreeing on the 2,750 GL target for recovery of water for the environment, a figure scientists now say is either the bare minimum needed for a healthy river, or too low. Labor also backed amendments to the plan, supported by the Nationals and the Liberals but opposed by the Greens, that cut the water recovered in the northern basin. \u201cEverything that was put in place for the plan has made the situation better than it otherwise would have been,\u201d Burke said on Monday when he visited Menindee. \u201cEverything \u2013 there is not a single part of the Murray-Darling Basin plan that is a step backwards for the environment from where it was when I was water minister.\u201d But the Greens want to see a comprehensive inquiry in light of the fish kill. \u201cWe have spent $13bn on the Murray-Darling Basin plan, yet the river system is in collapse,\u201d Hanson-Young said. \u201cThis plan was put in place to fix the river, and cotton, corruption and climate change is killing it. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard evidence of meter tampering, water theft, children being hospitalised because of toxic water, cases of fraud, donation scandals and corruption. The mass fish kill that has struck the Lower Darling in recent weeks is just the latest in a long list of problems with the management of the Murray-Darling Basin. \u201cWe urgently need a royal commission into the mismanagement and over-extraction of water in the Murray-Darling Basin. Australians deserve better, we need a healthy river \u2013 it is the lifeblood of our country,\u201d she said. The Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations have backed the Greens\u2019 call, saying the Nationals\u2019 stewardship has been akin to \u201cDracula in charge of the bloodbank.\u201d NBAN deputy chair, Ghillar Michael Anderson, and director, Cheryl Buchanan, said the disaster being experienced in the Murray Darling was not just due to drought. \u201cIt is is also a culmination of man-made mismanagement\u2026 and major development without scientific evidence-based planning in the formative years of the MDBA,\u201d they said. The Aboriginal nations along the Darling have native title and have been demanding greater recognition of cultural flows associated with their title. The river is at the centre of the Barka people\u2019s cultural beliefs, and the Barkinji around Wilcannia are literally \u201cthe river people\u201d. Yet they say they were excluded from the high level meeting convened by the Murray Darling Basin Authority and senior water managers. \u201cNBAN has great difficulty in understanding why the so-called expert water planners would attempt to normalise our current circumstances. First Nations now demand urgent answers and to be included in all future top-level water planning within the Murray Darling basin,\u201d they said. \u201cThe MDBA and state authorities in NSW are to blame for turning the Menindee Lakes native fish nursery area into the equivalent of a sewer,\u201d they said. \u201cSurely commonwealth and state water ministers should understand that they no longer have carte blanche rights to leave First Nations Peoples out of future government planning not just for water, but also for biodiversity, ecology and everything to do with our culture as it relates to management of Country, which includes water as a vital component.\u201d The angry release comes after a major fish kill at Menindee Lakes which saw hundreds of thousands of fish killed. There are fears that another one is imminent, after the current hot spell ends. But NSW state opposition leader, Michael Daley, who was in Menindee on Thursday, refused to back a federal royal commission, saying it was a matter for federal Labor and has instead proposed a state commission of inquiry with similar powers. But as the South Australian government discovered, the federal government refused to allow federal bureaucrats or ministers to give evidence, including the MDBA staff. Hanson-Young said the bill would be her first priority when parliament resumed. \u201cThe Liberal-National government, the Labor party and the crossbench should not waste this opportunity to do the right thing by our river communities, transparency, and the environment,\u201d Hanson-Young said.",

With flights from \u00a380, reasonable car hire (\u00a350) and a great Airbnb in Lajares (\u00a330 a night), it was a great week of cycling, surfing, hiking, boat trips to the small island off the north coast and epic sunsets from the lovely fishing village of El Cotillo. Lajares is fun, a lively village with cafes, shops and bike hire and it\u2019s in a national park with a backdrop of a volcano. The north track follows the coast from Corralejo to El Cotillo, where you can find beaches with world-class surf and sheltered white sand lagoons.

Downing Street has refused the demand. The Scottish National party\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, met May last night, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, also accepted her invitation.

The PM is required to come to parliament by Monday with a \u201cplan B\u201d for exiting the EU. Outside Downing Street last night, the prime minister said: \u201cI\u2019m inviting MPs from all parties to come together to find a way forward, one that both delivers on the referendum and can command the support of parliament. This is now the time to put self-interest aside.\u201d But she has rejected the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/tory-party-split-theresa-may-caves-customs-union-brexiters-warn\">key demand of Labour and some Tories of a permanent customs union</a>, and proven reluctant to concede that article 50 should be extended. Our editorial argues that May needs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-and-parliament-now-dissolve-the-red-lines\">abandon her red lines</a> if she truly seeks compromise.</p> \n<p>More than 170 business leaders have thrown their weight behind the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/more-than-170-business-leaders-join-call-for-second-brexit-referendum\">campaign for a second referendum</a>. Larry Elliott, our economics editor, points out this morning that \u201cthe pound rose and all was calm on the stock market\u201d after the events of Tuesday: \u201cAs far as the financial markets were concerned, the message was clear: the voting down by MPs of Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement means a delayed Brexit, a softer Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all.\u201d But he argues that while a \u201cBrexit in name only\u201d might mean less short-term pain, it would represent a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/17/rupture-eu-brexit-reform\">squandered chance to fix a broken economic system</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Future eaters \u2013 </strong>A science-based diet to tackle poor nutrition globally and steer our food habits away from damaging the environment has been devised. The \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d calls for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/new-plant-focused-diet-would-transform-planets-future-say-scientists\">red meat and sugar consumption to be cut by half</a>, while vegetables, fruit, pulses and nuts must double. Across the world 800 million people are hungry, 2 billion malnourished and 2 billion overweight or obese. International experts came up with the diet of 2,500 calories a day. It includes a beef burger and two servings of fish a week. Most protein comes from pulses and nuts; milk, cheese, butter and eggs are allowed in moderation; while half of each plate of food is vegetables and fruit and a third is wholegrain cereals. Meanwhile some food for thought from Tony Naylor: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2019/jan/16/the-14-cauliflower-steak-is-this-the-cost-of-vegan-cooking-being-taken-seriously\">should meat-free dishes also be cheap</a>? A pub company has been criticised over its \u00a314 cauliflower \u201csteak\u201d \u2013 but one top chef explains: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot cheaper to buy in pre-cut meats than vegetables you have to transform into something interesting. Anything that takes a long prep time, the price will reflect that.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Mental health risk of broken families \u2013</strong> Parental break-ups are more likely to trigger anxiety and depression in children if they are aged at least seven, but appear to have no effect if they are younger, research suggests. \u201cOne possible reason for this is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/17/parents-break-up-more-likely-to-harm-mental-health-of-children-aged-seven-to-14\">children are more sensitive to relationship dynamics at this age</a>,\u201d said Professor Emla Fitzsimons, study co-author from University College London. The first British study of its kind looked at 6,245 children and young people. The researchers found those from poorer and wealthier backgrounds were equally likely to experience mental ill-health.

      "bodyText": "Top story: PM pleads for compromise \u2013 from behind red lines Good morning, I\u2019m Warren Murray and it\u2019s the \u201cideas on a postcard please\u201d stage of Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not accept an offer to hold talks with Theresa May until she agrees to remove the threat of a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street has refused the demand. The Scottish National party\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, met May last night, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, also accepted her invitation. Our live coverage is under way and will continue throughout another eventful day. Corbyn\u2019s no-confidence vote may have been defeated but the dust is far from settled. The PM is required to come to parliament by Monday with a \u201cplan B\u201d for exiting the EU. Outside Downing Street last night, the prime minister said: \u201cI\u2019m inviting MPs from all parties to come together to find a way forward, one that both delivers on the referendum and can command the support of parliament. This is now the time to put self-interest aside.\u201d But she has rejected the key demand of Labour and some Tories of a permanent customs union, and proven reluctant to concede that article 50 should be extended. Our editorial argues that May needs to abandon her red lines if she truly seeks compromise. More than 170 business leaders have thrown their weight behind the campaign for a second referendum. Larry Elliott, our economics editor, points out this morning that \u201cthe pound rose and all was calm on the stock market\u201d after the events of Tuesday: \u201cAs far as the financial markets were concerned, the message was clear: the voting down by MPs of Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement means a delayed Brexit, a softer Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all.\u201d But he argues that while a \u201cBrexit in name only\u201d might mean less short-term pain, it would represent a squandered chance to fix a broken economic system. * * * Future eaters \u2013 A science-based diet to tackle poor nutrition globally and steer our food habits away from damaging the environment has been devised. The \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d calls for red meat and sugar consumption to be cut by half, while vegetables, fruit, pulses and nuts must double. Across the world 800 million people are hungry, 2 billion malnourished and 2 billion overweight or obese. International experts came up with the diet of 2,500 calories a day. It includes a beef burger and two servings of fish a week. Most protein comes from pulses and nuts; milk, cheese, butter and eggs are allowed in moderation; while half of each plate of food is vegetables and fruit and a third is wholegrain cereals. Meanwhile some food for thought from Tony Naylor: should meat-free dishes also be cheap? A pub company has been criticised over its \u00a314 cauliflower \u201csteak\u201d \u2013 but one top chef explains: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot cheaper to buy in pre-cut meats than vegetables you have to transform into something interesting. Anything that takes a long prep time, the price will reflect that.\u201d * * * Mental health risk of broken families \u2013 Parental break-ups are more likely to trigger anxiety and depression in children if they are aged at least seven, but appear to have no effect if they are younger, research suggests. \u201cOne possible reason for this is that children are more sensitive to relationship dynamics at this age,\u201d said Professor Emla Fitzsimons, study co-author from University College London. The first British study of its kind looked at 6,245 children and young people. The researchers found those from poorer and wealthier backgrounds were equally likely to experience mental ill-health. Tom Madders from the charity YoungMinds said it was important to build children\u2019s resilience from a young age and \u201cteach them to learn about healthy relationships, both with others and themselves\u201d. * * * Step towards \u2018space force\u2019 \u2013 Donald Trump is to announce an expansion of space-based missile detection systems. The president is likely to present it as a justification for his new \u201cspace force\u201d (about which Steve Carrell is making a Netflix comedy). The review cites a need to guard against incoming projectiles from \u201crogue states\u201d such as Iran and North Korea. A White House official said it was not aimed at Russia and China \u2013 \u201cthey have very large, sophisticated arsenals and we are postured to rely on our [nuclear] deterrence\u201d towards them. Stephen Young, from the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: \u201cI am quite surprised that there is no terrible news there \u2026 [but] Russia will be upset because of the expansion of the system.\u201d Trump is already involved in a row with Russia over nuclear weapons. The US is pulling out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty because, Trump says, the Russians have violated it by developing a new missile system. * * * House price corner \u2013 It\u2019s that time again. The latest chartered surveyors\u2019 figures show prices fell in December at the fastest rate in six years and the sales outlook is at its weakest in two decades as Brexit doom and gloom prevails.

      "body": "<p>I took the picture in the summer of 2013, in a rural part of northern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria\">Austria</a>. I grew up in Holland. I went back there in 2012 to try to recapture my own childhood, but the farm where I was born no longer existed and the people I knew as a child no longer lived there. And then I found my childhood \u2013 or what I wished it had been \u2013 here, in the Austrian countryside.</p> <p>I was asked to do <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/i-am-waldviertel.html\">a documentary project about the Waldviertel region</a>, which is how I came to meet these two local little girls, Hannah and Alena. Their mother, Sonja, asked if I would take some pictures of them.</p> <p>That summer, I travelled to their grandmother\u2019s farm in a village called Waldberg, between Vienna and the Czech Republic. It\u2019s where they always spend their holidays. We became friends and I\u2019ve been going back ever since to photograph them.</p> <p>The two boys \u2013 Martin, who is on the swing with the girls, and his brother Christian, whose hands and feet peek out from behind them \u2013 are their friends who spend their summers at the farm, too. When I first met Christian, all he wanted to talk about was my camera. But, from the outset, the girls simply did their own thing. I would start our sessions with a few posted portraits, but soon they would get bored and ignore me. And that\u2019s when I would begin to work.</p> <p>I think I was lying on the ground to get this shot, with my 35mm. It\u2019s a camera I love because it allows me to be right inside the image, and I want my viewers to feel the same thing.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if I purposefully avoided showing their full faces. It wasn\u2019t to anonymise them. Rather, it was to capture something more universal. Instead of looking into their eyes, you follow their individual gazes, and you see the social dynamics at play between them. But I\u2019m not really interested in what they\u2019re playing with. Here, I hate those metal pipes, they spoil my picture. And without the children, there is no picture.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2014/feb/14/world-press-photo-awards-2014-in-pictures#img-8\">Alena, the older girl</a>, is at the centre of the image, and that\u2019s true in how they play together. It\u2019s a role that naturally falls to her \u2013 she is in charge, she decides what they\u2019re going to do, and where they\u2019re going to play. The others are happy to follow her lead. And while any other adult \u2013 a parent or a grandparent \u2013 might be tempted to intervene (\u201cDon\u2019t do that\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s too rough\u201d), I don\u2019t judge, I don\u2019t comment, or direct anything. I might be present, but the kids are on their own. Wherever they go, I go. They don\u2019t see me. They\u2019re in their own world.</p> <p>It\u2019s a nostalgic image, with a touch of magic from those disembodied feet and hands of Christian\u2019s. The longer I live, the more I long to be a child again. This project has perhaps been more about looking not for my actual childhood, but one I might have had.</p> <p>When I was two, my father and older sister Anita were in a car accident. Anita was killed, and my father was left with the mental age of a child of seven. So the only father I knew, growing up, was someone who was aggressive, and of whom I was ashamed. He wasn\u2019t a normal father. Perhaps this is why I look for the idyllic, or the romantic in the stories I shoot \u2013 to balance things out, as a coping mechanism. I think that the most important things that happen to you, in life, happen between the ages of two and 12.</p> <p>When I see these four <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/children\">children</a> here, in their own world, what I love is that they\u2019re in charge. They are powerful. And that\u2019s how I choose not only to depict children in my work, but also how I want to relate to them in everyday life: as human beings, as equals.

      "bodyText": "With a bumper helping of pointlessness, M Night Shyamalan has created a bulky, lengthy, anti-climactic sequel to two of his previous films: the smart horror-thriller Split (2016) and the deeply strange mystery Unbreakable (2000), fusing them into a kind of own-brand superhero franchise. There\u2019s a cheeky dig at a certain comic-book institution when a magazine announces Philadelphia\u2019s newest, biggest skyscraper (a possible showdown site) as an architectural \u201cmarvel\u2019\u2019. James McAvoy reprises his bravura plural-performance from Split, playing the Horde, a villain with dissociative identity disorder. Bruce Willis is back as David Dunn, the guy who miraculously survived a train crash in Unbreakable with superstrength. These days, he\u2019s roaming the streets as a lone avenger, nicknamed the Overseer, wearing a signature hooded black poncho (which surely limits his movement and field of vision?) in partnership with his now grownup son Joseph, played again by Spencer Treat Clark, who handles the admin and monitors social media coverage back at base. And locked away in a psychiatric facility is Shyamalan\u2019s strangest creation, Mr Glass, played by Samuel L Jackson, a villain with the bizarre superweakness of ultra-fragile bones, balanced by excessive cerebral brilliance. These three figures are now to be yoked together by destiny, and come under the patient eye of psychiatrist Dr Ellie Staple, played by Sarah Paulson, whose mission is to persuade them that they do not have superpowers, just a malady of the mind. Like so many of Shyamalan\u2019s adventures, Glass starts strongly and fizzles, a dramatic droop which is initially camouflaged by the escalating grandiosity of visual rhetoric, something febrile and high-concept that is visionary in everything except having vision. At least it\u2019s good to be reminded of Unbreakable, Shyamalan\u2019s authentically weird gem.",

MB Hospital 9pm, BBC Two Looking beyond funding troubles and bed shortages, the series tells the stories of individual patients being treated at Liverpool\u2019s Walton Centre, the UK\u2019s only dedicated spine, brain and pain-management centre, where Sophie, 22, awaits a vital operation on her spine and brain-injured Tom really doesn\u2019t want to go to rehab. MB Hunted 9pm, Channel 4 This gameshow continues to feel like a faintly dystopian exercise in using entertainment to remind us how little freedom and privacy society allows us. Fortunately, it\u2019s fiendishly entertaining, too. This week, reformed criminal Nick and friend Paul are surrounded and Jess and Emma turn on the charm in Scotland. Phil Harrison Better Things 10pm, BBC Two Pamela Adlon\u2019s wicked dramedy about women and daughters offers a riskily uneventful second episode. However, it easily compensates for a stark lack of plot by introducing a gloriously on-form Celia Imrie as single mum Sam\u2019s own mother, who\u2019s both a guilt-inducing irritant and an essential ally.Jack Seale Film choice Croupier 1.10am, Film4 Another dark underworld thriller from Mike Hodges, director of the original Get Carter.

Do you agree or disagree with this idea?\u201d It turned out that 16% did agree, and 18% didn\u2019t. This was surprising.

It has been rerun in different versions several times: in <a href=\"http://business.illinois.edu/shavitt/BA_531/Bishop-week5.pdf\" title=\"\">1983, 1984</a>, 1995 and 2013, always with similar results. Around a third of people will pretend to have an opinion, unless you make it easy to say \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. If you say that \u201cPresident Obama\u201d or \u201cthe Republicans\u201d want to repeal the Public Affairs Act, even more opinions appear, along partisan lines. The study tells us something that no politician will ever say within earshot of the people who elect them: we often don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about, but we don\u2019t like to admit it.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean people are stupid. Quite the reverse. Stupid would be spending your time studying the minutiae of government legislation rather than working, caring for others, or enjoying life. After all, your opinion is just one of 47 million in the UK electorate, no matter how well informed you are. James Fishkin, a professor of political science at Stanford University and a leading advocate of \u201ccitizens\u2019 assemblies\u201d, a way of finding out what \u201cthe people\u201d really want, when they take some time to think it over, calls this \u201crational ignorance\u201d. Most of us simply don\u2019t need to know how to run the country. </p> <p>In November last year, Gordon Brown suggested that an assembly might resolve the Brexit crisis. Last month, Damon Albarn, Rowan Williams and a number of other public figures wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/16/damon-albarn-joins-call-for-citizens-assembly-to-break-brexit-deadlock\" title=\"\">an open letter to the Guardian</a> in support, and the idea now has this newspaper\u2019s backing. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2KV2nkpwoM\" title=\"\">Fishkin calls it \u201cembarrassingly simple\u201d</a>. You just put the country in a room and let them talk.</p> <p>In 2016, for instance, when Ireland decided to reconsider its abortion laws, everyone braced for a fight. A bitter referendum 33 years earlier had given mothers and their unborn children equal rights to life under the eighth amendment of the constitution. It made legal abortions almost impossible in Ireland and created a national controversy that would not go away. To tackle the question, and four others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/citizens-assembly-ireland-abortion-referendum\" title=\"\">parliament established a citizens\u2019 assembly</a> of 99 randomly selected Irish citizens, who would reflect the national balance of age, gender, class and region. They would be chaired by a supreme court judge (now retired), Mary Laffoy. No politicians would be involved.</p> <p>The first thing Neasa Keogh heard about it was a knock at the door of her house in Limerick. She had opinions on abortion, but had never been involved in politics in any way, besides voting. \u201cI was politically motivated when politicians came to my door,\u201d she says. \u201cI had often thought: \u2018We ought to do this, and we ought to do that.\u2019 But I never did anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>Now 58, Keogh had just retired from her job as a primary school teacher and could spare the time, and her travel to Dublin would be paid. Citizens\u2019 assemblies have to be transparent, however, and this would broadcast live online, which meant Keogh\u2019s name would be made public. She remembered \u201cthe hatred and the viciousness\u201d surrounding the eighth amendment in 1983. \u201cI was a little bit nervous about being targeted by rightwing elements,\u201d she says. But it was a chance to help her country, so she accepted.</p> <p>The assembly would meet at the Grand hotel, Malahide, north-east of Dublin, for a weekend every month, and it would be 18 months before all five topics were completed. In addition to the 99 citizens, there would be 100 substitutes in case some dropped out, which several did. Essentially, Keogh was to be one member of a gigantic jury, weighing a country\u2019s values rather than a person\u2019s innocence or guilt.</p> <p>On the morning of the launch event at Dublin Castle, another assembly member, Ois\u00edn Herraghty, set off early on the drive from County Mayo. Now 47, Herraghty is a technical manager at an arts centre. Like Keogh, he had been approached on his doorstep. He agreed to take part right away, then more or less forgot about it. \u201cI had the radio on in the car,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand the first item on the 8am news was the inaugural meeting of the citizens\u2019 assembly. I thought: \u2018Oh. That\u2019s me. The first item on the news, this must be bigger than I thought.\u2019\u201d At this point, he hadn\u2019t even told his family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e9367f790ba03428b81af9a021e82f34c32429f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e9367f790ba03428b81af9a021e82f34c32429f/0_0_4000_3898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Laffoy speaks during the citizens\u2019\u0080\u0099 assembly set up to deliberate on Ireland\u2019\u0080\u0099s strict abortion regime.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"975\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Laffoy speaks during the citizens\u2019\u0080\u0099 assembly set up to deliberate on Ireland\u2019\u0080\u0099s strict abortion regime.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scale of the responsibility, and the honour, hit Keogh at the event itself. After short speeches from Laffoy and Enda Kenny, who was then the Taoiseach, they heard from three lawyers and academics about the history of social change in Ireland. \u201cSometimes you go to things and you think it\u2019s all a bit of a show, but it was all so genuine and heartfelt,\u201d says Keogh.</p> <p>Sessions began in earnest the following month. Although 199 people may be a microcosm of Ireland\u2019s 4.8 million citizens, it is still far too many for a productive conversation, so they were split into groups. Keogh found herself part of a table of six, with a balance of men and women and one person from each age band. Each table also had a facilitator and a note-taker. The facilitator policed the conversation, according to a page of guidelines. During expert presentations, if a citizen felt nervous about asking a question, the facilitator would ask it on their behalf.</p> <p>They heard from medical experts, priests and advocates from both sides. More than 13,000 submissions were received from members of the public, and the assembly members themselves requested to hear some other points of view. At the end of each meeting, they had to write a short report, to satisfy the chair that they had understood what they had heard. Before each session, they were given background information to read. They were not shown abortion images, but were otherwise spared no details. It was hard work. It was hard in many ways.</p> <p>Keogh had voted against the ban on abortion in 1983, and considers herself fairly liberal, but she remembers being asked: Do you think the unborn does not have an equal right to life? \u201cThat was like a belt to the solar plexus,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a mother of three children \u2026 I found that very, very difficult.\u201d</p> <p>The final meeting to consider abortion began on Saturday 22 April 2017. Most of the weekend was spent voting in private booths, and the results astonished Ireland. The assembly decided overwhelmingly to change the eighth amendment, and 64% recommended that parliament allow abortion without any restriction, up to either 12 or 22 weeks. Although it had been written off by some as a way to smother the controversy, the assembly ended up being far more radical than anyone expected, and more than many thought Ireland was ready for. A referendum was duly held to find out. Herraghty followed the campaign. \u201cI heard people on both sides pushing their views,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019d find myself going: \u2018Hang on a second. That\u2019s not true. Check your facts. That\u2019s not actually true.\u2019\u201d On 25 May 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/26/irish-abortion-referendum-result-count-begins-live\" title=\"\">the country approved the changes by 66% to 34%</a>, just a touch above the margin at the Grand hotel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I found myself at tables where I had nothing in common with people, but we were still able to come to some consensus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This might confirm some people\u2019s suspicions about citizens\u2019 assemblies. Isn\u2019t it just what you would expect to happen when you lock people in a hotel with a bunch of, no-doubt, liberal experts? Well, it might be, but experts aren\u2019t the only people an assembly has to hear from. In Ireland, the citizens themselves demanded more firsthand experience from those affected by the abortion ban. Accordingly, they heard a selection of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAr9rZ0WwN4\" title=\"\">audio recordings from six women</a>, some of whom had travelled for abortions, some of whom had decided against it. In Limerick, some people told Keogh about their abortions, which they had kept secret for years. Assemblies can take the voice of ordinary people into the heart of politics.</p> <p>At the same time, they can solve the \u201cecho chamber\u201d problem by making people talk to others who don\u2019t share their opinions. \u201cThat was drilled into us,\u201d Keogh says. \u201cThat people had their views. Everyone had to be listened to. I found myself at tables where I had nothing in common with people, but we were still able to come to some consensus, or decide: \u2018We can\u2019t agree on that.\u2019 I met wonderful people. I met people like I\u2019d never met in my life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6cf4428af47e930df6961b6b975d43824801bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb6cf4428af47e930df6961b6b975d43824801bd/0_0_2000_1585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In 1996, when governor of Texas, George W Bush organised a \u2018deliberative poll\u2019.

An early televised experiment <a href=\"http://cdd.stanford.edu/1994/britain-experiments-with-the-deliberative-poll\" title=\"\">took place in Manchester in 1994</a>, discussing crime. In 1996, under governor George W Bush, the state of Texas organised what it called a \u201cdeliberative poll\u201d, which actively chose to pay a premium to generate power by wind instead of fossil fuels. (Texas still leads the US in wind power.) In 2006, a citizens\u2019 assembly recommended electoral reform in the Netherlands. In 2011, the Japanese government commissioned a <a href=\"https://participedia.net/en/cases/deliberative-poll-japans-energy-and-environmental-policy-options\" title=\"\">deliberative poll on nuclear power</a> and the future of the pension system. In Gdansk, Poland, a <a href=\"https://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-11-22/solutions-how-the-poles-are-making-democracy-work-again-in-gdansk\" title=\"\">citizens\u2019 assembly met</a> in 2016 to consider flood prevention, and they have tackled other subjects, such as migration, since. (Sadly, the pioneering mayor behind it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/gdansk-polish-city-mourning-mayor-pawel-adamowicz-stabbing\" title=\"\">Pawel Adamowicz</a>, was murdered at the weekend.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/labour-mps-seek-brexit-consensus-with-citizens-assembly-plan\">Labour MPs seek Brexit consensus with citizens' assembly plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, the process remains obscure, even in Canada, where local and national assemblies are common, and where they are sometimes called \u201creference panels\u201d. \u201cOne day a letter showed up at my house,\u201d says Syd Burdett, 27, from British Columbia, \u201cand it was like: \u2018Hey, we want people for this reference panel about pharmacare. We\u2019ll pay for you to come out to Ottawa for a week.\u2019\u201d The national government wanted a <a href=\"https://www.crppc-gccamp.ca/\" title=\"\">sample of 35 people from across Canada</a> to tell it how to pay for medicines. Burdett had been about to quit his job in a convenience store anyway. On a whim, he accepted.</p> <p>As things stand, people have free medical care for everything except prescriptions outside hospitals. As a result, some do without the medicines they need. A pharmacare system would fix that, and save lives, but at a cost. Burdett says he had a vague idea of what a reference panel was, but had heard nothing about this one. When he arrived at the hotel in Ottawa, after a five-hour flight, he enjoyed it very much. \u201cIt reminded me a lot of being at university,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an academic experience, in a way.\u201d</p> <p>Over the week, Burdett\u2019s group heard from academic, medical and commercial experts. One woman brought her new baby, who behaved very well. Discussions were quite technical at times, but nothing was impenetrable. \u201cI think by the end of the week people had a pretty good understanding,\u201d Burdett says. At last, <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/579b7eaf2e69cf79da94700b/t/5846333020099ec07a0f7b88/1480995633096/CRPPC+-+Media+Release.pdf\" title=\"\">they did recommend pharmacare</a>, paid for by higher taxes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was a real cross-section of people. I was quite surprised by how diverse the group was</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You can see why assemblies are winning the love of politicians. When something necessary but unpopular must be done, such as raising taxes, they move the responsibility on to the people who stand to suffer, who have no reason to lie, no votes to win, no need to pretend that they hold all the answers. At the same time, assemblies bring more authority than some decorative consultation, and more clarity than a referendum. Indeed, in England, they are already on the way.</p> <p>Rebecca Weight is 31 and works at a museum in London. She subscribes to online surveys so she wasn\u2019t surprised when an email arrived last year, asking if she would be willing to spend two weekends in a hotel in Birmingham, discussing <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/housing-communities-and-local-government-committee/citizens-assembly-faq-17-19/\" title=\"\">the future of adult social care</a>. She would be paid \u00a3300, plus expenses. \u201cI\u2019ve done focus group-type things,\u201d she says. \u201cIt seemed it might be similar to that, but maybe something with a little bit more meaning.\u201d It turned out to be the country\u2019s first true citizens\u2019 assembly, commissioned by the House of Commons.</p> <p>On 27 April 2018, Weight set off to join the other 46 citizens. \u201cIt was a real cross-section of people,\u201d she says. \u201cI was quite surprised by how diverse the group was.\u201d They had dinner, got to know each other, and the next day the problem of adult social care in England was set out before them. It turned out to be quite simple. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough money to pay for it,\u201d says Weight.</p> <p>Like every participant I spoke to, Weight found it challenging and enjoyable. She would have liked to hear more firsthand experience of the care system, but, overall, she felt they got enough from the many experts to form a reliable opinion, if not to become expert themselves. In the end, the assembly <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcomloc/citizens-assembly-report.pdf\" title=\"\">recommended paying for universal adult social care</a> with higher taxes.</p> <p>It remains to be seen what the authorities will do with the wisdom of Burdett and Weigh, and their fellow citizens. In Canada, the federal government responded with the <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/hoskins-pharmacare-1.4552739\" title=\"\">Hoskins Commission</a>, which will report this summer with a pharmacare plan. In England, the Commons committees behind the assembly have adopted most of its suggestions. A government green paper will follow this year.</p> <p>Would an assembly help to resolve Brexit? <a href=\"https://www.involve.org.uk/resources/blog/project-update/citizens-assembly-brexit-results-and-initial-reflections\" title=\"\">A trial run took place in October 2017</a>, at a hotel in Manchester. Organised by the charity Involve, the assembly brought together 25 leave voters, 22 remain voters and three people who did not vote. After two weekends, they chose to leave with a trade deal and preferential access for EU citizens, but not free movement. If they couldn\u2019t get such a deal, they wanted to remain in the single market, with free movement under tight controls. Recommending what he called \u201ca new kind of royal commission\u201d, Gordon Brown spoke in November of \u201ca dialogue about the difficult issues from migration to sovereignty and our long-term economic future, empowering all voices to be heard\u201d.</p> <p>This sounds marvellous, but if an assembly is to work, particularly on something as divisive as Brexit, we must foresee and understand the scepticism that will greet it. Matthew Taylor is the chief executive of the RSA, and has promoted deliberation in politics since the 90s. He often meets doubts about whether citizens\u2019 assemblies are fair, which is reasonable, given how little known they are. In particular, people doubt whether they are really representative, whether ordinary voters can grasp complex issues, and whether the process can be run impartially.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you have to take the plunge and do it,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you\u2019ve done it and people see, that they go: \u2018Oh, right. I can see that these people genuinely do represent the country.\u2019\u201d This is why Taylor believes it would be so important for a Brexit assembly to be open and televised. It would look like a stitch-up at first, in some eyes, but experience elsewhere shows it would earn its own legitimacy over time. The outcome need not be binding, but if a government chose to act against it, it would have to explain why. This way, politics could at last move forwards.</p> <p>Herraghty still doesn\u2019t talk much about his time at the assembly, but it came up by chance at work the other day. For the first time, he told his colleagues: \u201cI was a member of that.\u201d They looked at him, amazed. \u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the best experiences in my life.\u201d</p>",

Around a third of people will pretend to have an opinion, unless you make it easy to say \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. If you say that \u201cPresident Obama\u201d or \u201cthe Republicans\u201d want to repeal the Public Affairs Act, even more opinions appear, along partisan lines. The study tells us something that no politician will ever say within earshot of the people who elect them: we often don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about, but we don\u2019t like to admit it. This doesn\u2019t mean people are stupid. Quite the reverse. Stupid would be spending your time studying the minutiae of government legislation rather than working, caring for others, or enjoying life. After all, your opinion is just one of 47 million in the UK electorate, no matter how well informed you are. James Fishkin, a professor of political science at Stanford University and a leading advocate of \u201ccitizens\u2019 assemblies\u201d, a way of finding out what \u201cthe people\u201d really want, when they take some time to think it over, calls this \u201crational ignorance\u201d. Most of us simply don\u2019t need to know how to run the country. In November last year, Gordon Brown suggested that an assembly might resolve the Brexit crisis. Last month, Damon Albarn, Rowan Williams and a number of other public figures wrote an open letter to the Guardian in support, and the idea now has this newspaper\u2019s backing. Fishkin calls it \u201cembarrassingly simple\u201d. You just put the country in a room and let them talk. In 2016, for instance, when Ireland decided to reconsider its abortion laws, everyone braced for a fight. A bitter referendum 33 years earlier had given mothers and their unborn children equal rights to life under the eighth amendment of the constitution. It made legal abortions almost impossible in Ireland and created a national controversy that would not go away. To tackle the question, and four others, parliament established a citizens\u2019 assembly of 99 randomly selected Irish citizens, who would reflect the national balance of age, gender, class and region. They would be chaired by a supreme court judge (now retired), Mary Laffoy. No politicians would be involved. The first thing Neasa Keogh heard about it was a knock at the door of her house in Limerick. She had opinions on abortion, but had never been involved in politics in any way, besides voting. \u201cI was politically motivated when politicians came to my door,\u201d she says. \u201cI had often thought: \u2018We ought to do this, and we ought to do that.\u2019 But I never did anything about it.\u201d Now 58, Keogh had just retired from her job as a primary school teacher and could spare the time, and her travel to Dublin would be paid. Citizens\u2019 assemblies have to be transparent, however, and this would broadcast live online, which meant Keogh\u2019s name would be made public. She remembered \u201cthe hatred and the viciousness\u201d surrounding the eighth amendment in 1983. \u201cI was a little bit nervous about being targeted by rightwing elements,\u201d she says. But it was a chance to help her country, so she accepted. The assembly would meet at the Grand hotel, Malahide, north-east of Dublin, for a weekend every month, and it would be 18 months before all five topics were completed. In addition to the 99 citizens, there would be 100 substitutes in case some dropped out, which several did. Essentially, Keogh was to be one member of a gigantic jury, weighing a country\u2019s values rather than a person\u2019s innocence or guilt. On the morning of the launch event at Dublin Castle, another assembly member, Ois\u00edn Herraghty, set off early on the drive from County Mayo. Now 47, Herraghty is a technical manager at an arts centre. Like Keogh, he had been approached on his doorstep. He agreed to take part right away, then more or less forgot about it. \u201cI had the radio on in the car,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand the first item on the 8am news was the inaugural meeting of the citizens\u2019 assembly. I thought: \u2018Oh. That\u2019s me. The first item on the news, this must be bigger than I thought.\u2019\u201d At this point, he hadn\u2019t even told his family. The scale of the responsibility, and the honour, hit Keogh at the event itself. After short speeches from Laffoy and Enda Kenny, who was then the Taoiseach, they heard from three lawyers and academics about the history of social change in Ireland. \u201cSometimes you go to things and you think it\u2019s all a bit of a show, but it was all so genuine and heartfelt,\u201d says Keogh. Sessions began in earnest the following month. Although 199 people may be a microcosm of Ireland\u2019s 4.8 million citizens, it is still far too many for a productive conversation, so they were split into groups. Keogh found herself part of a table of six, with a balance of men and women and one person from each age band. Each table also had a facilitator and a note-taker. The facilitator policed the conversation, according to a page of guidelines. During expert presentations, if a citizen felt nervous about asking a question, the facilitator would ask it on their behalf. They heard from medical experts, priests and advocates from both sides. More than 13,000 submissions were received from members of the public, and the assembly members themselves requested to hear some other points of view. At the end of each meeting, they had to write a short report, to satisfy the chair that they had understood what they had heard. Before each session, they were given background information to read. They were not shown abortion images, but were otherwise spared no details. It was hard work. It was hard in many ways. Keogh had voted against the ban on abortion in 1983, and considers herself fairly liberal, but she remembers being asked: Do you think the unborn does not have an equal right to life? \u201cThat was like a belt to the solar plexus,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a mother of three children \u2026 I found that very, very difficult.\u201d The final meeting to consider abortion began on Saturday 22 April 2017. Most of the weekend was spent voting in private booths, and the results astonished Ireland. The assembly decided overwhelmingly to change the eighth amendment, and 64% recommended that parliament allow abortion without any restriction, up to either 12 or 22 weeks. Although it had been written off by some as a way to smother the controversy, the assembly ended up being far more radical than anyone expected, and more than many thought Ireland was ready for. A referendum was duly held to find out. Herraghty followed the campaign. \u201cI heard people on both sides pushing their views,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019d find myself going: \u2018Hang on a second. That\u2019s not true. Check your facts. That\u2019s not actually true.\u2019\u201d On 25 May 2018, the country approved the changes by 66% to 34%, just a touch above the margin at the Grand hotel. This might confirm some people\u2019s suspicions about citizens\u2019 assemblies. Isn\u2019t it just what you would expect to happen when you lock people in a hotel with a bunch of, no-doubt, liberal experts? Well, it might be, but experts aren\u2019t the only people an assembly has to hear from. In Ireland, the citizens themselves demanded more firsthand experience from those affected by the abortion ban. Accordingly, they heard a selection of audio recordings from six women, some of whom had travelled for abortions, some of whom had decided against it. In Limerick, some people told Keogh about their abortions, which they had kept secret for years. Assemblies can take the voice of ordinary people into the heart of politics. At the same time, they can solve the \u201cecho chamber\u201d problem by making people talk to others who don\u2019t share their opinions. \u201cThat was drilled into us,\u201d Keogh says. \u201cThat people had their views. Everyone had to be listened to. I found myself at tables where I had nothing in common with people, but we were still able to come to some consensus, or decide: \u2018We can\u2019t agree on that.\u2019 I met wonderful people. I met people like I\u2019d never met in my life.\u201d Citizens\u2019 assemblies are not unusual worldwide, nor new. An early televised experiment took place in Manchester in 1994, discussing crime. In 1996, under governor George W Bush, the state of Texas organised what it called a \u201cdeliberative poll\u201d, which actively chose to pay a premium to generate power by wind instead of fossil fuels. (Texas still leads the US in wind power.) In 2006, a citizens\u2019 assembly recommended electoral reform in the Netherlands. In 2011, the Japanese government commissioned a deliberative poll on nuclear power and the future of the pension system. In Gdansk, Poland, a citizens\u2019 assembly met in 2016 to consider flood prevention, and they have tackled other subjects, such as migration, since. (Sadly, the pioneering mayor behind it, Pawel Adamowicz, was murdered at the weekend.) Nonetheless, the process remains obscure, even in Canada, where local and national assemblies are common, and where they are sometimes called \u201creference panels\u201d. \u201cOne day a letter showed up at my house,\u201d says Syd Burdett, 27, from British Columbia, \u201cand it was like: \u2018Hey, we want people for this reference panel about pharmacare. We\u2019ll pay for you to come out to Ottawa for a week.\u2019\u201d The national government wanted a sample of 35 people from across Canada to tell it how to pay for medicines. Burdett had been about to quit his job in a convenience store anyway. On a whim, he accepted. As things stand, people have free medical care for everything except prescriptions outside hospitals. As a result, some do without the medicines they need. A pharmacare system would fix that, and save lives, but at a cost. Burdett says he had a vague idea of what a reference panel was, but had heard nothing about this one. When he arrived at the hotel in Ottawa, after a five-hour flight, he enjoyed it very much. \u201cIt reminded me a lot of being at university,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an academic experience, in a way.\u201d Over the week, Burdett\u2019s group heard from academic, medical and commercial experts. One woman brought her new baby, who behaved very well. Discussions were quite technical at times, but nothing was impenetrable. \u201cI think by the end of the week people had a pretty good understanding,\u201d Burdett says. At last, they did recommend pharmacare, paid for by higher taxes. You can see why assemblies are winning the love of politicians. When something necessary but unpopular must be done, such as raising taxes, they move the responsibility on to the people who stand to suffer, who have no reason to lie, no votes to win, no need to pretend that they hold all the answers. At the same time, assemblies bring more authority than some decorative consultation, and more clarity than a referendum. Indeed, in England, they are already on the way. Rebecca Weight is 31 and works at a museum in London. She subscribes to online surveys so she wasn\u2019t surprised when an email arrived last year, asking if she would be willing to spend two weekends in a hotel in Birmingham, discussing the future of adult social care. She would be paid \u00a3300, plus expenses. \u201cI\u2019ve done focus group-type things,\u201d she says. \u201cIt seemed it might be similar to that, but maybe something with a little bit more meaning.\u201d It turned out to be the country\u2019s first true citizens\u2019 assembly, commissioned by the House of Commons. On 27 April 2018, Weight set off to join the other 46 citizens. \u201cIt was a real cross-section of people,\u201d she says. \u201cI was quite surprised by how diverse the group was.\u201d They had dinner, got to know each other, and the next day the problem of adult social care in England was set out before them. It turned out to be quite simple. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough money to pay for it,\u201d says Weight. Like every participant I spoke to, Weight found it challenging and enjoyable. She would have liked to hear more firsthand experience of the care system, but, overall, she felt they got enough from the many experts to form a reliable opinion, if not to become expert themselves. In the end, the assembly recommended paying for universal adult social care with higher taxes. It remains to be seen what the authorities will do with the wisdom of Burdett and Weigh, and their fellow citizens. In Canada, the federal government responded with the Hoskins Commission, which will report this summer with a pharmacare plan. In England, the Commons committees behind the assembly have adopted most of its suggestions. A government green paper will follow this year. Would an assembly help to resolve Brexit? A trial run took place in October 2017, at a hotel in Manchester. Organised by the charity Involve, the assembly brought together 25 leave voters, 22 remain voters and three people who did not vote. After two weekends, they chose to leave with a trade deal and preferential access for EU citizens, but not free movement. If they couldn\u2019t get such a deal, they wanted to remain in the single market, with free movement under tight controls. Recommending what he called \u201ca new kind of royal commission\u201d, Gordon Brown spoke in November of \u201ca dialogue about the difficult issues from migration to sovereignty and our long-term economic future, empowering all voices to be heard\u201d. This sounds marvellous, but if an assembly is to work, particularly on something as divisive as Brexit, we must foresee and understand the scepticism that will greet it. Matthew Taylor is the chief executive of the RSA, and has promoted deliberation in politics since the 90s. He often meets doubts about whether citizens\u2019 assemblies are fair, which is reasonable, given how little known they are. In particular, people doubt whether they are really representative, whether ordinary voters can grasp complex issues, and whether the process can be run impartially. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have to take the plunge and do it,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you\u2019ve done it and people see, that they go: \u2018Oh, right. I can see that these people genuinely do represent the country.\u2019\u201d This is why Taylor believes it would be so important for a Brexit assembly to be open and televised. It would look like a stitch-up at first, in some eyes, but experience elsewhere shows it would earn its own legitimacy over time. The outcome need not be binding, but if a government chose to act against it, it would have to explain why. This way, politics could at last move forwards. Herraghty still doesn\u2019t talk much about his time at the assembly, but it came up by chance at work the other day. For the first time, he told his colleagues: \u201cI was a member of that.\u201d They looked at him, amazed. \u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the best experiences in my life.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thailand\u2019s immigration chief has pledged a reversal of the country\u2019s notoriously harsh treatment of refugees following the global furore around a young Saudi woman\u2019s attempt to seek asylum. Speaking on Wednesday, the newly appointed head of immigration, Surachate Hakparn, said refugees would no longer be returned home \u201cinvoluntarily\u201d. This would be a major shift in the long-running policy in Thailand of refusing to recognise and shelter asylum seekers and frequently returning them to countries where they are in danger. Thailand is also not a signatory to the UN convention on refugees. Surachate pledged that going forward, when it comes to asylum seekers, Thailand \u201cwill now follow international norms\u201d. Thailand\u2019s draconian immigration policies have been under the global spotlight over the past week, following the case of 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed from Saudi Arabia, who fled her abusive family and attempted to seek asylum in Australia. She captured headlines across the world after she was intercepted during a stopover in Bangkok and immediately prepared for deportation back to Saudi Arabia by Thai immigration authorities. It was only after Mohammed barricaded herself in a Bangkok hotel room and began tweeting her plight to the world, drawing international publicity and support, that Thailand made the rare exception to release her into the care of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and be given asylum in Canada, arriving in Toronto on Saturday. Surachate was adamant however that the Thai authorities had not caved to \u201cpressure\u201d in Mohammed\u2019s case. However, inconsistencies in Surachate\u2019s pledges to reform the Thai immigration process were already exposed in his comments on the ongoing case of Hakeem al-Araibi. Al-Araibi, a Bahraini refugee with permanent residency in Australia, was taken into detention when he arrived in Bangkok for a holiday in November, and faces deportation back to Bahrain where he says he will be at risk of torture. Al-Araibi, a former footballer for the Bahrain national team who now plays semi-professional football in Melbourne, was picked up by Thai immigration on an Interpol red notice, despite having refugee status in Australia since 2017. Australia has made repeated calls for him to be released and returned home to Australia. Surachate said the case was \u201cdifferent\u201d because there was an \u201coutstanding warrant\u201d for him, despite the fact that the Interpol red notice, requested by Bahrain and erroneously issued against Interpol\u2019s own refugee-protection protocols, has since been lifted. Thailand is instead processing a formal extradition request from Bahrain, and Surachate would only say that al-Araibi would be able to make his case \u201cin court\u201d. Surachate\u2019s appointment as department chief has been marked by a harsh crackdown on illegal immigrants over the past three months, which has resulted in women and children refugees, who had previously been released on bail, rounded up again and put back into detention \u2013 described as \u201cgovernment shelters\u201d \u2013 despite an earlier promise by the government to no longer detain single mothers and children. However, speaking on Wednesday, Surachate pledged that mothers and children held in immigration detention would be given bail.",

      "bodyText": "A new project that uses technology to track the movements of food through the supply chain will aim to inform consumers whether items such as fish they buy at a restaurant were produced legally and sustainably. The new venture is called OpenSC and uses product QR codes that consumers can scan with a smartphone to automatically display information on where the product was caught, when and how it was produced, what its journey through the supply chain looked like, and even its carbon miles and what temperature it was stored at. The tracking platform, which has been developed with WWF and BCG Digital Ventures, follows an award-winning pilot by the environment NGO that tracked tuna caught in the Pacific. To work, businesses dealing with products such as seafood must make a choice to attach a digital tag at the point of catch, and then again at the point of production, and link their products in a blockchain platform. On Thursday, chef Matt Moran cooked one of the first products to be tracked using OpenSC \u2013 a Patagonian toothfish caught in sub-Antarctic waters by Austral Fisheries, an MSC-certified sustainable fishery that sells its fish into 13 countries. The Patagonian toothfish is a deep sea fish that is prized by high-end restaurants and has historically been a victim of illegal poaching. At a restaurant, consumers could scan either a set menu or a token to track the journey of the fish on their plate. David Carter, the chief executive of Austral Fisheries, said the company was interested in the OpenSC project because it had taken steps to reduce its carbon footprint and wanted consumers to think about the climate impact of the foods they purchase. \u201cWe see how climate change affects our fisheries and we want our products to be a catalyst for the choices consumers make around climate,\u201d he said. While the toothfish is a high-end product that average consumers might not eat, the developers of the platform say they plan to expand to larger markets and are working on projects with the beef and timber industries. \u201cThe ambition here is to stretch across all the commodities that affect the degradation of this planet and human rights and workers\u2019 rights,\u201d the OpenSC CEO, Markus Mutz said. \u201cWe feel like the technology has the potential to absolutely reach the mass market and that is absolutely what we want to do. \u201cSome of the commodities that we are currently working on are well below the price point of the more exclusive fish like the Patagonian toothfish.\u201d Dermot O\u2019Gorman, the CEO of WWF Australia, said the idea was to create \u201ca whole new level of transparency about whether the food we eat is contributing to environmental degradation or social injustice such as slavery.\u201d",

Now smaller contractors are beginning to understand that Australians will punish companies that threaten their future.\u201d Adani, which usually ignores the actions of anti-coal groups, criticised the protesters in a statement on Monday. \u201cOnce again we are seeing activist and anti-coal groups peddle misinformation in an attempt to create hysteria based on myths,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHad the group checked its facts, it would have found that the business which it caused disruption to ... is not a contractor for the Carmichael project. \u201cWe recognise there are varied opinions about the Carmichael project but when groups such as this disrupt private businesses, impacting employees and their families based on incorrect information, they should be held accountable. \u201cThe great thing about living in a democracy is that we can hold and express our different views. All we ask is that people\u2019s opinions are based on facts and that they don\u2019t put lives at risk through irresponsible, illegal and unsafe protest behaviour.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Looking at contemporary politics, it\u2019s easy to feel a sense of despair. All across the world, we see a resurgence of racist demagogues, now rendered respectable by the embrace of the \u201cmainstream\u201d political right and much of the commentariat. Pauline Hanson, once considered beyond the pale, is now barely distinguishable from Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison. On the other hand, across the English-speaking world and to some extent beyond, young people have moved sharply to the left.</p> <p>With capitalism having failed them, many are willing to embrace socialism. But what does \u201csocialism\u201d mean?</p> <p>For the moment, it may be enough to define socialism as social democracy with a spine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/09/socialism-with-a-spine-the-only-21st-century-alternative\">as I have before</a>. But to inspire the kind of movement we need to defeat reactionary racism, a positive vision of a socialist society is essential. This calls for a kind of utopian thinking that has been out of favour for a long time. That\u2019s in part because of the failure of so many utopian visions, and even more because of the need to defend the partially realised utopia of the mid-20th century social-democratic welfare state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/09/socialism-with-a-spine-the-only-21st-century-alternative\">Socialism with a spine: the only 21st century alternative | John Quiggin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I thought it might be worth trying to imagine life in Australia in 2050, a few decades into a socialist resurgence, though well before the emergence of society that could truly be described as socialist. In the utopian vein, I\u2019m going to look at a future where everything has gone as well as could reasonably be hoped. However, I\u2019m going to make every effort to be realistic in terms of the economic constraints involved, and not to invoke radical and unlikely changes in human nature.</p> <p>I\u2019ll start with a typical 30-year old, born just a couple of years in our future. I\u2019ll call him/her Ali, and leave other details unspecified for now. Like most young people in the 2030s and 2040s, Ali completed high school and went on to further education, all of which had been made free as one of the earliest measures of the socialist government elected in 2025.</p> <p>Ali\u2019s partner, Sam, was one of the exceptions, finding school a bore and not having the aptitude for a skilled trade training. Instead of free education, Sam received a grant of $100,000 at age 20, to be used in starting up a small business, in Sam\u2019s case, a coffee shop. (A society without coffee shops would be a pretty poor excuse for utopia.)</p> <p>Ali works at a community-run credit union. The resurgence of credit unions followed the downfall of the global banking sector that dominated late-20th century financial capitalism. After the Second Global Financial Crisis of 2021, and the long depression that followed it, no government anywhere was willing to risk giving financiers another chance to destroy the economy. Investment banks and hedge funds were shut down. Financial transactions taxes, of a kind first proposed by 20th century economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/13/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">James Tobin</a>, made short-term financial trading of all kinds unprofitable. Commercial banking is once again dull and safe, as it was in the 1950s, a refuge for unadventurous souls with a knack for figures. Tight regulation and the dominant role of publicly owned institutions have seen to that.

      "bodyText": "Looking at contemporary politics, it\u2019s easy to feel a sense of despair. All across the world, we see a resurgence of racist demagogues, now rendered respectable by the embrace of the \u201cmainstream\u201d political right and much of the commentariat. Pauline Hanson, once considered beyond the pale, is now barely distinguishable from Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison. On the other hand, across the English-speaking world and to some extent beyond, young people have moved sharply to the left. With capitalism having failed them, many are willing to embrace socialism. But what does \u201csocialism\u201d mean? For the moment, it may be enough to define socialism as social democracy with a spine, as I have before. But to inspire the kind of movement we need to defeat reactionary racism, a positive vision of a socialist society is essential. This calls for a kind of utopian thinking that has been out of favour for a long time. That\u2019s in part because of the failure of so many utopian visions, and even more because of the need to defend the partially realised utopia of the mid-20th century social-democratic welfare state. I thought it might be worth trying to imagine life in Australia in 2050, a few decades into a socialist resurgence, though well before the emergence of society that could truly be described as socialist. In the utopian vein, I\u2019m going to look at a future where everything has gone as well as could reasonably be hoped. However, I\u2019m going to make every effort to be realistic in terms of the economic constraints involved, and not to invoke radical and unlikely changes in human nature. I\u2019ll start with a typical 30-year old, born just a couple of years in our future. I\u2019ll call him/her Ali, and leave other details unspecified for now. Like most young people in the 2030s and 2040s, Ali completed high school and went on to further education, all of which had been made free as one of the earliest measures of the socialist government elected in 2025. Ali\u2019s partner, Sam, was one of the exceptions, finding school a bore and not having the aptitude for a skilled trade training. Instead of free education, Sam received a grant of $100,000 at age 20, to be used in starting up a small business, in Sam\u2019s case, a coffee shop. (A society without coffee shops would be a pretty poor excuse for utopia.) Ali works at a community-run credit union. The resurgence of credit unions followed the downfall of the global banking sector that dominated late-20th century financial capitalism. After the Second Global Financial Crisis of 2021, and the long depression that followed it, no government anywhere was willing to risk giving financiers another chance to destroy the economy. Investment banks and hedge funds were shut down. Financial transactions taxes, of a kind first proposed by 20th century economist James Tobin, made short-term financial trading of all kinds unprofitable. Commercial banking is once again dull and safe, as it was in the 1950s, a refuge for unadventurous souls with a knack for figures. Tight regulation and the dominant role of publicly owned institutions have seen to that. Meanwhile, community banks and credit unions like the one where Ali works handle the finance of most families and small businesses. Like most workplaces, Ali\u2019s credit union is open for the standard four-day, 30-hour week. With Monday as a regular day off, Ronald Conway\u2019s sardonic description of Australia as \u201cthe land of the long weekend\u201d is now a reality. With eight weeks\u2019 annual leave and additional public holidays, Ali works around 1,200 hours a year, about average for full-time workers. The shift to a four-and-a-half day week beginning in 2033 was, amazingly in retrospect, the first reduction in standard working hours in 50 years, resuming a trend that had cut annual working hours in half between the mid 19th and late 20th centuries.

Output per hour worked doubled over 30 years as a result of technological progress. Moreover, many of the wasteful and unproductive activities of the market economy have disappeared, so that the social value of production has increased even more.

      "bodyText": "Just days into his quest to become the first Latino presidential nominee in US history, Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Obama administration housing chief, campaigned in New Hampshire, home to the first primary in the nation. While candidates often make a beeline to either Iowa or New Hampshire after declaring they are running, Castro\u2019s visit to the Granite state on Wednesday was the second stop of his new campaign after returning from Puerto Rico, a US territory where citizens are ineligible to vote in presidential elections. \u201cI went to San Juan, Puerto Rico, because I want every single American to know that everyone counts,\u201d Castro told guests invited to a Politics and Eggs event hosted by Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire\u2019s largest city, on Wednesday morning. \u201cIf we\u2019ve faced any crisis over these last two years, it\u2019s that we have an administration that doesn\u2019t believe that. It is picking and choosing who gets opportunity and who doesn\u2019t based on what you look like, based on your faith, based on how long you\u2019ve been in this country.\u201d Castro\u2019s two-day jaunt to New Hampshire featured no rallies and just one public event: a meet-and-greet at a coffee shop on Tuesday night. On Wednesday in Manchester, he told business leaders of his visions for a fairer and more prosperous America in the 21st century. He then travelled nearly 50 miles north to the small city of Laconia, the seat of a county where Donald Trump saw his most dominant victory in the state in 2016, to tour its downtown and visit an addiction treatment centre. In Laconia, Castro seemed most interested in learning about the challenges local business face and the ways the opioid crisis has ravaged this former mill town and other areas of New England. Perhaps Castro\u2019s unconventional style of early campaigning \u2013 marked by his Puerto Rico visit and the lack of rallies in New Hampshire \u2013 can help raise his profile as he enters a crowded Democratic primary field filled with political superstars. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren announced her exploratory committee on New Year\u2019s Eve; Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard announced that she would seek the presidency last week; New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand threw her hat in the ring on Tuesday. Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke are all tipped as contenders. In New Hampshire, Castro got his first \u201cofficial\u201d taste of the campaign trail. \u201cHere in New Hampshire, ya\u2019ll take your politics as seriously as we take our barbecue in Texas,\u201d he told the audience in Manchester, remarking on the state\u2019s once every four years political fervour. For many in New Hampshire, the visit was the first introduction to Castro. As the candidate walked down a snow-piled Main Street in Laconia and dropped into local businesses, many did not seem to recognize him and instead appeared taken aback by the flock of cameras following him. Laconia resident and business owner Carlos Cardona, who was helping guide Castro through the city, told him not to worry; when Barack Obama first visited downtown Laconia in 2007, nobody knew who he was either. In Manchester, Castro sought to introduce voters to his political platforms. Among them: using his first executive order to recommit the US to the Paris agreement, universal healthcare, universal pre-kindergarten, tuition-free colleges, reforming the criminal justice system, raising the minimum wage and finding affordable housing solutions. \u201cIt takes vision. My vision is that in the 21st century, America will be the smartest, healthiest, fairest and most prosperous nation on earth,\u201d he told the crowd. Speaking to the Guardian, Castro laid out a foreign policy platform that involved repairing damaged alliances and moving away from the \u201cerratic\u201d decision-making of the Trump administration. \u201cThe number one thing I am going to do as president, at the beginning of my administration if I\u2019m elected, is to repair the damaged relationships that this administration has caused around the world,\u201d he said. Washington should forge new alliances, Castro said, particularly in Latin America. If citizens of those nations can feel safe in their home countries, he argued, it could help stem the flow of migrants arriving at the US\u2019s southern border. On Syria, Castro said he supported withdrawing US troops, but in a \u201csensible way\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s been missing from the president\u2019s foreign policy has been a consistent and well thought out approach,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has been very erratic. And that\u2019s what needs to change in the next administration.\u201d While Cardona, one of Castro\u2019s guides through Laconia, said he hopes to welcome more Democratic candidates to the city and remains undecided, he appeared enthusiastic about Castro. \u201cAs a Latino myself, I think it\u2019s important that we have a Latino standing up during this administration,\u201d he said, adding that he considered Castro a \u201ctop tier\u201d candidate. And if he does take the nomination, Castro believes he can beat Trump. \u201cI believe that the Democratic nominee in 2020, whoever he or she is, will be able to win that election. Because I think more and more people are seeing that we\u2019re falling short with this president, that America can do much better,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m confident that if I\u2019m the nominee, I can win in 2020.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following along today! You can read more on what\u2019s happening with the SOTU here: Here\u2019s a breakdown of what else happened today: Just weeks after Trump declared victory over ISIS and announced he would pull troops out of Syria, the terrorist group attacked a military convoy killing 19. Four Americans were among the victims. Senator Chuck Schumer responded with condolences while Senator Rand Paul released a statement of support for the President. Paul\u2019s statement came after a meeting he and other Republicans had with Trump to discuss military policy in Syria. The longest shutdown in US history will drag on as lawmakers failed to find solutions today. Trump signed a bill guaranteeing back-pay for furloughed federal workers, but many are struggling to make ends meet in the interim. TSA employees are not showing up for work at increasing rates while the USDA will call on workers to start coming in again tomorrow. Cardi B pushed her fans to do something in a scathing video on Instagram. Cardi B has officially weighed in on the government shutdown, and she is not happy. In a video posted to Instagram the rapper criticized Trump and told her fans it was time for action, saying she felt bad for the federal workers who aren\u2019t getting paid. \u201cHey Ya\u2019ll! I just want to remind you because it has been a little over three weeks\u201d she quipped to her nearly 40 million Instagram followers, \u201cTrump is now ordering, as in summoning, federal government workers to go back to work without getting paid\u201d. She advised commenters not to try to bring up the shutdown that occurred under Obama, during the dispute over the Affordable Care Act. \u201cYeah Bitch! For healthcare\u201d she said before adding some colorful examples. \u201cWe really need to take this serious\u201d she added. \u201cI feel like we need to take some action\u201d. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has tweeted a response to the news that American service members were among the 19 killed by a suicide bomb in Syria, an attack that has been claimed by ISIS. The bombing came just weeks after President Trump declared a victory against The Islamic State and announced that he was pulling troops out of Syria. According to The New York Times, there have been at least six attacks by ISIS this month and the terrorist organization. The attack targeted an American military convoy in the northern city of Manbij while troops were inside the Palace of the Princes, a restaurant where they often stopped to eat during patrols, residents said. While the Americans were inside, a nearby suicide attacker wearing an explosive vest blew himself up. The bombing raised new questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise decision last month to end the American ground war in Syria. Critics of the president\u2019s plans, including members of his own party, said Mr. Trump\u2019s claim of victory over the Islamic State may have emboldened its fighters and encouraged Wednesday\u2019s strike\u201d. The US Department of Agriculture will call furloughed employees back to work on Thursday, reopening 980 agency offices that are responsible for processing farm loans and tax documents, Reuters reports. In a statement released today, the agency announced that roughly 2,500 FSA employees are being asked to work without pay for the next three workdays. \u201cUntil Congress sends President Trump an appropriations bill in the form that he will sign, we are doing our best to minimize the impact of the partial federal funding lapse on America\u2019s agricultural producers,\u201d U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. \u201cWe are bringing back part of our FSA team to help producers with existing farm loans\u201d. Representative Andy Harris, who was seen walking through the halls with far-right troll Chuck C. Johnson, has now released a statement saying the congressman was \u201cunaware of [Johnson\u2019s] previous associations\u201dand was meeting to discuss genetic sequencing. \u201cOf course I disavow and condemn white supremacy and anti-semitism\u201d. The Washington Post reports that a new policy being developed at the Pentagon may restrict recruitment of US citizens with foreign ties. Anonymous sources told the Post that the memo outlining the plan will be distributed by February 15, and will likely affect thousands of new recruits: The documents reveal how the Pentagon is grappling with the dual challenge of thoroughly screening prospective recruits for potential security threats and finding enough men and women willing to join the military. The Armed Forces have long sought green-card holders as recruits, marketing such jobs as a chance to attain U.S. citizenship\u201d. Worried that an official censure against Representative Steve King for racist remarks might set a precedent and open up members to politically-motivated attacks on speech, House Democratic leaders opted out of a vote and instead will pass the measure on to the House Ethics Committee. The move to censure followed a resolution, which was resoundingly passed Tuesday, to rebuke racism. Per the Washington Post: But Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.) sought to go further by censuring King and pressed for a vote on Wednesday. After the House clerk read the resolution detailing King\u2019s inflammatory comments over the years, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) moved to refer the matter to the Ethics Committee \u2014 a move that could bottle up the effort indefinitely\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a good thing for us to talk about censure for things that are done outside of the business of the House of Representatives\u201d House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn told the Washington Post. \u201cWe should be very, very careful about doing anything that constrains, or seems to constrain, speech\u201d. Senator Rand Paul, who met with the president today to discuss foreign policy, tweeted his resounding support for Trump\u2019s position on troop withdrawal. The meeting to discuss US military presence, which included several Republican senators, assembled shortly after 19 people, including 4 Americans, were killed by a suicide bomber in northern Syria. The bombing has been claimed by the Islamic State. In December, Trump announced that he would begin withdrawing troops from Syria, claiming \u201cWe have won against ISIS\u201d. As the shutdown continues into its 26th day, TSA employees are calling in sick at increasing rates. According to a press release from the agency, the rate of unscheduled absences doubled over the previous date in 2018, as \u201cmany employees are reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations\u201d. Still, 1.6 million passengers were screened. Just one day after the House overwhelmingly voted to reject white nationalism \u2014 a mostly symbolic gesture that falls short of an official censure \u2014 Huffpost reporter Matt Fuller spotted Chuck C. Johnson, an alt-right activist and Holocaust denier who was removed from Twitter in 2015 after trying to crowdfund violence against Black Lives Matter leaders, being welcomed by representatives. Gabrielle Canon here, taking over for Ben Jacobs. For those who are just joining us, here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far today: House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, asked the president to delay his State of the Union address until the shutdown ends, citing concerns over security. She told reporters Trump could deliver the speech from \u201cthe Oval Office if he wants\u201d. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee followed up with a statement expressing his support. Meanwhile, Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen pushed back, tweeting that her agency is able to handle the risks. An official disinvitation from the speaker has yet to be issued. The Senate failed to advance a measure that would stop the Trump Administration from lifting sanctions against Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The shutdown stalemate continues. Trump signed a bill guaranteeing pay for furloughed federal workers but they won\u2019t see that money until the shutdown ends. Senator Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, told reporters a bipartisan plan to reopen short-term while negotiations continue is unlikely to be implemented and will only happen when \u201cdonkeys fly\u201d. Trump signed a bill today to guarantee pay for federal employees furloughed during the shutdown. The legislation means that they will paid eventually but have no means of covering bills in the meantime. It also doesn\u2019t effect those on contracts with the government. President Donald Trump is now meeting with several Republican senators at the White House from across the ideological spectrum about the U.S. military presence in Syria. A new report from the inspector general of the General Services Adminstration says that the agency, which oversees government owned property, improperly ignored constitutional concerns over Donald Trump\u2019s lease of the Old Post Office building in Washington for a hotel. As the Washington Post puts it: Trump\u2019s company won the lease several years before he became president. After Trump was elected, the agency had to decide if his company would be allowed to keep its lease. At that time, the inspector general found, the agency should have determined if the lease violates the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which bar presidents from taking payments from foreign governments, or individual U.S. states. But it did not, according to the report issued Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2026found that [the agency] improperly ignored these Emoluments Clauses, even though the lease itself requires compliance with the laws of the United States, including the Constitution,\u201d said the report. Beto O\u2019Rourke seems to have started a road trip and it\u2019s chronicled in an unusual Medium post for a potential presidential candidate. Have been stuck lately. In and out of a funk. My last day of work was January 2nd. It\u2019s been more than twenty years since I was last not working. Maybe if I get moving, on the road, meet people, learn about what\u2019s going on where they live, have some adventure, go where I don\u2019t know and I\u2019m not known, it\u2019ll clear my head, reset, I\u2019ll think new thoughts, break out of the loops I\u2019ve been stuck in. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chair of the Homeland Security Committee has issued a statement supporting Pelosi on the State of the Union. \u201cI wholeheartedly support Speaker Pelosi\u2019s call to delay the State of the Union address until the government re-opens. The Secret Service is the lead federal agency in charge of facilitating security for the yearly State of the Union address, but because of the Trump shutdown, the agency is currently not fully operational. It would be completely inappropriate for President Trump to further deplete the agency\u2019s resources and manpower for the sole purpose of having an hour of uninterrupted primetime television coverage. \u201cToday, nearly four weeks after the President shut down the government over his ineffective, wasteful border wall, hundreds of thousands of federal employees are still being held hostage \u2013 and our national security is becoming more vulnerable every day. President Trump needs to bring a swift end to his absurd temper tantrum and reopen the government immediately.\u201d A congressional colleague has come to Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s aid as the Hawaii congresswoman has faced criticism for past homophobic remarks ahead of the launch of her presidential campaign. Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary tweets that her department would be fully prepared to handle the State of the Union even with the ongoing partial shutdown in the first response from anyone in the Trump administration to Pelosi\u2019s letter this morning. Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House of Representatives slams Paul Ryan, although not by name, for not taking action on Steve King during Ryan\u2019s tenure in the House. As Theresa May narrowly survived a confidence vote in the UK just now over Brexit, one Democratic presidential candidate has already weighed in on the British political crisis. Former Congressman John Delaney of Maryland said yesterday: \u201cThe truth is Brexit was never honestly sold to voters, which is why the UK finds itself in such a difficult position right now. \u201cLeaving the European Union will, in fact, hurt British citizens, but staying is not an option after a referendum, unless they have a second.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters earlier this afternoon that Trump can give the State of the Union \u201cfrom the Oval Office if he wants.\u201d Steny Hoyer has walked back his comments on that \u201cthe State of the Union is off.\u201d However, another member of Democratic leadership seems to view the situation differently. Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana is not optimistic, to say the least, about the possibility of a short term compromise to reopen the government. Bernie Sanders is currently meeting with a number of former staffers who are concerned about a pattern of sexual misconduct and harassment on his 2016 campaign. The Vermont senator is considered likely to run for President again in 2020. An effort to keep the Trump administration from lifting sanctions on Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska just failed in the Senate. The measure needed 60 votes to advance but only received 57. Its failure means that sanctions on Deripaska, who once employed Paul Manafort, will be lifted this week. The White House has issued a statement on Trump\u2019s meeting with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus this afternoon. The President and his team had a constructive meeting with bipartisan members of the problem solvers caucus. They listened to one another and now both have a good understanding of what the other wants. We look forward to more conversations like this.\u201d Axios reports that Trump\u2019s derision for forward planning was inspired by Mike Tyson. Trump is apparently fond of citing Tyson\u2019s famous saying \u201cEverybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d Instead, Trump reportedly views constant combat as a substitute. We\u2019ve just gotta fight every day and that\u2019s how we win.\u201d \u201cWe can plan all this stuff out but it\u2019ll change,\u201d the president continued. \u201cSo let\u2019s just not go through the effort.\u201d The Washington Post reports that T-Mobile CEO John Legere has become a regular guest at the Trump hotel in Washington as he seeks government approval for T-Mobile to merge with Sprint. By mid-June, seven weeks after the announcement of the merger, hotel records indicated that one T-Mobile executive was making his 10th visit to the hotel. Legere appears to have made at least four visits to the Trump hotel, walking the lobby in his T-Mobile gear. These visits highlight a stark reality in Washington, unprecedented in modern American history. Trump the president works at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Trump the businessman owns a hotel at 1100 Pennsylvania. Steny Hoyer, the Democratic majority leader in the House, makes plain \u201cthe State of the Union is off\u201d in an interview with CNN. It\u2019s worth looking at this time capsule at the shock felt in Washington in 1913 when Woodrow Wilson became the first president to deliver the State of the Union in person since John Adams. The Democrats meeting with Trump today have issued a statement that emphasizes \u201cwe must reopen the government\u201d and that \u201cwe accepted the White House\u2019s invitation to meet today to convey that message.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) squared off against Donald Trump\u2019s pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency today, urging him to acknowledge the science that shows climate change is a crisis requiring unprecedented action. Trump has referred to climate change as a hoax, but Andrew Wheeler, the former coal lobbyist who is headed toward easy approval by the Senate, said in his confirmation hearing that he would \u201cnot use the hoax word, myself.\u201d But he said he wouldn\u2019t call climate change \u201cthe greatest crisis.\u201d \u201cI consider it a huge issue that has to be addressed globally,\u201d Wheeler said. Wheeler, the interim administrator of EPA, said he is limited by the laws Congress has passed and that adaptation efforts would help with rising sea levels, \u201cabsent additional congressional authority.\u201d Sanders pushed Wheeler to take a leadership role on climate. \u201cWe have people here who don\u2019t believe in climate change,\u201d he said, referring to senators including Jim Inhofe, a senior member of the committee who prominently doubts man-made climate change. Protestors interrupted Wheeler\u2019s initial statements and were escorted out by security. \u201cShut Down Wheeler, not the EPA,\u201d they yelled from outside. All but EPA\u2019s most critical functions have been shuttered for several weeks as the president has refused to fund the government without money to build a border wall. One of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s most stalwart opponents, Kathleen Rice, has been denied a slot on the House Judiciary Committee. Politico reports that the New York Democrat was blocked after leading the effort to stop Pelosi from being re-elected as Speaker and voting against her on the floor of the House. Pelosi lobbied for other members to join the panel over Rice, leaving the third-term New York Democrat off a list of her preferred members for the committee during a tense closed-door meeting Tuesday night, according to multiple sources. The effort came despite a full-court push from the New York delegation to secure a spot for Rice, a former prosecutor, on the panel that oversees everything from impeachment to guns to immigration. The push by Pelosi was seen as payback by many in the room after Rice was one of the main megaphones behind a campaign to block the California Democrat from becoming speaker again. \u201cShe was boxed out and the result was cooked before we walked in the room,\u201d said a source in the room. \u201cIf you went by seniority then yes [she would have got the position]. But that\u2019s not what happened. Scores being settled was first priority.\u201c In his nomination hearing to be EPA Administrator, Andrew Wheeler is not exactly coming across as a hawk on climate change. A bipartisan group of senators are sending a letter to Trump in an effort to try to forge a compromise and reopen the government for three weeks while Congress debates border security. Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts will speak to a local gathering of New Hampshire Democrats next month. Moulton, who was one of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s most vocal foes inside the Democratic caucus before reaching a deal to support her as Speaker, had been attempting to increase his national profile before the midterms and visited Iowa. However, the buzz around a potential 2020 campaign around him had died down recently. Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown will be traveling to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina next month as part of a \u201cDignity at Work tour\u201d as he edges closer to a presidential bid. As Buzzfeed reports: Dignity of work has been the core message for Brown since he won his third Senate term last fall \u2014 as his allies like to note, in a state President Donald Trump won decisively in 2016. The sentiment has roots in a Martin Luther King Jr. speech weeks before his assassination and meshes with Brown\u2019s longtime advocacy for blue-collar workers and organized labor. He\u2019s been a staunch opponent of trade pacts such as NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. And he\u2019s known in Ohio for a populism that predates Trump and lacks the president\u2019s nationalistic fervor. Some history here on the State of the Union which mandated under Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has asked Donald Trump to reschedule the State of the Union because of the ongoing government shutdown. Pelosi asks Trump to either deliver the address in writing or to pick a different date because of shutdown related security issues. Sarah Sanders declines to comment directly on Donald Trump\u2019s views on Steve King but instead draws the contrast with Democratic silence on newly-elected congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who has invoked an anti-Semitic canard on social media. While speaking to reporters in New York, Gillibrand says she doesn\u2019t want her own superPAC and says other candidates shouldn\u2019t have them as well. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says Trump has been briefed on the terrorist attack by ISIS in Manbij, Syria. There are reports that four American soldiers were killed in the attack. \u201cThe President has been fully briefed and we will continue to monitor the ongoing situation in Syria. For any specific questions please contact the Department of Defense.\u201d Kirsten Gillibrand is holding a press event this morning in Troy, New York where she will have her campaign headquarters after announcing a bid for the White House on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night. Good morning. Donald Trump is meeting with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus at the White House today as the partial government shutdown continues, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced she\u2019d be exploring a presidential bid last night and the confirmation hearing for Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee Bill Barr will continue today. It\u2019s Wednesday in American politics.",

The administration\u2019s long-delayed missile defence review, which the president will present at the Pentagon, will call for the expansion of the US network of sensors and interceptors designed to identify and shoot down incoming projectiles from \u201crogue states\u201d such as Iran and North Korea. Since the last review in 2010, a senior administration official said, \u201cwe have seen a really significant change to the threat environment\u201d. \u201cWhat the missile defence review responds to is an environment in which our potential adversaries have been rapidly developing, and fielding, a much more expanded range of new offensive missiles,\u201d the official said. \u201cThese missiles are capable of threatening the United States, threatening our allies, our partners, and our US forces abroad.\u201d Trump is likely to present the review as a justification for his order for the creation of a new \u201cspace force\u201d with its own command structure. \u201cSpace is a very important point of emphasis for the president, the vice-president and the missile defence review,\u201d the administration official said. \u201cIt is something that we want to invest in \u2026 Space is the key to the next step of missile defence.\u201d The review would commission further study of space-based interceptors and lasers but would not direct the production or deployment \u201cof anything specific\u201d. \u201cThat is an area that we are studying but not one we have made a concrete decision on whether or not to deploy yet,\u201d said the official briefing reporters ahead of the review\u2019s launch. The official insisted the expansion of the system would not be aimed at Russia and China, and the US continued to see nuclear deterrence as the best defence against the threat from those major nuclear weapons powers. \u201cThey have very large, sophisticated arsenals and we are postured to rely on our [nuclear] deterrence to deter Russia and China in that area,\u201d he said. Stephen Young, senior Washington representative for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: \u201cI am quite surprised that there is no terrible news there.\u201d \u201cThese are relatively sensible choices. They are not trying to use missile defence to address Russia and China and they are not pursuing space-based interceptors.\u201d On the other hand, he added: \u201cThey are going to spend a lot more money on things that don\u2019t work very well, and Russia will be upset because of the expansion of the system.\u201d Young said the review was expected to order a major expansion of the US fleet of sea-based Aegis interceptors, upgraded so they are capable \u2013 at least theoretically \u2013 of shooting down intercontinental ballistic missiles. That is likely to be seen by Russia and China as a move to blunt their own nuclear deterrent, and therefore destabilising. The deployment of missile interceptors in eastern Europe is a major and longstanding source of tension between Washington and Moscow. The senior administration official said: \u201cWith respect to relations with Russia and China, the president relies on having good relations with the leaders of those countries. \u201cOur defence capabilities are purely defensive. The United States has been very transparent in the development of its missile defence capabilities, about what they are postured to defend against and our missile defence capabilities are primarily postured to stay ahead of rogue state threats.\u201d",

The lineup for Australian cinema in 2019 looks similarly eclectic, with a couple of big hitters sure to attract attention at the box office.</p> <p>Here are 10 titles soon to arrive on our screens. Be sure to also keep an eye out for the brilliant Adam Cullen biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/04/acute-misfortune-first-look-review-adam-cullen-biopic-is-an-enthralling-complex-triumph\">Acute Misfortune</a>, the gripping female-led drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/10/undertow-review-intensely-gripping-female-led-australian-drama\">Undertow</a> and the beautifully made but shockingly violent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/06/the-nightingale-review-jennifer-kent\">The Nightingale</a>, all of which Guardian Australia has already reviewed after the films played out on the festival circuit.</p> <p>The Very Excellent Mr Dundee \u2013 featuring Paul Hogan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/23/crocodile-dundee-was-sexist-racist-and-homophobic-lets-not-bring-that-back\">once again flogging a dead horse</a> \u2013 did not make it on to this list, because it can and should strike fear in the heart of all of us.

A luncheon? Murder! A dance hall? Murder! A beach? Murder! A vineyard? Murder! A jaunt down a lovely lakeside footpath in beautiful summer weather after a round of tea and scones?

Kurzel helmed one of the best modern Australian crime dramas (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/sep/05/snowtown-rewatched-a-supremely-unsettling-portrait-of-a-killer\">Snowtown</a>), one of the top Shakespeare adaptations in recent years (Macbeth), and the best film adaptation of a video game so far (Assassin\u2019s Creed).</p> <p>British actor George MacKay will play Ned without a beard (gasp!) \u2013 one of several indications that this will not be a standard-issue biopic.

The movie is warm and affecting but also credible as a historical document, touching on hard-hitting political elements including various forms of persecution of Indigenous people.</p> <h2><strong>I Am Woman</strong></h2> <p>Singer Helen Reddy\u2019s fist-pumping hit I Am Woman became a feminist anthem for the ages. Her real-life story suits the biopic format, given the Melbourne-born muso reportedly landed in New York in 1966 with $230 in her pocket, accompanied by her three-year-old daughter.</p> <p>The movie marks the feature film directorial debut of Unjoo Moon, working with crack cinematographer Dion Bebe (who won an Oscar for Memoirs of a Geisha). Rising star Tilda Cobham-Hervey will play Reddy.</p> <h2><strong>Nekrotronic</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/27/wyrmwood-road-of-the-damned-review-a-lean-mean-zombie-splatterfest\">Wyrmwood: Road of the Damned</a>, the splatterific low-budget feature film debut of brothers Kiah and Tristan Roache-Turner (with Kiah directing, Tristan producing and both co-writing) received the dubious distinction of becoming one of the most pirated movies in the world.</p> <p>For their follow-up film Nekrotronic, they move from the zombie genre to a more sensible, sedate and realistic concept \u2013 a completely normal and in no way batshit crazy story about \u201ca man who discovers that he is part of a secret sect of magical beings who hunt down and destroy demons in the internet\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Danger Close</strong></h2> <p>Kriv Stenders is a prolific genre-hopping director who cannot be pigeonholed. His finest work includes family films (Red Dog and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/25/red-dog-true-blue-review-a-splashy-sun-drenched-slice-of-australiana\">Red Dog: True Blue</a>), a riveting high school-set miniseries (The Principal) and a superb single-setting drama (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/26/boxing-day-rewatched-stirring-one-take-drama-about-a-reformed-criminal\">Boxing Day</a>).</p> <p>Danger Close sees him add another genre to the list: the war film. Stenders focuses on 1966\u2019s the Battle of Long Tan, one of the most traumatic engagements in Anzac history.

      "bodyText": "The best Australian films of 2018 were a bold and distinctive bunch, spanning genres and styles. The lineup for Australian cinema in 2019 looks similarly eclectic, with a couple of big hitters sure to attract attention at the box office. Here are 10 titles soon to arrive on our screens. Be sure to also keep an eye out for the brilliant Adam Cullen biopic Acute Misfortune, the gripping female-led drama Undertow and the beautifully made but shockingly violent The Nightingale, all of which Guardian Australia has already reviewed after the films played out on the festival circuit. The Very Excellent Mr Dundee \u2013 featuring Paul Hogan once again flogging a dead horse \u2013 did not make it on to this list, because it can and should strike fear in the heart of all of us. If you think that\u2019s too harsh, consult 2001\u2019s unwatchable Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles. Miss Fisher &amp; the Crypt of Tears The fabulously glamorous Australian sleuth Phryne Fisher (Essie Davis) has a Jessica Fletcher-like ability to encounter murders everywhere she goes. A luncheon? Murder! A dance hall? Murder! A beach? Murder! A vineyard? Murder! A jaunt down a lovely lakeside footpath in beautiful summer weather after a round of tea and scones? MURDER! With Davis of course leading the charge, Fisher will sashay herself around the world to investigate a mystery reportedly involving emeralds and an ancient curse. Miss Fisher &amp; the Crypt of Tears will be directed by Tony Tilse, the set-up director of the TV series. True History of the Kelly Gang Nobody in history is more qualified to bring the story of Australia\u2019s most legendary bush outlaw to the screen than director Justin Kurzel, who is extraordinarily talented at contriving a swelling sense of festering dread. Kurzel helmed one of the best modern Australian crime dramas (Snowtown), one of the top Shakespeare adaptations in recent years (Macbeth), and the best film adaptation of a video game so far (Assassin\u2019s Creed). British actor George MacKay will play Ned without a beard (gasp!) \u2013 one of several indications that this will not be a standard-issue biopic. The source material is author Peter Carey\u2019s blisteringly bold novel of the same name, adapted by Shaun Grant (who also wrote Snowtown and Jasper Jones). Judy and Punch The excellent Mia Wasikowska leads the cast of this reimagining of the classic puppet show, following two puppeteers keen to use the production as a way to escape a fictional backwaters town. Judy and Punch marks the feature film directorial debut of writer/director Mirrah Foulkes, who has described the film as \u201ca crazy mix of fantasy, feminism and fanaticism\u201d. It will also be the first Australian film produced by Vice Media. She Who Must Be Loved The life and legacy of the highly influential media figure Freda Glynn reminds us \u2013 as does the messages at the heart of this lovely documentary about her \u2013 that humility and timidity are not the same thing. Glynn \u2013 whose children include the film\u2019s director, Erica Glynn, and auteur Warwick Thornton \u2013 founded TV and radio networks across Australia, including co-founding the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association. The movie is warm and affecting but also credible as a historical document, touching on hard-hitting political elements including various forms of persecution of Indigenous people. I Am Woman Singer Helen Reddy\u2019s fist-pumping hit I Am Woman became a feminist anthem for the ages. Her real-life story suits the biopic format, given the Melbourne-born muso reportedly landed in New York in 1966 with $230 in her pocket, accompanied by her three-year-old daughter. The movie marks the feature film directorial debut of Unjoo Moon, working with crack cinematographer Dion Bebe (who won an Oscar for Memoirs of a Geisha). Rising star Tilda Cobham-Hervey will play Reddy. Nekrotronic Wyrmwood: Road of the Damned, the splatterific low-budget feature film debut of brothers Kiah and Tristan Roache-Turner (with Kiah directing, Tristan producing and both co-writing) received the dubious distinction of becoming one of the most pirated movies in the world. For their follow-up film Nekrotronic, they move from the zombie genre to a more sensible, sedate and realistic concept \u2013 a completely normal and in no way batshit crazy story about \u201ca man who discovers that he is part of a secret sect of magical beings who hunt down and destroy demons in the internet\u201d. Danger Close Kriv Stenders is a prolific genre-hopping director who cannot be pigeonholed. His finest work includes family films (Red Dog and Red Dog: True Blue), a riveting high school-set miniseries (The Principal) and a superb single-setting drama (Boxing Day). Danger Close sees him add another genre to the list: the war film. Stenders focuses on 1966\u2019s the Battle of Long Tan, one of the most traumatic engagements in Anzac history. The cast includes Travis Fimmel and Richard Roxburgh. Top End Wedding The director Wayne Blair\u2019s best-known film is the 2012 crowd-pleasing musical-drama The Sapphires, about a charismatic all-female group of Indigenous Australian singers. His latest, Top End Wedding, was co-written (with Joshua Tyler) by Miranda Tapsell, who played one of those singers. In the film, which will have its world premiere at this year\u2019s Sundance film festival, Tapsell returns to the big screen as a Sydney lawyer searching for her awol mother in the lead-up to her wedding. Not much else is known about it yet, beyond her co-stars: Gwilym Less, Shari Sebbens, Kerry Fox and Ursula Yovich. Animals Director Sophie Hyde\u2019s oeuvre includes the elegantly constructed gender-transitioning drama 52 Tuesdays and the funny and stylish ABC comedy Fucking Adelaide. Her new film adapts Emma Jane Unsworth\u2019s novel Animals, a tale of boozy female friendship. The book was described by the Guardian critic Kerry Hudson as a \u201cbrilliantly scathing\u201d text that \u201cbeautifully navigates the complexities of intimate relationships\u201d. The cast will be led by Holliday Grainger and Arrested Development\u2019s Alia Shawkat. Ride Like a Girl The real-life story of Australian jockey Michelle Payne has \u201cfeel good sports movie\u201d written all over it. According its official synopsis, Ride Like a Girl will explore how the champion racer \u201cbeat catastrophic injury and odds of 100-1 to become the first female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup\u201d. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how the director Rachel Griffiths (yes, that Rachel Griffiths) represents the horse-riding industry, given Payne in her 2015 victory speech took it to task for being \u201ca chauvinistic sport.\u201d",

Why on earth would you call a general election in the middle of that? It\u2019s deeply irresponsible.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ellwood said May\u2019s Brexit deal was voted down \u201cnot because you have another big idea waiting to slide into view, but because you have different caucuses join together in a coalition of convenience to vote this deal down.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He said that in his own constituency, he is being asked by voters to \u201cvote for no deal, vote for the Norway option, vote for a second referendum, it really is difficult to understand what leave really means, because it was never pointed out, there was never a manifesto statement that says this is what leave looks like.

To call on the government to seek to renegotiate the deal to achieve a specific outcome, be it a variation of the terms of the separation set out in the withdrawal agreement or providing clarity about the end state of future relations as set out in the political declaration. The main renegotiation possibilities would be: 1) Seeking changes to the text in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop arrangements; 2) Seeking a Canada-style deal: 3) Seeking to join the EEA through the EFTA pillar and remaining in a customs union with the EU or a variation on this.</p> \n   <p>4.

It did not generate big news, but there were some interesting lines. Here they are:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May signalled she is not willing to consider keeping the UK in a customs union for good (which is a Labour demand) when she opens cross-party talks on a new approach to Brexit. </strong>When asked about this explicitly by Labour\u2019s <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, May replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I want to see is what the British people voted for. They voted for an end to free movement, they voted for an independent trade policy, they voted to end the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. And it is incumbent on this parliament to ensure that we deliver on that. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Being in the customs union would be incompatible with an independent trade policy, because the UK would not be free to strike its own trade deals. When the pro-European Tory <strong>Ken Clarke</strong> tackled her on the same issue, saying he had not met anyone who said they voted leave because they wanted to leave the customs union, May made a similar point. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When they were [voting in the EU referendum] I believe they did vote to ensure we continue to have a good trading relationship with our nearest neighbours in the EU but also to improve our trading relationships with others around the world.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May was accused of being in denial about the extent of her difficulties over Brexit. </strong>Corbyn said the government was \u201cnot recognising the scale of the defeat they suffered last night\u201d. Cooper said: \u201cThe problem is the prime minister seems to be talking as if she lost by 30 votes yesterday, not 230.\u201d Labour\u2019s <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Angela Eagle</strong> criticised May for \u201cjust repeating the lines to take that we have heard for the last five months ad nauseam\u201d instead of accepting the need to change tack. And the SNP\u2019s <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Pete Wishart </strong>said:<br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>She\u2019s lost a quarter of her cabinet, 170 members of her backbench want her gone, she\u2019s experienced the biggest defeat in parliamentary history - what shred of credibility has her government got left? For goodness\u2019 sake, prime minister, won\u2019t you just go?</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn revealed that, despite May saying she wants to hold cross-party talks with senior parliamentarians, she had not been in touch with him.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There has been no offer of all-party talks, there has been no communication on all-party talks \u2013 all the prime minister said was she might talk to some members of the house. That isn\u2019t reaching out.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn accused May of heading a \u201czombie government\u201d and said any previous government would have resigned if it had lost as badly as May\u2019s did last night.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Last week they lost a vote on the finance bill, that\u2019s what\u2019s called supply.

To his credit, Jeremy Corbyn homed in on this in his very first question, and the topic was raised repeatedly by other MPs. (Or at least those who raised Brexit; it was surprising how many MPs seemed happy to stick with run-of-the-mill questions less than 24 hours after May broke all records for parliamentary humiliation.) </p> \n  <p>As usual, instead of properly engaging with the red lines question, May instead stuck to parroting the most recent line-to-take in her memory, the text of the statement she delivered to MPs last night about wanting \u201cconstructive\u201d talks while still honouring the result of the referendum. She would not address the question about whether she might now agree to the UK remaining in the customs union for good in any meaningful way, but her tone conveyed the clear impression that her lines remain almost as red as ever and that she is not seriously contemplating a departure from what she has already proposed. </p> \n  <p>But on one issue, she did hint that she is having a rethink. Her response to Ken Clarke about extending article 50 (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat?page=with:block-5c3f2363e4b03740e8745eb6#block-5c3f2363e4b03740e8745eb6\">12.30am)</a> implied that, if she is not exactly keen on extending article 50, she is at least less hostile to the idea than she was. (Some people assume that extending article 50 would automatically amount to a move in the direction of a softer Brexit, but that is not necessarily the case; she might want to extend it just to allow more time for no-deal preparations.) </p> \n  <p>Corbyn was probably at his best when he asked about Brexit. He quite successfully exposed the hollowness of May\u2019s offer on cross-party talks. After that, he asked about poverty and other domestic policy issues, achieving some fairly easy hits but without saying anything especially memorable. </p> \n  <p>The real debate about May\u2019s domestic record will probably start shortly.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-16T13:12:06.604Z\">at 1.12pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c3f27f5e4b03740e8745eea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-16T12:48:41.102Z\">12.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sarah Wollaston,</strong> the Tory pro-European, asks May to back a second referendum.

The options will be: we put forward our own proposals on a deal, or you put forward those plus the possibility of a referendum. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat went through our Labour party conference last year was: seek to get a deal that protects jobs and the economy, if you can\u2019t do that, then it\u2019s a referendum to ask people to think again.

If she had a real discussion, a real approach to compromise bring all the parties together I think there could be a compromise most probably on the basis of what Labour is advocating. But the problem that she\u2019s got is that I don\u2019t think people have any faith in her anymore to deliver that. </p> \n   <p>Clearly extending article 50 is now on the agenda but that is for the government to decide. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He appeared to concede that it was unlikely that the government would lose today\u2019s confidence vote. \u201cPeople don\u2019t expect us to win that, but who can tell?\u201d </p> \n  <p>He added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If that goes down, parliament really has to take a strong role ... proper negotiations and discussions to see if there is a compromise that can be reached. Theresa May has said she is willing to enter into those discussions, but she hasn\u2019t said she is willing to enter into them with Jeremy Corbyn. She has not contacted us.</p> \n   <p>We haven\u2019t been invited into those discussions yet. Then she\u2019s set conditions, she\u2019s ruling out by the looks of it a customs union which most of the opposition parties support. </p> \n   <p>We believe we should have a permanent customs union. The relationship with the single market should be a close and collaborative relationship. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-16T09:12:33.470Z\">at 9.12am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c3edbece4b0e86a86828ada\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-16T07:23:53.279Z\">7.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague <strong>Matthew Weaver </strong>now.

European standards require letterboxes to be between 70cm and 1.7m from the ground, thus reducing the risk of back injuries and risk of dog bite for postmen and women.</p> \n  <p>The Communications Union have <a href=\"https://www.cwu.org/ltb/ltb082-18-low-level-letter-boxes-re-launch-cwu-low-level-letter-box-campaign/\">this summary of the issue</a>, which they say they have been trying to get change on for years.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Communications Workers Union has been campaigning to outlaw low level letterboxes for many years. The CWU has been striving for the European Standard (EN13724) to be added to UK Building Regulations \u2013 this requires that letterboxes should be positioned at a suitably accessible height, accessible to postal delivery workers, significantly reducing possible injuries such as, dog bites, fingers being trapped or back strain caused when bending excessively to reach ground level boxes...</p> \n   <p>The problem with low level letter boxes is that back injuries to postmen and women occur each year in Royal Mail and delivering to low level letter boxes at the base of a house front door forces postal staff to stoop to ground level repetitively to deliver mail items which can cause or exacerbate back strain and back conditions. Low level letter boxes also present an increased risk of dog bites when the mail is pushed through the aperture at ground level and fingers get trapped.</p> \n   <p>In 2002 the European Standard EN 13724 was introduced and states that for \u201cergonomic and safety reasons\u201d the centre line of the letter box aperture should be at a height between 700 mm (2ft 3.5 inches) and 1700mm (5ft 7inches).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>For some reason, the debate about car production in Solihull, currently slated for after the no-confidence vote, hasn\u2019t generated quite the same interest as the letter boxes, though there are some who are keen.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/creeple/status/1085344607536406529\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yo UK I am here for the Solihull car production drama <a href=\"https://t.co/Jsc8nAqosh\">pic.twitter.com/Jsc8nAqosh</a></p>\u2014 Alice Teeple (@creeple) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/creeple/status/1085344607536406529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 16, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c3ec8e3e4b0e86a86828a70\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-16T06:55:32.108Z\">6.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I am very interested to see how the news of the Brexit deal defeat was covered in newspapers around the world, so tweet me (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsKateLyons\">@mskatelyons</a>) with photos or screenshots of the front pages from wherever you\u2019re reading from (and with English translations if you can!).</p> \n  <p>Here are a few from around Europe.

Until then, thanks for reading, it\u2019s been a pleasure. Here is Emmanuel Macron laying out what he sees as the three options facing the UK at this point in Brexit negotiations. Macron was speaking on Wednesday in Normandy after the May\u2019s disastrous loss on her Brexit deal. ICYMI, as we say on the internet, a group called Led By Donkeys have had some fun in Dover last night, putting up billboards showing quotes from various Conservative MPs on the subject of Brexit, which now seem a little, well, the words \u201cegg\u201d and \u201cface\u201d come to mind. We\u2019ve got a full story on that here: Tobias Ellwood, a Conservative defence minister, who is pro-remain, has been on Australian breakfast radio where he said that while the vote was tight it was \u201ca distraction from the bigger question of where we go with Brexit.\u201d He also has an interesting take on what the no-confidence vote was about, saying: \u201cThe question wasn\u2019t about confidence in the government, it was a question of do you want Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister?\u201d This might be what motivated a lot of Conservatives in their decision to support the PM today, but, needless to say, was not, technically, what the vote was about. Ellwood says any further moves to destabilise May by calling for another no-confidence vote would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had a general election, we\u2019re up against a deadline of March 29th otherwise we end up with either a no-deal Brexit, or you have to extend [the deadline]. Why on earth would you call a general election in the middle of that? It\u2019s deeply irresponsible.\u201d Ellwood said May\u2019s Brexit deal was voted down \u201cnot because you have another big idea waiting to slide into view, but because you have different caucuses join together in a coalition of convenience to vote this deal down.\u201d He said that in his own constituency, he is being asked by voters to \u201cvote for no deal, vote for the Norway option, vote for a second referendum, it really is difficult to understand what leave really means, because it was never pointed out, there was never a manifesto statement that says this is what leave looks like. But we all have to be responsible members of parliament and perhaps step back from our original positions and see if there is compromise so we can move forward and agree something prior to the deadline that is approaching.\u201d The Brexit drama of this week has led to renewed calls for another referendum on Scottish independence. The front page of the Scottish National paper has the headline: \u201cIndependence is the only way out of this mess\u201d. The Scottish Herald publishes a poll showing 56.55% of people think Scotland should have a referendum on independence if the UK leaves the EU of 29 March. Yvette Cooper has also thrown her support behind the idea of citizens assemblies as a way of widening the Brexit debate, which is one of the suggestions Lucas says she is going to take into her meeting with Theresa May tomorrow. Good evening, political-people, this is Kate Lyons taking over from Mattha Busby, which means this blog has now come full circle \u2013 I launched it about 18 hours ago, and will see it through until we put it to bed. If you\u2019ve been reading the blog that whole time, firstly, thank you, we appreciate you, our wonderful, devoted readers. Secondly, you must be exhausted, please get some sleep. But before you switch off for the night, perhaps you may want to send Caroline Lucas a quick tweet. The Greens MP will be meeting with the PM at 9am tomorrow and is inviting people to get in touch with her to tell her what message they want to convey to May in their meeting. Lucas has said she will tell May \u201cloud and clear\u201d that \u201cthe threat of no deal Brexit must come off the table and that there should be a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d Any other suggestions? @ her. That\u2019s all from me tonight. I will now hand over to my colleague Kate Lyons who will continue our coverage of political developments following events in Parliament today and Theresa May\u2019s statement in Downing Street this evening. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has predicted that the opposition parties will now take the lead on delivering Brexit. \u201cI think what will happen now is the Labour Party, along with the other opposition parties, and with other members of Parliament, will take the lead in this now because the Government significantly failed to come up with anything they can get through their own party,\u201d he told Peston on ITV. Its live here if you would like to tune in: The main takeaways from the prime minister\u2019s statement: She did not mention the prospect of no-deal, which most opposition parties are demanding. MP\u2019s must set out what they want, rather than what they don\u2019t want and \u2018put self-interest aside\u2019. The door remains open to talks with Jeremy Corbyn. May stressed the fact she recognises it is her duty to deliver on the British people\u2019s instruction to leave the European Union. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has been told that one former cabinet May loyalist has told her she is \u201cdeluded\u201d. Meanwhile, on Newsnight, Liam Fox has said no Brexit would be \u201cdemocratically unacceptable\u201d. What makes the prime minister tick? I hear you ask. The Guardian\u2019s political editor Heather Stewart has delved into what underpins Theresa May\u2019s \u201cextraordinary inflexibility\u201d. Labour\u2019s David Lammy, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign, has responded to the prime minister\u2019s statement tonight: The prime minister is like a broken record. After two and a half years of damaging the country\u2019s economy and international standing while failing to get consensus in parliament, her refusal to change tack is a historic mistake. If the prime minister really cares about the national interest, she would give the public the final say over this Brexit mess, with the option to stay in the EU. Here are some of tomorrow\u2019s front pages: The Mail blames \u201cwrecker Corbyn\u201d for not attending May\u2019s impromptu talks. The i reports that the UK is heading for close ties with Europe, according to ministers. The Times also leads on Corbyn\u2019s apparent refusal to accede to May\u2019s demand for cooperation. The National renews its call for Scottish independence. The Telegraph splash on the leaked recording of Hammond\u2019s conference call with business leaders. Brexican stand off, says the Metro. The FT heralds the beginning of May\u2019s search for Brexit inspiration. Theresa May\u2019s full statement: This evening the government has won the confidence of parliament. This now gives us the opportunity to focus on finding a way forward on Brexit. I understand that people getting on with their lives outside of Westminster, the events of last 24 hours will have been unsettling. Overwhelmingly, the British people want us to get on with delivering Brexit, and also address the other important issues they care about. But the deal I\u2019ve worked to agree with the European Union was rejected by MPs and by a large margin. I believe it is my duty to deliver on the British people\u2019s instruction to leave the European Union and I intend to do so. So now MPs have made clear what they don\u2019t want, we must all work constructively together to set out what parliament does want. That\u2019s why I\u2019m inviting MPs from all parties to come together to find a way forward, one that both delivers on the referendum and can command the support of parliament. This is now the time to put self-interest aside. I have just held constructive meetings with the Leader of the Liberal Democrats [Vince Cable], and the Westminster leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru, [Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, respectively]. From tomorrow meetings will be taking place between senior government representatives, including myself, and groups of MPs that represent the widest possible range of views from across parliament, including our confidence and supply partners, the Democratic Unionist party. I am disappointed that the leader of the Labour party [Jeremy Corbyn] has not so far chosen to take part, but our door remains open. It will not be an easy task, but MPs know they have a duty to act in the national interest, reach a consensus and get this done. In a historic vote in 2016 the country decided to leave the EU. In 2017, 80% of people voted for parties that stood on manifestos promising to respect that result. Now, over two-and-a-half years later, it\u2019s time for us to come together, put the national interest first \u2013 and deliver on the referendum. The chancellor Philip Hammond has reportedly told business leaders that the \u201cthreat\u201d of no-deal Brexit could be taken \u201coff the table\u201d in a number of days. The Telegraph reported that Hammond said this could potentially lead to article 50 being rescinded \u2013 therefore extending the period of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, according to a leaked recording of a conference call. When asked for assurances from the head of Tesco that the government would not oppose such a motion, Hammond apparently suggested that ministers may even back the plan. He went on to explain how a backbench bill could stymie the prospect of no deal. The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce has tweeted: Here are some takes on Theresa May\u2019s statement: This is the Labour party political broadcast that aired on the BBC tonight: The prime minister says she is disappointed Corbyn has chosen not to talk part in talks, \u201cbut the door remains open\u201d. In her closing remark, she says: \u201cIn a historic vote in 2016 the country decided to leave the EU. In 2017, 80% of people voted for parties that stood on manifestos promising to respect that result. \u201cNow, over two and a half years later, it\u2019s time for us to come together, put the national interest first and deliver on the referendum,\u201d she concludes, before immediately turning around and walking back into No 10. That\u2019s it. The prime minister has kept it short and sweet, without creating much news. Full transcription follows. May says now is the time to put self-interest aside, noting that she has just held constructive meetings with Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and the Westminster leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts. \u201cFrom tomorrow meetings will be taking place between senior government representatives, including myself, and groups of MPs that represent the widest possible selection of views from across parliament,\u201d she says. May reiterates that she understands it is her duty to deliver on the British people\u2019s instruction to leave the European Union: \u201cAnd I intend to do so.\u201d May says she understands that people getting on with their lives outside of Westminster must have found the last 24 hours \u201cunsettling\u201d. The BBC\u2019s news bulletin is in progress and the prime minister is expected to appear any moment. It is believed that Theresa May has held some talks with unspecified party leaders tonight. Laura Kuennsberg says she does not expect any \u201cdramatic departure\u201d from her established positions. May\u2019s statement is due in the next few minutes at 10pm. This will be her fourth public appearance during what must have been one of the most testing days in her political career. The podium is erected in front of Number 10 Downing Street. You can watch it live if you click on the video feed at the top of this blog. Or here: Southampton\u2019s third round FA cup replay with Derby has gone to extra time, meaning that BBC1 programmers have a small dilemma on their hands. It has now been reported - and this is unconfirmed \u2013 that May\u2019s statement will now air on the BBC News Channel. How British. Here\u2019s our live blog for the game: For anyone catching up on development\u2019s tonight, here are several reports from the Guardian\u2019s lobby team: And for anyone who fancies a giggle: A No 10 spokeswoman has confirmed that Theresa May is to make a statement in Downing Street at 10pm. Tom Newton Dunn, the Sun\u2019s political editor, claims May will reassure the public that she\u2019s still in charge, and is delivering Brexit. Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary has her own prediction: The Scottish National party has called on Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to support a people\u2019s vote, saying it \u201cmust now be on the table\u201d for cross-party Brexit talks to take place with the prime minister. Ian Blackford called on May to make concessions on her withdrawal deal after she survived tonight\u2019s confidence vote, saying the the SNP want guarantees that ruling out a no deal and extending article 50 will be possible options. \u201cThe SNP is committed to working constructively with the prime minister, however the option of ruling out a no deal, extending article 50 and holding a people\u2019s vote must now be on the table,\u201d Ian Blackford the party\u2019s Westminster leader said. \u201cI have written to Jeremy Corbyn along with other opposition leaders calling on him to support a People\u2019s Vote on the final Brexit deal. \u201cLast night\u2019s historic vote, which saw the UK government humiliated, was a clear indication of the strength of opposition to the Prime Minister\u2019s deal from across the House. We must see concessions from the prime minister, as well as Jeremy Corbyn, to break the Brexit impasse.\u201d Ahead of any talks, the SNP wrote a cross-party letter with the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens to the Labour leader. It argues that \u201cnow that the government and the official opposition\u2019s options have been tested before the House, we believe the only way now which presents a real chance of breaking the Brexit deadlock is to put the decision to the people by backing a people\u2019s vote.\u201d Nick Dearden, a spokesperson from Another Europe is Possible, has spoken to the BBC 71 Labour MP\u2019s today signed a letter saying that they would support a second referendum \u2013 that amounts to around 28% of the parliamentary party. Dearden conceded that this does not amount to a majority, but he countered: \u201cIf you look at the opinion polls we see over and over again that the Labour party is overwhelmingly in favour of remain, still, and an increasing number of people in favour of another referendum. \u201cAnd who can be surprised, we\u2019ve left it to this government, we\u2019ve left it to the politicians, they have failed to deliver anything which I think whether you voted remain or whether you voted leave, nobody voted for the constitutional crisis that we now have on our hands. \u201cWe have to put this back to the people and get a popular mandate, one way or another,\u201d he added, saying that he believes most Labour members would vote remain if it was on the ballot paper. Robert Peston, ITV\u2019s political editor, says May\u2019s emergency statement tonight will take place at 10.03pm. Earlier this evening, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman told reporters that Downing Street contacted the Labour leader\u2019s office ahead of the vote about the prospect of a meeting, but said that he was not expected to go to Number 10 on Wednesday evening. Explaining why the Labour leader wanted no-deal taken off the table, the spokesman said: \u201cThe blackmail is that by attempting to run down the clock and hold the threat of the country going over a cliff-edge into a no-deal outcome... that makes it more difficult to reach a real and effective deal.\u201d The spokesman said May must recognise the \u201creality\u201d facing her Withdrawal Agreement. That deal is dead. No number of tweaks or sweeteners from Brussels are going to change that. That is absolutely clear. If there is going to be a deal that is going to work for the country and have a majority in Parliament, Theresa May is going to have to abandon her red lines. However, he acknowledged this would cause problems in her own party, saying: \u201cAny change in the Government\u2019s red lines is going to cause them internal splits. That\u2019s the fundamental reason why they are unable to govern.\u201d The spokesman said Labour was not ruling out another no-confidence vote, but refused to be drawn on timing. Vince Cable is likely to meet with Theresa May tonight, along with Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts, who is apparently set to demand a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d from the PM face-to-face, according to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Earlier she tweeted that the secretary of state for international trade, Liam Fox, has told her he has \u201cconsistently opposed a customs union\u201d. Richard Branson, the business magnate, has urged Theresa May to abandon her red lines. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chairman, says May\u2019s offer of talks and a degree of rapprochement on Brexit in the national interest is \u201ca little too late\u201d and that \u201cshe hasn\u2019t listened until now\u201d. Its two years since these negotiations started, and for the prime minister to make a claim to meet with the leaders of the party\u2019s is a little too late. She hasn\u2019t at any stage .. sought to seek the advice .. of the opposition parties at all. I find that very distasteful. Its probably why we\u2019ve ended up in this situation. He went on to call May\u2019s deal \u201cthe worst possible from Brussels\u201d and that Labour will look to see what the government\u2019s plan B will be on Monday. \u201cWe want to see some sort of remedy to this situation.\u201d After obfuscating in his response to what has a credible chance of getting through the house, Lavery was asked whether there is any possible scenario where Labour could help get Brexit through. He reiterated Labour\u2019s opposition to no deal and said: We want to ensure that there\u2019s a Brexit for the people, we want to make sure that whatever Brexit is there for jobs, for the economy, for businesses. We will have one red line in these discussions with Theresa May, and that will be an absolute guarantee that there will not be a no-deal Brexit. So, everything\u2019s on the table, it\u2019ll be up to Theresa May to accept what the Labour party might wish to put forward. I hope she listens because she hasn\u2019t listened until now. Christopher Hope, The Telegraph\u2019s chief political correspondent, has tweeted: Here\u2019s a reminder of Corbyn\u2019s demand earlier: Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said tonight\u2019s vote was a \u201cbig rejection\u201d of Jeremy Corbyn, and that the Labour leader must change his position on the principle of a people\u2019s vote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big rejection of Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d he told the Press Association. \u201cJust as last night was a big rejection of her [Theresa May\u2019s] Brexit. I think we are narrowing the options. I think the one step forward that we are looking for from Jeremy Corbyn is he has got to change his position and accept some movement on the principle of a \u2018people\u2019s vote\u2019.\u201d On Brexit talks with May, Cable said: \u201cIf she wants to reach out we are up for it.\u201d Cable also told the BBC that while he would meet May he would have conditions on Brexit. \u201cAs I said in parliament this afternoon of course we will talk to the prime minister,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will make it absolutely clear that no deal has to be taken off the table and there has to be a sensible discussion about the \u2018people\u2019s vote\u2019.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s spokesman has told reporters that the Westminster leaders of Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru have been invited to meet the prime minister later this evening. However, a no-deal Brexit will not be taken off the table, despite Corbyn\u2019s insistence it was a prerequisite for talks, he added. The spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister has been very clear that the British public voted to leave the European Union. \u201cWe want to leave with a deal but she is determined to deliver on the verdict of the British public and that is to leave the EU on 29 March this year.\u201d A Number 10 source told the Press Association: \u201cWhat we are talking about tonight is party leader-level talks between the prime minister and her opposite numbers in other parties, should they wish to accept that.\u201d It is understood that the prime minister will be making a further statement at 10pm tonight. It is unclear what will be said. She may well reprise parts of her earlier speeches today, but the party talks \u2013 if they do indeed happen \u2013 could prove crucial in shaping her approach going forward. Caroline Lucas, the former Green party leader, has urged Jeremy Corbyn to hold a second referendum after his confidence motion was voted down. In a clip posted to Twitter, the Brighton Pavilion MP said: \u201cThe leader of the opposition was right to try to bring down this toxic, failing government. But now MPs have had their say on the Brexit deal, he needs to give the people a say over our future relationship with our nearest neighbours.\u201d Lucas added that to do otherwise would be a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the \u201cmajority of his party\u2019s members\u201d and young supporters who were unable to vote in the referendum two years ago. Earlier this evening in parliament, she said: Nigel Dodds, the DUP deputy leader, has highlighted the fact the government would have been unable to command half the support of the Commons tonight without the support of the Northern Irish unionist party, with whom the Conservatives have a confidence and supply agreement. Its worth mentioning here that the DUP have 10 MPs, and the result of tonight\u2019s vote was 325 to 306, out of 650 MPs overall. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has renewed calls for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d and criticised Jeremy Corbyn for sitting on the fence. He tweeted: James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, is the first cabinet minister to give an interview to the BBC News channel following this evening\u2019s vote. He said that tonight\u2019s events show that Theresa May commands the \u201cprofound\u201d confidence of the majority of MPs. Well the prime minister said yesterday that she wanted to test the opinion of the house, to see that we have the confidence of the House of Commons, which we profoundly do - that\u2019s the vote we\u2019ve had tonight. And therefore now to move on to discussions with other party leaders. As the prime minister said, wanted to work with other parties, parliamentarians, to test the support on the things that need to happen so we can ensure we make Brexit happen, and therefore following through as she said she would do. He then criticised Jeremy Corbyn, suggesting he does not want to act in the national interest, and saying that its \u201cextraordinary\u201d that the Labour leader sought to \u201cattach some conditionality\u201d to the prime minister\u2019s offer of talks, beginning this evening. \u201cI hope he reflects on that because otherwise it looks like this is all about party political manoeuvring, rather than acting in the national interest. That is what the prime minister is determined to do.\u201d The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has tweeted: Here are the remarks Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn made in the House of Commons following the confidence vote, in full. The prime minister said: I\u2019m pleased that this house has expressed its confidence in the government tonight. I do not take this responsibility lightly and our government will continue its work to increase our prosperity, guarantee our security and to strengthen our union. And yes we will also continue to work on the solemn promise we made to the people of this country to deliver on the result of the referendum and leave the European Union. I believe this duty is shared by every member of this house and we have a responsibility to identify a way forward that can secure the backing of the house. To that end I\u2019ve proposed a series of meetings between senior parliamentarians and representatives of the government over the coming days and I would like to invite the leaders of parliamentary parties to meet with me individually and I would like to start these meetings tonight. Mr Speaker, the government approach is to hold these meetings in a constructive spirit and I urge others to do the same but we must find solutions that are negotiable and command sufficient support in this house. And I\u2019ve said we will return to the house on Monday to table an amendable motion and to make a statement about the way forward. The house has put its confidence in this government, I stand ready to work with any member of this house to deliver on Brexit and to ensure this house retains the confidence of the British people. The leader of the opposition said: Thank you Mr Speaker. Last night the house rejected the government\u2019s conclusion of its negotiations with the European Union. Heckles from Tory MP\u2019s prompted an intervention from the Speaker, who said May was listened to in \u201crelative tranquility\u201d, suggesting Corbyn was not extended the same courtesy. Corbyn continued: Last night the house rejected the government\u2019s deal, emphatically. A week ago the house voted to condemn the idea of a no-deal Brexit. Before there can be any positive discussions about the way forward the government must remove, clearly and once and for all, the prospect of the catastrophe of no deal and all the chaos that would come as a result of that, and I invite the prime minister to confirm now that the government will not countenance a no-deal Brexit from the European Union. Theresa May has comfortably won the no-confidence vote, by 325 to 306 - a majority of 19. The vote came after a debate in which Jeremy Corbyn accused her of leading \u201ca zombie government\u201d, and Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, closed the debate with a powerful speech saying May does not \u201cpossess the necessary political skills, empathy, ability, and most crucially the policy, to lead this country any longer\u201d. (See 7.23pm.) Opposition party leaders have refused an invitation from May to join her for talks about an alternative approach to Brexit until she abandons some of her red lines. After the vote May said she would like talks to start tonight. But Corbyn and the Lib Dems said they would not engage with her until she ruled out a no-deal Brexit. And the SNP said she would have to be willing to discuss extending article 50 and holding a second referendum before they agreed to participate. Downing Street has flatly ruled out customs union membership, before the cross-party Brexit talks Theresa May promised on Tuesday night have even begun. May also delivered the same message in her speech in the debate. (See 4.14pm.) Michel Barnier has said Brexit is at a standstill after the crushing rejection of Theresa May\u2019s deal by MPs but offered to return to the negotiating table if parliament forces Theresa May to shift her \u201cred lines\u201d. Business leaders have suggested the UK resembles a \u201csupertanker heading for the rocks\u201d that will not be saved unless factions in the Conservative party drop their own \u201cred lines\u201d for a Brexit deal. Investors expect a delay to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU following the crushing defeat of the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal, the Bank of England governor has said. Half a dozen Labour MPs came out in support of a second referendum for the first time at a Westminster photocall, arguing it was the \u201cthe only logical option\u201d if the party could not secure a general election. Jacob Rees-Mogg hosted a champagne party for Brexiter colleagues on Tuesday night following the Commons vote that inflicted the worst defeat in modern history upon a UK prime minister, it has emerged. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Mattha Busby is taking over now. Tom Watson\u2019s speech was one of the most gently damning anyone has delivered about Theresa May since she became prime minister. Here are some key extracts. First let me say very clearly that I am not one of those people who questioned [May\u2019s] motives. I agree with [Tory MP Stephen Kerr] who claimed she was motivated by public duty. I don\u2019t doubt that she has sincerely attempted to fulfil the task given to us by the voters in the referendum. I have no doubt that she has tried her best and given it her all. But she has failed. And I\u2019m afraid the failure is hers. Hers alone ... Throughout history prime ministers have tried their best and failed. There is no disgrace in that. That\u2019s politics. But this prime minister has chosen one last act of defiance \u2013 not just defying the laws of politics, but defying the laws of mathematics. It was a Disraeli who said \u201ca majority is always better than the best repartee\u201d. She is a prime minister without a majority for her flagship policy, with no authority and no plan B. Mr Speaker \u2026 that\u2019s not a mere flesh wound. No one doubts her determination, which is generally an admirable quality, but misapplied it can be toxic. And the cruellest truth of all is that she doesn\u2019t possess the necessary political skills, empathy, ability, and most crucially the policy, to lead this country any longer ... We know [May] has worked hard. But the truth is she is too set in her ways, too aloof to lead. She lacks the imagination and agility to bring people with her. She lacks the authority on the world stage to negotiate this deal. Ultimately she has failed. It is not through lack of effort. It is not through a lack of dedication. And I think the country recognises that effort. In fact the country feels genuinely sorry for the prime minister. I feel sorry for the prime minister. But she cannot confuse pity for political legitimacy, sympathy for sustainable support. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem MP, says the Lib Dems also want May to rule out a no-deal Brexit before talks can start. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says he will only engage in talks with May if she is prepared to have extending article 50 and holding a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d as options. Jeremy Corbyn says he does not want to start talks with Theresa May until she rules out a no-deal Brexit. Theresa May has just announced, on a point of order, that she wants to start talks with the leaders of the opposition parties tonight about a way forward on Brexit. The government has won by 325 votes to 306 - a majority of 19. This is from the BBC\u2019s Joey D\u2019Urso. Here is the Labour MP Lisa Nandy on Michael Gove\u2019s speech. MPs are now voting on the no-confidence motion. It is a very simple motion. It just says: That this house has no confidence in Her Majesty\u2019s government. The SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green party have also signed it. You can read the signatories on the order paper here (pdf). Gove mentions investments that have been coming to Britain \u2013 all of those, \u201cin the words of the BBC\u201d, despite Brexit. The government is spending more on the NHS. And the country has two new aircraft carriers, he says. He says Corbyn wants to leave Nato and get rid of the nuclear deterrent. And he claimed that Corbyn once questioned why countries need big armies. Corbyn was present when a wreath was laid to commemorate those involved in the massacre of Israeli athletes. Corbyn said he was \u201cpresent but not involved\u201d, Gove says. Gove says that sums up Corbyn\u2019s stance on national security. When the Commons voted to oppose Islamic State, Corbyn was also present but not involved. And Gove goes on to claim that Corbyn would not stand up to Putin. If he won\u2019t stand up to Putin, how will he stand up for the national interest? Labour MPs are shouting \u201cshame\u201d very, very loudly. (The claims that Gove is making are to a large extent contested.) Gove finishes, with Tory MPs shouting \u201cmore\u201d enthusiastically. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is winding up for the government now. He says Tom Watson failed to mention Jeremy Corbyn in his speech. Gove and Watson have things in common, he says. They have both lost weight. And they both think Corbyn is unfit to lead the Labour party. Turning to the SNP, Gove says Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, did not say anything in his speech about the common fisheries policy, which is deeply unpopular with Scottish fishermen. Tom Watson\u2019s speech is getting rave reviews on Twitter \u2013 deservedly, because it was very good. Here is some comment from other journalists. From CityAM\u2019s Owen Bennett From the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy From the BBC\u2019s Jon Sopel From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire Watson says the question for MPs is whether it is worth giving May another chance to go back to Brussels, another chance to humiliate the UK, another chance to waste precious time. He says it was May who laid down impossible red lines. She refused to guarantee the rights of EU nationals. And she tried to shut out parliament. She has treated MPs with disdain, he says. He says parliament is now having to assert its authority. At every turn, May has promoted division instead of unity. She has chosen to placate the most extreme of her colleagues, he says. What happened to those burning injustices that May said she would fight: Racism? Classism? Homelessness? Insecure jobs? All these problems have got worse. May will forever be known as the \u201cnothing has changed\u201d PM. But something must change. May is too aloof, too set in her ways. She lacks the agility to bring people with her. It is not through lack of effort or dedication. The country feels sorry for the PM. Watson says he feels sorry for the PM. But that is not enough, he says. He says Tories may feel loyal to May. But they know in their hearts she is \u201cnot capable of getting a deal through\u201d. That is why we need a general election, he says. Watson says he is not one of those people who questions Theresa May\u2019s motives. He accepts she is motivated by duty, and that she is trying to honour the result of the referendum. But she has failed, and the failure is hers alone. He says he admires her resilience. Other people would not have been able to put up with the humiliations she has endured. But May has failed. He says she has no majority for her flagship policy, no authority, and no alternative. She lost the vote by 432 votes to 202. That is not a mere flesh wound, he says. He says May does not have the empathy or political skills to carry on as prime minister. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, is winding up now for the opposition. He says the UK is \u201cmore divided and fearful for the future than ever before\u201d. In Cardiff the Welsh assembly has passed a Plaid Cymru motion rejecting a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances. After the vote Adam Price, the Plaid leader, said: I\u2019m very pleased that the Welsh government and our national parliament supported Plaid Cymru\u2019s motion in rejecting in any circumstances an exit from the European Union with no deal. The agreement on our motion is a good sign that there is an emerging understanding in this place that we must come together to face problems that are crowding around Wales and the Welsh economy, threatening a perfect storm. According to the Times\u2019 Sam Coates, Labour is considering giving its MPs a free vote on what should happen next over Brexit. He explains how this might work in a Twitter thread starting here. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Wesminster, has tweeted this picture of himself and Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, meeting Theresa May in the Commons earlier. On Radio 4\u2019s PM programme Norman Lamont, the Brexiter former Conservative chancellor, said that Theresa May would split her party if she adopted a Brexit policy designed to appeal to Labour MPs, such as keeping the UK in the customs union. He explained: It would be suicidal for her to try to pass legislation of this kind, a measure of this kind, with a huge amount of Labour support, alienating perhaps 100 in her own party. I simply don\u2019t think that she could survive that, I don\u2019t think any prime minister of a Conservative bent could survive that. When Ken [Clarke, a fellow guest on the programme] says there is a majority for a customs union, there may be a majority for a customs union composed of a very large part of the Labour party. But there is no way a Conservative prime minister is going to survive on the back of the vote being largely Labour supported. That would be to destroy the Conservative [party]. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has put out this statement about her talks with Theresa May earlier. She said: We have had a useful discussion with the prime minister. These are critical times for the United Kingdom and we have indicated that first and foremost we will act in the national interest. Lessons will need to be learned from the vote in parliament. The issue of the backstop needs to be dealt and we will continue to work to that end. In keeping with our commitments in the confidence and supply agreement, which has benefitted every sector of society in Northern Ireland, the DUP is supporting the government this evening so that we can concentrate on the real challenges ahead of us. We will have further engagements in the coming days. Here are some more quotes from the no-confidence debate. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said the government should resign. The prime minister is beholden to the DUP but the DUP will only support her in very certain circumstances. This is not just about the defeat of the government last night on Brexit, it is a government that is stuck, that can\u2019t get its legislative programme through. It has no majority support in this house, it is a government that [is] past its time. And if the government had any humility, had any self respect it would reflect on the scale of that defeat last night ... The government should recognise it has no moral authority, the government quite simply should go. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, said the DUP would be backing the government. We believe it\u2019s in the national interest to support the government at this time so the aims and objectives of the confidence and supply agreement we entered into can be achieved. Much work remains to be done on those matters. I don\u2019t think the people in this country would rejoice at the prospect tonight if a general election were to be called. I\u2019m not convinced that a general election would significantly change the composition of the house and of course it doesn\u2019t change, whatever the outcome, it doesn\u2019t change the choices that lie before us all. The timing of this motion, as we well know, has got much more to do with the internal dynamics of the Labour party than a genuine presentation of an alternative programme for government. The Conservative MP Neil Parish, chair of the Commons environment committee, said people wanted the government to come together and deliver Brexit. We are the party of government, we were elected to govern this country and so therefore we have to make a decision. We can\u2019t sit contemplating our navels forever as to whether we\u2019re going to make the decision or not. John Woodcock, the former Labour MP who now sits as an independent, claimed some Labour MPs thought Jeremy Corbyn was unfit to be PM. With a heavy heart I have to tell the house that I cannot support the no-confidence motion tonight and some of my friends mutter disgrace, I hear some of them tutting. I have to say that many of them have privately said: \u2018Thank God that you have got the freedom to actually not support this,\u2019 because they are wrestling with their consciences, wanting desperately a Labour government, knowing that the leader of their party is as unfit to lead the country as he was when they voted against him in the no-confidence motion of the party those years ago. This is from the BBC\u2019s Mark Devenport. The SDLP, Labour\u2019s sister party in Northern Ireland, which used to be represented at Westminster until it lost its three seats in 2017, has criticised Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit. In a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, the SDLP Brexit spokesperson Claire Hanna said: The British Labour party in parliament say that membership of the customs union would mean there was no need for an Irish backstop. This simply is not true. There is no Brexit deal available that does not require a backstop. To be frank in the SDLP we are disappointed by the approach of the Labour leadership, who appear to place wooing DUP votes over protecting the Good Friday agreement. We absolutely acknowledge the concerns of many MPs about the impact of the withdrawal deal on their constituents, but the backstop does not fall into that category. The choices are between a deal with a backstop or a people\u2019s vote with an option for the UK to stay in the EU, keeping the whole of the island of Ireland in the EU and removing any question of a backstop. Here is Emmanuel Macron\u2019s take on where Britain stands after last night\u2019s Brexit vote. He says the mendacious leave campaign has left MPs with the task of trying to implement the impossible. George Osborne, the Evening Standard editor who was chancellor until he was sacked by Theresa May, reckons Macron has come up with a more realistic summary of Britain\u2019s situation than the prime minister. Here is the full transcript of what Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, told the European parliament this morning about the Commons Brexit vote, when he said: \u201cThe risk of a no deal has never been so high.\u201d The transcript also includes the comments from Frans Timmermans, the European commission vice president, on the same subject. In the light of claims that a lot of the Brexit debate is driven by fantasy, it is appropriate that he ended his remarks with this (rather good) quote from CS Lewis. Let me end with a quote by CS Lewis: \u201cWe cannot go back and change the beginning. But we can start where we are and change the ending.\u201d Another independent MP, Sylvia Hermon, who represents North Down in Northern Ireland, has said she will not be voting for the motion of no-confidence in the government, the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire reports. John Woodcock, who was elected as a Labour MP but now sits as an independent after leaving the party because of his opposition to Jeremy Corbyn and over a disciplinary case, has told the Commons he will not be voting for the motion of no-confidence in the government this evening. He said he thought Corbyn and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, were not fit to hold high office. The Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who delayed her caesarean section so that she could vote in last night\u2019s division, and who had to be taken through the lobby in a wheelchair, will be \u201cnodded through\u201d tonight. That is a procedure normally used for MPs who are seriously ill. As long as they are on the parliamentary estate at the time of the vote, and witnessed by a whip, their vote is counted as if they had gone through the division lobby in person. In a series of Tweets, Siddiq said she was doing this because she had received a personal assurance from the prime minister that the Tories would honour the system. At his regular press briefing in Brussels earlier today, Margaritis Schinas, the spokesman for the European commission, said it was up to London to decide what happened next in the Brexit process. He said: The next move has to come from London. There is nothing else we can do from here at this stage. What matters at this stage \u2026 is that we know what to expect from the UK, and that we don\u2019t know. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said Theresa May should resign \u2013 but also argued that if she survives the confidence vote she ought to be given a few days to find a way through the impasse. Speaking in the Senedd in Cardiff, Drakeford said: We need a new House of Commons and a new government to find a fresh way forward. That approach should rule out a no-deal exit and protect jobs and the economy here in Wales. Any prime minister who finds herself defeated in the way this prime minister has been when attempting to discharge the single most important responsibility that will ever fall to her should resign. That is the constitutionally proper form of action. The greatest threat to Wales is that we crash out of the European Union with no deal at all, with all the damage that will cause to business, to jobs. He said the point may come when a people\u2019s vote is the only way to break the impasse. But Drakeford also said May had told him in a telephone conversation that she would work with devolved administrations as well as parliamentarians to find a way through. He said: If she is in a position to do that after today, I think we have to allow her the few days at her disposal to see if that can be brought about. If there is a deal that she can do that meets the tests set out by my party, there may yet be a deal to be done. If that is not the case then I agree in those circumstances that the decision will have to go back to the people. Drakeford met today with members of Plaid Cymru and Welsh Tories to discuss no-deal contingencies. He said he had not met members of Ukip because they did not believe there was any need to prepare for no-deal. The Commons Brexit committee has published a report (pdf) saying MPs should be given a series of indicative votes on what happens next. Voting in the Commons is normally binary \u2013 MPs either vote for or against a proposition \u2013 but on Brexit there is increasing support for an alternative approach that would enable MPs to vote on a series of options, so as to show which had most support. The committee suggests MPs should be given a vote on four options. It explains them like this. 1. To hold another vote on the draft withdrawal agreement and framework for the future relationship. 2. To leave the EU with no deal on 29 March with no agreement on future relations in place and with no transition/implementation period. 3. To call on the government to seek to renegotiate the deal to achieve a specific outcome, be it a variation of the terms of the separation set out in the withdrawal agreement or providing clarity about the end state of future relations as set out in the political declaration. The main renegotiation possibilities would be: 1) Seeking changes to the text in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop arrangements; 2) Seeking a Canada-style deal: 3) Seeking to join the EEA through the EFTA pillar and remaining in a customs union with the EU or a variation on this. 4. In addition to these policy choices about the UK\u2019s future relationship, parliament could decide to hold a second referendum to allow the British people to decide either which kind of Brexit deal they want or whether they wish to remain in the EU. The committee, which is chaired by the Labour MP Hilary Benn, agreed the report by a majority. Four pro-Brexit members \u2013 the Tories Sir Christopher Chope, Craig Mackinlay, John Whittingdale and the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson \u2013 voted against. The government has not yet said when, or how, MPs will get to hold the debate that must take place following the Commons decision to vote down Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal yesterday. But in response to a point of order after the vote last night, John Bercow, the Speaker, indicated he would do what he could to ensure that debates and votes do take place. He said: Of one thing I am sure: that which members wish to debate and which they determine shall be subject to a vote will be debated and voted upon. That seems to me to be so blindingly obvious that no sensible person would disagree with the proposition. If MPs want to debate and vote on a matter, that opportunity will, I am sure, unfold in the period ahead. Anyone who thought that the first no-confidence debate in the Commons for almost a quarter of a century was going to be a vintage occasion will have been disappointed \u2013 at least by the opening statements. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech was a little rambling and definitely not one of his best. Theresa May\u2019s was not hugely better, although she did seem to be enjoying herself more than the opposition leader (bizarrely, in the circumstances, but who knows how the May psyche works). It did not generate big news, but there were some interesting lines. Here they are: May signalled she is not willing to consider keeping the UK in a customs union for good (which is a Labour demand) when she opens cross-party talks on a new approach to Brexit. When asked about this explicitly by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, May replied: What I want to see is what the British people voted for. They voted for an end to free movement, they voted for an independent trade policy, they voted to end the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. And it is incumbent on this parliament to ensure that we deliver on that. Being in the customs union would be incompatible with an independent trade policy, because the UK would not be free to strike its own trade deals. When the pro-European Tory Ken Clarke tackled her on the same issue, saying he had not met anyone who said they voted leave because they wanted to leave the customs union, May made a similar point. She said: When they were [voting in the EU referendum] I believe they did vote to ensure we continue to have a good trading relationship with our nearest neighbours in the EU but also to improve our trading relationships with others around the world. May was accused of being in denial about the extent of her difficulties over Brexit. Corbyn said the government was \u201cnot recognising the scale of the defeat they suffered last night\u201d. Cooper said: \u201cThe problem is the prime minister seems to be talking as if she lost by 30 votes yesterday, not 230.\u201d Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle criticised May for \u201cjust repeating the lines to take that we have heard for the last five months ad nauseam\u201d instead of accepting the need to change tack. And the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart said: She\u2019s lost a quarter of her cabinet, 170 members of her backbench want her gone, she\u2019s experienced the biggest defeat in parliamentary history - what shred of credibility has her government got left? For goodness\u2019 sake, prime minister, won\u2019t you just go? Corbyn revealed that, despite May saying she wants to hold cross-party talks with senior parliamentarians, she had not been in touch with him. He said: There has been no offer of all-party talks, there has been no communication on all-party talks \u2013 all the prime minister said was she might talk to some members of the house. That isn\u2019t reaching out. Corbyn accused May of heading a \u201czombie government\u201d and said any previous government would have resigned if it had lost as badly as May\u2019s did last night. He said: Last week they lost a vote on the finance bill, that\u2019s what\u2019s called supply. Yesterday they lost by the biggest margin ever, that\u2019s what\u2019s regarded as confidence. By any convention of this house, by any precedence, loss of both confidence and supply should mean they do the right thing and resign \u2026 This government cannot govern and cannot command the support of parliament on the most important issue facing our country. Every previous prime minister in this situation would have resigned and called an election and it is the duty of this house to lead where the government has failed. May said holding an election was \u201cnot in the national interest\u201d. She said: It would deepen division when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty, and it would bring delay when we need to move forward, so I believe this house should reject this motion. At this crucial moment in our nation\u2019s history, a general election is simply not in the national interest. May criticised Corbyn\u2019s record on security and said he would bring \u201cnational calamity\u201d to the country if he became PM. She said: This is the leader of the party of Attlee, who called for the dismantling of Nato, the leader of the party of Bevan, who says Britain should unilaterally disarm herself and cross our fingers that others follow suit, the leader of the party that helped deliver the Belfast agreement, invited IRA terrorists into this parliament just weeks after their colleagues had murdered a member of this House. His leadership of the Labour party has been a betrayal of everything that party has stood for, a betrayal of the vast majority of its MPs and a betrayal of millions of decent and patriotic Labour voters. I look across the house and see backbench members who spent years serving their country in office in a Labour government, but I fear that today this is simply not a party that many of its own MPs joined. What he has done to his party is a national tragedy; what he would do to the country would be a national calamity. David Cameron, the former Conservative prime minister, has told the BBC he does not regret calling the EU referendum. He said: I do not regret calling the referendum. It was a promise I made two years before the 2015 general election, it was included in a manifesto, it was legislated for in parliament. Obviously I regret that we lost that referendum. I deeply regret that. I was leading the campaign to stay in the European Union and obviously I regret the difficulties and problems we have been having in trying to implement the result of that referendum. Cameron also said he backed Theresa May and he supported \u201cher aim to have a partnership deal with Europe\u201d. He continued: \u201cThat is what needs to be put in place. That is what parliament needs to try to deliver now.\u201d David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, has told the Commons European scrutiny committee there would be \u201cquite visible anger\u201d among the public if the UK has not left the EU or begun a transition process to withdraw by April. He told the committee: I think we will see quite visible anger from the public at large, and not just those who might be counted as leavers. I have met quite a lot of erstwhile remainers who have said to me \u2018I have changed my mind and next time I will vote leave\u2019 or \u2018Why is this proving such a difficult process?\u2019 If they don\u2019t see a delivery on the vote of 2016, it will be really serious indeed. Appearing before the Commons\u2019 education committee this morning, Damian Hinds, the education secretary for England, said he might have to second civil servants to other departments for no-deal Brexit planning. Asked about no-deal planning, he said: There\u2019s a broader cross-governmental question about making sure that if there were to be a no deal, that those functions that are truly mission-critical, in the very sharpest sense, that government is collectively able to deliver. And that does involve departments like ours being asked to see who if needed we could release on a temporary basis to support those other departments. Is there a risk of civil servants being taken out of the DfE to go to other departments? On a temporary basis, absolutely. That is the reality of no deal \u2013 across government we would have to find resources to be able to make sure that mission-critical things for people\u2019s way of life, supply of food and medicines and so on, that those things are protected. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has said that it is not \u201cautomatic\u201d that Labour would back a second referendum if it fails to trigger a general election. Speaking at a conference in Westminster this morning held by Social Enterprise UK, she said \u201call options are on the table and that includes a peoples vote\u201d, although only in the event the party cannot first force an election. Describing the party\u2019s Brexit policy agreed at the party\u2019s conference, she said Now, it wasn\u2019t an automatic let\u2019s go straight to a people\u2019s vote. It was a determination to consider all of the options. There will be a lot of discussion after tonight about what happens next. Long-Bailey, who said Labour was still working for a \u201csuccessful outcome\u201d in tonight\u2019s vote, said she could \u201ccompletely understand\u201d why supporters of a second referendum were angry after two years of \u201cchaos\u201d from the government. However, she insisted Labour still needed to look at other options before throwing its weight behind the people\u2019s vote campaign. I think our position certainly hasn\u2019t moved dramatically from respecting the referendum and wanting to exhaust all of the possibilities that are available to us. But equally I think we\u2019ve got a duty to make sure that we don\u2019t hurtle towards a no-deal Brexit. We\u2019ve got to do everything in our power to stop that as well. What we want to see is a general election. Because it\u2019s not just Brexit that\u2019s an issue, and managing to have a government that\u2019s in power who can negotiate productively with the EU and get a deal that would provide consensus. It\u2019s also about dealing with all the other issues \u2013 the economic flaws that we currently see in our economy. Here is a Guardian graphic showing the timetable if Theresa May wins her confidence vote tonight (as everyone expects she will): And here is the timetable in the unlikely event of her losing: Leo Varadkar, Ireland\u2019s prime minister, has denied having secret plans to introduce checks at the border with Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. The Scottish government is stepping up its preparations for a hard, no-deal Brexit, including a public information campaign and contingency plans to ensure medicines, food supplies and transport are protected, its Brexit minister has said. Mike Russell, the Scottish constitutional affairs secretary, told MSPs in an emergency statement at Holyrood his devolved government was poised to expand its rapid response team of civil servants preparing for a hard Brexit. A public information campaign was in the final stages of development, he added. He continued: We\u2019re making initial decisions on issues such as medicine, medical devices and clinical consumables stockpiling, emergency transportation, support for supply chains, diversion of local produce and a host of other issues. All of this activity has become a significant focus of our resources and efforts, as it has to be for a responsible government. However, it remains something that the UK could and should choose to remove as a risk, and as a cost, today. I will post a summary from the opening of the debate shortly. After that I won\u2019t be covering all the speeches, but I will post any highlights, as well as keeping up with all the other Brexit developments. May says a general election will not help the country find a solution to Brexit. And a Labour government would not help either, she says. She says the government is fighting injustices, And, as it leaves the EU, the country must raise its ambitions. She is proud of what the government has achieved. The government has the confidence of the country. Now it is asking for the confidence of MPs too, she says. And that is it. May has finished her speech. Labour\u2019s Liam Byrne says May has built \u201ca cage of red lines\u201d around her Brexit policy. That led to her deal being rejected last night. May says she will talk to a range of MPs across the Commons to find what will secure their support. She says Byrne intervened just as she was getting to the point in her speech where she was going to talk about the economy. Byrne was the Labour Treasury who left a note for the Tories saying there as no money left. Byrne says he was leaving a note for his successor in accordance with a tradition going back to Churchill. He was proud to be part of a Labour Treasury team that stopped a depression, he says. He says the Tories backed Labour\u2019s spending plans. And now, under the Tories, the debate has double. May says, when Russia launched a chemical weapons attack on the streets of Salisbury, she said Russia should be held to account. Corbyn wanted the nerve agent to be sent to Russia so Moscow could say whether or not it was responsible. On the issue of launching a strike against Syria, May says she was in favour. But Corbyn wanted Russia to have a veto. She says, as a backbencher, Corbyn invited IRA terrorists into the Commons after they had bombed the prime minister. And she says he has tolerated antisemitism in the Labour party. Peter Kyle, the Labour MP, says May is talking about engagement with MPs, but she want to court to stop the Commons having a say on triggering article 50. May says she has frequently come to the Commons to answer questions about her Brexit policy. May says the government is building a country that is fairer and that works for everyone. It will carry on doing that, acting in the national interest, she says. She says she wants to engage with opposition MPs on Brexit. The question is, will the Labour leadership rise to the occasion. She fears that they won\u2019t, she says. She says Jeremy Corbyn is not showing leadership. All he is offering is vague aspirations, she says. She says last night Corbyn said it was important, not just to be against something, but to be for something too. But Corbyn did not say what. And on Sunday, when asked what he would campaign for in regard to Brexit at an election, Corbyn refused five times to say, she adds. My colleague Jessica Elgot thinks that after the confidence vote is over Theresa May may be able to exercise more leeway. May says people voted for Brexit because they felt people were not listening to them. That is why it is important to implement the result of the referendum, she says. Outside the chamber, No 10 has been even more specific about customs union membership being ruled out, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, says no one has told him they voted leave because they wanted to leave the customs union. Isn\u2019t it the case that there is nowhere in the world where two close countries have open borders without some form of customs union? May says people voted for a close trading relationship with the EU. But they also wanted the UK to forge new trading links with other countries. (That is a way is signalling that she is opposed to staying in the customs union. If the Uk were to do that, it would not be able to strike its own trade deals.) Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle says May is offering nothing new. She is just repeating the lines to take she has been using for months. May says she has a duty to implement the referendum result. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper says May seems to be talking as if she lost by 30 votes, not by 230 votes. Is May saying she will rule out under any circumstances the UK joining a customs union? May says the government must deliver what people voted for. May quotes some Labour MPs who have urged her to reach out to the opposition. Given what they have said, it would be odd for them to vote for an election, she says. May says the Commons delivered a clear message last night. She repeats the points she made in her response to the vote in the chamber. Asked by the SNP\u2019s Stewart McDonald which of her red lines she will change, May says she answered this earlier. (See 12.36pm.) McDonald says May is guilty of \u201crobotic fantasy\u201d. May says that, however good the government\u2019s Brexit deal was, Corbyn would vote against it. And however bad the EU\u2019s Brexit offer was, Corbyn would support it, she says. James Morris, a Conservative, asks May to rule out a second referendum. May says the country has had a referendum. There is no guarantee an election would deliver a majority for any course of action, she says. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says he and May do not agree on Europe. But he says that when the vote is called, the whole of the European Research Group (the Brexiter faction that has opposed May\u2019s Brexit policy) will be voting with her. Theresa May is responding now. MPs are being asked a simple question, she says. Should there be an election? But that would deepen divisions, she says. She says the people want MPs to get on with implementing Brexit. An election would prevent this. It would mean article 50 having to be extended, she says, and it would create uncertainty. Corbyn says, if Labour wins this debate, then there will be a wide-ranging debate about the future. But if the Commons does not pass this motion, then MPs should keep all options on the table. They should rule out no-deal, and the PM\u2019s deal, which was roundly defeated yesterday. He says \u201cevery previous prime minister in this situation\u201d would have resigned. MPs have a duty to pass the no-confidence motion, he says. And that\u2019s it. Corbyn says a general election would bring new impetus to the Brexit talks. And it might bring new solutions for the problems faced by constituents, including low pay and the scandal of social care. And homelessness is a particular scandal, he says. The homeless are looking to parliament for a better solution. Corbyn says all MPs have a duty to call out abuse. Too many constituents have faced that since the toxic debate in the EU referendum. And the government\u2019s hostile environment policy has not helped, he says. Corbyn says both the Tories and Labour fought the last election on manifestos promising to implement Brexit. But he says any government would be in a stronger position if it had a mandate for Brexit now. Anna Soubry, the Tory, says Corbyn is making some valid points \u2013 although he is not making them well. But why did a poll at the weekend show Labour six points behind. Was it because he is the most hopeless leader of the opposition there has ever been? Corbyn says he looks forward to testing public opinion at an election. Labour\u2019s David Lammy asks Corbyn to confirm that Labour would rule out a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn says he has ruled it out. And he says Greg Clark, the business secretary, agrees. Corbyn attacks the government\u2019s record on welfare. He says only yesterday it used the Brexit vote to sneak out pension changes that could cost some pensioners thousands of pounds. The government is not meeting its cancer and waiting time targets, he says. Corbyn says May\u2019s party is \u201cfundamentally split\u201d on the issue of Brexit. That is why the government can no longer govern, he says. He says May shook her head yesterday when he said she had treated this as a party matter. But he says about half an hour after this happened the Tory MP Nick Boles said that is what May was doing. The Conservative MP George Freeman asks, when the cross-party talks happen, which Scarlet Pimpernel will turn up: the Labour leader who campaigns against Brexit in London and the south, or the Labour leader who campaigns for it in the north. Corbyn says the blame for this mess lies with May. The Tories say they want parliament to be sovereign. But when parliament objects, they do all they can to obstruct MPs from having a vote. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem, asks Corbyn if he will support a people\u2019s vote if he loses the confidence vote. Corbyn says Carmichael knows Labour\u2019s policy. All options would be on the table. Labour\u2019s Catherine West asks Corbyn if he has received a call from Theresa May inviting him to cross-party talks on Brexit. Corbyn says he has not had such a call. Corbyn confirms May has not invited him to cross-party talks on Brexit. Corbyn says it was shocking that the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq had to vote last night despite being heavily pregnant. Anna Soubry, a Conservative, makes a point of order. Was Siddiq offered a pair? John Bercow, the speaker, says his understanding was that Siddiq was offered a pair. But MPs have expressed their concern nonetheless, he says. (The row was about Siddiq not being able to vote by proxy. A proxy vote would have meant she was recorded as voting against. Pairing just means that someone on the other side abstains too, which would have meant Siddiq being recorded as not having voted. And Siddiq expressed reservations about pairing, because the Tories have broken pairing arrangements in the past.) Jeremy Corbyn is opening the no-confidence debate. He says last night the government lost the Brexit vote by more than 200 votes. No other government has lost a vote by that many. And last week the government lost a vote on the finance bill. He says any PM who loses a vote like this should resign. He says this is what happened in the past. When the Liberal government lost votes on Lloyd George\u2019s budget in 1910, it went to the country. (Corbyn is using arguments fleshed out in this Guardian article by Emily Thornberry.) The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart asks what will Labour\u2019s Brexit policy be if there is an election: will it be for Brexit or against? Corbyn says Labour is a democratic party. The party will decide. The most interesting question at Westminster today is that raised by Nicola Sturgeon earlier this morning (see 9.58am); in her cross-party talks with MPs about an alternative Brexit plan, is Theresa May willing to abandon any of her rigid red lines? To his credit, Jeremy Corbyn homed in on this in his very first question, and the topic was raised repeatedly by other MPs. (Or at least those who raised Brexit; it was surprising how many MPs seemed happy to stick with run-of-the-mill questions less than 24 hours after May broke all records for parliamentary humiliation.) As usual, instead of properly engaging with the red lines question, May instead stuck to parroting the most recent line-to-take in her memory, the text of the statement she delivered to MPs last night about wanting \u201cconstructive\u201d talks while still honouring the result of the referendum. She would not address the question about whether she might now agree to the UK remaining in the customs union for good in any meaningful way, but her tone conveyed the clear impression that her lines remain almost as red as ever and that she is not seriously contemplating a departure from what she has already proposed. But on one issue, she did hint that she is having a rethink. Her response to Ken Clarke about extending article 50 (see 12.30am) implied that, if she is not exactly keen on extending article 50, she is at least less hostile to the idea than she was. (Some people assume that extending article 50 would automatically amount to a move in the direction of a softer Brexit, but that is not necessarily the case; she might want to extend it just to allow more time for no-deal preparations.) Corbyn was probably at his best when he asked about Brexit. He quite successfully exposed the hollowness of May\u2019s offer on cross-party talks. After that, he asked about poverty and other domestic policy issues, achieving some fairly easy hits but without saying anything especially memorable. The real debate about May\u2019s domestic record will probably start shortly. Sarah Wollaston, the Tory pro-European, asks May to back a second referendum. May says MPs must accept the referendum result. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, welcomes May\u2019s offer of cross-party talks. He says, as a former coalition colleague, May knows the Lib Dems will work with others in the national interest. But May should not even lift up the phone unless she is willing to rule out a no-deal Brexit and have constructive conversation about a people\u2019s vote. May says the way to avoid no deal is to back a deal. And she says some MPs are unwilling to hold constructive talks with her. Labour\u2019s Ian Lucas asks about the proposed Hitachi nuclear power station in north Wales in relation to her meeting with the Japanese PM last week. May says she did raise this topic. But it is for the company to make a commercial decision about whether or not to go ahead, she says. The Conservative Nicky Morgan asks May if she agrees that all MPs need to maintain maximum flexibility as they look for an alternative Brexit solution. May says she will approach the talks in a constructive spirit. But it is important to honour the referendum result, she says. Labour\u2019s Ronnie Campbell says a recent survey said 4 million workers were living in poverty. Will May call a general election? May repeats the point about the number of people in absolute poverty being at a record low. The SNP\u2019s Stewart McDonald asks May which of her red lines she is willing to give up. May says she will approach these talks in a constructive spirit. But the government has to deliver on the result of the referendum, she says. Phillip Lee, a Conservative pro-Euroepan who resigned as a minister because he opposed May\u2019s deal, asks May if she accepts that she may now have to change her mind about her Brexit plan. May says she will be talking to a wide range of MPs. Labour\u2019s Yasmin Qureshi asks about the drug primodos, and research showing it caused deformities. May says a minister is leading a review looking at what impact it had. That study will be considered very carefully. Tracey Crouch, a Conservative, asks about apprentices. May says she has met many young people who say that is the right approach for them. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, says he listened to many hours of the Brexit debate. He says the only proposals for which there was majority support were rejecting no deal, extending article 50, and some form of customs union with the EU. Just as he has had to accept the need to leave the EU, will May accept the need to modify her red lines too? May says it is because there are so many views that she is holding discussions with MPs. She says article 50 cannot be extended by the UK on its own. The EU would extend article 50 only if there were a plan moving towards a deal, she says. May appears to soften her opposition to extending article 50. When asked about this in the past, she has said the UK will leave on 29 March, but today she sounded open to the prospect of extending. For that to happen there would have to be agreement in the Commons on an alternative plan, she said. Labour\u2019s Roberta Blackman-Woods asks about health inequalities. People in Durham have worse outcomes than people in Windsor. So why is spending on public health being cut? May says the public health budget will be decided in the spending review. But it is not just the public health budget that affects people\u2019s health. Helen Grant, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees that if MPs fail to deliver on the referendum the public perception of politicians will be at an all-time low. May says she agrees. \u201cWe need to deliver Brexit for the British people.\u201d Labour\u2019s Seema Malhotra says last night May said she would hold talks with MPs in a constructive spirit. But now it seems she just wants to invite them in to tell them her deal is best. Is she prepared to change any of her red lines? Mays says she will meet with parliamentarians, and look to see what can get the support of the house. But what this house must have in mind is the importance of delivering on the referendum result. Trudy Harrison, a Conservative, asks May if she will meet with workers from the nuclear power plant in Copeland. May says she is aware of how important the nuclear industry is in Cumbria. She suggests Harrison meets with a business minister. Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle says May\u2019s defeat yesterday was historic and Titanic. Everything has changed, and May must change too. If May is not going to give people the power to have a say over this deal, then what has become of her promise to empower people. May says people voted to leave the EU in 2016. She thinks the government, and parliament, have a duty to deliver on that. Jeremy Lefroy, a Conservative, says the government has committed vast amounts of money to the NHS. But can May look at how money is allocated to CCGs [clinical commissioning groups]. May says changes have been made to the CCG allocations for 2019-20. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, said yesterday the attorney general said any new deal would be much the same as the old one. Will she admit that plan B will be much the same as plan A? May says she wants to hold talks with parliamentarians to find out what will get the support of the house. But she repeats the point about honouring the result of the referendum. Blackford says May has failed. It is an omnishambles. Westminster may have failed, but Scotland is united. She says the PM must seek the confidence of the people. May should extend article 50 and ask the people if they want her deal or remain. She should legislate for a people\u2019s vote. May says the Commons legislated for a people\u2019s vote in 2016. Robert Goodwill, a Conservative, asks about the \u201dnorthern powerhouse\u201d, and company selling exports to China. May says she has met this company. She cannot talk about its China contract, but this is what the northern powerhouse is about. Corbyn says May knows his Brexit policy \u2013 he wants a customs union with the EU. One of the problems with the government is its disregard for statistics. There are 21,000 fewer police officers. When May was home secretary, she would not accept police cuts had an impact on crime. Will she admit she got it wrong? May defends her Home Office record. Corbyn only talks about money, she says. What matters also is what powers the police get. She says Corbyn consistently voted against more powers for the police. Corbyn says a Labour government properly funded the police. Ask people if they feel safer now. We know that the answer will be, she says. He rattles of a list of areas where the government is failing, and it has failed on the most important issue, Brexit. Every previous PM would have resigned after last night\u2019s defeat. May says Corbyn has been calling for an election for weeks. Yet on Sunday, when asked if he would campaign to leave the EU in an election campaign, Corbyn refused to answer. He has let antisemitism run riot in his party. He would abandon our allies and wreck the economy. We will never let that happen, she says. Corbyn says the Commons rejected May\u2019s deal. Can\u2019t she understand she needs to come up with something else? But it is not just on Brexit she is failing. Poverty is rising. When will it fall while she is in office? May says there are 1 million fewer people in absolute poverty, and 300,000 fewer children in absolute poverty. Labour would spend \u00a31,000bn more, she says. Corbyn says May is in denial on a customs union, in denial on no deal, in denial on the amount of money spent on no-deal planning, and on poverty ... At this point Tory MPs jeer. Corbyn says this is significant. \u201cTell that to people queuing up at food banks,\u201d he says. What is May\u2019s greatest failure, he asks, listing various education policy problems. May says this is a government delivering on education. She says Corbyn has consistently failed to set out what his Brexit policy is. Jeremy Corbyn starts by saying he needs to correct the record. Last night he said this was the largest government defeat since the 1920s. In fact, it is the largest defeat in our democratic history. Is May ruling out the UK staying in the customs union in her cross-party talks? May says she wants to leave the EU in a way that respects the votes of the people in the referendum. That means ending free movement, getting control of laws and money, and having a good relationship with the EU. Corbyn asks May to confirm that we can\u2019t have a no-deal Brexit. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said that in a call with business leaders yesterday, he says. May says she does not want a no-deal Brexit. MPs can avoid no deal by voting for a deal, she says. Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative, says he believes in more jobs, lower taxes and stronger services. Does May agree the Conservatives have delivered that? (I think we\u2019re getting a preview of the no-confidence debate.) May says we have seen 3.4 million more people in work under the Tories. Under Jeremy Corbyn there would be more borrowing, more taxes and fewer jobs. Theresa May starts by condemning the Nairobi attack. PMQs is about to start. I normally post a snap verdict straight after the May/Corbyn exchanges, but today I will do it at the end of the session, because May v the Commons as a whole is probably more interesting. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question: The first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, have urged Theresa May for an urgent meeting in an effort to jointly agree a way out of the Brexit impasse. As she arrived at Westminster to meet Scottish National party MPs, Sturgeon released a letter she had sent May, calling for the prime minister to host a joint ministerial committee involving all four of the UK\u2019s governments (although Northern Ireland would be represented by UK civil servants since Stormont\u2019s power-sharing government is suspended). Sturgeon said Drakeford was also calling on May to arrange a JMC, and told May: Your government has now clearly failed to bring the country together in support of your proposed deal. It is time to recognise that reality and change course, starting with a new approach which seeks to find a way forward by genuinely involving the four nations of the UK. Up until now, despite stated intentions, the UK government has taken little or no account of the views of the people of Scotland or the position of the Scottish government. [It] is important, contrary to our experience of the past two and a half years, that such a meeting must be more than window dressing. Urgent and meaningful discussions are needed in the next days to agree a way forward which can command a majority in the House of Commons, and which has the confidence and support of the devolved administrations. The Scottish government believes that the best way of resolving the current impasse is to negotiate an extension to the article 50 period and hold a second EU referendum. Given the rejection of your deal we will now be intensifying work towards the achievement of that aim. Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, and Michael Gove, the environment secretary, will close the no-confidence debate tonight. Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May will open it, obviously. Seventy-one Labour MPs and 13 MEPs have signed a public statement calling for a second referendum on Brexit. They argue it is time for the party to commit to a second referendum and that a Brexit renegotiation, which at the moment is what Jeremy Corbyn is proposing, is \u201cnot a realistic prospect\u201d. Here is an extract from the statement. We represent hugely diverse constituencies from the north to the south, from Wales to Scotland. Many of our constituencies voted to leave in 2016. We must listen to and respond to the reasons why people did so. But we now face a moment of national crisis, where the facts and the views of many people have changed \u2013 and are continuing to change. It is now clear renegotiation is not a realistic prospect. No deal would be a catastrophe which we must resolutely oppose. The government should seek an extension to article 50 to provide time for parliament to find a way forward. Theresa May has failed to bring this country back together. Labour\u2019s conference adopted a clear policy for this situation. We must try and remove this government from office as soon as possible. But the removal of the government and pushing for a general election may prove impossible, so we must join trade unions, our members and a majority of our constituents by then unequivocally backing the only logical option to help our country move forward: putting the decision back to the people for a final say, in a public vote, with the option to stay and keep the deal that we have. Defeat of the Tory deal in a public vote would give us all a chance to campaign for the anti-austerity policies and a Labour government that deals with the true causes of the Brexit vote, and a reformed Europe that works for all people. The organisers say another 24 Labour MPs have publicly backed a second referendum, but haven\u2019t signed today\u2019s statement for administrative reasons. Here is a full list of the MPs and MEPs who have signed the statement. The initiative is intended to put pressure on Corbyn to commit the party to back a second referendum. Under the carefully negotiated compromise position agreed at party conference, the party is committed to calling for a general election first, with \u201call options remaining on the table\u201d if an election does not happen, \u201cincluding campaigning for a public vote\u201d. Campaigners for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d believe that, if the government wins the no-confidence vote tonight, Corbyn will no longer have any reason not to back a second referendum, although Corbyn has serious reservations about this approach and he does not seem keen to commit the party to backing second referendum legislation in any great hurry. Speaking to the Guardian, the Greek MEP Stelios Koulouglou said Theresa May\u2019s humiliating defeat last night highlighted the extent to which Britain had become a case study in the perils of nationalist demagogy. He said: It has become a case study of how nationalist demagogy can destroy a country. It will be taught in universities. It is dreadful to see what is happening. While insisting there was no desire whatsoever in Brussels for concessions, Koulouglou did not exclude Britain\u2019s exit from the EU being extended. \u201cNobody wants to change the content of the agreement,\u201d said the MEP, who represents Athen\u2019s ruling leftist party Syriza. \u201cThere is absolutely no chance of that happening but there would be a will to extend the withdrawal if it meant avoiding the chaos of a disorderly Brexit.\u201d The Greek media have watched the tortuous Brexit negotiations with dismay after its own near-brush with Grexit and today there is rare agreement that Britain has entered unchartered waters. \u201cThere is astonishment that a democracy as old as Britain has got itself into such a dead-end,\u201d the prominent commentator told the Guardian. It\u2019s the sort of mess that Greece would get into. The feeling across the media, with the exception of the eurosceptic press, is that London should reconsider other options, like putting the whole idea on hold. The Syntaktwn paper, which often reflects the views of prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government, predicted that, while May would probably survive tonight\u2019s confidence vote, the most likely scenario was an extension of the country\u2019s exit date until July \u201cin order to give London more time\u201d. The conservative Kathimerini, in particularly pessimistic mood, said the prospect of an alternative solution for the UK was far from optimistic. Citing last night\u2019s European parliament reaction to May\u2019s humiliating defeat, it underlined the dangers of a disorderly Brexit. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, with her MPs outside the Houses of Parliament. Mairead McGuinness, the vice-president of the European parliament, has said it would be wrong to start blaming Ireland\u2019s insistence on the backstop for Theresa May\u2019s historic defeat. \u201cWe must not allow a narrative to evolve that this is an Irish problem and can be resolved by the backstop [being removed],\u201d she told the Irish radio station Shannonside after chairing a debate in the parliament on Thursday morning. McGuinness, who is an Irish MEP, said it was not up to the EU to \u201cdecipher\u201d what deal can emerge from a House of Commons riven with \u201chard Brexiters and ardent remainers and those in between\u201d. In the radio interview, she said would not take lessons on the backstop from the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a man who had power but refused to use it to help seal a Brexit deal. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, is to meet Scottish National party MPs in London later as they sketch out their tactics after May\u2019s crushing defeat in the Commons, with the first minister urging May to extend article 50. Sturgeon tweeted earlier this morning she was travelling down from Edinburgh in advance of tonight\u2019s confidence vote at Westminster, where the SNP will vote against May. (See 9.58am.) The prime minister called her on Tuesday evening after her Brexit deal was voted down, but it appears neither is shifting ground. Sturgeon has reiterated her demands for a second Brexit referendum \u2013 a proposal the SNP now formally backs after some prevarication, but also said the crisis at Westminster underscored the case for independence. The first minister\u2019s trip to London is very largely presentational: the SNP\u2019s position on Brexit has been fixed for some months and, unlike Labour and the Tories, there are no open splits on policy or tactics in her Westminster group that require Sturgeon\u2019s hands-on involvement. And in keeping with the febrile atmosphere dominating UK politics, the Brexit crisis allows Sturgeon to shift the focus in Scotland away from her own deeply damaging crisis: the controversy over her government\u2019s handling of the sexual harassment claims against Alex Salmond. Party sources acknowledge privately that the domestic crisis has knocked Sturgeon\u2019s plan to capitalise on Brexit to reinvigorate the independence questions off course. And, talking about bills, the full text of Nick Boles\u2019s EU withdrawal (number 2) bill has been published. It is also backed by fellow Tories Nicky Morgan and Sir Oliver Letwin, Labour\u2019s Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn, and the Lib Dem Norman Lamb. You can read it here (pdf). Under the bill, if the Commons fails to pass a Brexit deal by 11 February, the Commons liaison committee would be asked to come up with an alternative plan by 5 March, to be put to a vote by 7 March. And if that plan were voted down, the government would then be obliged to ask the EU to extend article 50 until the end of the year. This is designed to ensure that there could be no no-deal Brexit in 2019. Speaking about the bill on the Today programme this morning, Letwin said it was important to come up with a plan acceptable to a majority of MPs and acceptable to the EU. He explained: There is no point in us discussing unicorns which are items that live in fanciful forests. We have to discuss real objects. He also criticised Theresa May for laying down firm red lines at the start of the Brexit process. He said: [May] put down right at the beginning of this process what she called red lines. This is not a terrain in which you can have things you will definitely never do. You have to sit down and talk and come up with a consensus. That means being much more flexible than we have been so far. As well as the no-confidence motion in the government, something else has been tabled for the Commons today \u2013 two new bills by ever-busy Conservative backbencher Dominic Grieve seeking to bring about a second Brexit referendum. The bills from the former attorney general call for \u201cpreparations for a referendum about the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union\u201d and provide for that referendum to happen. Last week, Grieve joined with the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, and the Labour MP Chuka Ummuna in publishing draft legislation on a referendum. While Grieve last week successfully had his amendment passed to shorten the time in which May has to update MPs after losing the vote on her deal, these bills have no chance of success without official support \u2013 which is showing no signs of happening yet. Writing in the Evening Standard on Tuesday, before May lost her vote, Grieve said: As a strong believer that Brexit is a very damaging mistake that becomes more obvious every day, I see sound democratic reasons for asking the electorate to confirm what it wants to do. But in doing so I entirely accept that if the choice is to leave the EU then we must do so, and both choices are now implementable. Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister and deputy chair of the European Research Group, which represents Conservatives pushing for a harder Brexit, has drafted a statement that he thinks Theresa May should make to parliament. Under the EU Withdrawal Act, now that May has lost a vote on her deal, she is obliged to return to the Commons to say what will happen next. Here is a press notice (pdf) summarising the proposed Baker draft, and here is the full document (pdf). The statement has also been signed by 21 other Brexiter Tory MPs. Under his plan, the UK would commit to leaving the EU on 29 March and step up planning for a no-deal Brexit, while simultaneously, as an alternative, offering the EU (effectively on a take-it-or-leave-it basis) the legal text for an EU-UK free trade deal, including a customs facilitation agreement as an alternative to the backstop. Baker said: The Commons rejection of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration is a great opportunity to aim for a better deal that respects the referendum result and is focused on the UK\u2019s trading priorities. We will offer the EU a better deal and we will be ready to trade on WTO terms with the EU if they decline. If we leave on WTO terms, we will no longer be faced with handing over \u00a339bn for little in return, seeing our United Kingdom broken apart or being forced to follow EU laws with no say. This document sets out a firm plan to take up the EU\u2019s March offer of a best-in-class trade agreement respecting UK priorities, the EU\u2019s legal order and allowing the UK to develop a truly independent trade and domestic regulatory policy. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, is coming to London today for Brexit talks, she says. She has also posted a Tweet approving a point made by the Scottish journalist Kirsty Strickland. At the moment it is not obvious that Theresa May will be willing to abandon her red lines. As Politico Europe reports, asked what principles would govern her approach to these cross-party talks, May\u2019s spokesman told journalists: We want to deliver an orderly Brexit with a deal. One that protects our union, gives us control of our borders, laws and money, and means we have an independent trade policy. It\u2019s for others to set out their positions \u2014 but we want to identify what would be required to secure the backing of the house, consistent with what we believe to be the result of the referendum. That does sound like a restatement of the red lines, only in slightly fuzzier terms than declared previously. The reference to a new approach being consistent with the result of the referendum implies that May will continue to rule out a second referendum. It also suggests May would have objections to a plan to keep the UK in the customs union for good - because that would stop the UK being able to strike its own trade deals. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, was on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain this morning. He said he thought parliament would not allow Brexit to happen on 29 March. He said: These are extraordinary circumstances. What you have got, probably for the first in the history of our nation, is a parliament that refuses point blank to accept the will of the people. We voted for Brexit, we backed it up in a general election the following year and a majority of the House of Commons don\u2019t want it. Under the legislation, 500 MPs voted for article 50. It said explicitly if we don\u2019t get a withdrawal agreement, we just leave on 29 March. That was backed up by the Referendum Act that just said we leave on 29 March. However, let me be honest with you, I do not believe that Mr Bercow as speaker and our parliament will allow it to happen. If you want my prediction, I believe the article 50 leaving date will be extended. He also said it was \u201cbizarre\u201d that Theresa May had not resigned. It is absolutely bizarre \u2026 the rest of the world is looking on with incredulity at what they think is a great country being led so badly, in such a shambolic way. It\u2019s not good for our standing in the world, it\u2019s not good for investment into Britain. We need a resolution, there is a way out. It is the legislation, we should leave on 29 March. Here is a Guardian Opinion panel on what should happen next in the Brexit crisis, with contributions from Matthew d\u2019Ancona, Katy Balls, Aditya Chakrabortty and Gaby Hinsliff. Ireland would not object if Britain asked for an extension to article 50, the deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, told RTE. He also brushed aside comments caught on mic on an off-guard moment last night in which he warned a fellow politician not to talk about potential checks at the border in the event of no deal for fear of a backlash. \u201cWe need to hold our nerve this week,\u201d he told RTE\u2019s Morning Ireland. The ratification \u201cdidn\u2019t go well, clearly.\u201d We will have to wait and see. There is an onus on the British parliament and the British government to propose an alternative that is viable if we are going to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Asked about the gaffe by Shane Ross, the transport minister, at yesterday evening\u2019s no-deal contingency planning briefing by the government, when Ross said he anticipated checks on lorries coming from Scotland across the border into Ireland, Coveney said Ross had meant that there would be \u201cminimal checks\u201d and these could be done at sea. In a private conversation with his transport minister caught on tape when he thought his mic was off, Coveney indicated ministers should not talk about the potential for border checks. He told Shane Ross: Once you start talking about checks anywhere near the Border, people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we\u2019ll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. The Andrea Leadsom Today programme interview, in which she played down the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn being included in the cross-party talks on an alternative Brexit plan that Theresa May is planning, does not seem to have gone down well. Here is some political reaction. From Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader: From Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee (and exactly the sort of senior parliamentarian that May seemed to have in mind when she announced her plan for cross-party talks): And this is from Lucy Powell, another senior Labour MP: From the Labour party: And here is some comment from journalists. From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith: From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Elgot The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, has defended the government\u2019s failure to discuss a compromise plan with Labour\u2019s frontbench. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 Today programme, she said: The government has been collaborating across the house ever since the beginning of this parliament. It simply isn\u2019t the case that the government isn\u2019t engaging with senior parliamentarians. Asked why the prime minister had not spoken to Jeremy Corbyn about a compromise, Leadsom said: \u201cShe will be speaking with senior parliamentarians.\u201d She also played down the prospect of Theresa May including Jeremy Corbyn when she reaches out to opposition MPs to discuss a possible way forward. She added: Jeremy Corbyn had the opportunity yesterday to put to the house exactly what his alternative proposals were. He clearly has none. He needs to come to the table and tell us what he wants to do. The country wants to know what the Labour party is actually proposing. Leadsom plays down prospect of May including Corbyn in her planned cross-party talks on an alternative approach to Brexit. Leadsom insisted that the withdrawal deal that was defeated last night remained the best \u201cbasis\u201d for a way to avoid a no deal. And she claimed the government would not be seeking to delay or revoke article 50. Leadsom said: I have struggled with the prime minister\u2019s deal but ultimately it is a deal that balances the various interests, the country has been divided on it but leaving the EU we have to deliver on that. And the prime minister has shown her determination to do that. She added that the legal default position is that we leave in March without a deal so it is \u201cvitally important\u201d that we put a deal in place Leadsom also insisted that whatever compromise was reached would not \u201cnot necessarily\u201d involve a softer Brexit. Leadsom rejects claims government defeat inevitably makes softer Brexit more likely. Barnier added: It is up to the British authorities to indicate how we can take things forward towards an orderly withdrawal. The agreement that we reached with the British government is a good agreement. It is the best possible compromise. Protecting the rights of citizens will continue to be the priority whatever the outcome. The backstop must remain a credible backstop. An orderly withdrawal must remain our absolute priority. The scenario we have always wanted to avoid is a no deal. We are stepping up our preparations for that contingency. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier has insisted that the Irish backstop must remain credible in any Brexit deal. Speaking in the European parliament in Strasbourg, he said \u201cwe regret profoundly\u201d the Commons vote on Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement after two years of negotiation \u201cbased on the red lines of the British government\u201d. Nathalie Loiseau, the Europe minister, told France Inter this morning: It\u2019s bad news, because this withdrawal agreement negotiated for nearly two years is a good agreement and the only agreement possible. It\u2019s for the British to decide what they want. We see there is no majority for this agreement, but we don\u2019t know what there IS a majority for\u2026 they want to leave the European Union to do what? Asked why leaving the EU was proving so difficult, Loiseau said: \u201cA certain number of British, including British politicians, didn\u2019t realise what being a member of the EU meant.\u201d She added that there had been \u201cmassive disinformation\u201d during the referendum campaign. Can the agreement be renegotiated? The text cannot be reopened especially after we\u2019ve gone 17 months with all the coming and going. It\u2019s been one third of my work since I became minister, which is a bit excessive, and we have other things to do in Europe than busy ourselves with a divorce. She added: \u201cNobody thinks a no deal is a good situation, but we are preparing for that\u201d, but warned: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to unknit the European Union because the UK wants to leave.\u201d Sophie in \u2018t Veld, a deputy leader of the liberal group in the European parliament, is sticking to the Brussels line that this crisis is for the UK to sort out. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: We got a lot of questions last night saying \u2018what is the EU going to do now?\u2019. Well, all the options have been on the table, it is for the UK now to decide what to do. I would strongly recommend all the parties to come together and unite in the interest of the UK. Asked if she would prefer if the UK remained in the EU, she said: We never wanted the UK to leave, so if they come to that conclusion then we will be very happy, but it is not for us to say, it is for the British people to say. But it will have to be a realistic, a workable solution, one that is taking into account the current arrangements within the EU, the Good Friday agreement, and the rights of citizens \u2013 the 3.5m Europeans living in the UK and the 1.5 million British people living in the EU 27. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, says the ball is in Britain\u2019s court to bring clarity to the chaos. \u201cThe MPs of the lower house have not made it known what they want, only what they don\u2019t want,\u201d he told the broadcaster Deutschlandfunk this morning. \u201cThat is not enough,\u201d he said. He added he did not support the idea of renegotiating the deal, saying that many compromises had already been made by both sides. \u201cIf one had been able to offer more, we would have had to do that weeks ago.\u201d He said the German government would follow closely the vote of confidence in Theresa May, but her fall would make the situation only more complicated. \u201cFor the negotiations we need a stable government,\u201d he said. Extending article 50 would be complicated in the light of upcoming European elections, he said, and anyway, an extension would require a clear idea as to what London wanted. \u201cIt will only make sense if there\u2019s a way which has as its goal to reach a deal between the EU and Britain and at the moment there\u2019s not a majority viewpoint in the British parliament\u201d. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has again ducked the question of whether the Labour frontbench will back a second referendum. He insisted it was for Labour\u2019s membership to decide. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: \u201cIf we secured a general election, our party then would have to decision about what goes into the manifesto. There is strong support that if there is an impasse we go back to the people. Our preference is a general election, if we get, there is also that view that there should be another referendum. \u201c\u201dMy view is that it will be decided by the democratic wishes of our party members. The options will be: we put forward our own proposals on a deal, or you put forward those plus the possibility of a referendum. \u201cWhat went through our Labour party conference last year was: seek to get a deal that protects jobs and the economy, if you can\u2019t do that, then it\u2019s a referendum to ask people to think again. I think if we do move to a general election that that the sort of debate that we will have.\u201d McDonnell insisted a compromise deal could be reached with the government. My own view is that Theresa May could sort this now. If she had a real discussion, a real approach to compromise bring all the parties together I think there could be a compromise most probably on the basis of what Labour is advocating. But the problem that she\u2019s got is that I don\u2019t think people have any faith in her anymore to deliver that. Clearly extending article 50 is now on the agenda but that is for the government to decide. He appeared to concede that it was unlikely that the government would lose today\u2019s confidence vote. \u201cPeople don\u2019t expect us to win that, but who can tell?\u201d He added: If that goes down, parliament really has to take a strong role ... proper negotiations and discussions to see if there is a compromise that can be reached. Theresa May has said she is willing to enter into those discussions, but she hasn\u2019t said she is willing to enter into them with Jeremy Corbyn. She has not contacted us. We haven\u2019t been invited into those discussions yet. Then she\u2019s set conditions, she\u2019s ruling out by the looks of it a customs union which most of the opposition parties support. We believe we should have a permanent customs union. The relationship with the single market should be a close and collaborative relationship. That\u2019s it from me, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Matthew Weaver now. Thanks for reading and tweeting, keeping following for updates. A few more front pages coming in from readers and I think Frankfurter Rundschau may be my favourite so far... The Labour MP Chuka Umunna has been on Good Morning Britain, arguing that Britain needs to get more time to \u201cprevent ourselves falling off a cliff\u201d. He says if the no-confidence motion fails today, Labour should immediately back calls for a second referendum, though as Piers Morgan points out, this is going to be difficult given \u201cJeremy Corbyn doesn\u2019t want to do that\u201d. Thanks for those tweeting in with Brexit headlines from newspapers around the world. We\u2019ve got headlines in from media outlets in Israel, Bulgaria and China, so far. Keep them coming! Quite a few questions and witticisms coming in about the fact that also on the parliamentary agenda today is a 10-minute motion on the prohibition of low-level letter boxes. There is some irony in this issue being debated today, as this is about trying to get European standards to be added to UK Building Regulations. European standards require letterboxes to be between 70cm and 1.7m from the ground, thus reducing the risk of back injuries and risk of dog bite for postmen and women. The Communications Union have this summary of the issue, which they say they have been trying to get change on for years. The Communications Workers Union has been campaigning to outlaw low level letterboxes for many years. The CWU has been striving for the European Standard (EN13724) to be added to UK Building Regulations \u2013 this requires that letterboxes should be positioned at a suitably accessible height, accessible to postal delivery workers, significantly reducing possible injuries such as, dog bites, fingers being trapped or back strain caused when bending excessively to reach ground level boxes... The problem with low level letter boxes is that back injuries to postmen and women occur each year in Royal Mail and delivering to low level letter boxes at the base of a house front door forces postal staff to stoop to ground level repetitively to deliver mail items which can cause or exacerbate back strain and back conditions. Low level letter boxes also present an increased risk of dog bites when the mail is pushed through the aperture at ground level and fingers get trapped. In 2002 the European Standard EN 13724 was introduced and states that for \u201cergonomic and safety reasons\u201d the centre line of the letter box aperture should be at a height between 700 mm (2ft 3.5 inches) and 1700mm (5ft 7inches). For some reason, the debate about car production in Solihull, currently slated for after the no-confidence vote, hasn\u2019t generated quite the same interest as the letter boxes, though there are some who are keen. I am very interested to see how the news of the Brexit deal defeat was covered in newspapers around the world, so tweet me (@mskatelyons) with photos or screenshots of the front pages from wherever you\u2019re reading from (and with English translations if you can!). Here are a few from around Europe. I\u2019d like to particularly draw your attention to the headline on the dispatch from London by the reporter for Le Monde, whose story is headlined: \u201cAt St Stephen\u2019s Tavern, shouts of victory, lukewarm beer and uncertainty for pro-Europeans\u201d. Some stereotypes never die. Writing in the Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds, Llu\u00eds Bassets warned that Tuesday\u2019s vote had been far from decisive, despite the scale of May\u2019s defeat. \u201cTo the misfortune of the British, and perhaps also the Europeans, this Tuesday was a historic day that does not preclude more historic days, all accompanied by the tragic storm clouds that tend to shadow history,\u201d he wrote. Bassets said \u201cthe great shredding machine that is Brexit\u201d was still hard at work, \u201cfed by uncertainty, bitterness and rancour \u2013 the three dismal feelings that May evoked in her defeat speech, and the three evil spirits that only grow with each day that Brexit remains unresolved\u201d. El Mundo\u2019s main headline on Wednesday morning was equally gloomy: \u201cA humiliating defeat for May leaves Brexit in limbo\u201d. In an editorial, the rightwing ABC said that as neither May nor parliament had shown themselves capable of dealing with the crisis, the matter should be put to the people once more. It seems clear that the moment has arrived to put the decision in the hands of the people, and the most sensible thing to do would be hold another referendum just as voters get to grips with the true arguments rather than just the nationalist-populist propaganda of the pro-Brexit lobby. The online paper eldiario.es noticed that Michael Gove had invoked the famous Game of Thrones line, \u201cWinter is coming\u201d. \u201cHe was one of the heavyweights in the party that had the most influence in the Brexit referendum,\u201d wrote I\u00f1igo S\u00e1enz de Ugarte. Gove and others like him brought winter to British politics and are now horrified at how cold things have got. Too cold for their fellow countrymen. Dominic Grieve, former attorney-general and advocate of a second referendum, will present two bills to parliament tomorrow regarding another referendum on the subject of \u201cthe United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union\u201d. This will happen after urgent questions and before business of the House and before business of the House and the vote on the no-confidence motion. Today\u2019s papers are grim reading for the prime minister, variously describing her defeat as \u201chistoric\u201d, \u201ccrushing\u201d and \u201chumiliating\u201d. The Sun has gone all-out, delivering a classic. \u201cBrextinct\u201d, is its headline and they have pasted May\u2019s face on to a dodo. The Guardian features a rare picture of the no lobby, which is packed with MPs walking through it to vote against May\u2019s Brexit deal. The headline is \u201cMay suffers historic defeat as Tories turn against her\u201d The Daily Mirror focuses on the no-confidence motion launched by Jeremy Corbyn, with the splash headline: \u201cNo deal, no hope, no clue, no confidence.\u201d \u201cA complete humiliation,\u201d says the Telegraph. \u201cMay suffers historic defeat,\u201d says the Times. \u201cDismay,\u201d says the Express. \u201cMay\u2019s Brexit deal crushed by Commons,\u201d says the FT. \u201cHistoric humiliation,\u201d says the i and \u201cCrushed,\u201d says the Scotsman. Even the paper most often in May\u2019s corner, the Daily Mail, can only manage \u201cFighting for her life,\u201d which does not bode well for the PM. In case you\u2019re wondering what the former prime minister of Australia Tony Abbott thinks of the day\u2019s Brexit events, he has tweeted to let you know, asking \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with no deal?\u201d The self-described Anglophile, who studied at Oxford and began his own downfall in Australian public opinion by reinstating the knighthood system in Australia, also posted a link to his Spectator piece on the subject. The article was published just after Christmas and was the magazine\u2019s fourth most-read story of the year, and in it he argues that a no-deal Brexit is the way to go, saying that \u201cif Europe knows what\u2019s in its own best interests\u201d, it would maintain entirely free trade and full mutual recognition of standards right across Europe and offer protection to British citizens living in Europe, if the UK makes similar overtures to the EU. The current prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, said the vote against May\u2019s Brexit deal highlighted global uncertainty. \u201cIt does highlight the impacts of global uncertainty in the economy,\u201d he told Sky News Australia. \u201cWe are already seeing some real tensions when it comes to trade. In 2019, the global economy is facing more uncertainty than it was this time last year.\u201d There you go, the view from Down Under. How did the markets react? The comprehensive defeat of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit vision subdued markets in Asia, with sterling expected to remain volatile until the result of Wednesday\u2019s no-confidence vote in the prime minister is known. Sterling sunk to trading at $1.2855 on the dollar early on Wednesday, having steadied after a tumultuous overnight session. May\u2019s crushing loss on Tuesday night and looming no-confidence vote triggered political upheaval that meant investors paused to assess their next options, putting pressure on UK-focused exchange-traded funds. A Tokyo-traded FTSE 100 ETF was down about one percent on Wednesday. \u201cWhile the margin of May\u2019s loss was a surprise, the defeat itself was something the market had been pricing in for a long time and it appears that participants covered shorts in the pound after the vote,\u201d said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog. Well, the news just keeps on coming. After a crushing, humiliating, historic (pick your adjective, all of them were used on the papers\u2019 front pages today) defeat for May in the \u201cmeaningful\u201d vote on her Brexit deal yesterday, she is gearing up for the next challenge: a vote of no confidence, which will be held this afternoon. The vote will take place sometime this afternoon, after a ten minute rule motion on the subject of low-level letter boxes and before an adjournment debate on car production in Solihull. By that time, Andrew Sparrow will be back with you, carefully guiding you through the day\u2019s political news. But for the next few hours, I\u2019ll be bringing you news and updates as they come in. Feel free to get in touch via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com) or on Twitter. Thanks for following along.

With just five days to go before May must make a statement to parliament setting out her Brexit plan B, Downing Street continued to indicate that she was not ready to budge on her red lines, including membership of a customs union. Conservative politicians are deeply divided about how May should adapt her deal to win over hostile MPs. The South Cambridgeshire Tory MP, Heidi Allen, said: \u201cI thought she was incredibly brave [after the Brexit defeat] and it felt like she got that we need to change. But today it was: \u2018I\u2019ll talk to people, but my red lines are still there.\u2019 And that\u2019s not going to work at all. \u201cMaybe the prime minister needs a little bit longer but she has got to reflect: stop pandering to the hard right of my party and start talking to those of us who have been working across parties for months. We\u2019re a functioning, collaborative body already. She just needs to tap into us.\u201d Some cabinet ministers clearly indicated the need for flexibility. The justice secretary, David Gauke, warned that the government should not allow itself to be \u201cboxed in\u201d, and Amber Rudd suggested a customs union could not be ruled out. Labour has not ruled out tabling further no-confidence votes in the days ahead, in the hope of peeling off exasperated Tory rebels and triggering a general election. But on Wednesday night other opposition parties sent a letter to Corbyn, which said they expected him to honour his promise to back a public vote if Labour failed to get an election. A Lib Dem source suggested the party may not back future no confidence votes if it felt they were a way to evade the issue. \u201cWe will support any real opportunity to take down the Tories with relish. We will not be party to Corbyn using spurious means to avoid Labour policy, by pursuing unwinnable no-confidence votes,\u201d the source said. The DUP was quick to stress that without its 10 MPs, the government would have lost the confidence vote, and called on May to focus on tackling their concerns with the Irish backstop. \u201cLessons will need to be learned from the vote in parliament. The issue of the backstop needs to be dealt with and we will continue to work to that end,\u201d said Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster. May\u2019s spokesman said a no-deal Brexit could not be ruled out. However, the Daily Telegraph claimed to have got hold of a recording of Philip Hammond speaking to business leaders on Tuesday night in which the chancellor said the threat of a no-deal could be taken \u201coff the table\u201d within days. May\u2019s spokesman suggested a customs union was not up for discussion: \u201cWe want to be able to do our own trade deals, and that is incompatible with either the or a customs union.\u201d After meeting party leaders, May is expected to extend the invitation to opposition backbenchers over the coming days, as well Tory Eurosceptics. \u201cWe want to find a way forward and we are approaching this in a constructive spirit,\u201d May\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve set out the principles but clearly there is an overriding aim \u2013 to leave the European Union with a good deal \u2013 and we are open-minded.\u201d Civil servants and political staff are likely to attend the meetings, and ministers can direct civil servants to draw up more concrete plans where necessary, but the talks will not have the same formal status as coalition negotiations. Wednesday\u2019s vote followed an ill-tempered debate in which Corbyn accused May of presiding over a \u201czombie government\u201d. \u201cIt is clear that this government are not capable of winning support for their core plan on the most vital issue facing this country. The prime minister has lost control and the government have lost the ability to govern.\u201d Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, wound up the debate for his party by saying May would for ever be known as \u201cthe nothing-has-changed prime minister\u201d. \u201cNo one doubts her determination, which is generally of an admirable quality, but, misapplied, it can be toxic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the cruellest truth of all is that she doesn\u2019t possess the necessary political skills, empathy, ability, and most crucially, the policy, to lead this country any longer.\u201d The environment secretary, Michael Gove, responded with a robust speech widely regarded at Westminster as a leadership pitch, praising May\u2019s \u201cinspirational leadership\u201d and attacking Corbyn on issues from antisemitism to foreign policy. \u201cIf he cannot protect the proud traditions of the Labour party, how can he possibly protect his country?\u201d he asked. One former Labour MP, John Woodcock, who resigned from the party after being investigated over sexual harassment claims, abstained from the vote, saying Corbyn was \u201cunfit to lead the country\u201d. Had the motion passed, MPs would have had 14 days for an alternative government to emerge that could command a majority in the Commons, or a general election would have been triggered. Corbyn is now likely to come under pressure from party activists to move towards supporting a second referendum. A group of more than 70 Labour MPs announced on Wednesday morning that they were backing the call for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Labour\u2019s formal position, adopted at its conference in Liverpool last year, commits the party to press for a general election. Failing that, all options are on the table, including that of campaigning for a second referendum.",

      "bodyText": "Michael McCormack has brushed off suggestions the government could do more to solve the Murray-Darling fish-kill crisis, blaming drought that he says will soon be relieved by flooding rains because \u201cthat\u2019s Australia\u201d. The acting prime minister made the comments to ABC AM on Thursday, arguing that the current dry spell is \u201cunprecedented\u201d in its proportions but claiming the pattern of drought and flood has characterised Australia\u2019s climate \u201csince the year dot\u201d. McCormack followed the lead of the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, defending cotton farmers and irrigators who he said had been \u201ccopping unfortunate memes\u201d from city folk who did not understand them. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The death of hundreds of thousands of fish near the Menindee Lakes has prompted the Greens to call for a royal commission into the management of the Murray-Darling and Labor to propose a scientific taskforce to look into the cause of the deaths. On Monday Guardian Australia revealed the Murray-Darling Basin Authority shelved its native fish strategy six years ago and ended its sustainable rivers audit program after New South Wales pulled funding. But McCormack said the environmental disaster was down to the fact it \u201cjust hasn\u2019t rained\u201d, with some areas in the catchment receiving no rain in seven years. \u201cWe are experiencing a very, very dry period of unprecedented proportions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it will rain again and when it rains it will come down in such torrents people will probably be saying \u2018what are we going to do with all the water?\u2019 That\u2019s Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s the weather patterns and the climate of Australia \u2013 it\u2019s been going on since the year dot.\u201d McCormack conceded the fish-kill crisis was \u201ca terrible mess\u201d and reiterated the government\u2019s promise of $5m to develop a recovery strategy. But the Nationals leader added that \u201cuntil it rains and [water] flushes through the system then we\u2019re going to be in a situation where sadly these sorts of occurrences happen\u201d. On Wednesday Joyce wrote in the Australian that it was \u201cimplausible and mischievous\u201d to blame cotton-growers for fish deaths because cotton-growers such as Cubbie Station had not taken water from the river since 2017. McCormack took up the theme, arguing that cotton, rice and other irrigated agriculture farmers had been unfairly \u201cmaligned\u201d. He said they were \u201ccopping unfortunate memes\u201d and \u201cdreadful things [are] said about them on social media by those people in the city for whom they have probably never been over the great sandstone curtain that is the Great Dividing Range\u201d. \u201cThey do not know, they do not understand regional Australia \u2026 [and] the great role our farmers play.\u201d Despite blaming the drought for the crisis, McCormack said the government would be open to \u201csome tweaks\u201d of the Murray-Darling basin plan because \u201cas these sorts of rare events happen, you have to revisit what you\u2019ve done in [the] past and improve upon it\u201d. \u201cBut we can\u2019t make it rain \u2013 the government can\u2019t make it rain, the opposition certainly can\u2019t make it rain,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually it will rain, then it will rain in buckets and we\u2019ll probably be cursing the fact we have too much rain and we have floods \u2013 that\u2019s Australia.\u201d The Labor agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, told Guardian Australia McCormack\u2019s comments were \u201cembarrassing\u201d and called on the government to back Labor\u2019s plan for a scientific taskforce. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Barnaby Joyce is still calling the shots in the National party and, like Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison is letting him get away with it,\u201d he said. The Greens water and environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, accused McCormack of \u201ctrying to pretend no one is responsible for the environmental collapse in [the] Murray-Darling\u201d. On Tuesday Phillip Glyde, the chief executive of the MDBA, said authorities had been working hard over the past decade to repair the damage wrought from 100 years of over-allocation of water in the Murray-Darling basin. Appearing on the ABC on Tuesday, he said climate change was making it more difficult to manage the system. \u201cWe know the climate is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has equal impact on irrigators as well as environmental water holders.

      "bodyText": "More than 170 business leaders, including Terence Conran and Norman Foster, have thrown their weight behind the campaign for a second referendum on Brexit. In a step designed to indicate growing support for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d after Theresa May suffered the heaviest parliamentary defeat in the modern era over her Brexit plan, the letter due to be published in the Times on Thursday asks both main party leaders in Westminster to support a second referendum. Conran, the renowned designer, who was knighted in 1983, and Lord Foster, the architect behind the Gherkin skyscraper in the City of London, were among 172 signatories from the world of business urging a second referendum on the final Brexit deal. The architect Sir David Chipperfield and the Nobel laureate and research scientist Paul Nurse were also among new names on the list of supporters. Several other captains of industry, including Mike Rake, the former chairman of BT, had previously backed the campaign and were also included as signatories. The figures from business, together representing more than \u00a3100bn in annual contributions to the UK economy, warned that a bad Brexit deal or Britain leaving without any deal at all could damage the economy. While admitting that many business leaders had initially backed May\u2019s deal, even though they believed it was far from perfect, the group stated that the priority after the prime minister\u2019s defeat in parliament was to stop a \u201cchaotic crash-out from the EU\u201d. The letter said: \u201cThe only viable way to do this is by asking the people whether they still want to leave the EU. With the clock now ticking rapidly before we are due to quit, politicians must not waste any more time on fantasies. We urge the leadership of both the main parties to support a people\u2019s vote.\u201d Both May and the Labour frontbench under Jeremy Corbyn have so far dismissed the idea of a second referendum. The prime minister has said she will speak to senior MPs to find a compromise deal, while Corbyn is pushing for a general election. The warning comes after the CBI lobby group suggested that the UK resembles a \u201csupertanker heading for the rocks\u201d after the dismissal of May\u2019s Brexit plan, saying the country would not be saved unless factions in the Conservative party drop their \u201cred lines\u201d for a deal. It also comes after Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the financial markets were indicating that a delay to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU could be possible after the prime minister\u2019s crushing defeat. The pound bounced back against the dollar on Tuesday night amid optimism that article 50 would be prolonged and that the prospect of a disorderly severance from Brussels had receded.",
