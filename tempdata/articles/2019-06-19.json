Stewart was leapfrogged by Sajid Javid, who increased his support by five votes to stay in the race. The home secretary\u2019s team insisted the momentum was now with him as the insurgent after his defeated rival underperformed in the TV hustings on Tuesday night. \u201cSaj has always had a funny habit of defying the odds,\u201d one campaign ally said. One former cabinet minister denied Raab had been the victim of a plot, but conceded that Johnson\u2019s right-hand man, Gavin Williamson, may have \u201cbullied a few weak souls into transferring their allegiance\u201d in order to knock the former Brexit secretary out of the race. Stewart said he would not dwell on how he had lost the votes. \u201cAll sorts of things might be happening in strange secret ballots,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the end the question for our country is bigger than that.\u201d Williamson, the former defence secretary and chief whip, has been one of the key whips for Johnson\u2019s campaign. In the third round of voting on Wednesday, Johnson substantially increased his tally to 143 votes, almost three times the number of his closest rivals Jeremy Hunt (54) and Michael Gove (51). The chancellor, Philip Hammond, will launch a broadside at Johnson in a speech on Thursday, when the former foreign secretary is expected to be confirmed as one of the final two candidates. Hammond will say any Conservative prime minister pursuing a no-deal Brexit would put at risk every party value, the union, economic prosperity and a general election. \u201cI will not concede the very ground we stand on,\u201d he will say in the charged speech at Mansion House. \u201cI will fight, and fight again, to remake the case for pragmatism and, yes, for compromise in our politics \u2013 to ensure an outcome that protects the union and the prosperity of the United Kingdom.\u201d He will also warn candidates there will be no funds for any of their spending commitments if a no-deal Brexit occurs. Backers of Raab, the former Brexit secretary, flocked almost en masse to Johnson on Wednesday. Raab endorsed Johnson in the morning and by the time voting had begun at 3pm, 14 of his 30 supporters had declared for Johnson.

But he admits he made a mistake, he tried to act the statesman, he didn\u2019t go for Boris,\u201d the MP said. Another former minister confided he had backed Stewart in the last round to see him take on Johnson, but had then switched to support Gove. An ally of Stewart said the international development secretary had been torn over text messages he had received from fellow MPs asking him to tone down his attacks, causing him to doubt his strategy. Stewart publicly admitted his performance in the BBC debate, in which candidates often talk over each other in a battle for airtime, had not been sure-footed. Brexiters were gleeful about Stewart\u2019s ousting. Andrew Bridgen said: \u201cIt is reassuring that there are just 27 of my colleagues who are completely bonkers.\u201d Javid, Gove and Hunt will be keen to gain Stewart\u2019s supporters. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary who is backing Hunt, hosted a dinner on Wednesday night for the One Nation group of Tory moderates, of which Stewart is a founder member. Johnson\u2019s backers have privately made it clear that they would prefer to face Hunt in the final round and avoid the \u201cpsychodrama\u201d of facing Gove, who triggered Johnson\u2019s exit from the 2016 leadership race, though it is unlikely such a successful tactical voting operation could be mounted against the environment secretary, and one campaign source conceded Stewart\u2019s votes are likely to scatter. One of Gove\u2019s backers, Nicky Morgan, said she believed any efforts to manipulate the final two \u201cwill go down very badly with Tory MPs and members ... the obvious motivation for keeping Michael off the ballot is to avoid a competitive race and a real contest of ideas\u201d. Javid\u2019s team insisted he would not be pulling out of the race, and denied he had borrowed votes to oust Stewart. \u201cSaj has never borrowed anything from anybody,\u201d said one adviser. His team plans to woo Stewart\u2019s supporters by stressing their common characteristics and the home secretary was the first to praise his rival after the results came in. \u201cRory acts differently, talks differently, speaks to different audiences, and that\u2019s a message that he and Saj absolutely share,\u201d the source said. \u201cAs we move forward into tomorrow we think we can talk to those MPs. Saj has been written off his entire life, but we think we can do it again.\u201d Johnson added 17 more MPs to his tally. However, key members of the European Research Group (ERG) of hard Brexiter Tory MPs have begun issuing coded warnings to the frontrunner about the limits of their support. Members of the group were reportedly alarmed by Johnson\u2019s refusal to be drawn on offering any guarantee of the UK leaving the EU on 31 October beyond saying it was \u201ceminently feasible\u201d. His evasiveness was highlighted by Hunt, who told the BBC on Wednesday: \u201cBoris has made a big play of saying we\u2019ll leave, deal or no deal, on October 31.

One prominent Brexiter, when asked what would happen to Johnson if he reneged on his pledge that the UK would be out by 31 October, said: \u201cThe same thing that happened to Theresa May \u2013 only a lot quicker.\u201d Johnson\u2019s rivals have openly questioned how he can be keeping the support of soft-Brexit Tories, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the former deputy prime minister Damian Green, as well as no-deal Eurosceptics, such as Baker and Mark Francois. Conservative MPs will vote again on Thursday morning and, if necessary, in the afternoon to deliver the final two candidates who will go on to the ballot paper to Conservative members.",

We will know the names of the final two on the ballot by this time tomorrow.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid\">Sajid Javid</a> seems to have very little chance now of making the final two. </strong>He would need to pick up a majority of Rory Stewart\u2019s votes to make it into the final two, but Javid has been hardening up his Brexiter credentials (last night he said the UK would have to leave by 31 October in all circumstances), whereas the Stewart support came from Brexit realists.<strong> </strong>But Javid and Stewart had 65 votes between them today, which would be reallocated assuming Javid is out before the final ballot. Many of those are likely to go to Boris Johnson, but Hunt and Gove will be well placed to pick them up too. There is no one obvious factor that will decide how these votes split.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Rory Stewart\u2019s bandwagon has been exposed as a lot less sturdy than it looked yesterday.</strong> Maybe his performance in the debate did not help (he admitted himself he was lacklustre), maybe the copy-and-paste text messages sent to MPs did not help, but there is also speculation that his total yesterday was inflated by some dark arts Johnson operation intended to push Dominic Raab out of the race.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Boris Johnson remains the overwhelming favourite to become next prime minister.</strong></p> \n  <p>That\u2019s all for tonight, thank you for joining us, and for all your comments.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-19T21:21:23.591Z\">at 10.21pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0a99518f082364d7ced580\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-19T20:27:14.740Z\">9.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</strong>, the imprisoned British-Iranian dual national, is being held \u201chostage\u201d by Iran, foreign secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has told LBC Radio.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>My message to Iran through all of this has been \u2018of course we can have disagreements as a country\u2019 and we profoundly disagree with some of the things Iran is doing right at the moment. </em></p> \n   <p><em>But don\u2019t make an innocent woman suffer for this, don\u2019t take someone hostage - who is absolutely nothing to do with this - and destroy her life because of a disagreement you might have with the UK.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if her release would be less likely if <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> became prime minister, Hunt said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>I don\u2019t want to answer that question because I think the worst possible thing in Nazanin\u2019s situation is if it became a brickbat in a Conservative leadership campaign. </em></p> \n   <p><em>I know that Boris wants to get Nazanin home every bit as much as I do, and I know that whoever is prime minister will do everything they can to get her home.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Richard Ratcliffe</strong>, the husband of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, today described a<strong> </strong>Johnson premiership as a potential threat to national security, as our diplomatic editor <strong>Patrick Wintour</strong> reported.</p> \n  <p>He said a story in the Sun newspaper, written on the day he met Johnson as foreign secretary, had given him false hope and antagonised the Iranians.</p> \n  <p>The story claimed Johnson had won a Whitehall agreement to repay a \u00a3400m debt owed by the British government to the Iranians arising from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/16/uk-hopes-to-end-long-legal-dispute-with-iran-over-1976-arms-deal\">sale of</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/16/uk-hopes-to-end-long-legal-dispute-with-iran-over-1976-arms-deal\">Chieftain tanks</a> in the 1970s.</p> \n  <p>He said the story turned out to be a bigger problem for her cause than an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/06/boris-johnson-mistake-could-harm-case-for-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-say-family\">earlier mistake by Johnson</a> at a foreign affairs select committee hearing, in which he said Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Tehran.

Two rounds of voting will take place tomorrow, unless Sajid Javid drops out. We will know the names of the final two on the ballot by this time tomorrow.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) Sajid Javid seems to have very little chance now of making the final two. </strong>He would need to pick up a majority of Rory Stewart\u2019s votes to make it into the final two, but Javid has been hardening up his Brexiter credentials (last night he said the UK would have to leave by 31 October in all circumstances), whereas the Stewart support came from Brexit realists.<strong> </strong>But Javid and Stewart had 65 votes between them today, which would be reallocated assuming Javid is out before the final ballot. Many of those are likely to go to Boris Johnson, but Hunt and Gove will be well placed to pick them up too. There is no one obvious factor that will decide how these votes split.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Rory Stewart\u2019s bandwagon has been exposed as a lot less sturdy than it looked yesterday.</strong> Maybe his performance in the debate did not help (he admitted himself he was lacklustre), maybe the copy-and-paste text messages sent to MPs did not help, but there is also speculation that his total yesterday was inflated by some dark arts Johnson operation intended to push Dominic Raab out of the race.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Boris Johnson remains the overwhelming favourite to become next prime minister.</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-19T17:40:57.744Z\">at 6.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0a6ba78f082364d7ced33b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-19T17:11:44.209Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Third ballot Tory leadership results</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here are the results with changes from yesterday, and overall percentages (rounded up).</p> \n  <p>Boris Johnson - 143 - up 17 - 46%</p> \n  <p>Jeremy Hunt - 54 - up 8 - 17%</p> \n  <p>Michael Gove - 51 - up 10 - 16%</p> \n  <p>Sajid Javid - 38 - up 5 - 12%<br></p> \n  <p>Rory Stewart - 27 - down 6 - 9%</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0a635e8f081e872734abc9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-19T17:06:11.810Z\">6.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rory Stewart knocked out of Tory leadership race</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Charles Walker, </strong>the joint acting chair of the 1922 Committee, is now reading out the results.</p> \n  <p>All 313 Tory MPs voted, he says.

Over the past nine months, I have stuck faithfully to it.</p> \n   <p> A no-deal Brexit would plunge us into the worst excesses of disaster capitalism and trash our economy on the back of fantasy Tory trade deals or worse, very real and very damaging trade deals with Donald Trump, opening up our NHS to American companies.</p> \n   <p>I have already made the case, on the media and in Dublin, that it is now right to demand that any deal is put to a public vote. That is in line with our conference policy which agreed a public vote would be an option.</p> \n   <p>A ballot paper would need to contain real choices for both leave and remain voters. This will of course depend on parliament.</p> \n   <p>I want to hear your views, I will be hearing trade union views next week, and then I want to set out our views to the public.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Mostly this is just a confirmation of a policy shift that Corbyn executed after the European elections, which saw Labour coming third behind the Brexit party and the Lib Dems. Until then Labour\u2019s position had been that it would support a second referendum to prevent a \u201cdamaging Tory Brexit\u201d or \u201cno deal\u201d. But it was not necessarily committed to a referendum on a Brexit deal approved by Labour (a \u2018good Labour Brexit\u2019, if you like).</p> \n  <p>Ahead of a visit to Dublin at the end of May Corbyn shifted, and said any Brexit deal (including a Labour-approved one) would be put to a public vote. He said (my bold type):</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Faced with the threat of no-deal and a prime minister with no mandate, the only way out of the Brexit crisis ripping our country apart is now to go back to the people. Let the people decide the country\u2019s future, either in a general election or through a public vote <strong>on any deal agreed by parliament.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Today\u2019s statement, which comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/16/tom-watson-to-say-labour-must-adopt-clear-anti-brexit-stance-jeremy-corbyn\">two days after deputy Labour leader Tom Watson used a speech to say Labour should explicitly be a remain party,</a> more or less just restates the Dublin position. But the comment about how a ballot paper would \u201cneed to contain real choices for both leave and remain voters\u201d could be taken as implying that Labour would not necessarily take sides in such a referendum. (If there were \u201creal choices\u201d for leave and remain, Labour seems to be saying there would be merit in both. In a referendum the party could agree to differ, as it did in 1975.) This is just my interpretation of the words, but party sources, while not accepting it, are not saying it is wrong either.</p> \n  <p>Although in some quarters this is being seen as a shift in the second referendum direction, in reality Corbyn is still managing to hold off the Watson/People\u2019s Vote crowd quite successfully. That\u2019s because: 1) he has not yet committed to backing remain in any such referendum and ; 2) he has not yet committed to including a second referendum in a Labour manifesto.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a56e28d0dc9eddd55cb9ca626bc9344db39da3f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a56e28d0dc9eddd55cb9ca626bc9344db39da3f/0_214_3464_2078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn at a march commemorating the second anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire at the weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn at a march commemorating the second anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire at the weekend.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0a51c58f082364d7ced190\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-19T15:18:07.146Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile 26 Labour MPs have signed a letter to Jeremy Corbyn opposing a second referendum and saying at commitment to one would be \u201ctoxic to our bedrock Labour voters\u201d.

Her achievements list does not stretch far, and today she faced criticism on issues like immigration, policing, poverty, benefits, the prosecution of soldiers in Northern Ireland and hospice funding. The questions on immigration, particularly from Labour\u2019s Virendra Sharma and the SNP\u2019s Deidre Brock, were probably the harshest. In response to the latter, who asked about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>, May tried what sounded like a new line of defence: that it was all the fault of previous governments that did not issue the correct paperwork to Windrush migrants. It was a transparent attempt to cover up for the part played by the \u201chostile environment\u201d measures she introduced as home secretary, and it was unconvincing.</p> \n  <p>Jeremy Corbyn went for May on another legacy issue, the Grenfell Tower fire. On this, May actually had something to say in her defence, She sought to take credit for setting up the inquiry, and was able to list in some detail fire safety measures taken by the government in response. But Corbyn argued it had not gone far enough. It wasn\u2019t one of his more memorable performances, but it was a well-constructed takedown and he had the upper hand.</p> \n  <p>Corbyn, though, was over-shadowed by the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, who used PMQs not to attack this PM, but the probable next one. Given that Westminster is already more interested in Boris Johnson than May, that made a lot of sense and Blackford seemed surprised when the Speaker, John Bercow, let him get away with calling Johnson a \u201cracist\u201d. If Johnson does, as expected, become PM towards the end of July, expect a lot more of this. PMQs is going to liven up considerably. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-19T13:40:46.971Z\">at 2.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0a22ba8f08374cc57910ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-19T11:57:35.572Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The SNP\u2019s<strong> Neil Gray</strong> say in-work poverty has risen dramatically.

She summarises again the government\u2019s response to Grenfell. She says she has met survivors on a number of occasions. She says their pain is indeed great. It will never go away. It isn\u2019t just about buildings. It is about support, including mental health support.

She says she is glad to see Emily Thornberry back from her re-education camp (a joke about Thornberry being replaced as Corbyn\u2019s stand-in at PMQs). Turning back to Grenfell, she says the inquiry will establish what went wrong. On cladding, the government has decided to fully fund the replacement of cladding on private buildings because owners are not doing enough.</p> \n  <p>Corbyn says May\u2019s answer is of no comfort to 60,000 people in high rise tower blocks. They are worried. More than 70 block owners have no plan in place to get this down. Will May set a deadline for the end of the year to get this job done? And will she introduce fines for owners that refuse to do this.</p> \n  <p>May says all buildings in the social sector have been inspected. Remedial work has started or finished in three quarters of buildings. Building owners were expected to take action. They have not done so, and so the government has acted.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0a17398f08374cc5791061\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-19T11:06:37.443Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNormanS/status/1141300597683105792\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Acres of green spaces on Tory benches for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMQs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PMQs</a> .

And Rory Stewart is only nine votes behind Hunt, meaning the race for the number two slot on the final ballot, up against Boris Johnson, now looks much more unpredictable than it did this time last week, when Hunt\u2019s second-place status looked more secure.</p> \n  <p>Hunt was on the Today programme this morning (for the 11th time this year) and he seems to be responding by taking an increasingly aggressive stance towards Johnson. On Monday Gove used his Today interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/17/tory-leadership-boost-for-boris-johnson-as-gove-tones-down-his-criticism-of-his-candidature-live-news?page=with:block-5d0740898f08374cc578f75c#block-5d0740898f08374cc578f75c\">to tone done his criticism of Johnson,</a> and he ended up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/17/tory-leadership-boost-for-boris-johnson-as-gove-tones-down-his-criticism-of-his-candidature-live-news?page=with:block-5d07501e8f08374cc578f7ca#block-5d07501e8f08374cc578f7ca\">spending most of the interview defending his rival.</a> By contrast, Hunt depicted Johnson as thoroughly untrustworthy, with unworkable ideas on Brexit, and partly responsible for the continued imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran. He did not put it quite as bluntly as that, of course - he is, after all, the country\u2019s chief diplomat - but Tory MPs will have understood exactly what he was saying.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hunt implied that Johnson could not be trusted to deliver on his promise to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October.</strong> He said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris has made a big play of saying that we will definitely leave, deal or no-deal, on 31 October. Yesterday, frankly, he suggested that he would not be so absolute in that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Nick Robinson</strong>, the presenter, said that in the BBC debate last night Johnson did not explicitly say he would \u201cguarantee\u201d to deliver Brexit by 31 October. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-leader/brexit-campaigner-boris-johnson-advances-on-britains-top-job-idUSKCN1TJ0QA\">But Johnson did say that date was \u201ceminently feasible\u201d.</a> In response Hunt said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, I am not entirely sure what he believes on this, having listened to him last night. </p> \n   <p>My point is, you have to think these things through because prime ministers have to make these judgments.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hunt implied that EU leaders would not trust Johnson if be became MP.</strong> He said that he (Hunt) would be well placed to deliver a deal with the EU because he would be someone they would trust. When Robinson said Hunt was suggesting they would not trust Johnson, Hunt replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, I don\u2019t want to make highly personal accusations against other candidates. I want to put this positively.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Robinson framed the question in another way. Did he think they trusted Johnson? Hunt replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m going to answer it this way. I believe that they would trust Jeremy Hunt as prime minister.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hunt said one of the Brexit ideas floated by Johnson in the BBC debate last night was flawed</strong>. Johnson said after Brexit there would be no tariffs on British exports to the EU because article 24 of the WTO treaty would allow the current arrangements to continue. The BBC\u2019s Reality Check team explain<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48685344\"> here </a>why Johnson is wrong. And, referring to Johnson\u2019s article 24 claim, Hunt said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s what some people claim. It is certainly not what the European Union are saying, and so that\u2019s why I think there\u2019s a lot of doubt about that. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hunt did not challenge the suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/13/boris-johnson-says-sorry-for-mistake-jailed-briton-iran-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Johnson\u2019s gaffe about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe being in Iran teaching journalism </a>had made her situation worse.</strong> In the debate last night Johnson claimed his comment did not make any difference to the Iranians\u2019 decision to keep her in jail. This morning Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, <strong>Richard Ratcliffe</strong>, said it had made a difference. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course [the comments] had consequences. The main difference they had was, obviously, they enabled a propaganda campaign that was run against Nazanin.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt was asked if Ratcliffe was right. Instead of defending Johnson, and saying his comment did not make the situation worse, Hunt just said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that is for Richard Ratcliffe to comment on. I think it would be incredibly unseemly when we have an innocent woman in prison, separated from her five-year-old daughter, for there to be any kind of point scoring by candidates for the leadership of the Conservative party.

      "bodyText": "Rory Stewart bowed out of the Tory leadership election following the third ballot of Conservative MP\u2019s this evening, leaving Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt remaining in the race to be the next prime minister. The international development secretary could not resist another swipe at Johnson, saying he \u201cfrequently\u201d doesn\u2019t know what he \u201cactually believes about anything\u201d and that he was worried he will let people down as PM. Speculation swirled around Westminster over whether dark arts were employed by Johnson supporting MP\u2019s to oust Dominic Raab, after Stewart received less votes than he did in the previous ballot \u2013 though he conceded his performance in last night\u2019s debate was unremarkable. Communities secretary James Brokenshire, a supporter of Johnson, said the former foreign secretary could \u201clift the spirit of the nation\u201d as PM, while appearing to accept the frontrunner was a Marmite-type figure and saying he was a man who stated his views clearly. Some people may like that, others may not. But I think its actually that cut through that he\u2019s able to achieve, that he was able to demonstrate in those campaigns [for London mayor] Johnson himself said very little following the result, which came on the day of his 55th birthday, retweeting a photo of himself at an earlier meeting on animal welfare proposals and thanking colleagues for their support with a photo of himself exchanging a left-handed handshake with a member of the public. Later in the evening he retweeted another photo: Javid refused to step down from the race, saying: \u201cI\u2019m in it to win it\u201d, and attempted to position himself as a force for change. While supporter, and Home Office colleague, Victoria Atkins echoed the fourth-placed candidate\u2019s remarks. He also posted a moving letter he received from his daughter. Foreign secretary Hunt distilled his CV into 280 characters: negotiator, entrepreneur, reformer, statesman, and campaigner. Earlier, he said that he would give Johnson the \u201ccontest of his life\u201d if he makes it to the final two. Gove tweeted a video saying he was \u201cdelighted to have made it through\u201d and close the gap on second place. He announced he will seek to make the Tory leadership race \u201ca contest of ideas\u201d on the road to building \u201ca better Britain.\u201d Here is Andrew Sparrow\u2019s earlier analysis of the third round results. (18:29) 1) The contest between Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove for a place alongside Boris Johnson on the ballot out to party members is too close to call. Hunt has been ahead in all three votes so far, but Gove has been closing the gap (six votes, then five votes, now three votes) and it is not obvious which of them will prevail in the end. Two rounds of voting will take place tomorrow, unless Sajid Javid drops out. We will know the names of the final two on the ballot by this time tomorrow. 2) Sajid Javid seems to have very little chance now of making the final two. He would need to pick up a majority of Rory Stewart\u2019s votes to make it into the final two, but Javid has been hardening up his Brexiter credentials (last night he said the UK would have to leave by 31 October in all circumstances), whereas the Stewart support came from Brexit realists. But Javid and Stewart had 65 votes between them today, which would be reallocated assuming Javid is out before the final ballot. Many of those are likely to go to Boris Johnson, but Hunt and Gove will be well placed to pick them up too. There is no one obvious factor that will decide how these votes split. 3) Rory Stewart\u2019s bandwagon has been exposed as a lot less sturdy than it looked yesterday. Maybe his performance in the debate did not help (he admitted himself he was lacklustre), maybe the copy-and-paste text messages sent to MPs did not help, but there is also speculation that his total yesterday was inflated by some dark arts Johnson operation intended to push Dominic Raab out of the race. 4) Boris Johnson remains the overwhelming favourite to become next prime minister. That\u2019s all for tonight, thank you for joining us, and for all your comments. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the imprisoned British-Iranian dual national, is being held \u201chostage\u201d by Iran, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has told LBC Radio. My message to Iran through all of this has been \u2018of course we can have disagreements as a country\u2019 and we profoundly disagree with some of the things Iran is doing right at the moment. But don\u2019t make an innocent woman suffer for this, don\u2019t take someone hostage - who is absolutely nothing to do with this - and destroy her life because of a disagreement you might have with the UK. Asked if her release would be less likely if Boris Johnson became prime minister, Hunt said: I don\u2019t want to answer that question because I think the worst possible thing in Nazanin\u2019s situation is if it became a brickbat in a Conservative leadership campaign. I know that Boris wants to get Nazanin home every bit as much as I do, and I know that whoever is prime minister will do everything they can to get her home. Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, today described a Johnson premiership as a potential threat to national security, as our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour reported. He said a story in the Sun newspaper, written on the day he met Johnson as foreign secretary, had given him false hope and antagonised the Iranians. The story claimed Johnson had won a Whitehall agreement to repay a \u00a3400m debt owed by the British government to the Iranians arising from the sale of Chieftain tanks in the 1970s. He said the story turned out to be a bigger problem for her cause than an earlier mistake by Johnson at a foreign affairs select committee hearing, in which he said Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Tehran. Her family insist she was on holiday. Ratcliffe said the mistake by Johnson at the hearing was still being used by Iranian news outlets to justify laying a second set of charges against her. Johnson\u2019s allies say the error at the hearing may have been off the cuff, but the Sun briefing was a considered decision by a senior political figure in the Foreign Office that raised expectations in Tehran, but served only to deepen the distrust of Johnson. What\u2019s next? There will be two candidates left in the contest by tomorrow night. Boris Johnson appears almost certain to make it on to the final ballot, which will go to the 160,000 Tory members to decide the next prime minister. Two more rounds of voting will determine whether Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove or Sajid Javid will face him. The fourth ballot, in a Commons committee room between 10am and noon tomorrow, will see Tory MPs eliminate another candidate, leaving just three contenders \u2013 with the result announced around 1pm. The final round of voting will take place between 3.30pm and 5.30pm, with the result announced around 6pm. With that all done and dusted, attention will turn to the first hustings for members on Saturday in Birmingham, organised by the party which is aiming to hold hustings in all 12 regions of the UK. The final two will both be invited to appear in special TV programmes on the BBC and Sky, and Tory members should receive their ballots by 8 July before the final hustings in London during the week commencing 15 July. A week later, the new leader will be announced following the ballot of Conservative members and from then on it\u2019s over to the Queen. The election of the next PM by Tory members is \u201cunprecedented and unconstitutional\u201d, according to former Commons clerk Dr Dorian Gerhold in a recent letter. This view was echoed in our editorial today (which will be in tomorrow\u2019s paper). For a country that takes pride in the venerable stability of its democracy, Britain is strangely prone to constitutional improvisations. For example, if the current Conservative party leadership contest proceeds as far as a ballot of party members, it will be the first time a prime minister is chosen by that method. In 2016, Theresa May\u2019s rivals withdrew before the final round. In previous applications of the rules it was the leader of the opposition being chosen, not a head of government. The system itself only dates back to 1998. Fine-tuning of the rules was completed by the 1922 Committee just three weeks ago. The process looks undemocratic and has no basis in ancient precedent. For anyone catching up with events this evening: And, cartoonist Steve Bell\u2019s take on yesterday\u2019s debate. An assortment of reaction from Conservative MP\u2019s. Glowing commiserations for Rory Stewart here from Jeremy Hunt. And from others. Along with independent MP, John Woodcock. Sajid Javid defiantly refuses to step down as a candidate, saying: \u201cI\u2019m in it to win it.\u201d He also tells the BBC that he is the \u201cchange candidate\u201d. Speaking to the BBC, Rory Stewart has again called into question the strength of Boris Johnson\u2019s convictions, adding that he thinks his fellow Tory MP\u2019s were not ready for his own message. Elsewhere, a consolatory endorsement from former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. The former foreign secretary David Miliband has said Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit stance is \u201cstraight out of Never Never Land\u201d ahead of giving the annual Fulbright lecture in Edinburgh. The Press Association have filed this report: Questioned on Labour\u2019s position on a second referendum, he said holding a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d is democratically the right choice. \u201cThat would be the democratic thing to do.\u201d He added: \u201cThe Brexit now on offer is so different, I think it would be undemocratic not to have a second referendum.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhat [Boris Johnson\u2019s] said about Brexit in the leadership campaign has come straight out of the Never Never Land of Brexiteer fantasy, which is if we shout louder and stamp our foot more we\u2019ll get a different answer. I just don\u2019t see that.\u201d He questioned the appeal of any of the candidates for prime minister, adding: \u201cWho won the debate? Well Jeremy Corbyn won the debate.\u201d However, he criticised the Labour leader\u2019s Brexit position, saying: \u201c[Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s] claimed he\u2019s trying to speak for remainers and leavers and the truth is he\u2019s not really appealed to either of them. \u201cThat\u2019s not the right dividing line, of course you should appeal to the whole country not just a part of it, but you appeal to the whole country by being clear on what you want, not by leaving everyone confused about what you want.\u201d The former Labour leadership contender, now president of the International Rescue Committee, said he was \u201cone of the few people who voted for Labour in the European elections\u201d. He said one thing Brexiters got right was recognising Brexit is a core domestic issue as well as foreign policy. His lecture argued people are living in an \u201cage of impunity\u201d as global powers become less accountable and those engaged in conflict worldwide now believe they can get away with anything, including atrocities such as using chemical weapons. He said this is reflection of weakening constraints on power both nationally and internationally, including from the US and by Brexit. He argued Britain was not immune to this \u201cpolitical emergency\u201d, adding: \u201cThe promise of Brexit was to make Britain an independent rule-maker, but in an interdependent world that is a mirage. \u201cIn fact Brexit reduces our power in global rule-setting, makes us prey to the trade policies of the world\u2019s big powers like the US and China, and castrates our foreign policy as the recent silence over the Hong Kong protests shows.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe retreat of key parts of the liberal democratic world from global responsibility, starting before the Trump administration but dramatically extended by it, has created a vacuum, which is being filled by a range of bad actors, who are exacting a terrible price from the world\u2019s most vulnerable.\u201d He called on checks on power to be upheld at home and abroad and said there is new dividing line in politics \u201cbetween those who believe that laws and norms to protect individual rights, in foreign policy and at home, are there to be observed and strengthened, and those who say the law is for suckers.\u201d Sky have spoken to James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, a supporter of Boris Johnson, who he says could \u201clift the spirit of the nation\u201d as PM. Asked whether the former foreign secretary was now unstoppable, he said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think any of us are taking anything for granted, even at this stage. Clearly, we\u2019re confident and really positive about tonight\u2019s result, and I think real momentum with people from across the party coming behind Boris .. and recognising he has that positive agenda and could really lift the spirit of the nation. \u201cBut equally, has that determination to deliver on Brexit and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s appealing to colleagues and that ability to bring the party together afterwards, but equally then, taking that message to the country.\u201d Questioned on why he, a remainer and longtime supporter of Theresa May, had chosen to ally himself with her \u201cnemesis\u201d rather than perhaps someone like Jeremy Hunt, Brokenshire said: \u201cIts interesting because I look at this on how best we get a deal for the country, how best we secure that deal with the EU and land that deal here in parliament; and yes, this has been hugely difficult, hugely challenging. Indeed, Boris has acknowledged this is not straightforward ... but I judged he is the best person to get that deal with the EU, to be able to have those conversations with our European partners. And just as importantly, to make that case out here.\u201d On Johnson as a divisive, Marmite-type politician, Brokenshire said that Johnson was a man who states his views clearly. \u201cSome people may like that, others may not. But I think its actually that cut through that he\u2019s able to achieve, that he was able to demonstrate in those campaigns [for mayor].\u201d These victories, in 2008 and 2012, underlined his ability to reach out in a way other senior Tory MP\u2019s cannot, Brokenshire said. A source from Sajid Javid\u2019s campaign has warned against ever counting their man out, while congratulating Rory Stewart on his campaign after Javid\u2019s magnanimous tweet about his former leadership rival just earlier. \u201cRory fought a great campaign, challenging the party to modernise and to be a broad church,\u201d a campaign source said. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to have the support of more MPs off the back of a strong week and a strong campaign and we\u2019ll be in the ballot tomorrow morning. Saj has a funny habit of defying the odds.\u201d Jeremy Hunt has put his CV into 280 characters. Earlier, he said that he would give Johnson the \u201ccontest of his life\u201d if he makes it to the final two. Michael Gove is \u201cdelighted to have made it through\u201d and will seek to make the Tory leadership race \u201ca contest of ideas\u201d. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is staying on message. Rory Stewart has been speaking to both Sky and the BBC in the lobby. Asked if he was deflated, he told Sky News: \u201cNo, I\u2019m feeling energised: the reality is you never know what MPs get up to in a secret ballot. They clearly decided that they were going to back a winner and they\u2019re going to go in other directions.\u201d Stewart expressed his surprise at losing 10 votes, amid speculation MP\u2019s lent him their vote to oust Dominic Raab, and the international development secretary said he did not understand why. \u201cBut something in the air must have made them sense that something was going in the other direction.\u201d He would not say who he would now back, and added that he was looking forward to seeing his two children, aged two and four. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting up at six in the morning and going to bed at two in the morning.\u201d Sajid Javid does not seem ready to give up before the next ballot. That\u2019s all from me for this evening. My colleague Mattha Busby is taking over now. These are from Rory Stewart. And here are some thoughts on the results. 1) The contest between Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove for a place alongside Boris Johnson on the ballot out to party members is too close to call. Hunt has been ahead in all three votes so far, but Gove has been closing the gap (six votes, then five votes, now three votes) and it is not obvious which of them will prevail in the end. Two rounds of voting will take place tomorrow, unless Sajid Javid drops out. We will know the names of the final two on the ballot by this time tomorrow. 2) Sajid Javid seems to have very little chance now of making the final two. He would need to pick up a majority of Rory Stewart\u2019s votes to make it into the final two, but Javid has been hardening up his Brexiter credentials (last night he said the UK would have to leave by 31 October in all circumstances), whereas the Stewart support came from Brexit realists. But Javid and Stewart had 65 votes between them today, which would be reallocated assuming Javid is out before the final ballot. Many of those are likely to go to Boris Johnson, but Hunt and Gove will be well placed to pick them up too. There is no one obvious factor that will decide how these votes split. 3) Rory Stewart\u2019s bandwagon has been exposed as a lot less sturdy than it looked yesterday. Maybe his performance in the debate did not help (he admitted himself he was lacklustre), maybe the copy-and-paste text messages sent to MPs did not help, but there is also speculation that his total yesterday was inflated by some dark arts Johnson operation intended to push Dominic Raab out of the race. 4) Boris Johnson remains the overwhelming favourite to become next prime minister. And here are the results with changes from yesterday, and overall percentages (rounded up). Boris Johnson - 143 - up 17 - 46% Jeremy Hunt - 54 - up 8 - 17% Michael Gove - 51 - up 10 - 16% Sajid Javid - 38 - up 5 - 12% Rory Stewart - 27 - down 6 - 9% Charles Walker, the joint acting chair of the 1922 Committee, is now reading out the results. All 313 Tory MPs voted, he says. There were no spoiled ballot papers. Boris Johnson - 143 Jeremy Hunt - 54 Michael Gove - 51 Sajid Javid - 38 Rory Stewart - 27 From the BBC\u2019s Peter Ruddick Here\u2019s a Twitter prediction, from the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes. Here are the results of the first two ballots, on Thursday last week and yesterday. The result of the third Tory leadership ballot is about to be announced. This is from the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart on the shadow cabinet today. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston, backing up the theory that Jeremy Corbyn may be preparing to back a second referendum with the proviso that senior party figures would be allowed to campaign on different sides. (See 4.53pm.) The People\u2019s Vote campaign has given a qualified welcome to the latest Labour statement about a second referendum. (See 4.53pm.) It has released this statement, from the Labour MP Ian Murray. Step by step the Labour leadership are coming closer to the increasingly clear view of the party\u2019s supporters, voters and members, that we must have a people\u2019s vote on any Brexit outcome and that staying in the European Union must be an option in that final say referendum. In recent months Labour has been losing support to parties that have a clearer stance in support of a people\u2019s vote by a factor of four to one in comparison to those that support no-deal or a harder form of Brexit. That erosion in our support is now extremely serious and threatens any prospect of Labour winning a future election, and so our party needs to speak clearly and loudly in support of a people\u2019s vote. The New Economics Foundation, a leftwing thinktank, has published an analysis of three of the tax plans being proposed by Tory leadership candidates: cutting the basic rate of income tax (a Sajid Javid idea); raising the threshold for employee national insurance contributions (an idea backed by Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson); and increasing the threshold for the higher rate of income tax (Johnson\u2019s key idea). It says all three options would help richer families more than poorer families. This is from Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the NEF. It\u2019s easy to forget that last night\u2019s TV sound bites could become government policy in a matter of weeks. Committing to cut taxes may sit well with Conservative party members. But look beneath the bonnet and it is clear that all the proposals being put forward would serve to benefit the very richest more than anyone else. \u201cWhatever the outcome of Brexit, any of these reforms would leave Britain a more unequal society with higher levels of poverty for both children and adults. For everyone feeling the impact of increased NHS waiting times, overcrowded school classes and unaffordable social care, these tax cuts will come as a double blow: foregoing billions of pounds in revenues that could otherwise have been used to boost public services. Voting has now closed in the third ballot of the Tory leadership candidate. The Conservative 1922 Committee will count the papers, and the result will be announced at about 6pm. More from the committee corridor. Lewis Baston, an elections expert, has also challenged the argument in the briefing given to the shadow cabinet today about how becoming more remain could allegedly cost Labour seats. (See 4.09pm.) He explains why in a thread starting here. Labour has now released a statement that Jeremy Corbyn made to the shadow cabinet today on the second referendum issue. Here it is in full: We have committed to respecting the result of the referendum, and have strongly made the case for an alternative plan for Brexit as the only serious deal that could potentially command the support of the House. At conference last year we passed our policy, the members\u2019 policy. Over the past nine months, I have stuck faithfully to it. A no-deal Brexit would plunge us into the worst excesses of disaster capitalism and trash our economy on the back of fantasy Tory trade deals or worse, very real and very damaging trade deals with Donald Trump, opening up our NHS to American companies. I have already made the case, on the media and in Dublin, that it is now right to demand that any deal is put to a public vote. That is in line with our conference policy which agreed a public vote would be an option. A ballot paper would need to contain real choices for both leave and remain voters. This will of course depend on parliament. I want to hear your views, I will be hearing trade union views next week, and then I want to set out our views to the public. Mostly this is just a confirmation of a policy shift that Corbyn executed after the European elections, which saw Labour coming third behind the Brexit party and the Lib Dems. Until then Labour\u2019s position had been that it would support a second referendum to prevent a \u201cdamaging Tory Brexit\u201d or \u201cno deal\u201d. But it was not necessarily committed to a referendum on a Brexit deal approved by Labour (a \u2018good Labour Brexit\u2019, if you like). Ahead of a visit to Dublin at the end of May Corbyn shifted, and said any Brexit deal (including a Labour-approved one) would be put to a public vote. He said (my bold type): Faced with the threat of no-deal and a prime minister with no mandate, the only way out of the Brexit crisis ripping our country apart is now to go back to the people. Let the people decide the country\u2019s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament. Today\u2019s statement, which comes two days after deputy Labour leader Tom Watson used a speech to say Labour should explicitly be a remain party, more or less just restates the Dublin position. But the comment about how a ballot paper would \u201cneed to contain real choices for both leave and remain voters\u201d could be taken as implying that Labour would not necessarily take sides in such a referendum. (If there were \u201creal choices\u201d for leave and remain, Labour seems to be saying there would be merit in both. In a referendum the party could agree to differ, as it did in 1975.) This is just my interpretation of the words, but party sources, while not accepting it, are not saying it is wrong either. Although in some quarters this is being seen as a shift in the second referendum direction, in reality Corbyn is still managing to hold off the Watson/People\u2019s Vote crowd quite successfully. That\u2019s because: 1) he has not yet committed to backing remain in any such referendum and ; 2) he has not yet committed to including a second referendum in a Labour manifesto. Meanwhile 26 Labour MPs have signed a letter to Jeremy Corbyn opposing a second referendum and saying at commitment to one would be \u201ctoxic to our bedrock Labour voters\u201d. It has been coordinated by Caroline Flint. My colleagues Jessica Elgot and Heather Stewart have all the details here. As my colleague Heather Stewart reported in an overnight story, the shadow cabinet was meeting today to discuss Brexit, with Jeremy Corbyn planning to use a speech soon to outline the party\u2019s thinking on a second referendum. Shadow ministers were being shown a presentation on polling. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has been shown an extract, which is arguing that the party could suffer electorally by adopting a more pro-remain stance. Rob Ford, the politics professor and co-author of Revolt on the Right, the key book about the rise of Ukip, thinks the argument in this extract is flawed. He explains why in a long Twitter thread starting here. Here are his final two tweets. More from outside committee room 14 From Sajid Javid More from the committee corridor David Davis was backing Dominic Raab until yesterday. Boris Johnson is 55 today. Suella Braverman, the former Brexit minister who was backing Dominic Raab until yesterday, is now voting for Boris Johnson. Tory MPs have now started voting in the third round of the leadership contest. Here are some tweets from reporters outside committee room 14, where the ballot is taking place. On the World at One Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary who is now backing Boris Johnson after being eliminated from the Tory leadership contest yesterday (see 11.50am), was asked about concerns that Johnson is not as wholly committed to leaving the EU by 31 October as he claims to be. The presenter, Ed Stourton, asked Raab if Johnson had looked him in the eye and said the UK would definitely be out by 31 October, no ifs, no buts. \u201cYes,\u201d said Raab. \u201cAnd you believe him even though he has a record of lying?\u201d Raab would not engage with that, but he said he absolutely believed that Johnson was committed to this and the politicians had to tested to keep their promises. From the Observer\u2019s Nick Cohen Boris Johnson was the clear winner of last night\u2019s BBC debate among viewers who voted Conservative in 2017, according to two opinion polls. YouGov and Opinium have both released polls of viewers who were asked who performed best. According to YouGov, Johnson was ahead among Tories, on 34%, followed by Jeremy Hunt (20%), Rory Stewart (18%), Michael Gove (12%) and Sajid Javid (5%). And, according to Opinium, Johnson was also ahead by the same sort of margin. Among Tories, Johnson was on 33%, Hunt on 18% and Stewart on 10%. But, as for who won among viewers overall, YouGov and Opinium were split. YouGov gives it to Stewart. But Opinium gives it to Johnson. Sometimes viewers change their opinions of politicians when watching debates like this. But, more often than not, what people tell pollsters about who won after a debate corresponds to a considerable extent with who they liked most before the debate started. Given Johnson\u2019s standing among Tories (he is more popular and better known than most of his rivals), it is not that surprising that he was judged the winner among this demographic. The YouGov poll is based on a survey of around 2,000 people, while Opinium questioned 700 people. These are from the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne. Abdullah Patel has also been suspended from the mosque where he is an imam, the Press Association reports. (See 2.03pm.) In a statement the executive members of the Masjid e Umar mosque in Gloucester said: We are fully aware of that allegations made against our imam, Abdullah Patel, regarding the contents of historic tweets. We have decided to act immediately and have chosen to give him some time away to allow us the opportunity to conduct a detailed investigation into this matter. This is the official stance of the mosque\u2019s executive committee and we hope you respect our right to privacy as we conduct this deeply sensitive investigation. It seems that Theresa May, whose response to journalists on being asked who she is voting for in the Tory leadership contest has been: \u201cNone of your business\u201d, is extending this policy closer to home. Even Philip, her husband, has been left in the dark. Asked who she had chosen to back, a No 10 source said: When the PM said she was not saying who she was backing, that includes her husband. It\u2019s also not at all clear whether May will be able to vote in person if there is a second vote tomorrow. The No 10 source said the PM would be around in time to vote in person for the first round, which starts at 10am. But she will be en route to Brussels when a second one, if needed, starts at 3pm. The source had no information on what might happen in such a situation. A proxy vote is possible \u2013 but who could May trust to deliver it, and never divulge who it was for? This is from Sajid Javid, the home secretary and Tory leadership contender, criticising Abdullah Patel, the imam who raised Islamophobia in the BBC debate last night and who has subsequently been suspended by the school where he works after it emerged he posted offensive tweets in the past. Patel\u2019s Twitter comments have been widely described as antisemitic, although he himself has described them as just critical of Israel. \u201cWords have consequences\u201d was the phrase Patel used in his question last night, which referred in particular to the Boris Johnson column describing women in burqas as looking like letterboxes. This is what the Press Association has filed on Ian Blackford calling Boris Johnson a racist at PMQs. Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson has been branded a \u201cracist\u201d who is \u201cnot fit for office\u201d by the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader. Speaking in the House of Commons, Ian Blackford asked: \u201cDoes the prime minister realise, not only is the member racist, he is stoking division in communities and has a record of dishonesty?\u201d The remarks came as the Labour MP Virendra Sharma labelled immigration policies Theresa May has presided over as home secretary and prime minister \u201cracist\u201d. Blackford\u2019s comments prompted the Speaker, John Bercow, to intervene and urge him to \u201cweigh his words\u201d as Tory MPs shouted \u201cWithdraw\u201d. Bercow said: \u201cI think it would be much better if for now he would withdraw any allegation of racism against any particular member. I don\u2019t think that this is the forum and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to behave.\u201d Blackford replied: \u201cThe member has called Muslim women \u2018letterboxes\u2019, described African people as having \u2018watermelon smiles\u2019, and another disgusting slur that I would never dignify by repeating. \u201cIf that\u2019s not racist, Mr Speaker, I don\u2019t know what is. Does the minister honestly believe that this man is fit for the office of prime minister?\u201d Theresa May replied: \u201cI can say to [him] that I believe any Conservative prime minister in the future will be better for Scotland than the SNP.\u201d Blackford began his exchange by asking: \u201cDoes the prime minister agree with the frontrunner set to succeed her that the Scottish people are a verminous race that should be placed in ghettos and exterminated?\u201d May responded: \u201cThe Conservative and Unionist party takes the people of every part of this UK not only seriously, but we welcome the contribution from people of every part of this UK, because that is what makes the UK the great country it is and long may Scotland remain part of it.\u201d Blackford went on: \u201cWell, of course, words matter and actions matter. The man who published those words in his magazine, the prime minister thought was fit for the office of a top diplomat and he hasn\u2019t stopped there.\u201d Theresa May has got four or five more PMQs before she stands down (the exact number depends upon when the new Tory leader is announced, which has not been confirmed) and, judging by today, they are all going to be dominated by arguments about her legacy. Her achievements list does not stretch far, and today she faced criticism on issues like immigration, policing, poverty, benefits, the prosecution of soldiers in Northern Ireland and hospice funding. The questions on immigration, particularly from Labour\u2019s Virendra Sharma and the SNP\u2019s Deidre Brock, were probably the harshest. In response to the latter, who asked about the Windrush scandal, May tried what sounded like a new line of defence: that it was all the fault of previous governments that did not issue the correct paperwork to Windrush migrants. It was a transparent attempt to cover up for the part played by the \u201chostile environment\u201d measures she introduced as home secretary, and it was unconvincing. Jeremy Corbyn went for May on another legacy issue, the Grenfell Tower fire. On this, May actually had something to say in her defence, She sought to take credit for setting up the inquiry, and was able to list in some detail fire safety measures taken by the government in response. But Corbyn argued it had not gone far enough. It wasn\u2019t one of his more memorable performances, but it was a well-constructed takedown and he had the upper hand. Corbyn, though, was over-shadowed by the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, who used PMQs not to attack this PM, but the probable next one. Given that Westminster is already more interested in Boris Johnson than May, that made a lot of sense and Blackford seemed surprised when the Speaker, John Bercow, let him get away with calling Johnson a \u201cracist\u201d. If Johnson does, as expected, become PM towards the end of July, expect a lot more of this. PMQs is going to liven up considerably. The SNP\u2019s Neil Gray say in-work poverty has risen dramatically. Isn\u2019t that May\u2019s legacy? May says the relative poverty has gone up because pensioners are better off. Gray may want to see pensioners worse off, but she doesn\u2019t. Julian Lewis, a Conservative, asks what May feels about the principle of bringing a dying soldier to court in Northern Ireland on the basis of no new evidence. May says no one wants to see cases like this coming to court. But previous investigations have been found to be not lawful. She says she wants to see terrorists being properly brought to justice. Labour\u2019s Rosena Allin-Khan asks about a stabbing in her Tooting constituency. This could have been avoided with more policing and good youth provision. Will May leave a legacy to prevent this, or can we see more of the same? May says none of us want to see people die in circumstances like this. The government has introduced a serious violence strategy. This is not just a question of funding and police numbers. Anyone who denies that fails to understand the nature of the problem. Anna Soubry, the Change UK MP, says May wants to secure a legacy of acting in the country\u2019s best interests. Will she legislate to ensure the Commons is sitting in September and October so MPs can legislate to rule out a no-deal Brexit. May says the sitting dates for September and October will be announced in due course. Labour\u2019s Sarah Jones asks if May agrees that ministers should have taken the advice on fire safety they received after the Lakanal House fire, and before the Grenfell Tower fire. May says this issue will be considered in the second phase of the Grenfell inquiry. Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh asks why the government rejected plans from the environmental audit committee (which Creagh chairs) for a fast-fashion tax. May says the government has addressed many of the points raised by the committee\u2019s report. James Gray, a Conservative, asks May to praise volunteers. They are the big society, he says. May says we should celebrate the work of volunteers, and thank them too. Labour\u2019s Mike Hill says Hartlepool now has seven food banks. Is that a legacy that May is proud of? May defends universal credit, which she says is working. Caroline Johnson, a Conservative, says hospices for children are struggling. Can May ensure they get the \u00a340m they need to provide good palliative care across the country? May says families must get the help they need. Palliative care is a priority in the next NHS plan. These children and their families deserve the very best care, she says. Labour\u2019s Paul Williams asks if May thinks she cut police numbers too much. May says police forces are getting more money this year. How they spend it is up to them. Gordon Henderson, a Conservative, says police officers and firefighters retire at 60. But prison officers retire at 66, and that may go up to 68. Is that fair? May says she will ask the Home Office to look at this. Labour\u2019s Alex Cunningham asks about a constituent, a refugee at risk of being deported. Will May show her compassion? May says she will ensure the home secretary looks at this case. Andrew Griffiths, a Conservative, asks about the case of a boy receiving just \u00a320 in compensation from the rapist who abused him. May says the child abuse inquiry, which she set up, is intended to ensure victims get justice. The SNP\u2019s Deidre Brock asks May if she will apologise for her record on immigration, and its contribution to the Windrush scandal. May says the Windrush scandal happened because people coming to the UK were not given documentary evidence of their status. People faced difficulties caused by this under Labour and Conservative governments. Now people are getting the help they need. Nigel Adams, a Conservative, asks about the skills Olympics, and the British bricklaying team. May says the UK needs skills like this. She wishes the bricklayers luck in the competition. Labour\u2019s Virendra Sharma says May has failed to reduce immigration. And her \u201cracist\u201d polices have been unjust. Will she admit her record has been a failure? May says the government backs immigration. But it is important that people have confidence in the system. Ken Clarke, the Tory former chancellor, says economic competence has been very important for the Tories. Does May agree that it would be wrong for leadership candidates, or the outgoing government, to make reckless spending promises that should properly be part of a spending review. May praises Clarke for the legacy he left as chancellor. She says she will not make any reckless commitments. But she thinks public services need to be supported properly. Labour\u2019s Diana Johnson asks why the victims of the contaminated blood inquiry are having to wait until it is over before being paid. May says victims and their families should get justice. She says the government is considering as a matter of urgency how victims can get more support. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, asks if May agrees with Boris Johnson that the Scottish people are a verminous race who should be exterminated. (This is a reference to a poem published in the Spectator by Johnson when he was the magazine\u2019s editor.) May says her party takes the people of every part of the UK seriously. Blackford says Johnson is racist. That provokes loud jeering from the Tories. John Bercow, the Speaker, says Blackford should not be accusing any MP of being racist. Blackford says he did warn Johnson this was coming up. Johnson described Muslim women as letterboxes, and referred to African people having watermelon smiles. If that is not racist, Blackford says he does not know what is. Boris Johnson denounced as \u201cracist\u201d by the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford. May says Blackford should be asking her about what she has been doing. Any Tory PM would be better for Scotland than the SNP. Tim Loughton, a Conservative, asks May to back a coastal schools challenge fund, to replicate the success of the London schools challenge fund. May says this sounds like a bid for the spending review. Corbyn suggets it should not take long to amend the Freedom of Information Act to apply to social housing run by housing associations. You cannot put a price on people\u2019s lives, he says. The PM said austerity was over. Can May promise to increase fire fighter numbers and funding next year. May says she can increase funding because the Tory government takes a balanced approach to the economy. Corbyn says the legacy of this government is 10,000 fire fighter jobs cut. May said action on Grenfell would be part of her legacy. But too little has changed. The pain of survivors continues. The government has failed to rehouse all the survivors, to retrofit sprinklers, and to hire more fire fighters. Will the government be able to say, next year, never again? May says all survivors have been offered temporary or permanent accommodation. She quotes the figures. She summarises again the government\u2019s response to Grenfell. She says she has met survivors on a number of occasions. She says their pain is indeed great. It will never go away. It isn\u2019t just about buildings. It is about support, including mental health support. We must do all we can to ensure a tragedy like this never happens again. Corbyn says May should commit to doing the work by the end of this year. At the current rate, it will take three years. He says more than 1,000 other buildings, like schools and hospitals, have problems with cladding. And the government has not accepted the recommendation for all high rise blocks to have sprinklers fitted. May says the coroner\u2019s report Corbyn referred to said councils should consider fitting sprinklers. It did not say they should have to fit sprinklers. Corbyn says the report said sprinklers would make blocks safer. We should not be playing around with semantics, he says. Two years on from Grenfell, when will the government strenghten tenants rights and apply the Freedom of Information Act to housing associations. May says one of the most distrubing aspects of Grenfell was that tenants\u2019 warnings were ignored. So the government asked if this was happening elsewhere. The government has been trying to strengthen tenants\u2019 voices. In future they will be heard. Jeremy Corbyn also mentions the Finsbury Park attack. He says our diversity is our strength. He pays tribute to those who have worked on the floods. And he mentions the Grenfell Tower fire, and asks May to sign up to the campaign to ensure it never happens again. Why do so many homes still have the same Grenfell-style clading? May says she met people from the Grenfell community in Number 10 yesterday. She says she is glad to see Emily Thornberry back from her re-education camp (a joke about Thornberry being replaced as Corbyn\u2019s stand-in at PMQs). Turning back to Grenfell, she says the inquiry will establish what went wrong. On cladding, the government has decided to fully fund the replacement of cladding on private buildings because owners are not doing enough. Corbyn says May\u2019s answer is of no comfort to 60,000 people in high rise tower blocks. They are worried. More than 70 block owners have no plan in place to get this down. Will May set a deadline for the end of the year to get this job done? And will she introduce fines for owners that refuse to do this. May says all buildings in the social sector have been inspected. Remedial work has started or finished in three quarters of buildings. Building owners were expected to take action. They have not done so, and so the government has acted. Marcus Jones, a Conservative, asks what can be done to allow town high streets to thrive, particularly in Nuneaton, his constituency. May says refers to the Nuneaton programme, and says its bid for money from the high streets fund is under consideration. Theresa May starts by saying it is two years since the terror attack on the Finsbury Park mosque. It was a cowardly attack intended to divide us. But London remains united. She pays tribute to the emergency services and the military for their work on the recent floods. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Here are two questions from readers below the line that deserve an answer. Is there a threshold in the Tory ballot today? No. There are never normally thresholds in the Tory leadership ballots for MPs. The Conservative 1922 Committee introduced some for this contest, because there were so many candidates, but the 33-vote threshold only applied for the second vote. Today it will just be the person coming last who will drop out. It is probable that all the candidates will be above the 33-vote threshold anyway. Does the new Tory leader have to show they have the confidence of the Commons to become PM? Under the cabinet manual, a guide to constitutional procedure, if a general election results in a hung parliament, the sitting PM is not meant to resign until able to recommend to the Queen a successor best able to command the confidence of the Commons. The same principle would apply if a PM lost a no confidence vote. At one point a week or so ago Number 10 implied that Theresa May could hang on until sure that her successor has the confidence of the Commons (ie, that half a dozen or more Tories have not resigned the whip because it is Boris Johnson). But then Number 10 said May had no intention of hanging on. When the new Tory leader is elected, she will resign as PM and the Queen will appoint the new leader as her replacement. And if there is an immediate vote of no confidence (which seems unlikely, at least in the early days)? Perhaps Johnson has to call Nigel Farage .... (See 11.21am.) Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary who was eliminated from the Conservative leadership contest yesterday, has told the Evening Standard that he is now backing Boris Johnson. Raab received 30 votes in yesterday\u2019s ballot and the Standard says most of those votes are also likely to go to Johnson. Raab told the paper: The only candidate who will now [definitely take the UK out of the EU by 31 October] is Boris Johnson \u2014 and so I\u2019ll be supporting him to become our next prime minister. We must leave the EU on October 31 \u2014 we\u2019ve had enough delays and we need to get on with it so we can deliver on the task the British people gave us as politicians. Boris will make sure we leave the EU on time and move on to uniting the country behind a positive programme where everyone can benefit from the UK\u2019s success. Johnson has repeatedly said he would deliver Brexit by 31 October, but other Tories are less inclined than Raab to take him at his word. This morning Jeremy Hunt said he could no longer be sure that this was Johnson\u2019s firm intention. (See 9.49am.) And there have been various hints from Johnson himself that he might relax this deadline. At his campaign launch Johnson refused to say he would resign if the UK was still in the EU after October, and in an interview with the World at One on Friday he said it would be wrong \u201cat this stage\u201d to signal a willingness to delay Brexit into November. Yesterday, when Johnson told business leaders in a private meeting that he would take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, some of them weren\u2019t convinced. Turning away from the Tory leadership contest for a moment, this is worth noting; at a Daily Telegraph event last night, Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, said his party would be willing to form an electoral pact with a Boris Johnson-led Conservative party in an election held to get a mandate for a no-deal Brexit. He said such an election might happen if Johnson lost a confidence vote in the Commons in these circumstances. As the Telegraph reports, Farage said: If [Johnson] has the guts to be prepared to be voted down by parliament, to call an election on a clean Brexit [ie, no-deal], then I would suggest that ... logically there is a deal that could be done, and in those circumstances Boris would come back with a massive, massive majority ... If he was prepared to do that of course I\u2019d want to work with them, of course I\u2019d do that. Crashing out of the EU on 31 October will have serious implications for hospitals, patients and pharmacies, with shortages of some medicines within weeks, MPs have been told by the medicine industry. Critical medicines, short shelf life medicines, some of which may need to be refrigerated until they are consumed, will be most vulnerable in a no-deal scenario, the Brexit select committee heard on Wednesday. \u201cWe would expect medicine shortages and a lot of price rises for the NHS pretty quickly and some shortages in some constituencies for sure,\u201d Martin Sawer, executive director of the Healthcare Distribution Association told them. Counterfeit and substandard drugs could also find their way into pharmacies if the UK is forcibly detached from a new system introduced by the EU in February requiring all medicines to have their unique barcode, Sawer told the committee. He went on: If we leave with no deal, we could be unplugged from that system and therefore medicines in the UK we believe could be less safe because there is evidence already of organised crime trying to get into regular prescription market. They have already picked up some packets through this new system in Holland which often [supplies] comes the UK. The Michael Gove camp are also dismissing the notion that Gove might stand aside for Rory Stewart. (See 10.37am.) A Gove source said: We are in it to win it and obviously we would welcome the support of any candidate that wanted to drop out and support us. Following Rory Stewart\u2019s revelation on the Victoria Derbyshire show that he is in talks with Michael Gove about a pact (see 10.37am), a source from the Stewart camp has been in touch to play down the idea that Stewart might stand aside for Gove. The source said: Clearly at some point people will need to combine teams But any team that gets combined, Rory wants to lead it - Rory believes he is the only one with a chance to beat Boris in the final two and to provide the clearest choice He\u2019s the one out polling in the areas we need to win. Rory\u2019s in this to win, whether on his own or with other people coming behind him. The BBC has put out this statement about Abdullah Patel, the imam featured in the BBC Tory leadership debate last night who has posted anti-Israel comments on Twitter. (See 10.11am.) A spokesperson said: We carried out background research into the online and social media profiles of all our questioners for last night\u2019s debate. Following the debate, one individual reactivated a public twitter account he had previously deactivated, whose tweets were not visible during our research period. Had we been aware of the views he expressed there he would not have been selected. Rory Stewart told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire that his team was in talks with Michael Gove\u2019s about combining to take on Boris Johnson. He explained: We\u2019re talking about combining forces, because it\u2019s clear that Boris is going into the last round and the question is, who is best placed to sit on the stage with Boris Johnson and who is best placed to ask the testing questions that need to be asked and who has the vision of Britain that is going to excite people, get young people involved again in politics, and show us that we can build a much better country. But when Derbyshire said it was hard to see how they could unite, given their differing views on Brexit (Stewart thinks MPs should pass Theresa May\u2019s deal; Gove thinks it needs to be changed), Stewart admitted this could be a problem. He said: By sitting down and thrashing through that very issue ... We would have to sit down and come to a common position. I would have to say to him, \u2018How is it that you think you are going to get a different deal through Brussels\u2019 How would you get a no-deal through parliament?\u2019 We would have to agree to compromise. And if neither of us were prepared to budge on our analysis of the situation, then of course we couldn\u2019t combine as a team. Rory Stewart, the international development secretary and another Tory leadership contender, has just told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show that he was up until 3am texting MPs asking them to support his campaign. He has had two new pledges, he said. A BBC presenter has apologised after an imam who questioned the Tory leadership contenders about Islamophobia was found to have made critical comments about Israel. As the Press Association reports, Nicky Campbell, who had Abdullah Patel on his breakfast show on BBC Radio 5 Live the morning after the live TV debate, said the imam had made \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d remarks on Twitter, and that he was \u201csorry\u201d the broadcaster had not checked beforehand. In tweets unearthed by the Guido Fawkes website, Patel wrote: Every Political figure on the Zionist\u2019s payroll is scaring the world about Corbyn. They don\u2019t like him. He seems best suited to tackle them! Patel also shared an image endorsing the relocation of Israel to the US as a way of solving the Israel/Palestine conflict. He has since taken down his Twitter account. Campbell tweeted: I would like to apologise. We had the Imam from the BBC Tory leadership debate on our programme this morning. His social media comments have been extremely disturbing. We should have checked. We didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. In his Today interview Jeremy Hunt confirmed that he wanted an independent inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia in the Conservative party. He said: I think we should have an independent inquiry because the cancer of racism and prejudice is not restricted to any one political party. We have been very vociferous calling out Jeremy Corbyn and anti-Semitism and if we are going to do that, and I think we are right to do that, then we have to be whiter than white ourselves. In last night\u2019s BBC debate Sajid Javid, the home secretary, appeared to bounce all the candidates into agreeing to such an inquiry. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, retained his second place in yesterday\u2019s Tory leadership ballot, but Michael Gove is catching up on him and there is a good chance that Gove could get more votes today (because 30 Brexiter Dominic Raab votes are now available). And Rory Stewart is only nine votes behind Hunt, meaning the race for the number two slot on the final ballot, up against Boris Johnson, now looks much more unpredictable than it did this time last week, when Hunt\u2019s second-place status looked more secure. Hunt was on the Today programme this morning (for the 11th time this year) and he seems to be responding by taking an increasingly aggressive stance towards Johnson. On Monday Gove used his Today interview to tone done his criticism of Johnson, and he ended up spending most of the interview defending his rival. By contrast, Hunt depicted Johnson as thoroughly untrustworthy, with unworkable ideas on Brexit, and partly responsible for the continued imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran. He did not put it quite as bluntly as that, of course - he is, after all, the country\u2019s chief diplomat - but Tory MPs will have understood exactly what he was saying. Here are the main points. Hunt implied that Johnson could not be trusted to deliver on his promise to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. He said: Boris has made a big play of saying that we will definitely leave, deal or no-deal, on 31 October. Yesterday, frankly, he suggested that he would not be so absolute in that. Nick Robinson, the presenter, said that in the BBC debate last night Johnson did not explicitly say he would \u201cguarantee\u201d to deliver Brexit by 31 October. But Johnson did say that date was \u201ceminently feasible\u201d. In response Hunt said: Well, I am not entirely sure what he believes on this, having listened to him last night. My point is, you have to think these things through because prime ministers have to make these judgments. Hunt implied that EU leaders would not trust Johnson if be became MP. He said that he (Hunt) would be well placed to deliver a deal with the EU because he would be someone they would trust. When Robinson said Hunt was suggesting they would not trust Johnson, Hunt replied: Well, I don\u2019t want to make highly personal accusations against other candidates. I want to put this positively. Robinson framed the question in another way. Did he think they trusted Johnson? Hunt replied: I\u2019m going to answer it this way. I believe that they would trust Jeremy Hunt as prime minister. Hunt said one of the Brexit ideas floated by Johnson in the BBC debate last night was flawed. Johnson said after Brexit there would be no tariffs on British exports to the EU because article 24 of the WTO treaty would allow the current arrangements to continue. The BBC\u2019s Reality Check team explain here why Johnson is wrong. And, referring to Johnson\u2019s article 24 claim, Hunt said: That\u2019s what some people claim. It is certainly not what the European Union are saying, and so that\u2019s why I think there\u2019s a lot of doubt about that. Hunt did not challenge the suggestion that Johnson\u2019s gaffe about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe being in Iran teaching journalism had made her situation worse. In the debate last night Johnson claimed his comment did not make any difference to the Iranians\u2019 decision to keep her in jail. This morning Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said it had made a difference. He said: Of course [the comments] had consequences. The main difference they had was, obviously, they enabled a propaganda campaign that was run against Nazanin. Hunt was asked if Ratcliffe was right. Instead of defending Johnson, and saying his comment did not make the situation worse, Hunt just said: I think that is for Richard Ratcliffe to comment on. I think it would be incredibly unseemly when we have an innocent woman in prison, separated from her five-year-old daughter, for there to be any kind of point scoring by candidates for the leadership of the Conservative party. My job as foreign secretary now is to get her out, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to focus on. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: The Commons Brexit committee takes evidence from the Chemical Industries Association, Universities UK International, UK Research and Innovation, the BioIndustry Association and the Healthcare Distribution Association. 10.15am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, speaks at the World Forum on Climate Justice in Glasgow. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2.30pm: Rory Stewart, the international development secretary and a Tory leadership contender, gives evidence to the Commons international development committee. 3pm: Conservatives start voting in the third round of the leadership contest. Voting closes at 5pm. 6pm: The result of the Tory leadership ballot gets announced. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively mostly on the Tory leadership contest and the debate. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Overnight he\u2019d lost his principles, come out swinging hard for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October to win over Dominic Raab\u2019s psychonaut supporters and looked all the more chipper for it. Once the contest was over, he\u2019d even have the sodding dog put down. He\u2019d never much liked it, but it had been worth some votes. Raab himself looked chastened. But then anyone would if they were out on police bail in connection with the murder of five people, whose bodies had turned up in the Thames the night before. Next in was Michael Gove, who has also perked up now he appears to be in recovery from his drug hell. The Narcotics Anonymous meetings have clearly been doing him a power of good. He has just about mastered Step One, his powerlessness over his unsuitability to be prime minister, but has a lot of work to do on his character defects. Where to begin with them? Westminster\u2019s very own priapic Mr Blobby, Boris Johnson, yet again said nothing as his courtiers danced around him, parading their undying loyalty as if to some Tudor king. There\u2019s going to be a lot of disappointed MPs when the inevitable coronation takes place in July. Matt \u201cGizza Job\u201d Hancock was taking no chances. The former remainer, now hardline \u201cBring it on Michel, if you think you\u2019re hard enough\u201d Eurosceptic, proudly displayed the burner phone he\u2019d taken into the voting booth with him. A photo had already been sent to Mr Blobby\u2019s campaign manager, Gavin Williamson. An hour later Walking Rory finally wandered into view. He apologised for his absence. He had been down in the tearooms, begging for support. Did he have enough? \u201cWho knows?\u201d he shrugged, as he had in the previous rounds. But this time he sounded as if he really meant it. He was worried about one proxy voter, but thought he might have picked up a couple more supporters from Raab. And yes, he wished he had done better in the debate the night before, but it wasn\u2019t easy when you had four mad people telling you you were mad. His Brexit plans may be just as unrealistic as everyone else\u2019s, but at least he talked human. Yet again, Theresa May refused to disclose how she had voted, once more telling a crowd of journalists to mind their own business. She must have been tempted to say she had voted for Mr Blobby. Just about the only thing that could stop Johnson from becoming the next prime minister was a gushing endorsement from the present occupant of No 10. There again, the emeritus prime minister could just be sadistic enough to want Johnson to experience the full hubris of his ambition, knowing that he was bound to screw up big time sooner rather than later and that the Tories would be ruthless in removing him. She certainly hadn\u2019t been in the mood to defend Mr Blobby\u2019s reputation at a sparsely-attended PMQs. After struggling to answer some well-directed questions from Jeremy Corbyn about Grenfell Tower \u2013 who would have guessed that setting up a public inquiry might not cut it or that private landlords might not be too bothered about dangerous cladding? \u2013 May found herself on the receiving end of a tirade from the SNP leader Ian Blackford about Johnson\u2019s racism. Several Tory MPs feigned outrage that a man who had made frequent racist remarks should be labelled a racist, but May merely demurred. Tory MPs had made it clear they wanted a racist fantasist as their next leader. They could reap what they had sown.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to have led the Conservative party. I\u2019d like to have been prime minister,\u201d confessed a disappointed Conservative politician on Monday. It is proving to be that kind of week for the Tory combatants. Today it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/19/tory-leadership-race-stewart-out-as-johnson-extends-lead\" title=\"\">Rory Stewart\u2019s turn</a> to come to terms with the dying of his national leadership dream, as Boris Johnson consolidated his grip on the Tory election in advance of today\u2019s next rounds.</p> <p>But these words of regret did not come from Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock or any of the earlier fallers in this contest. Instead they were spoken this week by Michael Heseltine, in the final part of the BBC\u2019s excellent five-part documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/17/thatcher-a-very-british-revolution-review-the-iron-ladys-downfall-in-compelling-detail\" title=\"\">Thatcher: a Very British Revolution</a>. It is what Heseltine said next that speaks most directly of all to the perhaps unsolvable problems facing today\u2019s Tory party. If he had become prime minister, Heseltine said: \u201cIt would have been a different country.\u201d He is right about that. But he didn\u2019t. So it isn\u2019t. And that is the Tory party\u2019s problem.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Brexit is the price the party is paying for the unchecked flowering of poisonous political seeds planted under Thatcher</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The scale of the crisis facing the Conservative party is not new, but it has never been more serious. It is 40 years since Margaret Thatcher arrived in Downing Street, and nearly 29 since Heseltine lost to John Major in the contest to succeed her in 1990. To many, these events will seem ancient history, noteworthy only for Thatcher\u2019s historic status as Britain\u2019s first female prime minister. But the Thatcher years continue to haunt the modern Tory party in malign and destructive ways, of which the BBC series was stuffed with rich examples. Theresa May\u2019s prime ministerial calvary cannot be understood without them. Nor can the seemingly impossible options that will face her successor.</p> <p>Brexit may seem like the overriding problem for the Tories. But Brexit is the price the party is paying for the unchecked flowering of many of the poisonous political seeds planted under Thatcher. She inherited a party from Edward Heath that was not just pro-European. It also supported investment in jobs, wanted increases in social service budgets, and believed in regional policy \u2013 all issues with which Heseltine was strongly associated. She bequeathed a party to John Major that was increasingly anti-European, indifferent to regional policy, and which favoured tax cuts at the expense of public spending as a matter of dogma.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b4504ac5cd4d92c01e28cda1d3b97c83723164e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b4504ac5cd4d92c01e28cda1d3b97c83723164e/0_194_2848_1708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Heseltine at the 1980 party conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pro-European and pro-government intervention \u2026\u2019 Michael Heseltine at the 1980 party conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Francis/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result \u2013 even three decades on \u2013 is a party that can barely conduct a sensible debate about anything, as the candidates proved this week. Nowhere is this more true than on public spending and the role of government. May tried to break this mould sometimes \u2013 it was one of her better instincts \u2013 but she never managed to persuade the party, Philip Hammond in particular, to do the same. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/18/rory-stewart-survives-as-dominic-raab-eliminated-from-tory-leadership-race\" title=\"\">Rory Stewart</a> has stood out, until now, as he made the case for necessary taxation and spending, but only because what he says is so unusual now, even among liberal Tories, including of the Cameron-Osborne era. All the four surviving candidates have continued to act as though these realities do not even exist.</p> <p>It is hardly surprising that, following Tuesday\u2019s candidates\u2019 debate, Heseltine told Newsnight that he felt \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d by the current process. He is right about that, too. That\u2019s because his kind of pro-European and pro-government intervention Tory \u2013 the Guardian\u2019s late Hugo Young once described Heseltine as \u201cHeath, but with children\u201d \u2013 is simply withering on the vine. This process has been brutally accelerated by the party\u2019s doctrinal obsession with Brexit. Same old Tories? Not a bit of it.</p> <p>A YouGov poll this week underscored the stunning scale of the reshaping, of which this election is both a symptom and a catalyst. Jeremy Hunt insisted several times in Tuesday\u2019s TV debate that the Tories are the party of business and of the union. That may have been true a generation ago, but it is more than questionable now. By two to one, the poll found that Tory members would rather Brexit took place even if it meant significant damage to the economy, even if it meant Scotland leaving the United Kingdom, and even if it meant the loss of Northern Ireland, too. A large majority of Tories even think Brexit is <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/06/18/most-conservative-members-would-see-party-destroye\" title=\"\">more important</a> than the survival of their party. Half of them would be happy for Nigel Farage to be their new leader.</p> <p>Thatcher was actually more pragmatic than is sometimes recognised. But that is not how her party remembers her. This week\u2019s poll found that <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/06/18/four-more-discoveries-our-conservative-member-surv\" title=\"\">93% of Tory members</a> think favourably of Thatcher as a party leader, second only to the sacred Winston Churchill. Languishing at the bottom of the pile of former leaders, in Tory members\u2019 estimation, below even Alec Douglas-Home, is Heath on 23%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/tv-debate-bbc-boris-johnson-sajid-javid-jeremy-hunt-michael-gove-rory-stewart-jonathan-freedland\">TV debate brought home a terrifying truth: one of these men will be PM | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This represents an enormous shift of mentality that will not be easily reversed, even if the party was prepared to try. The Tory party used to have a practical reputation. A lot of this was exaggerated. The image was always a bit of a caricature. The Tories were always more open to ideas than they are given credit for. But the party rested on a platform of realism, too, a big example of which was Iain Macleod\u2019s success in persuading the party not to re-privatise the National Health Service in the 1950s.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019d like to have led the Conservative party. I\u2019d like to have been prime minister,\u201d confessed a disappointed Conservative politician on Monday. It is proving to be that kind of week for the Tory combatants. Today it was Rory Stewart\u2019s turn to come to terms with the dying of his national leadership dream, as Boris Johnson consolidated his grip on the Tory election in advance of today\u2019s next rounds. But these words of regret did not come from Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock or any of the earlier fallers in this contest. Instead they were spoken this week by Michael Heseltine, in the final part of the BBC\u2019s excellent five-part documentary, Thatcher: a Very British Revolution. It is what Heseltine said next that speaks most directly of all to the perhaps unsolvable problems facing today\u2019s Tory party. If he had become prime minister, Heseltine said: \u201cIt would have been a different country.\u201d He is right about that. But he didn\u2019t. So it isn\u2019t. And that is the Tory party\u2019s problem. The scale of the crisis facing the Conservative party is not new, but it has never been more serious. It is 40 years since Margaret Thatcher arrived in Downing Street, and nearly 29 since Heseltine lost to John Major in the contest to succeed her in 1990. To many, these events will seem ancient history, noteworthy only for Thatcher\u2019s historic status as Britain\u2019s first female prime minister. But the Thatcher years continue to haunt the modern Tory party in malign and destructive ways, of which the BBC series was stuffed with rich examples. Theresa May\u2019s prime ministerial calvary cannot be understood without them. Nor can the seemingly impossible options that will face her successor. Brexit may seem like the overriding problem for the Tories. But Brexit is the price the party is paying for the unchecked flowering of many of the poisonous political seeds planted under Thatcher. She inherited a party from Edward Heath that was not just pro-European. It also supported investment in jobs, wanted increases in social service budgets, and believed in regional policy \u2013 all issues with which Heseltine was strongly associated. She bequeathed a party to John Major that was increasingly anti-European, indifferent to regional policy, and which favoured tax cuts at the expense of public spending as a matter of dogma. The result \u2013 even three decades on \u2013 is a party that can barely conduct a sensible debate about anything, as the candidates proved this week. Nowhere is this more true than on public spending and the role of government. May tried to break this mould sometimes \u2013 it was one of her better instincts \u2013 but she never managed to persuade the party, Philip Hammond in particular, to do the same. Rory Stewart has stood out, until now, as he made the case for necessary taxation and spending, but only because what he says is so unusual now, even among liberal Tories, including of the Cameron-Osborne era. All the four surviving candidates have continued to act as though these realities do not even exist. It is hardly surprising that, following Tuesday\u2019s candidates\u2019 debate, Heseltine told Newsnight that he felt \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d by the current process. He is right about that, too. That\u2019s because his kind of pro-European and pro-government intervention Tory \u2013 the Guardian\u2019s late Hugo Young once described Heseltine as \u201cHeath, but with children\u201d \u2013 is simply withering on the vine. This process has been brutally accelerated by the party\u2019s doctrinal obsession with Brexit. Same old Tories? Not a bit of it. A YouGov poll this week underscored the stunning scale of the reshaping, of which this election is both a symptom and a catalyst. Jeremy Hunt insisted several times in Tuesday\u2019s TV debate that the Tories are the party of business and of the union. That may have been true a generation ago, but it is more than questionable now. By two to one, the poll found that Tory members would rather Brexit took place even if it meant significant damage to the economy, even if it meant Scotland leaving the United Kingdom, and even if it meant the loss of Northern Ireland, too. A large majority of Tories even think Brexit is more important than the survival of their party. Half of them would be happy for Nigel Farage to be their new leader. Thatcher was actually more pragmatic than is sometimes recognised. But that is not how her party remembers her. This week\u2019s poll found that 93% of Tory members think favourably of Thatcher as a party leader, second only to the sacred Winston Churchill. Languishing at the bottom of the pile of former leaders, in Tory members\u2019 estimation, below even Alec Douglas-Home, is Heath on 23%. This represents an enormous shift of mentality that will not be easily reversed, even if the party was prepared to try. The Tory party used to have a practical reputation. A lot of this was exaggerated. The image was always a bit of a caricature. The Tories were always more open to ideas than they are given credit for. But the party rested on a platform of realism, too, a big example of which was Iain Macleod\u2019s success in persuading the party not to re-privatise the National Health Service in the 1950s. By contrast, there is zero realism in a debate about Brexit between leadership candidates who have no idea how they are going to get a no-deal Brexit, which most voters do not want, through a parliament that does not want it either. The historian Robert Saunders wrote in the New Statesman last week that Brexit has hastened a closing of the Conservative mind. That is true. Yet not all of this is about Europe. A lot derives from a banalised, often tabloid-driven oversimplification of the wider Thatcher legacy \u2013 in which obdurate leadership, a mythic view of 1940, and anti-statism have joined anti-Europeanism as among its most toxic elements. The upshot is that the Tory party has become faith-based, not ideas-open. This has happened at precisely the time when civil society in Britain has made the opposite journey towards openness to ideas and away from dogma.

But the central question that might hopefully be asked by church leaders would be about his suitability to lead one of the most unequal societies in the world, where the gap between rich and poor has never been more evident. The Church of England was not always so timid: 1983 saw the publication of Bishop David Sheppard\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1732280.Bias_To_The_Poor\" title=\"\">Bias to the Poor</a>, followed in 1985 by the Church of England\u2019s report <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_in_the_City\" title=\"\">Faith in the City</a>, highlighting the levels of unemployment, housing needs and dire poverty in our inner cities.

      "bodyText": "Picture anyone from any European country coming across the recent TV debate between the candidates for leadership of the Tory party and the UK (Johnson defensive and evasive but remains favourite for No 10, 19 June). Imagine trying to explain why this was taking place. Five politicians with closely similar views, representing barely half of our electorate, debating departure from the EU before the viewing public of our nation of 65 million souls, hoping to influence just 160,000 of their own political party. The goal: to vote for them as leader not only of the Tory party, but of the whole UK, including the near half who wish to remain within the EU. The concept is simply absurd. It doesn\u2019t stop there. High on the list of \u201cmust do\u201d concepts is the notion that leaving the EU without a deal is somehow a bargaining chip of major significance in the search for a mutually acceptable departure deal.

      "body": "<p>For a country that takes pride in the venerable stability of its democracy, Britain is strangely prone to constitutional improvisations. For example, if the current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservative-leadership\" title=\"\">Conservative party leadership contest</a> proceeds as far as a ballot of party members, it will be the first time a prime minister is chosen by that method.</p> <p>In 2016, Theresa May\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/conservative-leadership-race-who-are-the-five-candidates\" title=\"\"> rivals withdrew before the final round</a>. In previous applications of the rules it was the leader of the opposition being chosen, not a head of government. The system itself only dates back to 1998. Fine-tuning of the rules was completed by the 1922 Committee just three weeks ago. The process looks undemocratic and has no basis in ancient precedent.</p> <p>The antique aspect is the Tories\u2019 sense of entitlement to power. The Conservative party has been around so long as to have become intertwined with ideas of established authority, constitutional order and the natural way of doing things \u2013 at least in the imaginations of many Tories. But there is no reason for others to indulge that cultural conflation of party and state.</p> <p>The only sign that Conservatives are embarrassed by their exorbitant privilege in appointing the next prime minister is the decision to hold televised hustings, parading candidates before a wider public in a simulation of accountability. But the debate format <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/tv-debate-bbc-boris-johnson-sajid-javid-jeremy-hunt-michael-gove-rory-stewart-jonathan-freedland\" title=\"\">exposed the perversity of the whole affair</a>. It mimicked a general election but without the element of universal suffrage. Perhaps the broadcasts influenced MPs\u2019 decisions, but the elimination of Rory Stewart from the third round on Wednesday evening suggests that they are not overly concerned with the opinions of non-Tories, towards whom Mr Stewart\u2019s candidacy was most effectively geared.</p> <p>It defies principles of democratic representation that 160,000 Conservative members, a cohort that is much richer, older and whiter than the general population, should impose their choice on the rest. There would be equivalent problems if Labour had a leadership contest while in power. There is an awkward tension between rulebooks written to enhance internal party democracy and the logic of a parliamentary democracy that locates a prime minister\u2019s mandate in the Commons, with MPs as the channel for transmitting the popular will.</p> <p>This problem has turned acute for three reasons. First, the keys to Downing Street are changing hands in a hung parliament. Theresa May\u2019s mandate is flimsy enough before being passed on to a successor. Second, parliament\u2019s authority has been sabotaged by the 2016 referendum \u2013 an ill-conceived experiment in direct democracy that landed a ferociously complex task in the lap of a reluctant representative chamber. Third, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act limits the prospects for an early election, the traditional pressure valve when governments cease to function.</p> <p>To appoint a prime minister without a credible national mandate would be awkward in less volatile times. To do it three months before Britain\u2019s EU membership expires, when half of the country might prefer not to leave, places immense strain on the legitimacy of the system.

      "bodyText": "For a country that takes pride in the venerable stability of its democracy, Britain is strangely prone to constitutional improvisations. For example, if the current Conservative party leadership contest proceeds as far as a ballot of party members, it will be the first time a prime minister is chosen by that method. In 2016, Theresa May\u2019s rivals withdrew before the final round. In previous applications of the rules it was the leader of the opposition being chosen, not a head of government. The system itself only dates back to 1998. Fine-tuning of the rules was completed by the 1922 Committee just three weeks ago. The process looks undemocratic and has no basis in ancient precedent. The antique aspect is the Tories\u2019 sense of entitlement to power. The Conservative party has been around so long as to have become intertwined with ideas of established authority, constitutional order and the natural way of doing things \u2013 at least in the imaginations of many Tories. But there is no reason for others to indulge that cultural conflation of party and state. The only sign that Conservatives are embarrassed by their exorbitant privilege in appointing the next prime minister is the decision to hold televised hustings, parading candidates before a wider public in a simulation of accountability. But the debate format exposed the perversity of the whole affair. It mimicked a general election but without the element of universal suffrage. Perhaps the broadcasts influenced MPs\u2019 decisions, but the elimination of Rory Stewart from the third round on Wednesday evening suggests that they are not overly concerned with the opinions of non-Tories, towards whom Mr Stewart\u2019s candidacy was most effectively geared. It defies principles of democratic representation that 160,000 Conservative members, a cohort that is much richer, older and whiter than the general population, should impose their choice on the rest. There would be equivalent problems if Labour had a leadership contest while in power. There is an awkward tension between rulebooks written to enhance internal party democracy and the logic of a parliamentary democracy that locates a prime minister\u2019s mandate in the Commons, with MPs as the channel for transmitting the popular will. This problem has turned acute for three reasons. First, the keys to Downing Street are changing hands in a hung parliament. Theresa May\u2019s mandate is flimsy enough before being passed on to a successor. Second, parliament\u2019s authority has been sabotaged by the 2016 referendum \u2013 an ill-conceived experiment in direct democracy that landed a ferociously complex task in the lap of a reluctant representative chamber. Third, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act limits the prospects for an early election, the traditional pressure valve when governments cease to function. To appoint a prime minister without a credible national mandate would be awkward in less volatile times. To do it three months before Britain\u2019s EU membership expires, when half of the country might prefer not to leave, places immense strain on the legitimacy of the system. And to put the responsibility for managing that risk in the hands of someone as divisive and provocative as Boris Johnson threatens a full-blown crisis. It will certainly increase the pressure for a general election. If enough moderate Tories withhold support from a Johnson-led administration (as some have said they would, should a no-deal Brexit be on the agenda), he might not command a majority in the Commons. It is a grave decision for the crown to appoint a prime minister if it is uncertain that such a key requirement is met. These are not abstract issues. British politics functions by a complex operation of law, protocol, convention, precedent, habit and uncodified norms of decent conduct. Brexit has thrown the whole edifice off kilter, imperilling a delicate balance that sustains British democracy. The Tory leadership contest is being properly conducted, to the extent that the rules are being followed. But it is being held without adequate regard for the wider electorate; and without regard for what is at stake if the ultimate winner radiates contempt for the millions who have no say in his election.",

We\u2019ve got to be in the position of being post-Trump as rapidly as we possibly can.\u201d He added that there was a mood for change, even in the US where a movement was building to fight the climate crisis. \u201cOver the next 18 months to two years is the key turning point for us [politicians] on climate change,\u201d he said. Warning that the WTO was in crisis, he added: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t defended itself, it hasn\u2019t opened itself up to public debate. So if we can make it more transparent and amenable beyond the business world we can make it a more effective organisation. \u201cThe criticism is that it has been corporate captured. The issue is how you redress that balance so that trade is more than just a financial transaction.\u201d McDonnell said that if Labour held power when the UK next hosts a G7 summit in 2021 it would focus the annual meeting of the world\u2019s most powerful economies on measures to tackle global heating. Two previous UK summits, in 1998 and 2005, presided over by Tony Blair, were dedicated to debt relief and increasing western aid to developing countries, while McDonnell praised the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown for his role in orchestrating the international response to the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cWhatever you might say about them [Blair and Brown], we are an internationalist party. If you look at the track record of Labour governments they have always engaged in the global institutions. This government has taken no interest whatsoever.\u201d",

The often noisy and chaotic discussion was the first debate to feature Boris Johnson, who had refused to take part in Sunday night\u2019s programme on Channel 4. But it was the aftermath, involving scrutiny of the people who asked the questions, which left the BBC justifying the right of members of the public to ask questions on television regardless of their political backgrounds.

Miserable spectacle though it might have been, something of wider interest did slip through the cracks. Amid the verbal jostling to determine who the biggest, bounciest Brexit boy in the room was, the five leadership candidates were forced to account for cuts to services for vulnerable children, including special educational needs and disability (Send) provision.</p> <p>This is not a new issue. Last month, parents, teachers and pupils held protests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/30/families-rally-against-special-educational-needs-funding-cuts\" title=\"\">across the country</a>, decrying what they termed a \u201cnational crisis\u201d in provision for pupils. And as someone who personally benefited from Send provision as a child, it is a matter of great concern to me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Children with additional needs are more than capable of attaining the same level of success as their peers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was diagnosed with autism at the mercifully young age of four (if you\u2019re diagnosed at a young age, an advantage that many women and BAME people don\u2019t get, you\u2019re in a position to access and benefit from support much earlier in life). Prior to my entering compulsory education, my parents had to fight tooth and nail with our intransigent local authority to implement the support I would need in school. The council argued that such support would unfairly label me and thus stunt my development, as if, by some bizarre postmodern magic, refusing to acknowledge my needs would make them disappear.</p> <p>Thankfully, my parents won out and I was granted a SEN statement. This legally binding document spelled out my needs and allocated money towards meeting them. For example, my statement mandated 25% extra time in exams so as to account for my slower processing ability, in addition to allowing me to take tests in a separate room, as I found the presence of other pupils too distracting to work.</p> <p>Later on, my statement enabled me to attend a mainstream secondary school with a designated provision for children with additional needs, the only one of its kind in my town, even though I lived outside its catchment zone. This not only offered a physical space for pupils who had trouble socialising to go during breaks, but also specialised staff (who I honestly cannot credit enough) who would liaise with other teachers and provide one-to-one help in classrooms when required. I do not wish to paint the previous system as perfect (it most assuredly wasn\u2019t) but without that support, I would have been left floundering in a deeply flawed education system that would have been unable to accommodate me, let alone be in a position to have acquired a master\u2019s degree in politics or write this piece.</p> <p>I left compulsory education just after the Conservatives took power in the 2010 general election, so I narrowly escaped the numerous cuts and \u201creforms\u201d that would mar the subsequent decade. The most obvious change in terms of Send provision has been the replacement of the statement with the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help\" title=\"\">education, health and care plan </a>(EHC). Designed to be more comprehensive, these plans cover one\u2019s health and social needs in addition to education up to the age of 25 (whereas a statement was purely educational in focus and only went up to age 16).</p> <p>While it might sound sensible to roll these areas into a single plan, the all-encompassing approach starts to fall apart in the face of swingeing budget cuts. Funding for EHC plans are not separately allocated for individual pupils, being instead determined by both the school and the local authority in question. However, according to the National Audit Office, government funding for local authorities has <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Financial-sustainabilty-of-local-authorites-2018.pdf\" title=\"\">decreased</a> in real terms by 49.1% between 2010 and 2017/2018. According to the National Education Union, funding for Send provision in England has decreased by a staggering <a href=\"https://neu.org.uk/press-releases/send-provision\" title=\"\">\u00a31.2bn</a> since 2015. This comes at a time when the number of children with EHC plans has, as of January 2019, increased by <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/805014/SEN2_2019_text.pdf\" title=\"\">34,200 (11%)</a> from 2018, placing an additional strain on schools and local authorities. Other services that EHC plans would hinge on, such as Sure Start centres and mental health provision, have also been severely cut.</p> <p>The cumulative effect of these reforms has been devastating. There are multiple reports of academies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/07/cuts-heads-refuse-school-places-pupils-special-needs\" title=\"\">restricting the admission</a> of children with EHC plans, prompting calls for a judicial review of cuts to Send spending. Research from the London School of Economics has also found that <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/News/Latest-news-from-LSE/2019/06-June-19/Children-with-special-needs-discouraged-from-attending-some-primary-schools\" title=\"\">26% of pupils</a> with additional needs transition to a different school between preschool and reception as opposed to 18% without. Some parents are having to send their children to schools at the opposite end of the country, far from their family and community. Disruptions like this can prove incredibly distressing to Send pupils.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/04/funding-pupils-special-educational-needs-send-drops-north-england\">Funding for pupils with special educational needs drops 17%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Children with additional needs are more than capable of attaining the same level of success as their peers if those needs are adequately catered to. Already we are starting to see a wave of prominent autistic people enter the public arena, such as climate activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a>, alongside a global and ever-growing neuro-diversity movement. How will the newer generation of children, who were denied the same level of support afforded to people like me, fare when they leave education? How much potential is being squandered in the pursuit of economic efficiency? By denying them the support they need to stay afloat in an already deeply flawed education system, Send pupils are having their futures stolen from them.</p> <p>Which brings me back to the Tory leadership debate. Before devolving into a discussion about tax cuts versus public spending, the five remaining candidates fell over one another to praise service providers for vulnerable children and offer empty promises of increased funding. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-48683265/tory-leadership-candidates-on-health-and-social-care\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a> was the only one to signal anything even vaguely concrete by way of protecting funding in real terms for individual children. Given he was the architect of the mass academisation of the schooling system during his tenure as education secretary, however, I\u2019d only trust him as far as I could throw him. No, these men represent a party that has, through successive cuts to vital services, all but shut down the possibility of subsequent generations benefiting from the opportunities I had.</p> <p>\u2022 Gerry Hart is a politics master\u2019s graduate and a former subeditor for Newcastle University\u2019s student newspaper, The Courier</p>",

I was diagnosed with autism at the mercifully young age of four (if you\u2019re diagnosed at a young age, an advantage that many women and BAME people don\u2019t get, you\u2019re in a position to access and benefit from support much earlier in life). Prior to my entering compulsory education, my parents had to fight tooth and nail with our intransigent local authority to implement the support I would need in school. The council argued that such support would unfairly label me and thus stunt my development, as if, by some bizarre postmodern magic, refusing to acknowledge my needs would make them disappear. Thankfully, my parents won out and I was granted a SEN statement. This legally binding document spelled out my needs and allocated money towards meeting them. For example, my statement mandated 25% extra time in exams so as to account for my slower processing ability, in addition to allowing me to take tests in a separate room, as I found the presence of other pupils too distracting to work. Later on, my statement enabled me to attend a mainstream secondary school with a designated provision for children with additional needs, the only one of its kind in my town, even though I lived outside its catchment zone. This not only offered a physical space for pupils who had trouble socialising to go during breaks, but also specialised staff (who I honestly cannot credit enough) who would liaise with other teachers and provide one-to-one help in classrooms when required. I do not wish to paint the previous system as perfect (it most assuredly wasn\u2019t) but without that support, I would have been left floundering in a deeply flawed education system that would have been unable to accommodate me, let alone be in a position to have acquired a master\u2019s degree in politics or write this piece. I left compulsory education just after the Conservatives took power in the 2010 general election, so I narrowly escaped the numerous cuts and \u201creforms\u201d that would mar the subsequent decade. The most obvious change in terms of Send provision has been the replacement of the statement with the education, health and care plan (EHC). Designed to be more comprehensive, these plans cover one\u2019s health and social needs in addition to education up to the age of 25 (whereas a statement was purely educational in focus and only went up to age 16). While it might sound sensible to roll these areas into a single plan, the all-encompassing approach starts to fall apart in the face of swingeing budget cuts. Funding for EHC plans are not separately allocated for individual pupils, being instead determined by both the school and the local authority in question. However, according to the National Audit Office, government funding for local authorities has decreased in real terms by 49.1% between 2010 and 2017/2018. According to the National Education Union, funding for Send provision in England has decreased by a staggering \u00a31.2bn since 2015. This comes at a time when the number of children with EHC plans has, as of January 2019, increased by 34,200 (11%) from 2018, placing an additional strain on schools and local authorities. Other services that EHC plans would hinge on, such as Sure Start centres and mental health provision, have also been severely cut. The cumulative effect of these reforms has been devastating. There are multiple reports of academies restricting the admission of children with EHC plans, prompting calls for a judicial review of cuts to Send spending. Research from the London School of Economics has also found that 26% of pupils with additional needs transition to a different school between preschool and reception as opposed to 18% without. Some parents are having to send their children to schools at the opposite end of the country, far from their family and community. Disruptions like this can prove incredibly distressing to Send pupils. Children with additional needs are more than capable of attaining the same level of success as their peers if those needs are adequately catered to. Already we are starting to see a wave of prominent autistic people enter the public arena, such as climate activist Greta Thunberg, alongside a global and ever-growing neuro-diversity movement. How will the newer generation of children, who were denied the same level of support afforded to people like me, fare when they leave education? How much potential is being squandered in the pursuit of economic efficiency? By denying them the support they need to stay afloat in an already deeply flawed education system, Send pupils are having their futures stolen from them. Which brings me back to the Tory leadership debate. Before devolving into a discussion about tax cuts versus public spending, the five remaining candidates fell over one another to praise service providers for vulnerable children and offer empty promises of increased funding. Michael Gove was the only one to signal anything even vaguely concrete by way of protecting funding in real terms for individual children. Given he was the architect of the mass academisation of the schooling system during his tenure as education secretary, however, I\u2019d only trust him as far as I could throw him. No, these men represent a party that has, through successive cuts to vital services, all but shut down the possibility of subsequent generations benefiting from the opportunities I had. \u2022 Gerry Hart is a politics master\u2019s graduate and a former subeditor for Newcastle University\u2019s student newspaper, The Courier",

Gove is known to be close to a number of Raab\u2019s former supporters, though the majority are Brexiters who could now back the frontrunner, Boris Johnson. Raab endorsed Johnson on Wednesday morning. Of the 30 people who voted for Raab on Tuesday, three fewer than the 33 required to progress, Stewart told the BBC he had gained pledges from two of them. Stewart, who beat Javid by four votes, suggested on Wednesday morning he had entered discussions with Gove, but also admitted their Brexit positions appeared to be at odds. His team insisted the talks would only proceed if it was Stewart who went forward with Gove\u2019s backing. \u201cClearly at some point people will need to combine teams,\u201d a source close to Stewart said. \u201cBut any team that gets combined, Rory wants to lead.\u201d It is understood Hunt does not expect to advance his tally of votes much beyond his current total. One source close to his team predicted he would gain just one or two votes, but said they believed he was more likely to capitalise if Stewart or Javid were eliminated on Wednesday. A YouGov poll suggested viewers believed Stewart had performed best in the leadership debate on Tuesday night, winning approval from 41% of those watching. However Stewart said he felt his performance in the BBC One hustings had been underwhelming and he had not challenged Johnson as effectively as he had hoped. Overnight, some Javid supporters revealed they had received text messages from Stewart saying he would be \u201cproud to have you on my team\u201d and offering one-to-one meetings. However, when comparing their messages several MPs found some messages had praised the recipient\u2019s \u201cintellect\u201d while others had not. Sources close to Javid said they believed the home secretary had outperformed expectations by offering a clearer position that he would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal, and by forcing his fellow candidates to agree to an external investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. One rival camp described Javid\u2019s bullish approach in the debate to a no-deal Brexit as \u201cRaab-lite\u201d and suggested it was likely to dissuade more moderate MPs. Conservative MPs will vote on Wednesday afternoon, with results expected just after 6pm. Unlike previous rounds, candidates do not have to gain a specific number of votes but the candidate with the fewest supporters will be eliminated. At least two rounds of voting are then scheduled for Thursday morning and afternoon to whittle it down to the last two candidates, who will then be offered to Conservative party members in a postal ballot. The candidates will take part in 16 hustings around the country and the result will be announced in the week beginning 22 July.",

None of them deserves the top job, and most sensible people can see how flawed and uninspiring they are. But, the fact is that no matter how much we mock Boris Johnson\u2019s mannerisms, or his hair, or his fecklessness, the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis. Isn\u2019t it about time we put aside the sniping partisan politics of our echo chambers and worked towards a solution? The first part of any way out of this mess must be the rejection of no deal as an option. The next stage would be a public consultation on what out negotiated leave options are and how they stack up against not leaving at all. It\u2019ll never happen of course, but my point is that until the current tension is diffused nothing objective can be achieved. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/tv-debate-bbc-boris-johnson-sajid-javid-jeremy-hunt-michael-gove-rory-stewart-jonathan-freedland#comment-130284298\">FreeThinker73</a></strong></p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018</strong>Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU<strong>\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Out of this bunch Gove is by far the best candidate. That\u2019s not to say that I like him, or his politics but considering this is a Tory leadership contest and I\u2019ve voted Labour in every election of the last 30 years, I\u2019m not going to <em>like </em>any of them. Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU. The fact that he comes across as that annoying little pip from school doesn\u2019t change that. Nor does what happened within education whilst he was there; the policies may have been poor but ultimately he delivered them, which was his job. I can\u2019t stress enough that I don\u2019t even want a Tory government, let alone one with any of these people running it. If we have to have one though and if it has to be run by one of these, it\u2019s Gove. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/tv-debate-bbc-boris-johnson-sajid-javid-jeremy-hunt-michael-gove-rory-stewart-jonathan-freedland#comment-130283150\">AndyOldham</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors\u2019</h2> \n<p>On the plus side, the Tory party will almost certainly be crucified on the Brexit cross. Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors. Reality is simply something none of them are able to face (bar Stewart). There is no logic, or ration, or reason, to what they are doing. Still they believe they can abolish legal issues with force of will. Frankly both main parties may well be sacrificed in the altar: If the Tories fail to deliver Brexit, they are doomed. When they deliver it, they have nothing left to offer other than tax cuts. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/tv-debate-bbc-boris-johnson-sajid-javid-jeremy-hunt-michael-gove-rory-stewart-jonathan-freedland#comment-130282960\">AJVC1991</a></strong></p> \n<h2>\u2018The woman who has fostered over 100 children impressed me the most\u2019</h2> \n<p>Well, who impressed me the most, and who do I think has and is likely to make the biggest difference by their actions?

Exeprattler \u2018No matter how much we mock Boris Johnson the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis\u2019 It\u2019s satisfying and fun to rip in to this collection of deluded misfits. None of them deserves the top job, and most sensible people can see how flawed and uninspiring they are. But, the fact is that no matter how much we mock Boris Johnson\u2019s mannerisms, or his hair, or his fecklessness, the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis. Isn\u2019t it about time we put aside the sniping partisan politics of our echo chambers and worked towards a solution? The first part of any way out of this mess must be the rejection of no deal as an option. The next stage would be a public consultation on what out negotiated leave options are and how they stack up against not leaving at all. It\u2019ll never happen of course, but my point is that until the current tension is diffused nothing objective can be achieved. FreeThinker73 \u2018Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU\u2019 Out of this bunch Gove is by far the best candidate. That\u2019s not to say that I like him, or his politics but considering this is a Tory leadership contest and I\u2019ve voted Labour in every election of the last 30 years, I\u2019m not going to like any of them. Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU. The fact that he comes across as that annoying little pip from school doesn\u2019t change that. Nor does what happened within education whilst he was there; the policies may have been poor but ultimately he delivered them, which was his job. I can\u2019t stress enough that I don\u2019t even want a Tory government, let alone one with any of these people running it. If we have to have one though and if it has to be run by one of these, it\u2019s Gove. AndyOldham \u2018Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors\u2019 On the plus side, the Tory party will almost certainly be crucified on the Brexit cross. Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors. Reality is simply something none of them are able to face (bar Stewart). There is no logic, or ration, or reason, to what they are doing. Still they believe they can abolish legal issues with force of will. Frankly both main parties may well be sacrificed in the altar: If the Tories fail to deliver Brexit, they are doomed. When they deliver it, they have nothing left to offer other than tax cuts. AJVC1991 \u2018The woman who has fostered over 100 children impressed me the most\u2019 Well, who impressed me the most, and who do I think has and is likely to make the biggest difference by their actions? I thought it was the woman who has fostered over 100 children, and asked the question about funding for children\u2019s services \u2013 which none of them bothered to answer. Mizenhead1",

It averages out at 1.5 years of life and 3.2 years of healthy life lost per person.</p> <p>Of the 80 million years of life lost, 30 million are attributed to differences in education, 18 million to disposable income, 15 million to employment, and eight million each to crime and housing.</p> <p>The fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/25/improvement-uk-life-expectancy-stalled-ons-figures-show\">life expectancy improvements have stalled</a> for the first time in over a century \u2013 barring flu pandemics and world wars \u2013 shows a serious structural problem is emerging.

Residents in five London boroughs \u2013 Lambeth, Newham, Barking and Dagenham, Islington and Waltham Forest \u2013 lose an average of half a year each through crime.</p> <p>The impact of poor housing is most readily seen in rural areas such as Cornwall, West Devon and West Somerset.</p> <p>But the situation is not hopeless, if only there was the political will. CPP analysis of 35 OECD countries over the past 40 years shows that those which are invested in education and social protection beyond healthcare improved their life expectancy.</p> <p>As the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 analysis of <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14139\">the impact of the Sure Start programme</a> for parents of young children demonstrates, ambitious social support can have an impact, in this case large cuts in children in deprived areas being hospitalised, driven by everything from fewer falls to better immunity from diseases. But Sure Start funding has been cut by two-thirds, and its success should not distract from tackling the bedrock of life opportunities such as education and housing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/society-weekly-email-newsletter-sign-up\">Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Legislation such as the 2012 NHS reforms dabbles in health inequalities, but to negligible effect.

Now the Centre for Progressive Policy (CPP) has published a major study, Beyond the NHS - addressing the root causes of poor health, which examines how everything from crime to education lie at the heart of our serious and growing health inequalities. Launched at the House of Commons with public health expert Sir Michael Marmot a decade after his landmark review, its analysis indicates that the current population of England will lose around 80 million life years through socio-economic inequality, which will also take another 170 million years of healthy life. This is based on the assumption that everyone could live as long and as well as those in the least economically deprived areas. It averages out at 1.5 years of life and 3.2 years of healthy life lost per person. Of the 80 million years of life lost, 30 million are attributed to differences in education, 18 million to disposable income, 15 million to employment, and eight million each to crime and housing. The fact that life expectancy improvements have stalled for the first time in over a century \u2013 barring flu pandemics and world wars \u2013 shows a serious structural problem is emerging. The infamous gaps in life expectancy between the poorest and wealthiest parts of the country are edging upwards. Data from the Department of Health and Social Care reveals the shocking detail of how people die sooner in deprived areas, with widening gaps in recent years for infant mortality and under-75 deaths from cardiovascular disease and cancer. The CPP report reveals how most of the differences in life expectancy are explained by five social factors: education, employment, income, crime and housing. By some margin, differences in educational opportunities have the most extreme effect, reducing life expectancy in Great Yarmouth by 1.8 years, and 1.7 years in Fenland, Hull, Boston and Stoke-on-Trent. Hull loses roughly another year through poor employment, similar to Birmingham and Middlesbrough. Residents in five London boroughs \u2013 Lambeth, Newham, Barking and Dagenham, Islington and Waltham Forest \u2013 lose an average of half a year each through crime. The impact of poor housing is most readily seen in rural areas such as Cornwall, West Devon and West Somerset. But the situation is not hopeless, if only there was the political will. CPP analysis of 35 OECD countries over the past 40 years shows that those which are invested in education and social protection beyond healthcare improved their life expectancy. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 analysis of the impact of the Sure Start programme for parents of young children demonstrates, ambitious social support can have an impact, in this case large cuts in children in deprived areas being hospitalised, driven by everything from fewer falls to better immunity from diseases. But Sure Start funding has been cut by two-thirds, and its success should not distract from tackling the bedrock of life opportunities such as education and housing. Legislation such as the 2012 NHS reforms dabbles in health inequalities, but to negligible effect. There are ongoing attempts to improve access to healthcare in deprived areas, but this is not the same as tackling the root causes. The NHS long-term plan, published in January, addresses the symptoms but desperately needs a matching programme of social action. The CPP report drags the debate on health inequalities back to the hard facts. While healthy living advice is essential, we are never going to tackle the differences in longevity and healthy life expectancy one uneaten burger at a time. With all the current talk of uniting the country, giving everyone a chance to live a long and healthy life would be a good place to start. \u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst",
