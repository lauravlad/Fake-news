The prime minister on Thursday also declined to take part in an interview with ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham, despite every other leader of the main political parties participating in an interview on the programme. Johnson has faced mounting criticism for vetoing other programmes during the election campaign, including a climate leaders debate on Channel 4, where he was replaced with an ice sculpture, and a head-to-head debate with Jeremy Corbyn on 24 November. A spokesman for ITV said: \u201cThe ITV News team making the Boris Johnson Tonight film made the original bid for the prime minister when the election was called. \u201cThey have contacted his press team on repeated occasions with times and dates offered to film an interview. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s team have today confirmed he will not be taking part. \u201cThe programme will instead feature a profile of the prime minister using fresh interviews with other contributors and archive footage.\u201d Labour has accused the Conservative party leader of \u201crunning scared\u201d following his decision to forgo prime-time interviews with two of the nation\u2019s biggest political interviewers. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chair, said: \u201cBoris Johnson thinks he\u2019s born to rule and doesn\u2019t have to face scrutiny. \u201cHe\u2019s running scared because every time he is confronted with the impact of nine years of austerity, the cost of living crisis and his plans to sell out our NHS, the more he is exposed.\u201d Labour escalated its ongoing complaint about BBC bias and allowing Johnson to \u201cpick and choose\u201d his BBC platform, in an open letter to the BBC director general, Tony Hall, on Thursday. Labour\u2019s co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne said the BBC had given Labour a \u201cclear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed\u201d to the Neil interview. \u201cInstead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability. \u201cThis clearly broke the agreement the Labour party made with the BBC in good faith.\u201d Labour\u2019s letter claimed that the BBC \u201cdoes not have a role as a protagonist in the general election\u201d and suggested the BBC was effectively \u201ccomplicit in giving the Conservative party an unfair electoral advantage\u201d. A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThe BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.\u201d On Friday the BBC insisted it would not allow Johnson to appear on its flagship politics programmes until he had agreed a time to sit down with Neil, but on Sunday he appeared on the Andrew Marr Show following the London Bridge terror attack.",

Ever since the 18th century, almost every Commons Speaker, good or bad, has been given a peerage when they step down. Mr Bercow has not yet been offered one but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic\" title=\"\">told the Observer</a> last month that he \u201cwould accept, if it was offered\u201d.</p> <p>The point here is not whether the automatic peerage convention is a good one, or the House of Lords an institution worth preserving.

The point is whether a decision to single out Mr Bercow, if it happens, indicates a more general appetite in Mr Johnson\u2019s Tories for revenge against its enemies and a more peremptory approach against those with the temerity to get in the way of Brexiter orthodoxy and dogma. The election campaign has raised that possibility. When Channel 4 held its party leaders\u2019 climate debate last month, Mr Johnson did not turn up. The broadcaster decided to empty-chair him for the debate with a melting ice sculpture, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/28/ice-sculpture-to-replace-boris-johnson-in-channel-4-climate-debate\" title=\"\">whereupon</a> the Conservative party threatened to review Channel 4\u2019s licence if elected.

This widely unread document contains a litany of proposals and suggestions aimed at \u201crestoring public trust in government and politics\u201d. In reality, the aim is to take revenge against remainers, restrict access to the courts and voting rights for the Tory party\u2019s opponents, and attempt to embed ministerial powers without parliamentary or judicial oversight.</p> <p>Not all the plans are spelt out. But their scope is potentially breathtaking. They include voter ID systems, likely to deter young and migrant voters; a fresh constituency boundary review, opening the way to electoral gerrymandering; strong backing for first-past-the-post voting systems, suggesting future attempts to abolish proportional representation where it exists; and easier voting in the UK for British expatriates while doing nothing to extend the voting rights of foreigners domiciled in the UK.</p> <p>Perhaps the spookiest line is this: \u201cAfter Brexit, we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution.\u201d This could mean anything.

The idea that the Human Rights Act might be \u201cupdated\u201d to create a new balance between rights and national security needs is both vague and sinister.</p> <p>Voters would be right to hear loud alarm bells in all this.

Put simply, the BBC tends to be more sympathetic to the status quo and the government of the day than political change.</p> <p>Yet behind all that lies the hard work of thousands of professional BBC employees out there reporting and producing news on a wide range of matters that the printed media no longer often does.</p> <p>As with the gender pay gap at the BBC, perhaps it\u2019s time for those at Broadcasting House to listen more to their employees and their trade unions and less to the politicians of the moment.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Fran Unsworth, the BBC\u2019s director of news and current affairs, writes: \u201cImpartiality is precious to us. We\u2019ll protect it\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/04/bbc-impartiality-precious-protect-election-coverage\" title=\"\">Journal</a>, 4 December). To claim that the rightwing bias catalogued by Peter Oborne was \u201ca couple of editorial mistakes\u201d is frankly risible. Her argument that \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d are in vogue just will not wash. I note that her defence of the BBC\u2019s news coverage concentrates on the few weeks of this general election campaign, but I have observed rightwing bias in a number of current affairs programmes for many years. And we all remember Steve Bell\u2019s brilliant IF strip highlighting rightwing bias on the Radio 4 \u201cToady\u201d programme, which featured Nick Robinson.</p> <p>Last Sunday the BBC did a U-turn and allowed Boris Johnson to appear on the Andrew Marr show, claiming it was in the public interest. Marr lost control of the interview and the only interest served was that of the Conservative party.</p> <p>If Unsworth wants to salvage some of the BBC\u2019s tattered reputation she needs to ensure that the promised interview between Andrew Neil and Boris Johnson takes place before the general election; otherwise the accusation of Tory bias will be reinforced.<br><strong>Geoffrey Carpenter </strong><br><em>Worthing, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Fran Unsworth seeks to justify serious flaws in reporting at the BBC with bluster at a highly critical time in our politics. She cites three instances of error \u2013 all of which favoured the prime minister.</p> <p>First, in the excellent Question Time leaders\u2019 debate, there was mocking laughter at the response of Boris Johnson to a question about trustworthiness. This was later edited out of footage for a lunchtime news bulletin. A \u201cclumsy one-second edit\u201d, she says.</p> <p>Second, coverage of the cenotaph remembrance service where the PM made a mistake laying a wreath and looked foolish was replaced by archive footage of him at the 2016 service on BBC Breakfast. We are \u201cfanciful\u201d to consider this significant, she says.</p> <p>Third, the inability of the corporation to ensure that all the party leaders are interviewed by Andrew Neil before next week\u2019s election in order \u201cto be impartial\u201d. Neil exposed flaws in all the party leaders\u2019 reasoning with corresponding headlines in the press the next day. Why has the PM not been interviewed? Unsworth says \u201cthe logistics are highly complex\u201d. Not good enough from our public service provider.<br><strong>Nancy Hardy</strong><br><em>Eastergate, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 I take issue with what Fran Unsworth wrote in claiming impartiality at the BBC. To my mind, she is making the mistake of equating quantity with quality.</p> <p>If there are many hours of programming but without rigorous challenging of politicians and political statements then the BBC becomes part of the propaganda machine. It is falling behind Channel 4 in the quality of its interviewing. Part of the defence is that there is information produced by the BBC online. </p> <p>On checking both the Policy Guide and Reality Check which Unsworth cites, I was less than impressed. The analysis of the Conservative top priorities lists 50,000 more nurses and 20,000 more police officers \u2013 both discredited claims. This is not a simple editorial mistake. Need one say more about our diminishing trust in the BBC?<br><strong>Stephen Hawkins</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 Fran Unsworth seemingly derives satisfaction from the fact that the BBC is criticised by both left and right in \u201calmost equal volumes\u201d. But this is due to the fact that the BBC overrepresents the centre at the expense of both left and right.</p> <p>This is conveyed, for example, by BBC political journalists\u2019 frequent use of the word \u201cmoderate\u201d, with its overtone of approval, to describe those in the centre of politics.</p> <p>This was fine when the centre embodied a national consensus. But at a time of political polarisation, the BBC and other public service broadcasters need to widen their ideological lens if they are to fulfil Unsworth\u2019s vision of seeking \u201cto represent the nation in its entirety\u201d.<br><strong>Prof</strong><strong> James Curran</strong><br><em>Goldsmiths, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 In 1984, I was appointed head of the BBC Bristol Network Production Centre. It was the time of the miners\u2019 strike. Every morning we received a shoal of letters complaining about the BBC\u2019s coverage. They fell into two broad categories: those who thought the BBC was a lackey of the rightwing establishment, and those who thought it was a subversive, lefty organisation. Every morning, we would sort the letters into two piles. And every morning, the piles were exactly the same height.</p> <p>These were people who had been watching exactly the same programmes.

Put simply, the BBC tends to be more sympathetic to the status quo and the government of the day than political change. Yet behind all that lies the hard work of thousands of professional BBC employees out there reporting and producing news on a wide range of matters that the printed media no longer often does. As with the gender pay gap at the BBC, perhaps it\u2019s time for those at Broadcasting House to listen more to their employees and their trade unions and less to the politicians of the moment. Keith Flett London \u2022 Fran Unsworth, the BBC\u2019s director of news and current affairs, writes: \u201cImpartiality is precious to us. We\u2019ll protect it\u201d (Journal, 4 December). To claim that the rightwing bias catalogued by Peter Oborne was \u201ca couple of editorial mistakes\u201d is frankly risible. Her argument that \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d are in vogue just will not wash. I note that her defence of the BBC\u2019s news coverage concentrates on the few weeks of this general election campaign, but I have observed rightwing bias in a number of current affairs programmes for many years. And we all remember Steve Bell\u2019s brilliant IF strip highlighting rightwing bias on the Radio 4 \u201cToady\u201d programme, which featured Nick Robinson. Last Sunday the BBC did a U-turn and allowed Boris Johnson to appear on the Andrew Marr show, claiming it was in the public interest. Marr lost control of the interview and the only interest served was that of the Conservative party. If Unsworth wants to salvage some of the BBC\u2019s tattered reputation she needs to ensure that the promised interview between Andrew Neil and Boris Johnson takes place before the general election; otherwise the accusation of Tory bias will be reinforced. Geoffrey Carpenter Worthing, West Sussex \u2022 Fran Unsworth seeks to justify serious flaws in reporting at the BBC with bluster at a highly critical time in our politics. She cites three instances of error \u2013 all of which favoured the prime minister. First, in the excellent Question Time leaders\u2019 debate, there was mocking laughter at the response of Boris Johnson to a question about trustworthiness. This was later edited out of footage for a lunchtime news bulletin. A \u201cclumsy one-second edit\u201d, she says. Second, coverage of the cenotaph remembrance service where the PM made a mistake laying a wreath and looked foolish was replaced by archive footage of him at the 2016 service on BBC Breakfast. We are \u201cfanciful\u201d to consider this significant, she says. Third, the inability of the corporation to ensure that all the party leaders are interviewed by Andrew Neil before next week\u2019s election in order \u201cto be impartial\u201d. Neil exposed flaws in all the party leaders\u2019 reasoning with corresponding headlines in the press the next day. Why has the PM not been interviewed? Unsworth says \u201cthe logistics are highly complex\u201d. Not good enough from our public service provider. Nancy Hardy Eastergate, West Sussex \u2022 I take issue with what Fran Unsworth wrote in claiming impartiality at the BBC. To my mind, she is making the mistake of equating quantity with quality. If there are many hours of programming but without rigorous challenging of politicians and political statements then the BBC becomes part of the propaganda machine. It is falling behind Channel 4 in the quality of its interviewing. Part of the defence is that there is information produced by the BBC online. On checking both the Policy Guide and Reality Check which Unsworth cites, I was less than impressed. The analysis of the Conservative top priorities lists 50,000 more nurses and 20,000 more police officers \u2013 both discredited claims. This is not a simple editorial mistake. Need one say more about our diminishing trust in the BBC? Stephen Hawkins Edinburgh \u2022 Fran Unsworth seemingly derives satisfaction from the fact that the BBC is criticised by both left and right in \u201calmost equal volumes\u201d. But this is due to the fact that the BBC overrepresents the centre at the expense of both left and right. This is conveyed, for example, by BBC political journalists\u2019 frequent use of the word \u201cmoderate\u201d, with its overtone of approval, to describe those in the centre of politics. This was fine when the centre embodied a national consensus. But at a time of political polarisation, the BBC and other public service broadcasters need to widen their ideological lens if they are to fulfil Unsworth\u2019s vision of seeking \u201cto represent the nation in its entirety\u201d. Prof James Curran Goldsmiths, University of London \u2022 In 1984, I was appointed head of the BBC Bristol Network Production Centre. It was the time of the miners\u2019 strike. Every morning we received a shoal of letters complaining about the BBC\u2019s coverage. They fell into two broad categories: those who thought the BBC was a lackey of the rightwing establishment, and those who thought it was a subversive, lefty organisation. Every morning, we would sort the letters into two piles. And every morning, the piles were exactly the same height. These were people who had been watching exactly the same programmes. I rest my case.

      "bodyText": "An hour a day of outdoor learning for primary school children and tighter restrictions on paving over front gardens are two of 80 nature policies proposed in a report commissioned by the Green party. The recommendations set out in A New Deal for Nature are designed to protect wildlife and put biodiversity at the centre of government policy. Other suggestions include turning 20% of Britain into national parks and helping farmers devote 15% of their land to nature. The report advocates for more green spaces in cities through the rewilding of hospital grounds, funded by car parking charges, and the creation of pocket parks to ensure no home is more than 1km from a wild green space. The report was commissioned by Caroline Lucas, the Green party candidate for Brighton Pavilion, and produced by conservationists and nature writers including Patrick Barkham, who writes for the Guardian on natural history, Mark Cocker, Jake Fiennes, Jeremy Mynott and Helen Smith. Cocker, an author and naturalist, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe for one moment that it\u2019s the last word on the future of nature in Britain, but we hope it\u2019s a start, a way of thinking hereafter and hopefully in perpetuity about life in these islands and what has to change. Other species have rights to exist in our country and we are under a moral obligation to sustain them.\u201d The report recommends moving to pesticide-free farming by 2040, with research into alternatives to be funded by a pesticide tax, and phasing out artificial fertilisers over the same period. To improve urban areas, it suggests planning permission should be required to pave over front gardens, and the use of materials that do not allow water to drain through should be banned. Two million trees should be planted in cities, towns and suburbs by 2030, adopted by local schools and named by children. A report in October by a coalition of more than 70 wildlife organisations and government conservation agencies said numbers of the UK\u2019s most important wildlife had fallen by 60% since 1970, with a quarter of mammals and nearly half of birds assessed to be at risk of extinction. Mynott, an author and birdwatcher, said: \u201cOutside the Green party there are a few politicians who grasp the full dimensions of the nature crisis.

Last week the 55-year-old dodged a Channel 4 debate on climate change, sending instead his dad and his wingman, Michael Gove.

With the president of America strutting around London this week, the comparison is inevitable. Over this election, Johnson is playing the media and the public just as Trump did before claiming the White House in 2016.</p> \n<p>Both men are adept at exploiting the media appetite for offence over ideas, for name-calling in place of nuance. Trump calls Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d; Johnson likens Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin. Ridiculous, of course, but enough kindling for at least two days\u2019 headlines.

      "bodyText": "Constantly inconstant, Boris Johnson is faithful in at least one area: generating outrage. That he does as naturally as a dog cocks its leg at a lamppost. This week, he has used the bodies of those murdered at London Bridge as props for his election campaign. Last week the 55-year-old dodged a Channel 4 debate on climate change, sending instead his dad and his wingman, Michael Gove. And then there are his many columns, spitting at gay men (\u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d), single mums (\u201cuppity and irresponsible\u201d) and black people (\u201csmiling piccaninnies\u201d). I would go on, but equally so might you \u2013 and we both know what typically comes next. The performative pearl-clutching, the saucer-eyed wailing: \u201cHow could he?\u201d The sound and rote fury on social media and rolling news, followed by a satisfied, full-bellied silence as grateful journalists wait for their next steaming dollop of Boris buffoonery. It passes time and it pads out columns, but it is no way to scrutinise the man who may well be our next prime minister, in charge of taking Britain out of Europe into a new era of foreign and trade relations \u2013 and rewriting our political, economic and social settlement. With the president of America strutting around London this week, the comparison is inevitable. Over this election, Johnson is playing the media and the public just as Trump did before claiming the White House in 2016. Both men are adept at exploiting the media appetite for offence over ideas, for name-calling in place of nuance. Trump calls Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d; Johnson likens Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin. Ridiculous, of course, but enough kindling for at least two days\u2019 headlines. The US president calls his counterpart in No 10 Britain Trump, and both men have made the same calculation. The cash-strapped media needs eyeballs, and these two enjoy having all eyes on them \u2013 so they grab coverage and set the terms of the debate. If Johnson makes a show of himself, at least he\u2019s the star. When he has a car crash, websites thank him for the traffic. With the biggest UK newspaper groups already behind him, the Conservative leader thus ensures he gets both total control of the message from his friends and the total attention of everyone else. Who cares if they call him Pinocchio? As a journalist he made his name with tales taller than Michael Jordan \u2013 yarns about how Brussels was designating snails as fish, or imposing a maximum size on condoms. Decades before Mark Zuckerberg came along, Johnson had already gleaned the attention economy\u2019s golden rule: professional reputation matters less than providing distraction. Did anyone say zip wire? This is nothing to do with appearing prime ministerial: it\u2019s about grabbing power. Like Trump, Johnson has no interest in wooing all bases. I have written here before about how the Old Etonian has gone from being Heineken \u2013 the politician who reaches the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot reach \u2013 to utter Marmite. Now he pursues a political strategy for a polarised country that deliberately seeks to divide it further by treating the other side as anti-national. You want Brexit, or you\u2019re part of the remoaner elite. You want spending cuts, or you can bugger off to Venezuela. The critics are so busy fact-checking his fibs that there\u2019s less time and energy to investigate the inconvenient truth.
