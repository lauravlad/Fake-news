      "bodyText": "Theresa May has suffered a second humiliating defeat on her Brexit deal, as MPs voted it down by a crushing majority of 149, dealing a fresh blow to her shattered authority. With just 17 days to go until the UK is due to leave the EU, backbenchers from both sides of the Brexit divide immediately began manoeuvring to take control of the next steps of the process, in a series of key votes in the coming days. MPs ignored the prime minister\u2019s pleas to \u201cget the deal done\u201d and voted the deal down for a second time, after the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) said it was not convinced by last-minute assurances won from Brussels on Monday. Of the Conservatives who rejected the deal in January, when May lost by a record majority of 230, 39 switched sides, including the former Brexit secretary David Davis \u2013 with many fearing Brexit would be delayed or reversed if they did not support the agreement. All but three Labour MPs trooped through the packed voting lobbies with the DUP, the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), and some remain-supporting Tories, to sink May\u2019s plan. In total, 75 Conservatives rebelled, and the deal was rejected by 391 votes to 242. With her voice cracked and fading, the prime minister had earlier pleaded with the House of Commons: \u201cThis is the moment and this is the time \u2013 time for us to come together, back this motion and get the deal done. Because only then can we can get on with what we need to do, what we were sent here to do.\u201d After the catastrophic defeat, May immediately rose to her feet to say she \u201cprofoundly regretted\u201d that her deal had been rejected for a second time. She said MPs would be given the opportunity to debate on Wednesday whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal on 29 March \u2013 and that she would offer MPs a free vote on that decision. They will then be given the opportunity to delay Brexit, by requesting an extension to article 50, on Thursday. The prime minister said she had \u201cpersonally struggled\u201d with the question of no deal, but said: \u201cI am conscious also of my duties as prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of the potential damage to the union that leaving without a deal could do.\u201d The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cThe government has been defeated again by an enormous majority and it must accept its deal is clearly dead and does not have the support of this house.\u201d Moments after the crushing defeat, Donald Tusk, president of the European council, warned that he expected a \u201ccredible\u201d reason for any delay to Brexit. \u201cShould there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU27 will consider it and decide by unanimity,\u201d a spokesman for Tusk said. \u201cThe EU27 will expect a credible justification for a possible extension and its duration.\u201d The ERG\u2019s Steve Baker, together with the former education secretary Nicky Morgan and other senior Conservatives, quickly tabled an amendment to the government\u2019s motion for Wednesday that would force May to pursue the so-called Malthouse compromise. The government will publish fresh details of its no-deal policies, including tariffs on food imports and how it will handle checks at the Northern Ireland border, on Wednesday morning. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is also likely to underline the risks of no deal when he delivers his spring statement on Wednesday, before the debate. Some members of the ERG \u2013 including the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson \u2013 claim a no-deal Brexit would be preferable to May\u2019s deal, and hope it could still happen. He said the prime minister\u2019s deal had \u201creached the end of the road\u201d. May insisted: \u201cVoting against leaving without a deal, and for an extension, does not solve the problems we face. The EU will want to know what use we want to make of that extension. The house will have to answer that question.\u201d She declined to set out how she would allow parliament to make that decision. But the motions on Wednesday and Thursday will be amendable, potentially allowing MPs to put forward their own alternatives. MPs pressing for a softer Brexit have signalled that they are ready to push the government to allow a series of votes to identify where a cross-party majority could be found \u2013 and believe they have supporters inside government. The former Tory minister Nick Boles warned his Brexiter colleagues even before Tuesday\u2019s vote that he and his allies would \u201cdo whatever it takes to frustrate you\u201d, and \u201cwork with opposition parties to build a majority for a softer Brexit deal\u201d. But senior Tory insiders suggested May could instead attempt to bring her deal back a third time, in what is already being dubbed \u201cmeaningful vote 3\u201d. Late on Tuesday night, May\u2019s spokesman declined to rule out the idea of the PM putting her vote to parliament yet again, despite having already suffered two of the four biggest ever parliamentary defeats in the past 100 years. \u201cShe said at the beginning that she believes very strongly that the House of Commons wants to leave with a deal, and she very strongly believes that the deal she has negotiated is the best deal which is on offer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut parliament over the next two days now potentially has two very significant decisions to make.\u201d He also denied swirling rumours at Westminster that May could ultimately be forced to call a general election to overcome the stalemate in parliament. \u201cWe are not preparing for, we do not want a general election: our position is unchanged,\u201d he said. May\u2019s defeat came despite her late-night dash to Strasbourg on Monday, during which Jean-Claude Juncker signed off on three additions to the agreement struck in November. These included a joint interpretative instrument fleshing out both sides\u2019 obligations to negotiate in good faith, a joint statement that they would work on alternative arrangements, and a unilateral statement by the UK that there would be nothing to stop Britain seeking to \u201cdisapply\u201d the backstop if negotiations broke down. Earlier, the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, had called on his colleagues to treat the vote as a \u201cpolitical judgment\u201d, after his legal advice offered little comfort to those concerned about the backstop. In his statement, he suggested the changes reduced the risk of the UK being trapped indefinitely in the Northern Ireland backstop \u2013 but did not eliminate it.",

      "body": "<p>Theresa May was greeted by a smattering of applause as she stood before her Conservative MPs to convince them that \u201cthis is the day\u201d to vote for her Brexit deal in the interests of the party and the country.</p> <p>But as she spoke, Eurosceptic MPs were poring over bombshell legal advice from Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, in growing horror.</p> <p>It showed he had returned from Brussels negotiations unable to say the Irish backstop was temporary \u2013 and therefore could bind the UK into a permanent customs union.</p> <p>May, looking weary and suffering a heavy cold, struggled to command the room. A string of supportive MPs left to brief reporters unconvincingly that the tide was turning among Conservative colleagues. \u201cI think she will win tonight,\u201d Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, insisted.</p> <p>Nadhim Zahawi, a Brexit-supporting minister, said \u201cmany\u201d MPs had stood up to tell the prime minister they would now support her deal but struggled to name a single one. George Freeman claimed there was a \u201cbig migration of wildebeests\u201d towards the deal and a \u201ccollective sound of pennies dropping\u201d.</p> <p>However, even those standing up to say their minds were changed were damning in their praise. Mark Pritchard said he had been expecting a \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d but it turned out to be a \u201chamster\u201d \u2013 only just enough to persuade him to back the deal.</p> <p>May left the room looking unsure of herself. Asked if she had done enough to bring in the votes, she grimaced, saying: \u201cSufficient.\u201d</p> <p>Within minutes, it started to become clear that the European Research Group and Democratic Unionist party were turning against the EU concessions held up by May as legally binding, as they were unable to stomach Cox\u2019s unchanged legal advice.</p> <p>Hours earlier, it had looked as if May had got almost enough. But Cox gave an early hint that he would not be pressed into changing his mind under duress from No 10. In response to a suggestion that he would, he simply tweeted: \u201cBollocks.\u201d</p> <p>Leaving the meeting with May, Mark Francois, a vocal member of the ERG, set the tone as he pronounced he \u201cfound the prime minister\u2019s answers wholly unconvincing\u201d.</p> <p>Another firm Eurosceptic, Andrew Bridgen, called the mood among his colleagues uncooperative. \u201cThere is a feeling that the prime minister has got a short shelf life and yet is determined to impose a withdrawal agreement so onerous it will trap and restrict whoever is the prime minister who negotiates the next phase,\u201d he said. \u201cThe short-term political expediency is to vote it through but in the long term I think it would cause a great deal of pain.\u201d</p> <p>From May\u2019s meeting in Portcullis House, MPs headed for the House of Commons, where Cox was due to set out his view that the deal should be backed despite his legal reservations about the permanent nature of the backstop.</p> <p>Sources close to the DUP began briefing furiously that they were not likely to support the deal. At the same time, the leader of the ERG, Jacob Rees-Mogg, had been skewering the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, in a committee hearing: \u201cBut the ability to ask is not the same as the ability to leave, is it?\u201d</p> <p>Before long, the ERG\u2019s \u201cstar chamber\u201d of lawyers said: \u201cIn the light of our own legal analysis and others we do not recommend accepting the government\u2019s motion today.\u201d</p> <p>A trickle of MPs began to declare they had changed their minds on May\u2019s deal with little enthusiasm, simply pointing out that it was better than something worse. Zac Goldsmith said the deal \u201cremained appalling\u201d but he was considering backing it anyway.</p> <p>With the ERG standing firm, anger exploded into the open among some of the deal\u2019s supporters. Charles Walker, a vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, openly called for a general election if the deal were not passed. \u201cShe has to get a new mandate for the sake of the country. Needs must when the devil drives. We cannot go on trying to govern like this,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s World At One.</p> <p>The prime minister herself opened the afternoon\u2019s debate on her Brexit deal at 2pm, watched by her husband, Philip, from the Commons gallery. Several MPs passed her throat sweets as she spoke but the Tory benches were only half full behind her.</p> <p>Never a bunch to resile from drama, the ERG gave the prime minister a chink of light by calling a meeting at 5pm to make their final decision on how to vote. The room off the ancient Westminster Hall was packed with hardline Brexiters including Sir Bill Cash, David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith, Dominic Raab and Baker.</p> <p>Boris Johnson, who led the Vote Leave campaign, was also present after setting the tone of the ERG response by telling the Commons that the deal \u201csews an apron of fig leaves that does nothing to disguise the embarrassment of the UK\u201d. He added: \u201cThis deal has reached the end of the road.\u201d</p> <p>When the meeting broke up after 90 minutes, senior members invited journalists and cameras inside to brief them that the clear majority of the group were planning to sink May\u2019s deal.</p> <p>The Tory MP Chris Green explained the thinking. \u201cParliament can\u2019t become the executive. We\u2019ve already had a vote and so the law is we leave on the 29th. The question is how we leave on the best possible terms. It\u2019s only a few days away but there is still plenty of time to come up with a significantly better deal. It\u2019s not just about the 17.4 million people but all the people who participated in that democratic process.\u201d</p> <p>It was clear the ERG still believed a no-deal Brexit was a serious option to be pursued; many argued that parliament would not be able to stop it because there was no time for more legislation.</p> <p>With most of the Eurosceptics standing firm, MPs filed into the Commons to make their decision at 7pm \u2013 voting on a single motion with no amendments.</p> <p>After the prime minister crashed to a 149-vote defeat, she stood up once again with a faltering voice to throw the ball into parliament\u2019s court.</p> <p>\u201cDoes the house wish to revoke article 50? Does it want to hold a second referendum? Or does it want to leave with a deal but not this deal?</p> <p>\u201cThese are unenviable choices, but thanks to the decision the house has made this evening they must now be faced.\u201d</p>",

A string of supportive MPs left to brief reporters unconvincingly that the tide was turning among Conservative colleagues. \u201cI think she will win tonight,\u201d Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, insisted. Nadhim Zahawi, a Brexit-supporting minister, said \u201cmany\u201d MPs had stood up to tell the prime minister they would now support her deal but struggled to name a single one. George Freeman claimed there was a \u201cbig migration of wildebeests\u201d towards the deal and a \u201ccollective sound of pennies dropping\u201d. However, even those standing up to say their minds were changed were damning in their praise. Mark Pritchard said he had been expecting a \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d but it turned out to be a \u201chamster\u201d \u2013 only just enough to persuade him to back the deal. May left the room looking unsure of herself. Asked if she had done enough to bring in the votes, she grimaced, saying: \u201cSufficient.\u201d Within minutes, it started to become clear that the European Research Group and Democratic Unionist party were turning against the EU concessions held up by May as legally binding, as they were unable to stomach Cox\u2019s unchanged legal advice. Hours earlier, it had looked as if May had got almost enough. But Cox gave an early hint that he would not be pressed into changing his mind under duress from No 10. In response to a suggestion that he would, he simply tweeted: \u201cBollocks.\u201d Leaving the meeting with May, Mark Francois, a vocal member of the ERG, set the tone as he pronounced he \u201cfound the prime minister\u2019s answers wholly unconvincing\u201d. Another firm Eurosceptic, Andrew Bridgen, called the mood among his colleagues uncooperative. \u201cThere is a feeling that the prime minister has got a short shelf life and yet is determined to impose a withdrawal agreement so onerous it will trap and restrict whoever is the prime minister who negotiates the next phase,\u201d he said. \u201cThe short-term political expediency is to vote it through but in the long term I think it would cause a great deal of pain.\u201d From May\u2019s meeting in Portcullis House, MPs headed for the House of Commons, where Cox was due to set out his view that the deal should be backed despite his legal reservations about the permanent nature of the backstop. Sources close to the DUP began briefing furiously that they were not likely to support the deal. At the same time, the leader of the ERG, Jacob Rees-Mogg, had been skewering the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, in a committee hearing: \u201cBut the ability to ask is not the same as the ability to leave, is it?\u201d Before long, the ERG\u2019s \u201cstar chamber\u201d of lawyers said: \u201cIn the light of our own legal analysis and others we do not recommend accepting the government\u2019s motion today.\u201d A trickle of MPs began to declare they had changed their minds on May\u2019s deal with little enthusiasm, simply pointing out that it was better than something worse. Zac Goldsmith said the deal \u201cremained appalling\u201d but he was considering backing it anyway. With the ERG standing firm, anger exploded into the open among some of the deal\u2019s supporters. Charles Walker, a vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, openly called for a general election if the deal were not passed. \u201cShe has to get a new mandate for the sake of the country. Needs must when the devil drives. We cannot go on trying to govern like this,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s World At One. The prime minister herself opened the afternoon\u2019s debate on her Brexit deal at 2pm, watched by her husband, Philip, from the Commons gallery. Several MPs passed her throat sweets as she spoke but the Tory benches were only half full behind her. Never a bunch to resile from drama, the ERG gave the prime minister a chink of light by calling a meeting at 5pm to make their final decision on how to vote. The room off the ancient Westminster Hall was packed with hardline Brexiters including Sir Bill Cash, David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith, Dominic Raab and Baker. Boris Johnson, who led the Vote Leave campaign, was also present after setting the tone of the ERG response by telling the Commons that the deal \u201csews an apron of fig leaves that does nothing to disguise the embarrassment of the UK\u201d. He added: \u201cThis deal has reached the end of the road.\u201d When the meeting broke up after 90 minutes, senior members invited journalists and cameras inside to brief them that the clear majority of the group were planning to sink May\u2019s deal. The Tory MP Chris Green explained the thinking. \u201cParliament can\u2019t become the executive. We\u2019ve already had a vote and so the law is we leave on the 29th. The question is how we leave on the best possible terms. It\u2019s only a few days away but there is still plenty of time to come up with a significantly better deal. It\u2019s not just about the 17.4 million people but all the people who participated in that democratic process.\u201d It was clear the ERG still believed a no-deal Brexit was a serious option to be pursued; many argued that parliament would not be able to stop it because there was no time for more legislation. With most of the Eurosceptics standing firm, MPs filed into the Commons to make their decision at 7pm \u2013 voting on a single motion with no amendments. After the prime minister crashed to a 149-vote defeat, she stood up once again with a faltering voice to throw the ball into parliament\u2019s court. \u201cDoes the house wish to revoke article 50? Does it want to hold a second referendum? Or does it want to leave with a deal but not this deal? \u201cThese are unenviable choices, but thanks to the decision the house has made this evening they must now be faced.\u201d",

But the road to success is now closed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/12/mps-ignore-mays-pleas-and-defeat-her-brexit-deal-by-149-votes\" title=\"\">Parliament\u2019s second verdict</a> on Theresa May\u2019s deal is slightly less crushing than the first one in January. But a defeat by 149 votes, just weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU, indicates not only the last evacuation of any authority from the prime minister but a profound crisis in the project that is the only purpose of her government. She had one job, and she cannot do it. Vital questions about the future will now be settled in a state between despondency and panic. There is no strategy, no guiding intelligence. A plan must be salvaged from the wreckage of a bad idea badly executed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/12/mps-ignore-mays-pleas-and-defeat-her-brexit-deal-by-149-votes\">MPs ignore May\u2019s pleas and defeat her Brexit deal by 149 votes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There was a moment, early on Tuesday, when May thought she saw a way through. A path was briefly visible to the promised land of orderly Brexit. The prime minister had brought legal clarifications from Strasbourg to embellish her deal. But then the road was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/12/theresa-may-brexit-concessions-charade-second-referendum-essential\" title=\"\">barred by Geoffrey Cox</a>. The attorney general judged that the UK might still find itself in the notorious backstop \u2013 an EU customs union \u2013 with no unilateral means of dissolving the arrangement. Indefinite backstop is a deal-breaker for hardliners.</p> \n<p>Cox\u2019s judgment spread disappointment well beyond the circle of noisy Brexit ultras. There is a quieter tranche of MPs whose first preference is that Brexit just be done with a minimum of trauma. Most aren\u2019t that bothered about the detail. But May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, the only existing mechanism to achieve their goal, is just too toxic after so much high-profile scorn. </p> \n<p>Pro-Brexit Labour MPs need Tories to vote for a Tory deal. Many Conservatives wanted to oblige, but they needed a credible reason to endorse something in March that they had despised in January. A revision of the backstop was meant to be the ladder down which they could climb with dignity intact. Instead the prime minister asked them to make an awkward leap on her behalf. Not enough Conservatives trust or like their leader enough to do that.</p> \n<p>That was always going to be a political calculation, not a legal one. The story that May\u2019s deal, sprinkled with magic codicils, could be transformed from a dud to diamond was dishonest. The Brexit ultras of the European Research Group put on a show of legal piety, convening a \u201cstar chamber\u201d of jurists to evaluate the EU\u2019s offer. They borrowed the nomenclature from Tudor England, not because the historical analogy is appropriate but as a stylistic affectation, lending bogus gravitas to what is, in reality, a conclave of veteran Eurosceptics who were always going to say what decades of prejudice had primed them to say: that Brussels has not given enough; that the sovereignty of Albion is affronted.</p> \n<p>I do not recall the high priests of Brexit being so interested in legal nicety when arguing that Britain should quit the EU without a deal, reneging on financial commitments already made under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/08/sufficient-progress-in-brexit-talks-announced-after-mays-dash-to-brussels\" title=\"\">December 2017 \u201cjoint report\u201d</a>, and hang the consequences for Ireland and its border. In the referendum, leave campaigners were hardly fastidious in explaining the technical implications of ending UK-EU treaties. They didn\u2019t even feel bound by domestic electoral law, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/08/electoral-law-broken-fight-for-soul-of-democracy\" title=\"\">subsequent investigations</a> have established.</p> \n<p>Britain did once cultivate a sober, lawyerly and realistic strain of Euroscepticism. The perspective it brought to EU affairs, the laconic distance from continental flights of federalism, was often appreciated by fellow member states. It was a valued part of the cultural mix. But that trait has been submerged in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/16/brexit-paranoid-fantasy-fintan-otoole\" title=\"\">torrent of romantic nationalism</a> that sweeps rational query aside and dismisses practical objections as deficient patriotism.</p> \n<p>Every difficulty encountered in Brexit negotiations over the past two years was foreseeable. Most flowed from the same essential miscalculation: the wildly implausible expectation that a bloc of 27 nations, each knowing the value of unity and solidarity, would be the weaker party in negotiations. The path to May\u2019s humiliation began in the weird solipsism of an exiting country, having no notion of the relationship it wanted with the rest of Europe, imagining it might dictate the terms of its exit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6188f4c9-5590-469d-b292-c44ab1d34dba\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c2mfgyIr4fA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Brexiters cite their technical reasons for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/15/what-is-the-brexit-backstop\" title=\"\">hating the backstop</a>, but it also represents something so painful that they dare not admit it, even to themselves. It exists because European nations resolved to put the needs of Ireland, a small country, ahead of demands by the UK, a bigger, mightier country. It is an emblem of the protection that EU membership affords. It proves that national power can be amplified in Brussels, when Eurosceptics insist it can only be debilitated there.</p> \n<p>All of the diplomatic and political wrangling over the past 24 hours \u2013 and many Westminster skirmishes over the previous 24 months \u2013 have been little more than displacement activity for the Tories. There have been countless excuses to fuss around in the undergrowth of the Brexit process just to avoid looking up at the horizon and blinking in shock to see the world as it is, not as the leave campaign falsely promised it would be.</p> \n<p>This has been the greatest source of frustration and shock for the rest of Europe: the spectacle of a once serious country, formerly admired for the coolness of its temperament, racing towards perilous choices while turning its face defiantly against obvious realities. That, plus the tragic irony of history creating a vacancy for visionary leadership and then filling it with May.</p> \n<p>There is an almost perfect mismatch between the prime minister\u2019s character and the skills she has needed. She was blunt when she should have been diplomatic; inscrutable when she needed to be candid. When imagination was required, she opted for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/14/theresa-may-brussels-pizza-hut\" title=\"\">inane repetition</a>. When she should have reached out, she doubled down. She appeased enemies of compromise in parliament and squandered goodwill in the country.</p> \n<p>It can be hard to disentangle the disaster Brexit might always have been from the specific mess May has made of it. There are turnings on the road to failure that she did not need to take, junctions that were missed. She did not have to embark on the article 50 route before knowing where it led. She could have drawn different <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/05/theresa-may-brexit-red-lines-reckless-hostage-dup-promises-cant-keep\" title=\"\">red lines</a> or changed them when they confined her to impossible choices. But while there were problems with the driver, there were also limits to how far she could get with Brexiteer maps, scrawled in crayon on the eve of the referendum with wild, higgledy lines pointing at destinations that don\u2019t exist.</p> \n<p>The result is that the country has been driven round in circles. The parliamentary debate on May\u2019s deal today was a gloomier, paler version of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-suffers-historic-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-her\" title=\"\">one that was held in January</a>. For much of the day the Commons benches were emptier than last time. The prime minister\u2019s exhausted voice was hoarser. The deal was rejected by a smaller margin not because it has got any better, but because fear and exhaustion are catching up with Tory MPs, overtaking their belief that something better will come along.</p> \n<p>As for the implacables who voted against May, they were not jubilant. They inflicted a defeat, but they know also that there was no victory here for any kind of Brexit. A ruinous no deal is still technically possible, but a chain of events has been triggered that could lead to postponement or even annulment of the whole project. The prime minister\u2019s humiliation could rebound on to every Eurosceptic fanatic who urged her ever further and faster down the road to nowhere. Brexiteers have a dangerous adversary that they cannot name. It isn\u2019t any opposition party, or Brussels, or remainers. It is reality.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "There might still be ways that Brexit can go badly; unexplored dead ends and byways of failure. But the road to success is now closed. Parliament\u2019s second verdict on Theresa May\u2019s deal is slightly less crushing than the first one in January. But a defeat by 149 votes, just weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU, indicates not only the last evacuation of any authority from the prime minister but a profound crisis in the project that is the only purpose of her government. She had one job, and she cannot do it. Vital questions about the future will now be settled in a state between despondency and panic. There is no strategy, no guiding intelligence. A plan must be salvaged from the wreckage of a bad idea badly executed. There was a moment, early on Tuesday, when May thought she saw a way through. A path was briefly visible to the promised land of orderly Brexit. The prime minister had brought legal clarifications from Strasbourg to embellish her deal. But then the road was barred by Geoffrey Cox. The attorney general judged that the UK might still find itself in the notorious backstop \u2013 an EU customs union \u2013 with no unilateral means of dissolving the arrangement. Indefinite backstop is a deal-breaker for hardliners. Cox\u2019s judgment spread disappointment well beyond the circle of noisy Brexit ultras. There is a quieter tranche of MPs whose first preference is that Brexit just be done with a minimum of trauma. Most aren\u2019t that bothered about the detail. But May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, the only existing mechanism to achieve their goal, is just too toxic after so much high-profile scorn. Pro-Brexit Labour MPs need Tories to vote for a Tory deal. Many Conservatives wanted to oblige, but they needed a credible reason to endorse something in March that they had despised in January. A revision of the backstop was meant to be the ladder down which they could climb with dignity intact. Instead the prime minister asked them to make an awkward leap on her behalf. Not enough Conservatives trust or like their leader enough to do that. That was always going to be a political calculation, not a legal one. The story that May\u2019s deal, sprinkled with magic codicils, could be transformed from a dud to diamond was dishonest. The Brexit ultras of the European Research Group put on a show of legal piety, convening a \u201cstar chamber\u201d of jurists to evaluate the EU\u2019s offer. They borrowed the nomenclature from Tudor England, not because the historical analogy is appropriate but as a stylistic affectation, lending bogus gravitas to what is, in reality, a conclave of veteran Eurosceptics who were always going to say what decades of prejudice had primed them to say: that Brussels has not given enough; that the sovereignty of Albion is affronted. I do not recall the high priests of Brexit being so interested in legal nicety when arguing that Britain should quit the EU without a deal, reneging on financial commitments already made under the December 2017 \u201cjoint report\u201d, and hang the consequences for Ireland and its border. In the referendum, leave campaigners were hardly fastidious in explaining the technical implications of ending UK-EU treaties. They didn\u2019t even feel bound by domestic electoral law, as subsequent investigations have established. Britain did once cultivate a sober, lawyerly and realistic strain of Euroscepticism. The perspective it brought to EU affairs, the laconic distance from continental flights of federalism, was often appreciated by fellow member states. It was a valued part of the cultural mix. But that trait has been submerged in a torrent of romantic nationalism that sweeps rational query aside and dismisses practical objections as deficient patriotism. Every difficulty encountered in Brexit negotiations over the past two years was foreseeable. Most flowed from the same essential miscalculation: the wildly implausible expectation that a bloc of 27 nations, each knowing the value of unity and solidarity, would be the weaker party in negotiations. The path to May\u2019s humiliation began in the weird solipsism of an exiting country, having no notion of the relationship it wanted with the rest of Europe, imagining it might dictate the terms of its exit. Brexiters cite their technical reasons for hating the backstop, but it also represents something so painful that they dare not admit it, even to themselves. It exists because European nations resolved to put the needs of Ireland, a small country, ahead of demands by the UK, a bigger, mightier country. It is an emblem of the protection that EU membership affords. It proves that national power can be amplified in Brussels, when Eurosceptics insist it can only be debilitated there. All of the diplomatic and political wrangling over the past 24 hours \u2013 and many Westminster skirmishes over the previous 24 months \u2013 have been little more than displacement activity for the Tories. There have been countless excuses to fuss around in the undergrowth of the Brexit process just to avoid looking up at the horizon and blinking in shock to see the world as it is, not as the leave campaign falsely promised it would be. This has been the greatest source of frustration and shock for the rest of Europe: the spectacle of a once serious country, formerly admired for the coolness of its temperament, racing towards perilous choices while turning its face defiantly against obvious realities. That, plus the tragic irony of history creating a vacancy for visionary leadership and then filling it with May. There is an almost perfect mismatch between the prime minister\u2019s character and the skills she has needed. She was blunt when she should have been diplomatic; inscrutable when she needed to be candid. When imagination was required, she opted for inane repetition. When she should have reached out, she doubled down. She appeased enemies of compromise in parliament and squandered goodwill in the country. It can be hard to disentangle the disaster Brexit might always have been from the specific mess May has made of it. There are turnings on the road to failure that she did not need to take, junctions that were missed. She did not have to embark on the article 50 route before knowing where it led. She could have drawn different red lines or changed them when they confined her to impossible choices. But while there were problems with the driver, there were also limits to how far she could get with Brexiteer maps, scrawled in crayon on the eve of the referendum with wild, higgledy lines pointing at destinations that don\u2019t exist. The result is that the country has been driven round in circles. The parliamentary debate on May\u2019s deal today was a gloomier, paler version of the one that was held in January. For much of the day the Commons benches were emptier than last time. The prime minister\u2019s exhausted voice was hoarser. The deal was rejected by a smaller margin not because it has got any better, but because fear and exhaustion are catching up with Tory MPs, overtaking their belief that something better will come along. As for the implacables who voted against May, they were not jubilant. They inflicted a defeat, but they know also that there was no victory here for any kind of Brexit. A ruinous no deal is still technically possible, but a chain of events has been triggered that could lead to postponement or even annulment of the whole project. The prime minister\u2019s humiliation could rebound on to every Eurosceptic fanatic who urged her ever further and faster down the road to nowhere. Brexiteers have a dangerous adversary that they cannot name. It isn\u2019t any opposition party, or Brussels, or remainers. It is reality. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

It got Karen Bradley, 11 March), but should we be surprised? The Northern Ireland posting has for decades been regarded as a political backwater, or the graveyard of political ambition. Hence Reggie Maudling\u2019s famous relief at leaving such \u201ca bloody awful place\u201d in the 1970s. Yet it is worse than that. Irish affairs have long been regarded with a mixture of indifference and apathy in England. Polls have shown a general public that did not know that the Republic was not part of the UK. Only in 1980, 12 years after the start of the Troubles, did the BBC air Robert Kee\u2019s excellent television history of Ireland. And so it goes on into the modern era, producing political illiterates like Bradley.

A deal which \u2013 just two months ago \u2013 they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-loses-brexit-deal-vote-by-majority-of-230\" title=\"\">overwhelmingly rejected</a>. Has she achieved enough to change her critics\u2019 minds? Perhaps in some cases, but certainly not all. But does that matter? Can she sneak her deal over the line with abstentions and some Labour rebels? We will find out later tonight in a crucial parliamentary debate.</p> <p>I sometimes think that even if May had hiked up Mount Sinai and dragged down stone tablets from Moses himself setting out commitments that the backstop couldn\u2019t become permanent, you would still have heard Eurosceptic MPs telling journalists that they would not support the Brexit deal. For some of her critics, no reassurance was ever going to work, and no compromise would be accepted. As Taylor Swift sang \u2013 <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/taylor-swift-haters-gonna-hate-shake-it-off-134CbbASMeRPDa\" title=\"\">haters gonna hate</a> \u2013 and some critics will always oppose.</p> <p>But there is also a biddable group of Conservative MPs who, although they were dissatisfied with the deal, and especially with the backstop, could be persuaded to vote for it. Many of them are worried about losing Brexit altogether, or seeing it diluted into an even softer version. They will have been worried to hear President Juncker insist yesterday that, if Brexit is delayed beyond May, the UK would have to elect MEPs, something that few in parliament want to see happen.</p> <p>Will the reassurances be sufficient to assuage the concerns of these Conservative critics? A lot, perhaps everything, rides on what the attorney general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/07/cometh-the-hour-cometh-geoffrey-cox-wobbly-codpiece\" title=\"\">Geoffrey Cox</a>, says when he publishes updated legal advice, later today.

      "bodyText": "With a late-night dash to Strasbourg yesterday, Theresa May secured a last-minute package of changes which she hopes to use to persuade MPs to back her Brexit deal this evening. A deal which \u2013 just two months ago \u2013 they overwhelmingly rejected. Has she achieved enough to change her critics\u2019 minds? Perhaps in some cases, but certainly not all. But does that matter? Can she sneak her deal over the line with abstentions and some Labour rebels? We will find out later tonight in a crucial parliamentary debate. I sometimes think that even if May had hiked up Mount Sinai and dragged down stone tablets from Moses himself setting out commitments that the backstop couldn\u2019t become permanent, you would still have heard Eurosceptic MPs telling journalists that they would not support the Brexit deal. For some of her critics, no reassurance was ever going to work, and no compromise would be accepted. As Taylor Swift sang \u2013 haters gonna hate \u2013 and some critics will always oppose. But there is also a biddable group of Conservative MPs who, although they were dissatisfied with the deal, and especially with the backstop, could be persuaded to vote for it. Many of them are worried about losing Brexit altogether, or seeing it diluted into an even softer version. They will have been worried to hear President Juncker insist yesterday that, if Brexit is delayed beyond May, the UK would have to elect MEPs, something that few in parliament want to see happen. Will the reassurances be sufficient to assuage the concerns of these Conservative critics? A lot, perhaps everything, rides on what the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, says when he publishes updated legal advice, later today. What the DUP decides will be critical too. If they declare they can live with the backstop as redefined, particularly given new binding commitments that it doesn\u2019t cut across the 1998 Belfast Good Friday agreement, it seems likely that many erstwhile critics on the Conservative side could also soften. On the other side of parliament, the Labour front bench continues its tantric dance towards (but seemingly never quite to) a second referendum. Having voted to support a referendum, promised to respect its result, and then whipped MPs to trigger article 50, the Labour party is now determined to vote against a Brexit deal almost come what may, primarily it often seems because it\u2019s not a Labour Brexit (whatever that is). Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary \u2013 in a bizarre echo of May\u2019s catchphrase \u2013 has tried his best to insist this morning that nothing has changed, when it obviously has.

It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council.

Thirdly, the UK has issued its own unilateral declaration, asserting that it will apply to the independent arbitration panel to dismantle the backstop provisions if the government believes the EU is not making efforts to end the arrangement. May will need to convince the vast majority of Tory Brexiters and the DUP in order for her deal to pass and is likely to face continued opposition from Tory remainers, Labour and most opposition parties. About 20 Labour MPs are believed to be seriously considering voting for the deal, with some party sources suggesting the number may be as high as 60. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said there was nothing in the assurances that had not been present before the last meaningful vote, and that May had failed on one of her key aims: to change the text of the withdrawal agreement. He said the UK\u2019s unilateral declaration was meaningless. \u201cThis is a bit like someone saying: \u2018I have read my home insurance agreement, this is what I think it means,\u2019\u201d he told Today. However, Gove said the unilateral declaration \u201chad not been rejected or undermined by the EU, so that too has political and legal standing and is legally material\u201d. Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions, released his own legal assessment of the deal on Tuesday morning. \u201cHaving studied the documents, I would be surprised if they are sufficient to enable the attorney general to change the central plank of his December legal advice,\u201d it said. Cox\u2019s legal advice said the backstop \u201cwould endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement takes its place in whole or in part\u201d. Starmer\u2019s advice said: \u201cThe withdrawal agreement does not include a mechanism for unilateral exit from \u2013 or termination of \u2013 the backstop (or any other part of the agreement) even where bad faith is made out. \u201cTurning the content of the 14 January letter from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker into a joint interpretative declaration does not change that. Nor in my view does anything else agreed last night.\u201d",

But, if there are any further developments tonight, you\u2019ll hear about them here first. In any case, thanks for reading and for all the comments.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The British prime minister, Theresa May, and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said they had agreed a series of changes to the Brexit deal.</strong> The news came after May\u2019s last-minute dash to Strasbourg for talks with EU leaders. MPs will be asked to vote on the amended deal on Tuesday after the government tabled a motion late on Monday evening.</li> <li><strong>May claimed the new deal satisfied Parliament\u2019s concerns because it provided \u201clegally binding\u201d changes. </strong>Crucially, she said it would allow the UK to complain to an independent arbitrator and exit the backstop if the EU sought to \u201ctrap\u201d it. And she claimed the UK could unilaterally leave the backstop if talks on a future relationship broke down.</li> <li><strong>But senior Labour figures said nothing of substance had changed.</strong> The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, attacked the deal in the Commons on Monday and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, indicated the party would not back it there on Tuesday. Many commentators noted that the key to its success would be whether or not the changes would lead the attorney general to change his legal advice that the backstop could leave the UK trapped indefinitely in the backstop.</li> <li><strong>Juncker warned there would be no further chance to pass a withdrawal deal.</strong> He said: \u201cIn politics, sometimes you get a second chance ... There will be no third chance.\u201d And he added a warning that \u201cit is this deal or Brexit might not happen at all\u201d. Moreover, he said, the UK would be legally obliged to hold European Parliament elections in May, should Brexit not be sorted by then.</li> <li><strong>The hard Brexit-supporting factions within Parliament appeared split on whether or not the new deal could satisfy them.</strong> The DUP said it would reserve judgment. Some figures in the Tory backbench ERG dismissed it as \u201cgloss\u201d, while others were more willing to consider it. They may be key to passing or rejecting the \u2013 as well as to May\u2019s political career.</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/11/brexit-latest-news-vote-tuesday-tories-suspect-may-could-pull-tuesdays-key-vote-after-talks-fail-to-deliver-progress-politics-live?page=with:block-5c86a276e4b016d234259c7b#block-5c86a276e4b016d234259c7b\">For a comprehensive summary of the day\u2019s earlier events, see here</a>.</li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019re looking to read more, my colleague <strong>Rowena Mason</strong> has the full story:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/11/may-secures-legally-binding-changes-to-brexit-deal-government-claims\">May wins \u2018improved\u2019 Brexit deal but it may not be enough for MPs</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c86fbc4e4b0cf92e5a55211\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T00:23:11.986Z\">12.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jean-Claude Juncker</strong> and <strong>Michel Barnier</strong> briefed the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group after the EU Commission president\u2019s press conference with May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MargSchinas/status/1105255047267581952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Now \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JunckerEU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JunckerEU</a>\u2069 \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichelBarnier?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MichelBarnier</a>\u2069 briefing \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europarl_EN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Europarl_EN</a>\u2069 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> Steering Group on agreement with \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theresa_may</a>\u2069. \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guyverhofstadt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@guyverhofstadt</a>\u2069 \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElmarBrok_MEP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ElmarBrok_MEP</a>\u2069 \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gualtierieurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gualtierieurope</a>\u2069 \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/danutahuebner?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@danutahuebner</a>\u2069 \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ph_lamberts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ph_lamberts</a>\u2069 \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabiZimmerMEP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GabiZimmerMEP</a>\u2069 <a href=\"https://t.co/PdNcEmEjgj\">pic.twitter.com/PdNcEmEjgj</a></p>&mdash; Margaritis Schinas (@MargSchinas) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MargSchinas/status/1105255047267581952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 11, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c86f856e4b016d234259ef7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T00:08:33.471Z\">12.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After the emergency meeting of Ireland\u2019s cabinet concluded in Dublin late on Monday night, the country\u2019s transport minister, <strong>Shane Ross</strong>, said the Taoiseach would make a statement on Tuesday morning.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think everybody here is hoping that it goes through the House of Commons tomorrow.

I stand by what that deal achieves for my country.</p> <p>It means we regain control of our laws, by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. Regain control of our borders, by ending free movement. Regain control of our money, by ending vast annual payments to the EU.</p> <p>The end of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy for British farmers and fishermen. An independent trade policy.</p> <p>And the deal sets us on course for a good future relationship with our friends and allies in the EU. A close economic partnership that is good for business. Ongoing security co-operation to keep our peoples safe.</p> <p>The deal honours the referendum result and is good for both the UK and the EU. </p> <p>But there was a clear concern in Parliament over one issue in particular: the Northern Ireland backstop.</p> <p>Having an insurance policy to guarantee that there will never be a hard border in Northern Ireland is absolutely right \u2013 it honours the UK\u2019s solemn commitments in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>But if we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not the template for our future relationship.</p> <p>The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally binding changes were needed to set that right. Today we have agreed them.</p> <p>First, a joint instrument with comparable legal weight to the withdrawal agreement will guarantee that the EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely. If they do, it can be challenged through arbitration and if they are found to be in breach the UK can suspend the backstop.</p> <p>The joint instrument also gives a legal commitment that whatever replaces the backstop does not need to replicate it. And it entrenches in legally binding form the commitments made in the exchange of letters with Presidents Tusk and Juncker in January.</p> <p>Second, the UK and the EU have made a joint statement in relation to the political declaration. It sets out a number of commitments to enhance and expedite the process of negotiating and bringing into force the future relationship. And it makes a legal commitment that the UK and the EU will begin work immediately to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by the end of December 2020.</p> <p>There will be a specific negotiating track on alternative arrangements from the very start of the next phase of negotiations.

It is right that I address these remarks to the House today and correct the record.</p> <p>What I said was wrong, it was deeply insensitive to the families who lost loved ones in incidents involving the security forces.</p> <p>I have apologised unreservedly for the offence and hurt that my words caused.</p> <p>Today, I repeat that apology; both to the families and to members of this House. The language that I used was wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bradley said she was \u201cgrateful\u201d to affected families for giving her the opportunity to apologise in person last week and added that any evidence of wrongdoing should be pursued \u201cwithout fear or favour, whoever the perpetrators might be\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My position and the position of this government is clear, we believe fundamentally in the rule of law.

And the government begged us \u2013 and I use the word deliberately - to vote for the Brady amendment. That then gave the prime minister a mandate to go to Brussels and say, look, I have the support of the House of Commons to ask you to remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>We now know they never asked.

She is stuck to plan A.

In a speech at Bloomberg in London, ahead of the spring statement on Wednesday, McDonnell said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The position of the chancellor of the exchequer comes with a responsibility which I think Philip Hammond actually has abdicated in his current role. If Brexit ends up leading to even half of what the government\u2019s own forecasts suggest could happen, I think history will judge harshly the few who could have prevented and averted this potential disaster and did so little.</p> </blockquote> <p>McDonnell said the \u201ceffects of their complicity\u201d were already there, including the \u201cslowest growth in six years, investment falling, manufacturing in recession, a trade deficit of over \u00a310bn last quarter, growth forecasts being revised downwards by the Bank of England and others ... firms announcing their intentions to leave the UK\u201d. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think all this was avoidable were it not for the political weakness and yes, these are strong words, the cowardice of the chancellor of the exchequer.</p> <p>Failure to stand up for our economy and failure to stand up for the interests of our country. </p> <p>And whatever happens with Brexit, that\u2019s damage to people\u2019s lives that cannot be undone.</p> </blockquote> <p>McDonnell was particularly critical of Hammond for not ruling out a no-deal Brexit. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re on the verge of a no-deal Brexit which could decimate British industry and bring about \u2013 in the words of the Bank of England \u2013 a worse economic catastrophe than the financial crisis ten years ago.</p> <p>Philip Hammond has repeatedly spoken about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. But here we are, a couple of weeks away from one, and all he has to show for his high office is words. Can you imagine Rab Butler, Nigel Lawson or Ken Clarke allowing their Cabinet colleagues to best them in this way? Let alone Hugh Gaitskell, Denis Healey or Gordon Brown?</p> </blockquote> <p>(Hammond would argue that it was precisely because he and other cabinet colleagues have been saying that a no-deal Brexit would be unacceptable, Theresa May agreed to give MPs a vote this week on ruling one out if her deal gets defeated. Hammond and the Treasury have also been arguing in government for a Brexit that does least damage to trade, achieving a partial success when the cabinet backed the \u201cChequers plan\u201d that was unacceptable to Brexiters like David Davis and Boris Johnson.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ff20952a8d0e5f952d089cc9583d2271269eb29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ff20952a8d0e5f952d089cc9583d2271269eb29/0_52_5000_2999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell speech at Bloomberg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell speech at Bloomberg</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c865c71e4b0eff8e0fc0ab3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-11T13:03:52.927Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May could be heading for Strasbourg later for a meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, the BBC reports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1105090558639382528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hearing PM likely to go to Strasbourg later - not confirmed tho, &#39;fluid&#39; the polite way of describing what&#39;s going on at the moment</p>&mdash; Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1105090558639382528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 11, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1105091482007023617\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Certainly the case Number 10 have been increasingly seeing Juncker as the deal maker here - EU 27 sources say meeting btw the two for tonight not in the diary yet</p>&mdash; Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1105091482007023617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 11, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c865a1fe4b0cf92e5a54b94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-11T13:02:24.950Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After the two urgent questions in the Commons (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/11/brexit-latest-news-vote-tuesday-tories-suspect-may-could-pull-tuesdays-key-vote-after-talks-fail-to-deliver-progress-politics-live?page=with:block-5c86552be4b016d23425982b#block-5c86552be4b016d23425982b\"> 12.33pm)</a>, we are going to have three statements.

If a leader wins a vote of this kind, as May did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2018/dec/12/tory-mps-trigger-vote-of-no-confidence-in-may-amid-brexit-uncertainty-politics-live?page=with:block-5c117699e4b025637fe94420#block-5c117699e4b025637fe94420\">on 12 December, </a>no other confidence vote is allowed for another year.</p> <p>But, ultimately, at least in normal circumstances, any leader requires the confidence of his or her party, and if MPs were determined to force May out now they could. For example, there could be a mass cabinet walk-out. Or MPs could start refusing to vote for government business. </p> <p>(Of course, it did not work like this when Labour MPs tried to defenestrate Jeremy Corbyn in 2016, after the referendum. But Corbyn felt strong enough to stay put because he knew he had the support of the membership. The Conservative membership is much smaller, and it never chose May because she became party leader without the need for a ballot.)</p> <p>As a last resort Conservative MPs could also vote against the government in a confidence motion, on the assumption that another party leader might take over in the 14-day grace period before a no-confidence vote leads to a general election.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c864d3de4b0eff8e0fc09e5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-11T11:59:12.489Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Commons order paper says Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will be giving evidence to the Brexit committee at 12.15pm.

Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Gove rejects Brexiter claims that May\u2019s plan would turn the UK into a \u201cvassal state\u201d.</strong> He says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is not the case that this deal makes us a colony or vassal state. How could it when it gives us total control over our borders and ends our automatic payments to the EU? Colonies, by definition, don\u2019t have control over their borders and they give up their natural resources to others.</p> <p>This deal means we have the absolute freedom to decide who comes into this country, and on what terms. It also allows us to decide what pan-European programmes, if any, we want to join in.</p> <p>As one of the leaders of the leave campaign, I know that two of the most resonant demands from voters were control of our borders and money. This deal delivers \u2014 completely and, as it happens, without compromise \u2014 on both.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gove does not say it, but one of the Tories who has been most vocal in claiming that May\u2019s deal would turn the UK into a \u201cvassal state\u201d has been Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, (eg,<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-latest-boris-johnson-warns-draft-deal-will-turn-uk-into-vassal-state-as-he-calls-on-ministers-a3989436.html\"> here)</a>, who along with Gove joint leader of the Vote Leave campaign.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Gove says Brexit should be a compromise that acknowledges the concerns of those who voted remain.</strong> He says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Forty-eight per cent of the country voted to remain. Their voices need to be listened to, their hopes incorporated in our plan for the future. That doesn\u2019t mean giving in to the much smaller number who want to overturn the decision and frustrate Brexit.</p> <p>But it must mean that none of us leavers should try to make our perfect Brexit the enemy of the common good.</p> <p>Which is why I hope that everyone who believes in our democracy \u2014 in the importance of delivering Brexit and in the critical need to unite our country \u2014 will get behind the prime minister\u2019s deal this week.</p> <p>It is, of course, a compromise. But so many of the great British traditions and institutions I and many others value are the result of compromise.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He says people did not vote for a no-deal Brexit in 2016.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some may say that ditching this deal will allow us to leave without any compromises. But we didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal. That wasn\u2019t the message of the campaign I helped lead.

It is expected to be called by the Speaker, John Bercow. Even though it will be heavily defeated, Blackford said he thought it would be the first time the Commons has debated and voted on independence.</p> <p>He said the motion was laying the groundwork for a future political battles on independence. The next source of conflict between the UK and Scottish governments is likely to be formal demands in coming weeks from Nicola Sturgeon for the legal powers to stage a second independence referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are making the case that Scotland has to have a say in this.

The news came after May\u2019s last-minute dash to Strasbourg for talks with EU leaders. MPs will be asked to vote on the amended deal on Tuesday after the government tabled a motion late on Monday evening. May claimed the new deal satisfied Parliament\u2019s concerns because it provided \u201clegally binding\u201d changes. Crucially, she said it would allow the UK to complain to an independent arbitrator and exit the backstop if the EU sought to \u201ctrap\u201d it. And she claimed the UK could unilaterally leave the backstop if talks on a future relationship broke down. But senior Labour figures said nothing of substance had changed. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, attacked the deal in the Commons on Monday and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, indicated the party would not back it there on Tuesday. Many commentators noted that the key to its success would be whether or not the changes would lead the attorney general to change his legal advice that the backstop could leave the UK trapped indefinitely in the backstop. Juncker warned there would be no further chance to pass a withdrawal deal. He said: \u201cIn politics, sometimes you get a second chance ... There will be no third chance.\u201d And he added a warning that \u201cit is this deal or Brexit might not happen at all\u201d. Moreover, he said, the UK would be legally obliged to hold European Parliament elections in May, should Brexit not be sorted by then. The hard Brexit-supporting factions within Parliament appeared split on whether or not the new deal could satisfy them. The DUP said it would reserve judgment. Some figures in the Tory backbench ERG dismissed it as \u201cgloss\u201d, while others were more willing to consider it. They may be key to passing or rejecting the \u2013 as well as to May\u2019s political career. For a comprehensive summary of the day\u2019s earlier events, see here. If you\u2019re looking to read more, my colleague Rowena Mason has the full story: Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier briefed the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group after the EU Commission president\u2019s press conference with May. After the emergency meeting of Ireland\u2019s cabinet concluded in Dublin late on Monday night, the country\u2019s transport minister, Shane Ross, said the Taoiseach would make a statement on Tuesday morning. I think everybody here is hoping that it goes through the House of Commons tomorrow. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping for. We\u2019re very hopeful that it will go through. The President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, is following the same line as Juncker: The prominent Tory backbencher, Damian Collins, who backed remain, says he\u2019ll vote against the government\u2019s motion tomorrow. Collins is the chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. The DUP MP, Jim Shannon, warned that improvements to the deal could be the \u201cEmperor\u2019s new clothes\u201d. He said: He will know the story of the Emperor\u2019s clothes and we just hope tomorrow morning the Emperor\u2019s clothes won\u2019t reveal something very embarrassing for the prime minister. Several Tory MPs suggested the prime minister postpone tomorrow\u2019s vote by 24 hours to give the Commons more time to examine the changes to the withdrawal agreement. Charlie Elphicke said: If it\u2019s such a great deal, why the rush? Why bounce the House into a vote tomorrow? If it\u2019s such a good deal why do we not take a few days to cogitate, reflect, look at the deal then come to the House and have the vote when we\u2019ve gone across the detail and we have had that chance for full and frank consideration? Lidington said the House has \u201cconsidered these issues on a number of occasions\u201d, saying that the public \u201cwant decisions taken\u201d and to see politicians \u201cget on with delivering the referendum result\u201d. Peter Bone said there would \u201cnot be enough time to debate the motion\u201d ahead of the vote at 7pm tomorrow, adding: \u201cCan I suggest to the deputy PM... would it not be better to have a statement from the attorney general tomorrow, a statement from the prime minister tomorrow and a debate the following day?\u201d He added it was \u201cridiculous that Parliament should be bounced into it\u201d, but Lidington said we \u201ccannot have further delay\u201d. Back in Westminster, Lidington is still batting for the government. MPs have repeatedly pressed him to reveal when key documents will be available and have bemoaned the fact that details of the government motion first emerged on Twitter \u2013 an approach Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty described as \u201ccontemptuous\u201d. The Brexiter and Conservative former minister, Mark Francois, said: If the government\u2019s motion is on Twitter, couldn\u2019t the minister just read it out? On the legal advice, Francois warned that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has been involved in negotiating the deal, and will be \u201cto some extent marking his own homework when he advises the House\u201d. The Labour MP, Stella Creasy, added: It\u2019s clearer that we should be looking at Twitter rather than listening to the minister on this. And the former government minister, Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden said of Lidington\u2019s announcements in his initial statement: Well, if this is a fig leaf it doesn\u2019t cover very much and it certainly doesn\u2019t cover the government\u2019s desperation to give the ERG and the DUP an excuse to come in off the ledge. Here\u2019s a fuller explanation of the DUP\u2019s position, from a party spokesman: We note the prime minister\u2019s latest statement and update on our EU exit negotiations. These publications need careful analysis. We will be taking appropriate advice, scrutinising the text line by line and forming our own judgment. We will measure this latest text against the Brady amendment, and the commitments made by the prime minister of 29 January. For his part, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, believes May\u2019s latest attempt satisfies that amendment. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, has said May\u2019s meeting with Juncker showed the Brexit negotiations were in disarray. Midnight flits to Strasbourg and desperate late night Commons statements underline the chaos into which Project Brexit has descended. It is time for ministers to admit that this brinkmanship is fruitless. They cannot negotiate a better deal than being in the EU, because the UK is stronger inside as a full member. The only way out of this crisis is to extend Article 50, and let the people choose between the withdrawal agreement and staying in the EU. The UK government has released the text of the motion for Tuesday\u2019s Commons vote, which asks MPs to approve five documents \u2013 the withdrawal agreement (WA) and political declaration agreed in November along with the three others finalised in Strasbourg today. The motion defines the first new document as \u201cthe legally binding joint instrument\u201d relating to the WA that \u201creduces the risk that the UK could be deliberately held in the Northern Ireland backstop indefinitely and commits the UK and EU to work to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020\u201d. The second new document is described as a \u201cunilateral declaration by the UK\u201d that sets out \u201cthe sovereign action the UK would take to provide assurance that the backstop would only be applied temporarily\u201d. The final document is a supplement to the political declaration \u201csetting out commitments by the UK and the EU to expedite the negotiation and bringing into force of their future relationship\u201d. Here\u2019s a full transcript of the prime minister\u2019s speech in Strasbourg this evening: Last November, after two years of hard-fought negotiations, I agreed a Brexit deal with the EU that I passionately believe delivers on the decision taken by the British people to leave the European Union. Over the last four months, I have made the case for that deal in Westminster and across the UK. I stand by what that deal achieves for my country. It means we regain control of our laws, by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. Regain control of our borders, by ending free movement. Regain control of our money, by ending vast annual payments to the EU. The end of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy for British farmers and fishermen. An independent trade policy. And the deal sets us on course for a good future relationship with our friends and allies in the EU. A close economic partnership that is good for business. Ongoing security co-operation to keep our peoples safe. The deal honours the referendum result and is good for both the UK and the EU. But there was a clear concern in Parliament over one issue in particular: the Northern Ireland backstop. Having an insurance policy to guarantee that there will never be a hard border in Northern Ireland is absolutely right \u2013 it honours the UK\u2019s solemn commitments in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. But if we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not the template for our future relationship. The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally binding changes were needed to set that right. Today we have agreed them. First, a joint instrument with comparable legal weight to the withdrawal agreement will guarantee that the EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely. If they do, it can be challenged through arbitration and if they are found to be in breach the UK can suspend the backstop. The joint instrument also gives a legal commitment that whatever replaces the backstop does not need to replicate it. And it entrenches in legally binding form the commitments made in the exchange of letters with Presidents Tusk and Juncker in January. Second, the UK and the EU have made a joint statement in relation to the political declaration. It sets out a number of commitments to enhance and expedite the process of negotiating and bringing into force the future relationship. And it makes a legal commitment that the UK and the EU will begin work immediately to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by the end of December 2020. There will be a specific negotiating track on alternative arrangements from the very start of the next phase of negotiations. It will consider facilitations and technologies - both those currently ready and emerging. The UK\u2019s position will be informed by the three domestic groups announced last week - for technical experts, MPs, and business and trade unions. Third, alongside the joint instrument on the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom government will make a unilateral declaration that, if the backstop comes into use and discussions on our future relationship break down so that there is no prospect of subsequent agreement, it is the position of the United Kingdom that there would be nothing to prevent the UK instigating measures that would ultimately disapply the backstop. Unilateral declarations are commonly used by states alongside the ratification of treaties. The attorney general will set out in legal analysis the meaning of the joint instrument and unilateral declaration to Parliament. Tomorrow, the House of Commons will debate the improved deal that these legal changes have created. I will speak in more detail about them when I open that debate. MPs were clear that legal changes were needed to the backstop. Today we have secured legal changes. Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people. Jean-Claude Juncker, in a letter addressed to the European Council president Donald Tusk, has said the EU\u2019s \u201chand must remain outstretched\u201d to the UK and that the bloc should \u201ccontinue to support the efforts of Prime Minister May to ensure an orderly withdrawal\u201d. While fully respecting the principles defined unanimously by the European Council we should \u2013 following the request of Prime Minister May \u2013 now give one last push to get the withdrawal agreement over the finishing line. He sent Tusk the text of the instrument relating to the withdrawal agreement and the joint statement supplementing the political declaration, agreed between him and May and endorsed by the European Commission. Juncker recommended that the leaders of the 27 remaining EU states give their endorsement to the documents at the European Council summit of 21-22 March in Brussels, subject to them having been approved by that time by the House of Commons. I believe it is high time to complete the withdrawal process in line with the wishes expressed by the government of the UK and to move on as swiftly as possible to the negotiation of our future partnership. The Commission is ready to start talks on the future partnership \u201cimmediately after the withdrawal agreement is signed\u201d, he said. Juncker added that the UK\u2019s withdrawal should be complete by the time of the European Parliament elections of 23-26 May. If it was not complete, the UK would be legally required to take part in the elections, he said. Here\u2019s the full text of Juncker\u2019s letter: The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has responded to May\u2019s statement, saying her \u201cnegotiations have failed\u201d. This evening\u2019s agreement with the European Commission does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised Parliament, and whipped her MPs to vote for. Since her Brexit deal was so overwhelmingly rejected, the prime minister has recklessly run down the clock, failed to effectively negotiate with the EU and refused to find common ground for a deal Parliament could support. That\u2019s why MPs must reject this deal tomorrow. Here\u2019s a little more from Juncker\u2019s statement just now. He told reporters: We left no stone unturned, our mind has always been open, our work always creative and our hand has always been outstretched. It is in this spirit that today the prime minister and I have agreed on a joint legally binding instrument relating to the withdrawal agreement. This instrument provides meaningful clarifications and legal guarantees on the nature of the backstop. The backstop is an insurance policy, nothing more, nothing less. The intention is for it not to be used, like in every insurance policy. Juncker said he had spoken to Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who he said had indicated he was \u201cprepared to back this approach in the interests of an overall deal\u201d. Referring to the backstop Juncker also said: If either side were to act in bad faith, there is a legal way for the other party to exit. The instrument which sets out these details has legal force while fully respecting the guidelines of the European Council. He added: \u201cIt compliments the withdrawal agreement without reopening it.\u201d May and Juncker are taking questions from journalists. Juncker reiterates that he believes there will be no new deal: This is it. That concludes the press conference. Theresa May says it is the UK\u2019s position that it believes it could unilaterally withdraw from the backstop if negotiations with the EU on the future relationship were to break down. May is now confirming what Lidington told MPs about what changes she says she has secured. Just as they were taking the stage, Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted this: Theresa May is speaking now. She says she has delivered a deal, made the case for it, and stands by what it achieves for the UK. Sitting next to Theresa May, Jean-Claude Juncker notes that this is a \u201csecond chance\u201d and says, perhaps rather pointedly, that there will be no third chance. Juncker says the day of the referendum was a \u201csad day\u201d but says \u201cwe must respect the decision of the British people\u201d. He says there have been difficulties with ratification on the UK\u2019s side and claims to have worked hard to help May get the deal past Parliament. Here\u2019s a live stream of the presser: Here come Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker for their joint press conference. Juncker opens... It seems the DUP and the ERG responses are still crystallising. While Steve Baker was dismissive, Jacob Rees-Mogg seemed more willing to keep an open mind: Here\u2019s a decent summary of what we\u2019ve had so far: Delivering his statement just now, Lidington further told MPs: The second document is a joint statement supplementing the political declaration, which outlines a number of commitments by the United Kingdom and the European Union to enhance and expedite the process of negotiating and bringing into force the future relationship \u2013 for example, it makes reference to the possibility of provisional application of such future agreement \u2013 and it sets out in detail how the specific negotiating track on alternative arrangements will operate. Negotiations are continuing and the government will provide an update to the House at the earliest opportunity should there be further changes. He concluded by saying: The House was clear on the need for legally-binding changes to the backstop. Today we have secured these changes. Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal and deliver on the instruction of the British people. Earlier in the evening, there were reports of optimism within Number 10 about tonight\u2019s developments. Within minutes of Lidington\u2019s statement to the Commons, they may be losing their gloss, somewhat: The DUP appears slightly less dismissive: Here\u2019s a little more detail on what the cabinet secretary, David Lidington, has told MPs about the negotiations in Strasbourg: We will be laying two new documents in the House: A joint, legally binding instrument on the withdrawal agreement and protocol on Northern Ireland; and a joint statement to supplement the political declaration. The first provides confirmation that the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely and that doing so would be an explicit breach of the legally-binding commitments that both sides have agreed. If \u2013 contrary to all expectations \u2013 the EU were to act with that intention, the UK could use this acceptance of what could constitute an explicit breach as the basis for a formal dispute, through independent arbitration, that such a breach had occurred \u2013 ultimately suspending the protocol if thew EU continued to breach its obligations. On top of this, the joint instrument also reflect the United Kingdom\u2019s and European Union\u2019s commitment to work to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020, setting out explicitly that these arrangements do not need to replicate the provisions of the backstop in any respect. Starmer is saying he does not believe the evening\u2019s developments would allow the attorney general to change his legal advice. Lidington had said the Cox would be publishing advice ahead of Tuesday\u2019s debate, but needed time to consider the new changes. The attorney general will publish his legal opinion. That will be available in good time before the debate. I think the house would expect the Attorney General to consider very carefully rather than rush an opinion out to meet the deadline for this statement this evening. Starmer closes by saying the Labour party will reject the deal and he believes the House of Commons will do the same. Starmer is saying nothing has changed as a result of this evening\u2019s negotiations, claiming that it simply restates the joint letter from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker to Theresa May, which was sent in January. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, is now responding. He opens with a joke \u2013 saying he isn\u2019t complaining about not have advance notice of the deal, since Lidington appears not to have had such. Lidington tells MPs the \u201cimproved deal\u201d will be put before them at the meaningful vote tomorrow \u2013 and will be the \u201conly deal\u201d on offer. Lidington says the government has \u201csecured legally binding changes that strengthen and improve the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration\u201d. He says the joint instrument prevents the EU from trapping the UK in the backstop indefinitely and will allow the UK to raise a grievance if it feels it is. Lidington opens by apologising for not giving opposition MPs an advance copy of the statement, saying that is because the talks are still going on. David Lidington is on his feet in the Commons. Ministers on Whitehall are tight-lipped this evening. We may, however, be about to get the news: The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has an interesting update from this evening\u2019s cabinet discussions: But, as the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar points out, it\u2019s not solely about the reactions of the ERG and the DUP: As we\u2019ve noted, May is expected to give her statement in Strasbourg soon. Back in Westminster, David Lidington \u2013 who briefed the cabinet earlier this evening \u2013 will address the Commons. This from the Conservative MP, Vicky Ford: We\u2019ll bring you all the details from that statement as it\u2019s delivered. The package negotiated by Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker is expected to be in three parts: A joint interpretative instrument \u2013 a legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement. It will give legal force to a letter from Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council, given to May in January which stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered or get out of it as swiftly as possible, if it was. A unilateral statement from the UK. That is likely to seek to explain the British position that, if the backstop was to become permanent and talks were going nowhere on an alternative, the UK would seek to exit the arrangement. Additional language in the political declaration to emphasise the urgency on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. It is hoped this will be enough to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, to change his initial legal advice that the backstop could be in place indefinitely. The problem: Very, very little of this is significantly new. The most substantive element is the joint interpretative instrument. But it falls well short of Cox\u2019s demands over the last week for what amounted to a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop. While we wait for Theresa May\u2019s statement in Strasbourg, here\u2019s a take on Brexit from the former Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd: I\u2019m struck, as the British parliament moves towards the endgame on Brexit, with the number of times Australia, Canada, New Zealand and India have been advanced by the Brexiteers in the public debate as magical alternatives to Britain\u2019s current trade and investment relationship with the European Union. This is the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments that have emerged from the Land of Hope and Glory set now masquerading as the authentic standard-bearers of British patriotism. It\u2019s utter bollocks. While nothing is being confirmed, there are whispers that some progress has been made in the talks \u2013 and the signs of movement in both Dublin and London would tend to support those rumours. And there are reports that some progress has been made: Journalists are now assembling in the European Parliament\u2019s press conference room. Across the other side of this vast building in Strasbourg, in the Winston Churchill building, Jean-Claude Juncker and Theresa May are discussing the latest on the Brexit talks. UK officials are milling around in the press conference room but nothing is being confirmed \u2013 presumably to avoid reports that a press conference was cancelled in the event that things do not go well with the commission president. Just before May arrived at the parliament, Juncker was seen swaying his hips from side to side. He has form for teasing the PM over her dance routine at the Tory party conference \u2013 but let\u2019s be generous and say he was keeping his back loose. Juncker suffers from sciatica. There were smiles in Strasbourg as Theresa May arrived, to be met by Jean-Claude Juncker, earlier this evening. Meanwhile, in Westminster: As May holds talks in Strasbourg, it seems things are moving in both Westminster and Dublin: Press Association reports that several cabinet ministers left Government Buildings in Dublin about 20 minutes ago, though none commented as they left. A spokeswoman for the Irish government said the meeting had been adjourned and would reconvene later tonight. The Taoiseach spoke to President Juncker this evening. The cabinet met to discuss developments across the day. Cabinet meeting adjourned just after 8.30pm and will resume again later this evening. Discussions are continuing. May was greeted in Strasbourg by Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier, captured on camera here by RT\u00c9 News\u2019 Paul Cunningham: The prime minister has arrived in Strasbourg, where she is expected to make a unilateral statement on the backstop, according to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg and Sky News\u2019 Faisal Islam: Here\u2019s a little more detail on tonight\u2019s meeting convened by the Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson: Those details from Dan Sabbagh, as well as journalists from the Times, the BBC, Politics Home and ITV News. In Westminster, the Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley has issued a fresh apology for her \u201cdeeply insensitive\u201d comments on state killings during the Troubles. Raising a point of order, she said: In response to an oral question on 6 March, I made inaccurate comments regarding the actions of soldiers during the Troubles. It is right that I address these remarks to the House today and correct the record. What I said was wrong, it was deeply insensitive to the families who lost loved ones in incidents involving the security forces. I have apologised unreservedly for the offence and hurt that my words caused. Today, I repeat that apology; both to the families and to members of this House. The language that I used was wrong. Bradley said she was \u201cgrateful\u201d to affected families for giving her the opportunity to apologise in person last week and added that any evidence of wrongdoing should be pursued \u201cwithout fear or favour, whoever the perpetrators might be\u201d. My position and the position of this government is clear, we believe fundamentally in the rule of law. That is a principle that underpins our approach to dealing with legacy issues and it\u2019s one from which I will not depart. That is why I launched the public consultation on addressing the legacy of the Troubles. The shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Tony Lloyd, suggested Bradley should make a fuller statement to the House, adding: One of the prime necessities for anybody in the role she has is that they have the confidence not simply of the political parties but of the broader civil society in Northern Ireland, in particular, the victims\u2019 families because of the pain that they\u2019ve gone through for so many years. He said a justice process for these families has yet to be delivered, before saying Bradley had \u201clost the confidence\u201d of some political parties and the families. Lloyd added: That makes her own position a very difficult one. I think she does have to think about what that means in terms of not simply her credibility but her capacity to do the job. An emergency meeting of Irish cabinet ministers has been called for 7pm, a government source has confirmed to the Press Association. The Irish premier Leo Varadkar, who was due to begin his journey to America for St Patrick\u2019s Day, returned from Dublin airport and is currently in government buildings for the cabinet briefing. And Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, has confirmed he will meet with Theresa May this evening: Theresa May will make an 11th-hour dash to meet EU leaders in Strasbourg as the government insisted the meaningful vote on her Brexit deal would go ahead on Tuesday as planned. A no-deal Brexit would cost Japanese carmakers in Britain more than $1bn a year if 10% tariffs were imposed on trade between the UK and EU, new analysis suggests. The government has released a list of \u201ccritical goods\u201d which could be carried on additional ferry sailings chartered in the case of a no-deal Brexit. As the Press Association reports, on the list are medicines for humans and animals, vaccines, infant milk formula, organs for transplants and chemicals for the energy industry. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, issued contracts totalling \u00a3107m in December for ferry firms to run additional services to take the pressure off the Dover-Calais route if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29. The mother of Shamima Begum has written to the Home Office to urge the department to reconsider its decision to strip the teenage Isis bride of her British citizenship as an \u201cact of mercy\u201d. Harrogate is to pilot a new phase of the government\u2019s controversial universal credit (UC) welfare shake-up, the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd has said. As the Press Association reports, Rudd told MPs Harrogate was chosen for the major trial of \u201cmanaged migration\u201d as it has a diverse spread of claimants. Managed migration sees a wider range of claimants moved over to the UC system, not just people with changes to their circumstances, or those making new claims. Giving evidence to the work and pensions committee, Rudd said that revised regulations concerning the pilot initiative would be brought before parliament by July. About 70 Labour MPs and peers have attended a meeting convened by Tom Watson, the deputy leader, for parliamentarians from Labour\u2019s social democratic wing. My colleague Dan Sabbagh has more details. The tax-free personal allowance, which rises to \u00a312,500 in April, should be scrapped and replaced with a flat payment of \u00a348 a week for every adult, according to radical proposals welcomed by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. This is from my colleague Daniel Boffey. From Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam This is from Margaritis Schinas, the European commission\u2019s spokesman. And this is what Iain Duncan Smith said on BBC News when asked if thought the deal being agreed would persuade him to vote for the withdrawal agreement. He replied: Well, I\u2019m certainly going to keep a completely open mind, as all my colleagues are. We want to say a) what it is and then b) the legalities of that. Is it, by any means, good enough for [Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general] to change his advice, which was quite tough last time. He said basically the agreement would leave us trapped in a backstop, which would mean they would have complete negotiating power over us, which is not good. So if that changes, and he\u2019s able to say that\u2019s differently, and the Malthouse arrangements are part of a package signed up to by the EU - not just discussed - and with an end date, then that process is moving in the right direction. This is what Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter and former party leader told BBC News about what he had learnt after his meeting with Julian Smith, the chief whip. I think they are reaching a point where they are about to have some kind of agreement - I\u2019m speculating, but that\u2019s my indication - and I think there will be a statement tonight at around about 9 o\u2019clock tonight, one in Strasbourg and I think one here in the House of Commons. Then they will lay the motion, as amended. And that will be voted upon tomorrow. But there needs to be time to look at the legalities of this ... It sounds like they think that they\u2019ve got something. That\u2019s what the statement is going to be about tonight. Theresa May is expected to arrive in Strasbourg around 9pm local time, or 8pm UK times. She has just left, according to a Number 10 source. Downing Street are stressing that her decision to go does not mean that there will definitely be a deal. But it does mean there is a basis \u201cfor further face-to-face discussion\u201d, a source said. Theresa May is going to Strasbourg tonight, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Europe editor, Alberto Nardelli. During the Brexit UQ Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn did not get a proper answer when he asked if the motion being voted on tomorrow would meet the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act. (See 3.56pm.) Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam has more on what the act says here. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. This is from the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. The Brexit committee hearing with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has now been rescheduled for 11.15am tomorrow. Bercow says, if possible, he will ensure that the Stephen Barclay statement to MPs comes before 10pm. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper rises to make her own point of order. She says the government is holding a month-long consultation at the moment on door closures on the Docklands Light Railway. Isn\u2019t it outrageous that the government is giving more time for a consultation on this than for its Brexit plan? Bercow says he agrees that MPs must not be \u201cmessed around\u201d. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, rises to make his own point of order. He asks Bercow to confirm that the statement to MPs coming from Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, later won\u2019t be immediately after the first two statements. It could be much later, he says. Bercow says that is correct. The Barclay statement won\u2019t necessarily be at the end of the parliamentary day, he says. But it could be quite late in the evening. Stephen Barclay\u2019s Brexit statement to MPs is likely to come quite late this evening, MPs told. John Bercow, the speaker, is now responding to points of order. In response to a question about whether MPs will take time to table amendments if the government tables its motion late tonight, he says there will be time tomorrow. He suggests, if necessary, the main debate could be delayed to ensure that MPs to get time to look at the motion properly and table manuscript amendments. Bercow hints that tomorrow\u2019s debate could be delayed to allow MPs extra time to table amendments. Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam says Downing Street will have to decide within the next hour whether or not Theresa May heads for Strasbourg. Back in the Commons, Labour\u2019s Kevin Brennan says it is customary on this occasion to says people have the monkey, not the organ-grinder. But on this occasion MPs have not even got the monkey, he says. And they have not even got the codpiece, he says. At Westminster Abbey Theresa May was reading a passage from the Bible about the importance of solidarity and working together. It was chosen to refer to the Commonwealth, but could equally well apply to the EU. Perhaps someone at the abbey chose it to make a point about Brexit. For the record, here is the reading in full (from the King James version - which may or may not have been the one May was using at Commonwealth Day Service). For the body is not one member, but many. If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. And if they were all one member, where were the body? But now are they many members, yet but one body. And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked. That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. Anna Soubry, the Independent Group MP, asks how MPs will be table to table amendments to the motion if it only gets tabled at close of play tonight, at 10.30pm. Walker says the government wants to publish the motion as soon as possible. John Bercow, the speaker, says Soubry is right to say 10.30pm is the deadline for the government to table a motion for publication on the order paper tomorrow. He says, given the concerns MPs have about the time available to table amendments, he can assure them that if necessary he will accept manuscript amendments (ie, amendments tabled by hand on the day, rather than those tabled in advance and printed on the order paper). These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the ERG, asks Walker if he agrees that it is \u201cincongruous\u201d that it is harder to leave the backstop than the EU. Walker says Rees-Mogg makes an interesting point. The Tory Brexiter Mark Francois ask when MPs will see the text of the government\u2019s motion for tomorrow - later today, or just when it appears on the order paper overnight? Walker says the government will publish it as soon as possible. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, asks why the Irish foreign minister said Theresa May would be travelling to Strasbourg later for Brexit talks. And, if there is an agreement, will the meaningful vote tomorrow be enough to approve the withdrawal agreement under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act? Walker says Benn is asking questions he cannot answer. But he says Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has agreed to appear before the Brexit committee tomorrow to answer questions. Barclay was due to appear before the committee this afternoon, but Walker\u2019s response implies this session has been postponed. Here is an extract from Corbyn\u2019s opening statement. This is a government in chaos, with a country in chaos because of this mess ... This chaos cannot go on much longer. The fate of people\u2019s workplaces and jobs and businesses is at stake the longer this government fails to negotiate and simply dither after dither after dither, and then further delay. It is time for answers. Walker is responding to Corbyn. He says the meaningful vote will take place tomorrow. He says Corbyn himself called for article 50 to be triggered immediately after the referendum. The attorney general\u2019s advice before the Commons sits tomorrow (which will be at 11.30am.) Corbyn says the government is in chaos. He says, when he left his office, he did not know who would be replying to his UQ. We find out from journalists, or the Irish government, about the PM travelling to Strasbourg - or not travelling to Strasbourg. He says the PM promised votes this week. As a matter of trust, they must go ahead. Time and time again she has delayed, he says. He says she is running down the clock. He says the PM\u2019s deal was a bad deal in December, a bad deal in January, when it was defeated, and it remains a bad deal today. He says these shambolic negotiations are having a real effect. Jobs are being lost, and workplaces are closing, he says. He says firms are having to spend millions preparing for a no-deal Brexit MPs have already rejected. What changes has the government got? When will the attorney general publish his advice? Given May voted for the Brady amendment, demanding changes, will she vote against her own deal if there are no changes? Is May willing to compromise? Corbyn says this chaos cannot go on much longer. It is time for answers. Jeremy Corbyn reads out his urgent question. He stresses the words \u201cprime minister\u201d when he says he is asking the PM about progress made in the Brexit talks. Robin Walker, the Brexit minister, says negotiations are ongoing \u201cand at a critical stage\u201d. He says discussions are still going on. The government will make a statement later today, and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, will publish a statement with his updated legal advice. He says he cannot comment on ongoing negotiations. But the government will tell MPs when it can. And the meaningful vote will take place tomorrow. He says MPs have the chance tomorrow to provide certainty, by voting for May\u2019s deal. Robin Walker is responding to Jeremy Corbyn. (See 3.36pm.) HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh thinks the government could be putting up the junior Brexit minister Robin Walker to respond to Jeremy Corbyn. Walker is not even a minister of state (a senior junior minister, so to speak). He is a parliamentary under secretary - a proper junior minister. If he is replying to Corbyn, that will be quite a snub. And here is Theresa May arriving at Westminster Abbey for the Commonwealth Day Service. Jeremy Corbyn won\u2019t be getting Theresa May for his UQ. the BBC reports. This is from the Financial Times\u2019 Mehreen Khan. The Labour party still does not know who will be responding to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s UQ at 3.30pm. On the World at One Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter and former party leader, claimed that the EU would be willing to change its stance on the backstop. He said: The words [in the Brady amendment], which the EU is beginning to move on, which is \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, which would change the backstop - that\u2019s the Malthouse stuff - that\u2019s now being discussed. So it\u2019s very hopeful that they will come to the conclusion they have to change this, and then they change it. In which case, the deal will go through. A question from a reader. The answer is yes. The parliamentary votes would not count. An article 50 extension has to be agreed by all EU states, and parliament cannot tell them what to do. The only alternative would be for the PM to revoke article 50, which can be done unilaterally. But a) it is impossible to imagine May ever doing this, b) there is a strong legal argument for saying the PM would need parliamentary approval, and c) a UK decision to revoke would not be acceptable to the EU if it were just a delaying tactic, EU law suggests. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. The Irish government are getting ahead of themselves in saying Theresa May will definitely be going to Strasbourg later, a Number 10 source has told my colleague Jessica Elgot. In an interview with Radio 5 Live Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter and vice chair of the European Research Group, said that, even though MPs voted for the Brady amendment saying the backstop should be \u201creplaced\u201d, Theresa May never asked for this in her talks with the EU. He told 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett: What that [amendment] said was that they should \u2018replace\u2019 - that was the key word - the whole of the backstop. And the House of Commons voted for that. Almost the entire Conservative party voted for that, including almost the entire ERG. And the government begged us \u2013 and I use the word deliberately - to vote for the Brady amendment. That then gave the prime minister a mandate to go to Brussels and say, look, I have the support of the House of Commons to ask you to remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement. We now know they never asked. The government never formally requested that the EU should replace it. Even though they had a mandate from parliament. Asked how he could be sure that May did not ask the EU to replace, he said: We know from sources on the other side of the channel that they never asked \u2026. We know from sources within the commission that she didn\u2019t. And asked why he thought May did not press the EU on this, Francois said: Because she didn\u2019t believe in it. She\u2019s never wanted to do it. She is stuck to plan A. She is absolutely wedded to her original withdrawal agreement. Francois also argued that this showed there would be no point in MPs voting for a motion backing May\u2019s deal, conditional on further changes to it being made. (See (See 9.13am and 11.44am). He explained: What is the point of us voting for something conditional, when we already did [so] in Brady, but then the government, because the remainers in the cabinet, and senior civil servants like Olly Robbins, didn\u2019t agree with that, made sure that we never asked the EU the question in the first place. Jeremy Corbyn says he wants Theresa May to respond to his urgent question personally. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has an interesting take on the John McDonnell speech. (See 1.24pm.) This is what Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, said earlier about Theresa May going to Strasbourg for Brexit talks later. (See 1.35pm.) The negotiations are ongoing. Many had hoped we would have clarity at this stage, particularly in advance of the vote tomorrow. We don\u2019t yet. The British prime minister is travelling to Strasbourg this evening, I understand, to try to finalise an agreement, if that is possible, to be able to put that to a meaningful vote in Westminster tomorrow. Downing Street has refused to confirm that, saying only: \u201cWe have not confirmed anything at this stage.\u201d Coveney also said the Irish government remained opposed to changing the withdrawal text. Asked about possible concessions, he said: I don\u2019t think it is helpful to go into the detail of what the obstacles are to getting agreement but there are some. But our approach remains the same, consistent. We are very clear that the withdrawal agreement can\u2019t change in terms of text. But we also want to be helpful in terms of providing the clarity and reassurance that is needed in Westminster that the backstop is intended to be temporary. Nobody is looking to trap anybody anywhere permanently, but the backstop needs to be there and it needs to be robust. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chair of the European Research Group, thinks the Irish government making announcements on behalf of London (see 1.35pm) could be a foretaste of things to come. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming. This is from the Irish Times\u2019 Denis Staunton. But the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, says a May/Juncker meeting is not yet confirmed. Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, has said that Theresa May is flying to Strasbourg tonight to try to finalise a Brexit agreement, the Irish Independent\u2019s Kevin Doyle reports. I\u2019ve been to see Dominic Raab deliver what we are obliged to call a \u201cwide-ranging\u201d speech in London \u2013 that is, one signalling leadership intentions. As is often the case for Conservative MP seeking to expand their appeal, it was about social mobility. Of course, with Raab being the former Brexit secretary and one of the likely standard-bearers for the Brexit wing of the party in a fight to succeed Theresa May, the subsequent Q&amp;A saw lots of Brexit questions. Raab more or less dodged them all, declining to say whether May should pursue no-deal or indeed if she should go. He did say May should, on her Brexit plan, seek to \u201cget the deal into the kind of shape needed to get through the Commons\u201d - ie amend the Irish backstop. He did not suggest how to get the EU to agree to this. He also dismissed the warnings from Michael Gove that voting against May\u2019s plan tomorrow could put departure in peril: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable to say it\u2019s either this deal or no Brexit.\u201d However, Raab did more or less concede he had an eye on Number 10. Asked if he wanted to be PM, he replied: \u201cNever say never.\u201d The actual speech, hosted by newish right-leaning thinktank Onward inside the hugely flash offices of PR firm Maitland in St Pancras, was fairly low-key, beginning with Raab\u2019s personal backstory as the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee. Amid the standard social mobility metaphors \u2013 at one point Raab talked about \u201csmashing through glass ceilings and providing ladders of opportunity\u201d \u2013 there were some specific, such as paying more to teachers in deprived schools, and providing non-graduate routes into professions such as law and accountancy. Is it all enough to make Raab a contender when the time comes? Who knows. But is is a signal of intent. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has accused Philip Hammond, the chancellor, of \u201ccowardice\u201d because he believes Hammond could have done more to prevent Brexit damaging the economy. In a speech at Bloomberg in London, ahead of the spring statement on Wednesday, McDonnell said: The position of the chancellor of the exchequer comes with a responsibility which I think Philip Hammond actually has abdicated in his current role. If Brexit ends up leading to even half of what the government\u2019s own forecasts suggest could happen, I think history will judge harshly the few who could have prevented and averted this potential disaster and did so little. McDonnell said the \u201ceffects of their complicity\u201d were already there, including the \u201cslowest growth in six years, investment falling, manufacturing in recession, a trade deficit of over \u00a310bn last quarter, growth forecasts being revised downwards by the Bank of England and others ... firms announcing their intentions to leave the UK\u201d. He went on: I think all this was avoidable were it not for the political weakness and yes, these are strong words, the cowardice of the chancellor of the exchequer. Failure to stand up for our economy and failure to stand up for the interests of our country. And whatever happens with Brexit, that\u2019s damage to people\u2019s lives that cannot be undone. McDonnell was particularly critical of Hammond for not ruling out a no-deal Brexit. He explained: We\u2019re on the verge of a no-deal Brexit which could decimate British industry and bring about \u2013 in the words of the Bank of England \u2013 a worse economic catastrophe than the financial crisis ten years ago. Philip Hammond has repeatedly spoken about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. But here we are, a couple of weeks away from one, and all he has to show for his high office is words. Can you imagine Rab Butler, Nigel Lawson or Ken Clarke allowing their Cabinet colleagues to best them in this way? Let alone Hugh Gaitskell, Denis Healey or Gordon Brown? (Hammond would argue that it was precisely because he and other cabinet colleagues have been saying that a no-deal Brexit would be unacceptable, Theresa May agreed to give MPs a vote this week on ruling one out if her deal gets defeated. Hammond and the Treasury have also been arguing in government for a Brexit that does least damage to trade, achieving a partial success when the cabinet backed the \u201cChequers plan\u201d that was unacceptable to Brexiters like David Davis and Boris Johnson.) Theresa May could be heading for Strasbourg later for a meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, the BBC reports. After the two urgent questions in the Commons (see 12.33pm), we are going to have three statements. The one from Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will come last. It would be surprising if starts before 6.30pm, and it could be quite a bit later. What we don\u2019t know yet is whether the government will announce its plans for the motion for tomorrow\u2019s Brexit debate in the UQ at 3.30pm, in the Barclay statement later, or at some other point entirely. A statement from a secretary of state (Barclay) would normally come before a statement from a minister of state (Burt), but the Barclay statement may have been held back because ministers won\u2019t be sure what is happening until later this evening. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has said that, if the UK does get an article 50 extension, it must be for a purpose. Speaking at the launch of the Irish government\u2019s national childcare scheme, he said: If there is going to be an extension, it has to be an extension with a purpose. Nobody across the European Union wants to see a rolling cliff edge where tough decisions just get put off until the end of April, then to the end of May and then maybe till the end of July. Responding to reports that Theresa May might offer MPs a vote on a motion backing the deal subject to further assurances on the backstop being provided (see 9.13am and 11.44am), Varadkar said this would be a mistake. He told reporters: I do hear some suggestion that the votes may be called off in favour of a new vote as a result of which the House of Commons would tell the European Union what they want. That really misses the point. We\u2019re two-and-a-half years if not nearly three years now since the referendum. It is far too late for the United Kingdom to tell us what they want. The withdrawal agreement requires a compromise and this Withdrawal Agreement is already a compromise. Theresa May has had a further conversation with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, which finished recently, Downing Street has said. \u201cTalks continue,\u201d a spokesperson added. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, was not keen to discuss Brexit when he was doorstepped by ITV this morning. But Barnier was a bit more forthcoming when he spoke to AFP. He told the agency as he arrived for a meeting of EU ambassadors: We talked all weekend and now the discussions, the negotiations, are between the government in London and the parliament in London. Labour have tabled an urgent question to Theresa May, asking her to tell MPs what\u2019s happening on Brexit. The fact that Jeremy Corbyn is asking for May to come to the despatch box does not mean he will get her. The government will have to put up a minister to respond, but it could be Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, or David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister. This is from the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul, commending an argument made by James Kirkup, who runs the Social Market Foundation thinktank. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg agrees. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper has said she and Conservative MPs would attempt to force votes on an extension of article 50 on Thursday should the prime minister pull the votes, saying it would be a \u201cstraight-up lie\u201d to parliament if Theresa May changed her plans. In speech setting out the next steps should parliament vote for an extension, Cooper said May must come forward with a process for how the extension should work. The former shadow home secretary, who has been one of the key players in parliamentary moves to avoid no deal, said May should offer a series of indicative votes on the future relationship with Europe and a consultative process with business and trade unions, as well as a possible citizens\u2019 assembly. If the prime minister continued to prevaricate and attempt changes to the backstop, Cooper said she and others would attempt to force a new process. If [May] comes forward with a process on Thursday, then that would be a way forward ... but if she doesn\u2019t that is when we will be looking at possible amendments or other approaches ... to make sure you can get indicative votes. In her speech at the Centre for European Reform, Cooper said that it \u201cthe time to pivot not to dig in\u201d and that the risk of extension was that May would \u201cdo more of the same, running round in circles on the backstop and running down the clock.\u201d We have to use an extension and work out what kind of Brexit people want to see. We are going to have to start facing these choices this summer anyway. Let\u2019s decide before we finish article 50 rather than after. The PM should use [the A50 extension] to be bold and offer a series of indicative votes, then publish the government\u2019s draft mandate for the future so that can be amended by parliament. Cooper said that in order to grant an extension, the EU would need to see \u201ca sense of purpose\u201d and said May would need to \u201cestablish a timetable or structure before the European council\u201d which takes place on 21 March. Cooper said any final Brexit approach, which covered both exit and future relationship, may need \u201cpublic consent for it to endure\u201d which she said could be a general election or a referendum. However, Cooper said she was cautious of endorsing any referendum too quickly and said it was right that Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson had pulled their amendment to offer a referendum on May\u2019s deal, saying she could not endorse that deal. Here\u2019s a question from a reader. It is true that, technically, Conservative MPs have to wait until December before they can use the \u201c48 letters\u201d mechanism (letters from 15% of MPs to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee demanding a confidence vote) to try to force out the party leader. If a leader wins a vote of this kind, as May did on 12 December, no other confidence vote is allowed for another year. But, ultimately, at least in normal circumstances, any leader requires the confidence of his or her party, and if MPs were determined to force May out now they could. For example, there could be a mass cabinet walk-out. Or MPs could start refusing to vote for government business. (Of course, it did not work like this when Labour MPs tried to defenestrate Jeremy Corbyn in 2016, after the referendum. But Corbyn felt strong enough to stay put because he knew he had the support of the membership. The Conservative membership is much smaller, and it never chose May because she became party leader without the need for a ballot.) As a last resort Conservative MPs could also vote against the government in a confidence motion, on the assumption that another party leader might take over in the 14-day grace period before a no-confidence vote leads to a general election. The Commons order paper says Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will be giving evidence to the Brexit committee at 12.15pm. But the committee says that that is a mistake, and that the hearing is scheduled for 4pm. If Barclay does give a statement to the Commons, it will take place after the statement is over, the committee says. This is from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. This is a good illustration of how commitments given at the despatch box in the House of Commons can become binding, even if they do not have the force of law. I\u2019m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. It was not hugely enlightening - it sounds as though the key decision about what MPs will vote on tomorrow has yet to be decided, because some issues remain unresolved - but here are the main points anyway. Downing Street said a meaningful vote on Brexit will still take place tomorrow. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman advised reporters not to believe reports that the government has decided to offer MPs a vote on a motion backing Theresa May\u2019s deal subject to the UK getting further assurances on the backstop (see 9.13am), but he would not say what the motion will say. It will be published later today. Reporters came away with the impression that the PM has not yet decided what will happen. This is from my colleague Rowena Mason. The spokesman said that talks with the EU on a solution to the backstop were continuing. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is expected to give a statement to MPs today about the talks, the spokesman said. The spokesman confirmed that, if May loses the vote tomorrow, MPs will still get a vote on a no-deal Brexit, and then a vote on extending article 50. Originally the two votes were due on Wednesday and on Thursday. But the spokesman would not comment on claims that both might be held on Wednesday. If the vote is lost on Tuesday, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, will announce the details in a business statement. The spokesman would not rule out May holding a briefing for cabinet ministers on what has been decided later today. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper has been making the same point in her speech this morning, the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith reports. Cooper may have been remembering this exchange from last month. I\u2019m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. The Conservative MP Nick Boles, who has been leading efforts in the Commons to allow MPs to vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit, has posted a thread on Twitter saying Theresa May will have lost the confidence of the Commons if she goes back on the promises she made about this week\u2019s votes. It starts here. And here is the key tweet. Michael Gove, the environment secretary and the most prominent Brexiter left in cabinet, has written a long article for the Daily Mail urging MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s plan. Here are the main points. Gove rejects Brexiter claims that May\u2019s plan would turn the UK into a \u201cvassal state\u201d. He says: It is not the case that this deal makes us a colony or vassal state. How could it when it gives us total control over our borders and ends our automatic payments to the EU? Colonies, by definition, don\u2019t have control over their borders and they give up their natural resources to others. This deal means we have the absolute freedom to decide who comes into this country, and on what terms. It also allows us to decide what pan-European programmes, if any, we want to join in. As one of the leaders of the leave campaign, I know that two of the most resonant demands from voters were control of our borders and money. This deal delivers \u2014 completely and, as it happens, without compromise \u2014 on both. Gove does not say it, but one of the Tories who has been most vocal in claiming that May\u2019s deal would turn the UK into a \u201cvassal state\u201d has been Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, (eg, here), who along with Gove joint leader of the Vote Leave campaign. Gove says Brexit should be a compromise that acknowledges the concerns of those who voted remain. He says: Forty-eight per cent of the country voted to remain. Their voices need to be listened to, their hopes incorporated in our plan for the future. That doesn\u2019t mean giving in to the much smaller number who want to overturn the decision and frustrate Brexit. But it must mean that none of us leavers should try to make our perfect Brexit the enemy of the common good. Which is why I hope that everyone who believes in our democracy \u2014 in the importance of delivering Brexit and in the critical need to unite our country \u2014 will get behind the prime minister\u2019s deal this week. It is, of course, a compromise. But so many of the great British traditions and institutions I and many others value are the result of compromise. He says people did not vote for a no-deal Brexit in 2016. Some may say that ditching this deal will allow us to leave without any compromises. But we didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal. That wasn\u2019t the message of the campaign I helped lead. During that campaign, we said we should do a deal with the EU and be part of the network of free trade deals that covers all Europe, from Iceland to Turkey. Leaving without a deal on March 29 would not honour that commitment. It would undoubtedly cause economic turbulence. Almost everyone in this debate accepts that. In a clip for ITV, David Cameron, the former prime minister, has said that he supports Theresa May and that a no-deal Brexit would not be \u201ca good idea at all\u201d. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has gone into Number 10, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports. Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party\u2019s Westminster leader, has said Jeremy Corbyn and Labour are trying to give themselves \u201cwriggle room\u201d by suggesting a second EU referendum should only be held once there is a different, strengthened Brexit offer. John McDonnell, the shadow Chancellor, said on Sunday Labour would want to use any delay to article 50 to press for changes to Brexit rather than put Theresa May\u2019s deal forward against remain in a second EU referendum. The party\u2019s language on the terms of a referendum has subtly shifted, and now focuses on pushing for a \u201ccredible\u201d Brexit offer. A statement backed at Scottish Labour\u2019s conference in Dundee spoke of \u201can amendment [at Westminster] in favour of a public vote, between the option on the one hand of a credible leave deal and on the other hand remain\u201d. Blackford said he could understand why Labour wanted to postpone a Commons vote on staging that second referendum until later this month. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the majority to do so. I think we can get it but we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said. However Labour\u2019s new emphasis on a different Brexit offer was disingenuous, he said. He went on: What Jeremy is still trying to do is give himself wriggle room. I don\u2019t think that Jeremy, from a fundamental point of view, supports the people\u2019s vote. Corbyn wanted to \u201cstop short of getting into the position where you can have a people\u2019s vote,\u201d he said. The SNP are tabling a motion in the Commons later today calling for the powers to stage a second Scottish independence referendum if the UK leaves the EU. It is expected to be called by the Speaker, John Bercow. Even though it will be heavily defeated, Blackford said he thought it would be the first time the Commons has debated and voted on independence. He said the motion was laying the groundwork for a future political battles on independence. The next source of conflict between the UK and Scottish governments is likely to be formal demands in coming weeks from Nicola Sturgeon for the legal powers to stage a second independence referendum. We are making the case that Scotland has to have a say in this. In essence, we are all European citizens and Scotland voted to remain. We have to determine our own future if Westminster is determined to take us out of the EU. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg says, if Theresa May tried to cancel the votes on a no-deal Brexit and extending article 50 promised this week (promised in the event of her deal being rejected), there could be government resignations, or an attempt to remove her. In his London Playbook briefing, Politico Europe\u2019s Jack Blanchard has a good description of what it would mean if Theresa May changed her mind and asked MPs to vote tomorrow for a motion backing her deal, conditional on various new backstop assurances being agreed. This course of action would involve May breaking her solemn promise to parliament to hold the next meaningful vote by March 12, which even by her own somewhat flexible standards of truth-telling is pretty hard to imagine. There is a *slight* risk too that it would fuel criticism that the Brexiteers (and indeed the prime minister) have retreated into fantasy land, and prefer to vote on imaginary deals rather than the one Britain spent the past two years negotiating. The Sun\u2019s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, thinks Theresa May will end up pulling tomorrow\u2019s planned vote (a vote on an actual deal available to the UK) and replace it with an indicative vote (a vote on a hypothetical deal, so far rejected by the EU), as the Times splash suggested she might. (See 9.13am.) George Freeman, the Tory former minister and former chair of the prime minister\u2019s policy board, told the Today programme this morning that, although he was opposed to replacing Theresa May as party leader now, he would like that to happen after Brexit. He explained: I hope the prime minister can get withdrawal through and then I do think we need to choose a new leader for a new generation with a new vision of a conservatism that can make sense of Brexit and reinspire and reunite the nation. I hope we can do that having secured a sensible withdrawal agreement. A panicked change of leader now will solve nothing, we have got to get this through. I hope colleagues this week will recognise that: vote for the deal and then we can change. Freeman also said, if May\u2019s deal is rejected this week, the UK should adopt an Efta-style arrangement (European free trade association), like Norway\u2019s, that would keep the UK in the single market. Marcus Fysh, another Tory MP from the European Research Group (ERG), the hard Brexit caucus which represents up to 80 MPs in the party, told the Today programme this morning that he thought the EU might agree to revise its stance on the backstop if it saw the plans produced by his group showing how existing technology could avoid the need for a hard border in Ireland. He said: That really is all the evidence the EU should require. I think it would be worth reiterating that and actually putting the detail of the proposals which we worked up with the Government over recent weeks on the table so that the EU could be fully aware and discuss what it was exactly we were proposing. (The EU would say they already well aware of the plans, which are not exactly a secret and which have been promoted repeatedly by the ERG in recent weeks. The People Vote campaign published a critique of them which is available here.) We have not even got to Brexit day yet, but already the nation is running short of one much-used commodity - Westminster cliches. It used to be meaningful to talk about a \u201ccrunch week\u201d for the prime minister. But in Brexit there have been more crunch moments than you get in a walk through the Cornflake factory after a spillage, and so the jargon doesn\u2019t work any more. This week we are due to get the fifth big Brexit vote (after meaningful vote 1, MV1, and three next steps votes, NS1, NS2 and NS3). If if all proceeds as people were expecting at the end of last week, Theresa May will lose badly in the vote on Tuesday (MV2) and, after MPs rule out no-deal on Wednesday, they will vote to extend article 50 on Thursday. This would be a very significant development; the UK would no longer be leaving the EU, as planned, on Friday 29 March, and arguably May and her government would have lost control of the whole Brexit process. (I say arguably, because it is not as if her grasp on events as been 100% up to now anyway.) But this morning it is not even clear that MV2 will go ahead as expected. In the Times splash (paywall), Oliver Wright says May is under pressure to replace the vote on a motion backing her deal with a vote on a motion on an alternative plan that would be acceptable to parliament. Wright reports: In phone calls with Downing Street, leading Tories in the Commons gave warning that the prime minister could face another three-figure defeat if she went ahead with her plan. They have advised her to halt the vote and replace it with a motion setting out the kind of Brexit deal that would be acceptable to Tory MPs to keep the party together and put pressure on Brussels. \u201cAs it stands her deal is going to be defeated,\u201d a senior party source said. \u201cIt has been made clear to Downing Street that it would be eminently sensible to avoid that by proposing a motion that the party can support. Whether they listen or not is another matter\u201d ... Tory MPs have also urged Mrs May to come up with a Plan B should no deal be reached. \u201cAnything that avoids what looks like a massive defeat on Tuesday is worth considering,\u201d the former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell said. Under the plan, instead of holding a meaningful vote tomorrow, the government would lay a conditional motion setting out terms that might be acceptable to parliament to deal with the Irish backstop issue. Those who support the plan say it would send a message to the EU about the kind of deal that might get a parliamentary majority. Yesterday No 10 were insisting the vote would go ahead. But overnight they are saying the talks in Brussels are \u201cdeadlocked\u201d and the prospect of a last-minute U-turn is being taken seriously by Tory MPs. Mark Francois, vice chair of the European Research Group, which represents Conservatives pushing for a harder Brexit, told Sky News this morning that he thought there was a good chance that May would adopt the plan described by the Times. Asked if he thought May would pull the vote, he replied: I would say, as of now, this morning, I\u2019d say it\u2019s about 50/50 that they are going to pull the vote, despite everything they are saying, because why come back to the House of Commons to be thumped again? What does that achieve? Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, gives a speech to the Centre for European Reform on Brexit. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. Morning: Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, gives a speech on the opportunity society. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech ahead of the spring statement on Wednesday. 12.15pm: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Brexit committee. 4.15pm: Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, gives evidence to the work and pensions committee on the benefit freeze. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up, at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",
