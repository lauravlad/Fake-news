Nor was it elevated. But it was reliably entertaining, far more so than Wednesday\u2019s debate (on which our broken clock of a president had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1144056731653169152\">an accurate take</a>). And it did provide useful insight into the differences among the candidates and how the race might unfold.</p> \n<p>The two most obvious observations are: Joe Biden performed miserably, while Kamala Harris was in excellent form.</p> \n<p>The standout moment of the night was a jaw-dropping exchange between Harris and Biden on segregation and busing. Harris told Biden that she had been hurt by his nostalgic recollections of relationships with racist senators. She pointed out that he <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/04/joe-bidens-record-on-racial-integration-is-indefensible\">fought against busing in the 1970s</a>, an issue that was deeply personal for her, as she had been bused as a child. She spoke movingly about the pain caused by Biden\u2019s stances.</p> \n<p>It was an opportunity for Biden to show some thoughtfulness and contrition over one of the ugliest parts of his political history. He did not take that opportunity. Instead, he accused Harris of smearing him: \u201cIt\u2019s a mischaracterization of my position. I did not praise racists.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Biden has indeed praised racists \u2013 he <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/everybodys-chum\">gave a glowing eulogy</a> at the funeral of infamous segregationist Strom Thurmond.

      "bodyText": "The Democratic presidential field is currently so crowded with candidates that it is difficult for televised debates to be anything but a frenzied spectacle. Thursday night\u2019s debate in Miami wasn\u2019t exactly substantive. Nor was it elevated. But it was reliably entertaining, far more so than Wednesday\u2019s debate (on which our broken clock of a president had an accurate take). And it did provide useful insight into the differences among the candidates and how the race might unfold. The two most obvious observations are: Joe Biden performed miserably, while Kamala Harris was in excellent form. The standout moment of the night was a jaw-dropping exchange between Harris and Biden on segregation and busing. Harris told Biden that she had been hurt by his nostalgic recollections of relationships with racist senators. She pointed out that he fought against busing in the 1970s, an issue that was deeply personal for her, as she had been bused as a child. She spoke movingly about the pain caused by Biden\u2019s stances. It was an opportunity for Biden to show some thoughtfulness and contrition over one of the ugliest parts of his political history. He did not take that opportunity. Instead, he accused Harris of smearing him: \u201cIt\u2019s a mischaracterization of my position. I did not praise racists.\u201d But Biden has indeed praised racists \u2013 he gave a glowing eulogy at the funeral of infamous segregationist Strom Thurmond.
