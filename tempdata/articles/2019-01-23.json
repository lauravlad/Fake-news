      "bodyText": "Labor will aim for 40% of Australian honours to be awarded to women in its first year in office under a plan to \u201cmodernise\u201d the system by boosting underrepresented groups. Labor\u2019s shadow women\u2019s minister, Tanya Plibersek, announced the plan on Thursday, suggesting the gender imbalance in honours could be fixed by more female-friendly awards categories. Since 1975, women have received about 30% of all awards in the order of Australia\u2019s general division, a figure that is set to increase to 35% in the Australia Day honours for 2019. Plibersek said Australia should not \u201crest on our laurels\u201d despite the improvement, promising that Labor will set a 40% target by 2020 with the \u201cultimate aim\u201d of half of all awards going to women. \u201cWomen contribute as much as men, and our honours and awards should properly reflect that,\u201d she said. Plibersek blamed the prevalence of male-dominated professions in award categories for the over-representation of men. She noted there are standalone categories for building and construction, engineering, mining, and primary industry, while the female-dominated profession of nursing is subsumed into the broader category of medicine. In last June\u2019s Queen\u2019s birthday honours, male recipients outnumbered female recipients in almost 90% of categories. No women received awards in the categories of dentistry, IT, architecture, industrial relations, surveying and mapping, transport or veterinary science. \u201cLabor will make the award categories more representative to broaden the types of contributions that are recognised, including in traditionally female-dominated industries,\u201d Plibersek said. Women currently make up only 30% of nominees, which Labor will address through consultation with the states and territories, governor general and women\u2019s groups to boost the number of nominations of women. The policy does not contain targets for other underrepresented groups, but Plibersek said Labor will \u201cbetter recognise\u201d the contribution of First Nations people, culturally diverse, or Australians living with a disability. The award nomination form would be changed to ask if a nominee comes from these groups, which will help \u201cbetter monitor progress\u201d, Plibersek said.",

A decision on whether to resume the search would be made early on Thursday, police said.

He said: \u201cI\u2019m here on a plane that looks like it\u2019s about to fall apart, and I\u2019m going to Cardiff \u2026 If in an hour and a half you have no news from me, I don\u2019t know if they are going to send someone to look for me because they cannot find me, but you know \u2026 Dad, how scared am I!\u201d</p> \n<p>Sala\u2019s former girlfriend Berenice Schkair, 27, wrote on social media: \u201cI want to wake up and all of this to be a lie. Please investigate because I cannot believe this accident.\u201d In a separate post, which was later deleted, Buenos Aires-born Schkair wrote: \u201cInvestigate the football mafia, because I don\u2019t believe this was an accident.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3c2e9149-48a9-4606-a66e-5618ecbd68fe\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zaN1O_VpKmI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ibbotson is an experienced flyer and a member of the British Parachute Association (BPA), from the small town of Crowle near Scunthorpe.</p> \n<p>Debra Middleton, the mayor of Crowle and Ealand, said Ibbotson was \u201cvery well known and very well liked\u201d and that residents were hoping desperately for a positive outcome. \u201cWe all really do feel for his family. Everybody\u2019s listening to the news and hoping everything\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Humberside police said: \u201cWe can confirm that north Lincolnshire man David Ibbotson is believed to be the pilot of the light aircraft that went missing near Guernsey. Specially trained officers are supporting Mr Ibbotson\u2019s family, who have asked for privacy at this difficult time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Guernsey police had said on Wednesday morning that rescuers were working on four possibilities:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Sala and Ibbotson landed elsewhere but have not made contact.</p></li> \n <li><p>They landed on water and have been picked up by a passing ship but have not made contact.</p></li> \n <li><p>They landed on water and made it into a life raft police know was onboard.</p></li> \n <li><p>The aircraft broke up on contact with the water, leaving them in the sea.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The police said the search was focusing on the life raft option.</p> \n<p>Capt David Barker, the Guernsey harbourmaster, leading the operation, said there was still a chance that the pair could be alive if they had made it into a life raft. \u201cNobody here, including me, is giving up,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>John Fitzgerald, the Channel Islands Air Search chief officer, said: \u201cWe\u2019re out there looking for something you don\u2019t expect to see, whether it\u2019s a whole aircraft, a life raft or bits of whatever. We have seen lots of things in the water, but that\u2019s not to say they\u2019re from the plane. They could be from the ship, from the land, anywhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fitzgerald suggested it was unlikely the pair would survive for days even if they were in a raft. \u201cThe sea is 8-9C. That takes your core temperature away very quickly. Unless you are in a survival suit and really know how to look after yourself, you will have severe issues.\u201d Privately, others directly involved in the rescue said there was very little hope. </p> \n<p>The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the plane was unlikely to have been fitted with a flight recorder, or black box. A vital tool for crash investigators, black boxes are mandatory on airliners and business jets, but not on light aircraft such as the Piper PA-46 Malibu that Sala was travelling in.</p> \n<p>The plane took off at 7.15pm on Monday and was flying at an altitude of 5,000ft (1,500 metres). On passing Guernsey, it \u201crequested descent\u201d, but Jersey air traffic control lost contact with it while it was at 2,300ft.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b6f698ae-4a57-48e4-861a-7b6896573a77\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JBRtNTP3pZo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Cardiff City said Sala had arranged the flight himself. The club chairman, Mehmet Dalman, told BBC Radio Wales: \u201cWe spoke to the player and asked him if he wanted us to make arrangements for his flight, which would have been commercial. He declined and made his own arrangements.\u201d It is believed that a football agent may have helped him arrange the flight. </p> \n<p>Guernsey police said: \u201cAfter an intensive search using multiple aircraft and one lifeboat over the last nine hours, we have found no trace of the missing plane. With the light now fading, the search will be suspended for the night. A decision about whether to recommence will be taken early tomorrow morning.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a statement, Sala\u2019s agent, Mark McKay, expressed his sadness at the news. \u201cI knew Emiliano well,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a wonderful person and I count myself fortunate to have known him.\u201d He made it clear that neither he nor anyone in his family owned the aircraft.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rescuers fear that there is little hope of finding the footballer Emiliano Sala and an experienced pilot alive after their light aircraft went missing over the Channel Islands. The search for the new Cardiff City striker Sala and the pilot, who has been named as Dave Ibbotson from Lincolnshire, was postponed as darkness fell on Guernsey on Wednesday. A decision on whether to resume the search would be made early on Thursday, police said. It is understood that a French navy vessel had been directed to the area to assist. Earlier on Wednesday, Guernsey police had raised hopes by saying searchers were focusing on the possibility that the pair had made it into a life raft. But some of those involved in the rescue said that even if this was the case, there was little chance they would have survived since Monday night in cold, choppy conditions. Sala, 28, and Ibbotson, 59, have been missing since their plane disappeared from radar over the Channel as the footballer was being flown to Cardiff having been sold to the Welsh club by Nantes for \u00a313m. The search has focused on a 280 sq mile area north of Guernsey that is close to shipping lanes and dotted with reefs. Sala, who is Argentinian, is believed to have sent a voicemail message to his father saying he was frightened that the plane was about to break up. He said: \u201cI\u2019m here on a plane that looks like it\u2019s about to fall apart, and I\u2019m going to Cardiff \u2026 If in an hour and a half you have no news from me, I don\u2019t know if they are going to send someone to look for me because they cannot find me, but you know \u2026 Dad, how scared am I!\u201d Sala\u2019s former girlfriend Berenice Schkair, 27, wrote on social media: \u201cI want to wake up and all of this to be a lie. Please investigate because I cannot believe this accident.\u201d In a separate post, which was later deleted, Buenos Aires-born Schkair wrote: \u201cInvestigate the football mafia, because I don\u2019t believe this was an accident.\u201d Ibbotson is an experienced flyer and a member of the British Parachute Association (BPA), from the small town of Crowle near Scunthorpe. Debra Middleton, the mayor of Crowle and Ealand, said Ibbotson was \u201cvery well known and very well liked\u201d and that residents were hoping desperately for a positive outcome. \u201cWe all really do feel for his family. Everybody\u2019s listening to the news and hoping everything\u2019s OK.\u201d Humberside police said: \u201cWe can confirm that north Lincolnshire man David Ibbotson is believed to be the pilot of the light aircraft that went missing near Guernsey. Specially trained officers are supporting Mr Ibbotson\u2019s family, who have asked for privacy at this difficult time.\u201d Guernsey police had said on Wednesday morning that rescuers were working on four possibilities: Sala and Ibbotson landed elsewhere but have not made contact. They landed on water and have been picked up by a passing ship but have not made contact. They landed on water and made it into a life raft police know was onboard. The aircraft broke up on contact with the water, leaving them in the sea. The police said the search was focusing on the life raft option. Capt David Barker, the Guernsey harbourmaster, leading the operation, said there was still a chance that the pair could be alive if they had made it into a life raft. \u201cNobody here, including me, is giving up,\u201d he said. John Fitzgerald, the Channel Islands Air Search chief officer, said: \u201cWe\u2019re out there looking for something you don\u2019t expect to see, whether it\u2019s a whole aircraft, a life raft or bits of whatever. We have seen lots of things in the water, but that\u2019s not to say they\u2019re from the plane. They could be from the ship, from the land, anywhere.\u201d Fitzgerald suggested it was unlikely the pair would survive for days even if they were in a raft. \u201cThe sea is 8-9C. That takes your core temperature away very quickly. Unless you are in a survival suit and really know how to look after yourself, you will have severe issues.\u201d Privately, others directly involved in the rescue said there was very little hope. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the plane was unlikely to have been fitted with a flight recorder, or black box. A vital tool for crash investigators, black boxes are mandatory on airliners and business jets, but not on light aircraft such as the Piper PA-46 Malibu that Sala was travelling in. The plane took off at 7.15pm on Monday and was flying at an altitude of 5,000ft (1,500 metres). On passing Guernsey, it \u201crequested descent\u201d, but Jersey air traffic control lost contact with it while it was at 2,300ft. Cardiff City said Sala had arranged the flight himself. The club chairman, Mehmet Dalman, told BBC Radio Wales: \u201cWe spoke to the player and asked him if he wanted us to make arrangements for his flight, which would have been commercial. He declined and made his own arrangements.\u201d It is believed that a football agent may have helped him arrange the flight. Guernsey police said: \u201cAfter an intensive search using multiple aircraft and one lifeboat over the last nine hours, we have found no trace of the missing plane. With the light now fading, the search will be suspended for the night. A decision about whether to recommence will be taken early tomorrow morning.\u201d In a statement, Sala\u2019s agent, Mark McKay, expressed his sadness at the news. \u201cI knew Emiliano well,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a wonderful person and I count myself fortunate to have known him.\u201d He made it clear that neither he nor anyone in his family owned the aircraft.",

D\u00e1maso L\u00f3pez N\u00fa\u00f1ez told the jury at Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s trial that Emma Coronel Aispuro helped her husband trade messages with his sons and others who coordinated the breakout at Altiplano prison in central Mexico. Coronel \u201cwas giving us his orders\u201d, L\u00f3pez said, adding that she also was in on meetings about the escape. After Guzm\u00e1n was recaptured and thrown in another Mexican lockup, the cartel paid a $2m bribe to a prison official to get him moved back to Altiplano, L\u00f3pez said. Before that could happen, Guzm\u00e1n was extradited in 2017 to the US, where he has been kept in solitary confinement. The testimony cast a harsh spotlight on Coronel, who has sat quietly in the courtroom for most of a trial that began in mid-November. Most of the attention on her so far has been for her wardrobe and her reaction to waves from the defendant. At a lunch break, she did not speak to reporters and Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers declined comment. Known by his alias \u201cEl Licenciado\u201d, which is a title for college graduates, L\u00f3pez, 52, was once a close confidant of the kingpin. He was extradited to the US in July and is now serving a life sentence in prison for drug trafficking, and has said he is cooperating with prosecutors in the hope of getting the sentence reduced. He has testified that he began working for Guzm\u00e1n in 2001 and is a godfather to one of his former boss\u2019s twin daughters. L\u00f3pez told jurors that he plotted his boss\u2019s escape with Coronel and Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons, with Coronel passing messages to and from Guzm\u00e1n. As described by L\u00f3pez, the 2015 escape was far more elaborate than one Guzm\u00e1n pulled off in 2001 by hiding in a prison laundry cart. It included smuggling a phone with GPS to Guzm\u00e1n so the plotters could determine where best to tunnel in, he said. His followers also bought property adjacent to the facility, so they could dig the mile-long (1.6-km-long) escape route, L\u00f3pez said.

      "bodyText": "Phoenix police say a licensed practical nurse has been arrested on a charge of sexual assault in the impregnation of an incapacitated woman who gave birth last month at a long-term healthcare facility. The Phoenix police chief, Jeri Williams, said on Wednesday investigators arrested 36-year-old Nathan Sutherland on one count of sexual assault and one count of vulnerable adult abuse. Williams said Sutherland worked at the Hacienda HealthCare facility where the woman lived and had been providing care to her. The 29-year-old victim has been incapacitated since the age of three and gave birth to a boy at the facility on 29 December. Employees said they had no idea she was pregnant. Court records say her last known physical examination was in April. John Michaels, a lawyer for the woman\u2019s family, said she was not in a coma but has \u201csignificant intellectual disabilities\u201d and does not speak but has some ability to move, responds to sounds and is able to make facial gestures. \u201cThe important thing here is that contrary to what\u2019s been reported, she is a person, albeit with significant intellectual disabilities. She has feelings and is capable of responding to people she is familiar with, especially family,\u201d he told the Arizona Republic newspaper. Williams said the police felt they owed the arrest of the suspect to the victim. \u201cAnd we owed this arrest to the newest member of our community, that innocent baby,\u201d Williams said. The surprise birth late last month triggered reviews by state agencies, highlighted safety concerns for patients who are severely disabled or incapacitated and led to disciplinary actions and resignations of staffers and managers. It also prompted authorities to test the DNA of all the men who worked at the Hacienda HealthCare facility. Sutherland, 36, submitted his DNA sample under court order on Tuesday and the results came back a few hours later, showing he was a match to the baby. He declined to speak with police and invoked his fifth amendment rights to remain silent, a police spokesman, Tommy Thompson, said.

      "bodyText": "Paul Scholes believes it is \u201cstrange\u201d that only Nicky Butt of the Class of 92 works at Manchester United, the former midfielder stating that Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s wish was for them all to have roles. Scholes was referring to himself, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Gary and Phil Neville together with Butt, who is the head of academy at United. Scholes went as far as to say that he had been left feeling unwelcome at United. The six own 60% of Salford City, following the announcement on Wednesday that Beckham has bought a 10% stake. Although Giggs was United\u2019s interim manager and then Louis van Gaal\u2019s No 2, and Scholes has coached there, the 44-year-old pointed to the way in which Ferguson\u2019s vision has not been fulfilled. The Scot retired as manager in May 2013 and Scholes stopped playing at the same time. \u201cIt is a little bit strange,\u201d Scholes said. \u201cI think it was always the [former] manager\u2019s idea that he would have us all involved in some capacity. He went at the same time, we retired together. In an ideal world he would have liked that but it didn\u2019t happen for a year or so and people got other interests. \u201cSalford obviously took a big chunk of that, people went into different stuff. Gary went into management [at Valencia], Ryan is now at Wales. The manager always wanted something similar to a Bayern Munich or an Ajax where there are always ex-players there involved in the club, but it just has not happened.\u201d Scholes hinted that Ed Woodward replacing David Gill as the head executive was a factor. He said: \u201cA lot changed at the club, obviously David Gill [went] as well. It could have been different, it couldn\u2019t have been \u2013 I just don\u2019t know.\u201d Scholes admits that not being actively involved in football has left a void. \u201cSaturday afternoon is the hardest thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI can go out and watch games but I\u2019m constantly on my phone looking at results, what score is this, what score is that. \u201cYou have no real involvement but you\u2019re obsessed with it. I want that feeling back again of working towards something through the week, working towards the end game on a Saturday through to the end of the season.\u201d As a pundit Scholes was critical of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho before the Portuguese\u2019s sacking in mid-December. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, the caretaker manager, has won his opening seven games. Scholes, asked whether it was too early to judge the former United striker after the leaden football of his predecessor, was scathing about Mourinho\u2019s mode of play, branding it \u201cshite\u201d. He is happier with Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s approach. \u201cSince Ole has come back you feel like you\u2019ve got your club back. You don\u2019t ever feel like you\u2019ve lost it, I suppose, but it just feels like you\u2019ve got someone there who knows Man United, he\u2019s been a player, you look at Ole and he\u2019s a United man. \u201cI know he\u2019s had jobs at other clubs but he\u2019s a United person. You\u2019d almost feel welcome there again.\u201d Scholes has been linked with the managerial vacancy at Oldham Athletic. He said he was unsure whether being a Salford shareholder would prove a problem were he offered the job.",

We got a bit of pride back. We showed a lot of spirit, some good youngsters as well. I thought we pressed them and did everything we could tonight. The pressure was off, of course, with the tie being over. But we put in a good performance against some top, top players. We were brave and caused them problems. I watched their last couple of Premier League games against Wolves and Huddersfield and I thought we caused them as many problems as they did. As a club, it\u2019s been an incredible experience just to reach the last four. As a team, especially for the youngsters, it\u2019s been incredible to be on the same pitch as those magnificent players. We take an awful lot from it, the experience and the glory of reaching the semi. Hopefully we\u2019ve made a bit of money too.

The pitch was so dangerous and slippery. But we make a good game. I am a little disappointed with our finishing, but we were good. Burton had also a couple of clear chances, and were outstanding. But we are in the final, that is what is important. I didn\u2019t see a lack of desire, we played seriously, and we have no injuries. I am not thinking about Chelsea or Tottenham, they are both incredible teams.

Some muted clapping, and that\u2019s about it. The managers Nigel Clough and Pep Guardiola shake hands warmly and share a smile, just as they did at the Etihad a fortnight ago. But this time Clough\u2019s side have given a much better account of themselves. His players look understandably deflated, but they\u2019ve restored much pride after the horrors of the first leg, and once the sting subsides, should feel pleased with their efforts tonight, a mid-table League One outfit holding the champions of England to a single goal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a6e050750fc4757159309fe076311cd774d0568\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a6e050750fc4757159309fe076311cd774d0568/0_0_1648_989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young fan gets a hug from Manchester City\u2019s Benjamin Mendy as well as his shirt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young fan gets a hug from Manchester City\u2019s Benjamin Mendy as well as his shirt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-23T21:50:14.679Z\">at 9.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c48de75e4b024f0efead228\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-23T21:38:20.362Z\">9.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: Burton Albion 0-1 Manchester City (agg: 0-10)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>... that\u2019s the final whistle!

You can\u2019t keep a goalscoring genius quiet for too long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"423014a7e58288329159d45a3f2f634d428a2fd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/423014a7e58288329159d45a3f2f634d428a2fd7/0_192_4626_2776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sergio Aguero of Man City opens the scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sergio Aguero of Man City opens the scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49ff729d4e1a449eb607b8c9e5d00acf2aebe066\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49ff729d4e1a449eb607b8c9e5d00acf2aebe066/0_117_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sergio Aguero is congratulated by his Manchester City teammates after opening the scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">And is congratulated by his teammates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Holt/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-23T20:33:39.559Z\">at 8.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c48ca0de4b0a585f6e8517b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-23T20:10:59.185Z\">8.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Good combinations between Aguero and Poveda down the left.

So there is a <em>little</em> something riding on tonight\u2019s match: the small matter of pride, and staying if at all possible out of the record books.</p> <p><strong>The biggest aggregate win in a League Cup semi is 9-0, so Burton need at least a draw tonight in order to avoid obliterating that one.</strong> A tall order, though should City win tonight as expected, Burton can console themselves with the fact that everything is relative: the current record, already held by City, came after 6-0 and 3-0 pastings of West Ham United in 2014. West Ham were a fellow Premier League concern; at least Albion have the excuse of plying their trade a couple of divisions down.</p> <p><strong>And by limiting City to nine, they made sure they didn\u2019t join Bury and Fulham in the ultimate League Cup hall of double-digit shame. </strong>The Shakers lost 10-0 at West Ham in October 1983, while the Cottagers were beaten by the exact same scoreline at Liverpool in September 1986. Burton should take succour from the results of the other legs in both of those second-round maulings from yesteryear: Bury lost 2-1, Fulham went down 3-2. Not ideal either, but one strongly suspects the Brewers won\u2019t be too unhappy if they escape tonight with a similar damage-limiting, face-saving defeat.</p> <p><strong>Or would they? Do they fancy their chances of pulling off a valedictory shock as they take their leave of this season\u2019s League Cup? </strong>You never know, with quadruple-chasing City planning to load their team with nippers and reserves. The first leg thrashing has made it easy to forget how brilliant Burton have otherwise been in this year\u2019s competition, seeing off the likes of Burnley, Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough. Can they somehow end on an unlikely high note? Or will City hand out another lesson? It\u2019ll be fun finding out, even if it won\u2019t be tense and we won\u2019t be going to extra time and penalties. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>7.45pm GMT.</p> </div>   </div>",

Congratulations to Manchester City on reaching their seventh League Cup final; commiserations to Burton Albion, though take nothing away from their wonderful run to the semis, and the way they bounced back from despair to give a great account of themselves tonight. Thanks for reading; sweet dreams, wherever you are! And now Cloughie Jr. gives his verdict. \u201cWe came very close a couple of times, I\u2019m very pleased with the way we played tonight and went about it. We got a bit of pride back. We showed a lot of spirit, some good youngsters as well. I thought we pressed them and did everything we could tonight. The pressure was off, of course, with the tie being over. But we put in a good performance against some top, top players. We were brave and caused them problems. I watched their last couple of Premier League games against Wolves and Huddersfield and I thought we caused them as many problems as they did. As a club, it\u2019s been an incredible experience just to reach the last four. As a team, especially for the youngsters, it\u2019s been incredible to be on the same pitch as those magnificent players. We take an awful lot from it, the experience and the glory of reaching the semi. Hopefully we\u2019ve made a bit of money too. I can\u2019t wait for Bradford on Saturday!\u201d Pep speaks! \u201cWe worked very well. The pitch was so dangerous and slippery. But we make a good game. I am a little disappointed with our finishing, but we were good. Burton had also a couple of clear chances, and were outstanding. But we are in the final, that is what is important. I didn\u2019t see a lack of desire, we played seriously, and we have no injuries. I am not thinking about Chelsea or Tottenham, they are both incredible teams. The important thing is again, one more year we are there.\u201d A charming post-match interview with 18-year-old Ian Carlo Poveda. He\u2019s a little nervous, but his joy at making his Manchester City debut tonight is infectious. \u201cI am buzzing,\u201d he begins, smiling shyly. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful for the opportunity, I couldn\u2019t have done it without the support of my family and my friends, and the fans also.\u201d He\u2019s asked what it was like to play alongside the likes of Aguero and De Bruyne. \u201cI\u2019m just speechless to be honest, it\u2019s an amazing feeling, I have dreamt of this.\u201d An evening to remember for the young man. So City will play either Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur in the Wembley final on February 24. We always knew this would be the case, after that first-leg rout, so there\u2019s little in the way of the usual manic semi-final celebrations at the final whistle. Some muted clapping, and that\u2019s about it. The managers Nigel Clough and Pep Guardiola shake hands warmly and share a smile, just as they did at the Etihad a fortnight ago. But this time Clough\u2019s side have given a much better account of themselves. His players look understandably deflated, but they\u2019ve restored much pride after the horrors of the first leg, and once the sting subsides, should feel pleased with their efforts tonight, a mid-table League One outfit holding the champions of England to a single goal. ... that\u2019s the final whistle! City have reached their fourth League Cup final in six seasons! And Burton Albion have restored some pride with a staunch second-leg display. 90 min +2: Danilo whips the free kick over the wall. It\u2019s straight at Collins, who tips over with ease. The corner comes to nothing, and ... 90 min +1: There will be two added minutes. In the first, McCrory races out of his own box and slams Jesus to the ground. A free kick, 25 yards out. 90 min: Hutchinson shows Foden a clean pair of heels down the left. But just as Burton start to dream about the cross that leads to that precious consolation strike, Hutchinson takes a heavy touch and runs the ball out for a goal kick. 88 min: Jesus dribbles into the Burton box in the style of Ricky Villa, but can\u2019t finish his baroque ramble. His shot is smothered by Collins, and the resulting corner comes to nothing. 86 min: Nothing going on. Which explains why K\u00e1ri Tulinius has started to concentrate on the pitchside advertising. \u201cWhen I was a wee lad watching English football in Iceland, I would puzzle over the pitchside hoardings, trying to figure what the various exotic companies were selling. Pirelli Stadium is bringing me right back as I wonder what the heck Palletforce, Kestral and Russell are all about.\u201d A timely email, because they\u2019ve just this minute flashed up an ad for Don Amott caravans. Anyone who watched ATV back in the 70s and 80s will have enjoyed a Proustian rush. 84 min: Garcia slips over as City knock it back and forth around the back. Daniel nearly manages to latch onto a momentarily loose ball, but Garcia recovers just in time. 82 min: Harness is sent scampering into the City box down the right by Fox. He\u2019s hassled by Mendy, then crashes into Muric, who has come out to smother. Harness wants a penalty kick, but that\u2019s not forthcoming. 81 min: City continue to hog the ball in the sterile fashion. 79 min: City stroke it around, keeping warm their only concern. Can they find the two goals that would give them the all-time League Cup aggregate victory? Or is the ten-goal semi-final record enough to sate their desires? 77 min: Boyce is replaced by Daniel. Both teams have now made all their substitutions. 76 min: Templeton ambles down the left, and has Hutchinson on the overlap. He eventually finds his team-mate with a pass, after plenty of faffing about, but at this point Hutchinson is offside. The pair analyse the move in the full and frank style. 74 min: It\u2019s a couple of degrees below zero now, and the pitch is hardening up. Pretty passing is at a premium right now, the ball bobbling around quite a bit. Burton will be happy enough, as it ensures City can\u2019t be their usual fluent selves. 72 min: Nmecha goes down in the Burton area, barged by Harness as he chases a Jesus pass down the inside-left channel. It was a good old-fashioned shoulder-charge, though, and the referee\u2019s not interested in awarding a penalty kick. 70 min: Burton come so close to that consolation! Sandler slips on the edge of his own box. Boyce steps into the area, but his heavy touch allows Muric to smother. The ball breaks to Miller, on the penalty spot. He slams low towards the goal, but Garcia is back on the line to spectacularly clear! Poor old Burton. 69 min: Mahrez finds himself standing in the Burton D. He considers shooting, but instead slides a pass wide right for Danilo, who instantly looks for Jesus in the middle. His ball, neither cross nor shot, flashes out to the left of goal. 67 min: City make their final change of the night, Zinchenko making way for debutant Felix Nmecha. 65 min: Harness busies himself down the right, and nearly slips Miller free in the City box. But Garcia has read the danger well, stepping in to shield the ball out of play for a goal kick. Burton are giving it their all in pursuit of this consolation goal. 63 min: Aguero has had a very strange evening indeed: some awful control, that dreadful miss, and the game\u2019s only goal. A clinically brilliant one at that. He\u2019s had a good run out, though, and now he makes way for Jesus. Meanwhile de Bruyne, also working his way back from injury, is replaced by Mendy, returning from a spell out himself. This is all great news for City, several of their stars sharpening up just in time for the big run-in. 61 min: What a miss! Aguero backflicks deliciously down the left to send de Bruyne into space. De Bruyne then slides a pass down the channel to release Foden, who tears clear into the box, then cuts one back for Aguero. He can\u2019t miss, but does, sending his first-time shot wide right from 12 yards under no pressure whatsoever! Replays show Foden was well offside, so it\u2019s probably for the best. 59 min: Templeton simmers down, and is again about his business, dribbling into the City box from the left again. But neither of his two attempts to cross low are any good, both blocked by his nemesis Danilo. 57 min: Templeton continues to argue the toss, chuntering on at whoever will listen as play continues. It still means something, ten goals down or not. 55 min: Templeton dribbles into the City box from the left and springs over Danilo\u2019s leg. He\u2019s livid. He\u2019s after a penalty kick. But there was no contact, and Danilo did nothing wrong. The VAR folk - apparently working from a van in the car park, a pimped version of Andy Townsend\u2019s old truck, perhaps? - double check, and we play on. 54 min: Danilo makes space on the right and swings a low cross to the near post, where Delph must surely score. But he takes a fresh-air swipe at the ball, which then bounces back towards him off Collins, offering a second bite at the cherry. He clanks that one out of play, wide right, for a goal kick. It should have been City\u2019s 11th goal of the tie. Hey, if you\u2019re going to miss a sitter, now\u2019s the time to do it. 53 min: Foden probes down the City left; Mahrez has a go out on the right. Neither can work a clear route into the box. 51 min: Aguero dribbles down the right. He\u2019s stopped by Wallace, who in turn is slide-tackled by ... his own man, McCrory. Burton continue to give it their all despite the ludicrous scoreline, which is very much to their credit. 49 min: Garcia slips on the frosty turf and very nearly allows Boyce to race clear on goal. He does very well to recover and hack away from danger. 47 min: Mahrez glides in from the right but can\u2019t release himself into the box with a one-two with Aguero. City will be in something of a rush themselves, needing two more goals to register the biggest aggregate win in all League Cup history. 45 min 21 sec. Burton have clearly come out with a flea in their ear, ordered to pick up the pace in search of this elusive consolation goal. They snap into a couple of challenges, and suddenly Templeton has possession 25 yards out. He creams a fine shot just over the bar. No time to waste. Here we go again! Burton get the second half underway, having replaced Quinn with Fox. Half-time entertainment. Burton were four down at half-time a fortnight ago, so this is a most acceptable improvement. The home side will be relatively pleased with their efforts so far ... but what they\u2019d give for a consolation goal in the second half, even if they end up shipping a few more themselves. Don\u2019t go anywhere! 45 min: Both teams appear to be waiting for the half-time whistle. Not much going on. They\u2019ll get their wish in two minutes. 43 min: Harness comes again down the right and whips a cross to the near post. But there\u2019s nobody in yellow there, and Garcia is able to clear calmly. 42 min: De Bruyne hesitates 30 yards from his own goal and has his pocket picked by Harness. For a second, City are exposed, but de Bruyne ensures Harness can\u2019t have a clear run on goal, making up for his mistake and putting a stop to Burton\u2019s gallop. 40 min: Turner\u2019s race is run. The big centre-half has picked up an injury, and he limps off sadly, to be replaced by Hutchinson. 38 min: Boyce is sent zipping clear down the inside left by a lovely Templeton defence-splitter, but Muric is out of his box quickly to batter clear. 36 min: De Bruyne loops the set piece to the far post, where Garcia should either score or roll a pass back across goal to invite a tap-in. He does neither, allowing Collins to claim. In the crowd, a clear \u201cfackinell\u201d pierces the white noise, life imitating the art of Father Ted. 35 min: Aguero drops a shoulder to nip past McFadzean, and is clipped to the floor for his trouble. A free kick out on the right. 33 min: Foden comes straight through the back of Templeton, and should really go in the book. It wasn\u2019t a good challenge. But the referee\u2019s in a lenient mood. 32 min: Zinchenko is sent scampering free down the left by Poveda. His low cross is trapped by Aguero on the penalty spot, but before he can shoot and surely score, the flag goes up for offside. Zinchenko had mistimed his run by a nanosecond. 31 min: City knock it around in a professional manner. They\u2019re in complete control. \u201cHow\u2019s the atmosphere at the Pirelli Stadium?\u201d wonders Ian Sargeant, setting himself up for a tyre-related zinger. \u201cIf a little flat, the DJ should play Goodyear For The Roses to fit with a melancholy mood.\u201d 29 min: It would be lovely to see Burton grab a consolation at some point. With this in mind, Miller takes up possession 25 yards out, down the inside-left channel, and tries to curl one into the top right. It\u2019s high and wide, but not so far off target that Muric wasn\u2019t momentarily concerned. 28 min: As things stand, this is now the biggest aggregate scoreline in a League Cup semi, beating the 9-0 rattled up by City against West Ham five years ago. You just knew this would happen. Aguero hasn\u2019t been at the races, so of course now he opens the scoring. De Bruyne, quarterbacking from deep, plays a glorious defence splitter down the inside right. Mahrez dribbles into the box, waits for Aguero to arrive on the penalty spot, and tees his team-mate up. Aguero sends a crisp finish into the bottom left, Collins with no chance. You can\u2019t keep a goalscoring genius quiet for too long. 24 min: Good combinations between Aguero and Poveda down the left. Suddenly they flick Zinchenko away. He crosses to nobody in particular, and that\u2019s easy meat for McFadzean. 22 min: Aguero\u2019s cold start continues. First he kicks a huge divot out of the turf as he skedaddles down the inside-right, scuppering his hopes of getting a shot on goal. Then he tries to bring down Delph\u2019s crossfield pass on the left, but lets that roll off his boot and out of play. The home crowd taunt him on both occasions, which let\u2019s face it is asking for trouble. Nevertheless, it\u2019s been an undistinguished first 22 minutes for a very distinguished player. 20 min: Zinchenko is brushed off the ball by Harness, who looks for a split second clear down the right. But the City man battles hard to snaffle possession back. 18 min: Mahrez swans in from the right, unchallenged, and pearls a glorious effort towards the top left. The ball flies millimetres wide of its intended target. That would have been a very handsome goal, even if McCrory\u2019s defending wasn\u2019t up to much. 16 min: Burton will be happy enough with this start. City have only carved out one opportunity so far, despite hogging the ball. It\u2019s all relative: City\u2019s team cost 317 times more than Burton\u2019s. 14 min: Quinn whips the free kick low and hard into the City box from the right. Boyce attempts a cute flick, helping it on towards the bottom left. But Muric is down to smother easily enough. Close, though. And that\u2019s two good chances in a minute. In a parallel universe, this game is already 1-1, and Burton have their precious consolation goal. 13 min: Boyce bowls down the right, capitalising on a loose pass from Delph. He\u2019s brought down by the same player, who was desperately trying to recover the ground he\u2019d given up, and that\u2019s a free kick in a dangerous position for the hosts. 12 min: City\u2019s first shot in anger, as McCrory makes a balls of Delph\u2019s lob down the inside-right channel. His air kick allows the busy Mahrez to ghost in behind, and his fierce first-time shot from a tight angle flashes across Collins but inches wide of the bottom-left corner. 11 min: Poveda and Delph take turns to probe down the left. Akins and McFadzean take turns to hold them up. City are dominating in terms of possession and territory, as you\u2019d expect. \u201cPirelli Stadium? Nice name. Too bad Burton\u2019s wheels fell off in the first leg.\u201d Peter Oh, ladies and gentlemen. He\u2019s here all week. Try the artisan ale. 9 min: More space for Mahrez, who scoops a pass from right to left for Aguero. City\u2019s captain for the night completes an early triptych of uncharacteristically poor control as he scuffs a weak first-time shot towards Collins. His boots will warm up soon enough, you can be sure of it. 7 min: Danilo sashays in from the right and tees up Aguero, 25 yards out. Aguero tries to slip a pass towards Mahrez instead of shooting, but it goes all wrong. That\u2019s his second touch of the evening; his first ballooned off his shin a couple of minutes ago. Even the greats aren\u2019t perfect. 5 min: City make it into the Burton box for the first time this evening, Mahrez twisting and turning down the right. He dinks one into the middle for Aguero, but Turner is well positioned and clears well. 4 min: City\u2019s young stars continue to knock it about stylishly. Sandler and Garcia are striding around like they\u2019ve spent years together as City\u2019s centre-back pairing. Full of confidence. Burton can\u2019t get a sniff right now. 2 min: City spend the majority of the opening period stroking the ball about in the calm and considered style. And we\u2019re off! City get the ball rolling. A reminder that should the aggregate score be level after 90 minu... ah let\u2019s not rub it in. Both sets of fans are giving it their all; here\u2019s to an entertaining second leg. The teams are out! Burton sport their yellow shirts, which in theory allows Manchester City to wear their first-choice sky blue. But folk don\u2019t roll like that these days, do they, so third-choice purple with orange sash it is. There\u2019s a cracking atmosphere at the Pirelli Stadium. We\u2019ll be off before you know it! Pep meanwhile doesn\u2019t appear to be letting up, even if his team are nine up and he\u2019s playing some of the kids. \u201cWe are going to try to win the game of course. We spoke about what we have to do to attack them in the best way. Poveda is a winger, so aggressive, he\u2019s a brave guy. It\u2019s a good test for him to play tonight.\u201d Nigel Clough speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s a huge night, the semi-final of the Carabao Cup. If we get here again in our lifetime it\u2019ll be incredible, so it\u2019s one to be enjoyed at this stage. When you look around it\u2019s just remarkable that we\u2019re here, and not one of the Premier League or Championship clubs. I think we can enjoy it; I hope so. We might not enjoy it so much tonight, if their players start knocking it around as we know they can! But when we look back at it with the children, we should be proud that we\u2019ve been on the same pitch as some of these players. We\u2019d love to score a goal if we can, that would be a major success!\u201d Winter in Staffordshire. It\u2019s cold. So cold they\u2019ve had the covers on all day to make sure the pitch doesn\u2019t freeze over. Players and fans alike are wandering around with bobble hats pulled tightly over their heads. Meanwhile Pep Guardiola, a man used to the subtropical climate of Catalunya, is forced into this snood, the like of which hasn\u2019t been seen since the chart-bothering glory days of Nik Kershaw. Burton may be nine goals adrift going into tonight\u2019s second leg, but that doesn\u2019t mean their supporters aren\u2019t going to enjoy themselves. Our man Jamie Jackson has been out, and furthermore about, meeting the Albion faithful. This lovely piece is the result. Burton make six changes to the side that scraped a last-minute draw at Doncaster on Saturday. Out go John Brayford, Jake Buxton, Reece Hutchinson, Jamie Allen, Scott Fraser and Josh Clarke; in come Kyle McFadzean, Ben Turner, David Templeton, Damien McCrory, Will Miller and Kieran Wallace. Manchester City also make a truckload of changes, in the wake of their easy win at Huddersfield on Sunday. Eight in all, with plenty of the kids getting a taste of a big-match occasion. The 18-year-old winger Ian Carlo Poveda makes his debut. But there are some star names in the mix too: Sergio Aguero, Kevin de Bruyne, Riyad Mahrez and Fabian Delph all get a run-out. And Benjamin Mendy comes back from injury to take a place on the bench. Burton Albion: Collins, Akins, McFadzean, Turner, McCrory, Quinn, Wallace, Harness, Miller, Templeton, Boyce. Subs: Bywater, Brayford, Buxton, Sbarra, Fox, Hutchinson, Daniel. Manchester City: Muric, Danilo, Sandler, Garcia, Zinchenko, De Bruyne, Delph, Foden, Mahrez, Aguero, Poveda. Subs: Nmecha, Stones, Mendy, Grimshaw, Gabriel Jesus, Bolton, Richards. Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire). Burton Albion weren\u2019t the first team to be thrashed senseless in the semi-finals of the League Cup by Manchester City; chances are they won\u2019t be the last. But this is the here and now, and after that nine-goal tonking in the first leg at the Etihad, the Brewers will desperately be hoping to avoid a second humiliation in 14 days. So there is a little something riding on tonight\u2019s match: the small matter of pride, and staying if at all possible out of the record books. The biggest aggregate win in a League Cup semi is 9-0, so Burton need at least a draw tonight in order to avoid obliterating that one. A tall order, though should City win tonight as expected, Burton can console themselves with the fact that everything is relative: the current record, already held by City, came after 6-0 and 3-0 pastings of West Ham United in 2014. West Ham were a fellow Premier League concern; at least Albion have the excuse of plying their trade a couple of divisions down. And by limiting City to nine, they made sure they didn\u2019t join Bury and Fulham in the ultimate League Cup hall of double-digit shame. The Shakers lost 10-0 at West Ham in October 1983, while the Cottagers were beaten by the exact same scoreline at Liverpool in September 1986. Burton should take succour from the results of the other legs in both of those second-round maulings from yesteryear: Bury lost 2-1, Fulham went down 3-2. Not ideal either, but one strongly suspects the Brewers won\u2019t be too unhappy if they escape tonight with a similar damage-limiting, face-saving defeat. Or would they? Do they fancy their chances of pulling off a valedictory shock as they take their leave of this season\u2019s League Cup? You never know, with quadruple-chasing City planning to load their team with nippers and reserves. The first leg thrashing has made it easy to forget how brilliant Burton have otherwise been in this year\u2019s competition, seeing off the likes of Burnley, Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough. Can they somehow end on an unlikely high note? Or will City hand out another lesson? It\u2019ll be fun finding out, even if it won\u2019t be tense and we won\u2019t be going to extra time and penalties. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 7.45pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>As night follows day, as rivers flow to sea, as fourth gins unleash tears of regret, so inevitable was Danny Dyer\u2019s Right Royal Family (BBC One). It was ordained from the moment his turn on Who Do You Think You Are? revealed him to be a descendant of Thomas Cromwell, Elizabeth Seymour and therefore also Edward III, who is his 22x great grandfather. And it was probably fast-tracked when his description on breakfast TV of David Cameron as \u201ca twat \u2026 in Nice wiv \u2019is trotters up\u201d made him the nation\u2019s darling. Now, as our hero puts it in the opening minutes of this new \u2013 I want to say \u2026 documentary? \u2013 here he is, gathering leafy details for his family tree and learning why he is not currently \u201ctonguing a princess\u201d in Buckingham Palace: \u201cWe can all get regalled out of our brains. It\u2019s going to be a right nutty royal caper.\u201d Did I mention that Danny Dyer is a cockney? Not a mockney like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/guy-ritchie\">Guy Ritchie</a>, or a cockernee like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/russell-brand\">Russell Brand</a> but the genuine article, which makes it slightly less painful all round.</p> <p>He first meets a historian (\u201cgeezer called Anthony\u201d) who tells him that he can trace his history back through Louis IX, Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine and William the Conqueror to the Viking king Rollo. Danny is delighted \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s livened me right up!\u201d \u2013 so off to Scandinavia we speed. There, Danny takes part in a battle re-enactment in period dress and unremarkable headgear (\u201c\u2019Orns were a myff,\u201d he explains), eats a Viking meal of axe-split sheep\u2019s head, shark meat and whey and, after a brief rush to the khazi, listens to a lecture on Rollo\u2019s warrior credentials from \u201cclever Scandinavian geezer\u201d Dr S\u00f8ren Sindb\u00e6k. </p> <p>Back to England we go, to take in the Tower of London, before moving on \u2013 via a veritably Reithian 20 seconds of historical facts in voiceover as a red timeline creeps across the screen \u2013 to William the Conqueror. Valiant efforts ensue by archaeology professor Naomi Sykes to explain the introduction of forest law by the Normans and the \u201cunmaking rituals\u201d of deerhunting as a king before Danny hotfoots it to Dover castle (\u201cbeautiful gaff\u201d) to learn a further fact and a half about \u201cgrandad\u201d \u2013 Henry II.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/22/danny-dyer-right-royal-family-from-tinpot-wideboy-to-tv-treasure\">A bit of ruff: how Danny Dyer went from tinpot wideboy to TV treasure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a romp. It\u2019s not going to win any awards, but let go your worries and your cares and your calculations as to what portion of the licence fee was annexed to make it, and enjoy. When Dyer forgets himself and starts to have fun with it all, it is almost enough to make you glad that the making rituals of media law demanded it be done. I would happily argue that him nodding sagely as Prof Laura Ashe described Thomas Becket\u2019s fate for speaking against the king and church and replying: \u201cI bin a bit trappy in the past, so I get it,\u201d was worth the price of admission alone.

      "bodyText": "As night follows day, as rivers flow to sea, as fourth gins unleash tears of regret, so inevitable was Danny Dyer\u2019s Right Royal Family (BBC One). It was ordained from the moment his turn on Who Do You Think You Are? revealed him to be a descendant of Thomas Cromwell, Elizabeth Seymour and therefore also Edward III, who is his 22x great grandfather. And it was probably fast-tracked when his description on breakfast TV of David Cameron as \u201ca twat \u2026 in Nice wiv \u2019is trotters up\u201d made him the nation\u2019s darling. Now, as our hero puts it in the opening minutes of this new \u2013 I want to say \u2026 documentary? \u2013 here he is, gathering leafy details for his family tree and learning why he is not currently \u201ctonguing a princess\u201d in Buckingham Palace: \u201cWe can all get regalled out of our brains. It\u2019s going to be a right nutty royal caper.\u201d Did I mention that Danny Dyer is a cockney? Not a mockney like Guy Ritchie, or a cockernee like Russell Brand but the genuine article, which makes it slightly less painful all round. He first meets a historian (\u201cgeezer called Anthony\u201d) who tells him that he can trace his history back through Louis IX, Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine and William the Conqueror to the Viking king Rollo. Danny is delighted \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s livened me right up!\u201d \u2013 so off to Scandinavia we speed. There, Danny takes part in a battle re-enactment in period dress and unremarkable headgear (\u201c\u2019Orns were a myff,\u201d he explains), eats a Viking meal of axe-split sheep\u2019s head, shark meat and whey and, after a brief rush to the khazi, listens to a lecture on Rollo\u2019s warrior credentials from \u201cclever Scandinavian geezer\u201d Dr S\u00f8ren Sindb\u00e6k. Back to England we go, to take in the Tower of London, before moving on \u2013 via a veritably Reithian 20 seconds of historical facts in voiceover as a red timeline creeps across the screen \u2013 to William the Conqueror. Valiant efforts ensue by archaeology professor Naomi Sykes to explain the introduction of forest law by the Normans and the \u201cunmaking rituals\u201d of deerhunting as a king before Danny hotfoots it to Dover castle (\u201cbeautiful gaff\u201d) to learn a further fact and a half about \u201cgrandad\u201d \u2013 Henry II. It\u2019s a romp. It\u2019s not going to win any awards, but let go your worries and your cares and your calculations as to what portion of the licence fee was annexed to make it, and enjoy. When Dyer forgets himself and starts to have fun with it all, it is almost enough to make you glad that the making rituals of media law demanded it be done. I would happily argue that him nodding sagely as Prof Laura Ashe described Thomas Becket\u2019s fate for speaking against the king and church and replying: \u201cI bin a bit trappy in the past, so I get it,\u201d was worth the price of admission alone. And if, after pretending to be the devout Louis IX on his barefoot procession with Christ\u2019s crown of thorns through the streets of Paris (\u201cLet\u2019s get pious, kids\u201d), your astonishment at being confronted with the actual blood-stained tunic he wore is expressed in an awed \u201cFuuuckinell\u201d that whispers through the cloistered silence of Notre Dame cathedral \u2026 well, at least it has the virtue of authenticity. So too does his reaction to the Sainte Chapelle, built at Louis\u2019s behest to house the holy crown. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a building that\u2019s more godlike,\u201d he says, staring up at the endless gilded, graceful beauty of this gaff of gaffs. \u201cIf God was gonna have some windows, they\u2019d be his windows.\u201d Exactly what his 26x great-grandfather was going for eight centuries ago. It was a little moment touched by grace, and it made you wonder whether Dyer might in the fullness of time, with a bit more confidence in himself and a bit more confidence placed in him by producers, be able to front something quite good on a subject beyond his usual Deadliest Men and Football Factory remits; keeping the laughs, but letting in more honest, serious stuff, too. Next week Danny does the Tudors and I\u2019m not saying my heart doesn\u2019t quail slightly at the thought. But on the other hand, who can resist the idea of the dissolution of the monasteries as the right nuttiest of all nutty royal capers or not look forward to Danny\u2019s thoughts on tonguing all six of Henry VIII\u2019s wives?

He had just received his first cap from two Bajan legends.

      "bodyText": "With the ageless Jimmy Anderson at the helm and the second new ball in his hand, England just managed to retrieve a tricky situation. By snatching three late wickets as the sun headed swiftly towards the Caribbean sea, he dragged England back into a game that had been slipping out of control. Anderson finished the day with exceptional figures: 24-12-33-4. Leaving aside the wickets column, look at the volume of overs and runs conceded. Amid an uneven display among the bowlers \u2013 Ben Stokes was also impressive, while the rest struggled \u2013 Joe Root was indebted to his senior citizen as the West Indies slumped from 240 for four to 264 for eight against the second new ball. After all the conjecture about the pitch, it transpired that it was as docile and well-behaved as a teacher\u2019s pet. Moreover the much-discussed Dukes ball also behaved decorously, offering just moderate swing at the start \u2013 oddly the second one was more amenable. This reduced the impact of Sam Curran at the start and enhanced the considerable reputation of Stuart Broad, who was sitting as comfortably as his minor ailments would allow in the pavilion, having been omitted for the third time in four Test matches. By contrast John Campbell had every reason to feel a little light-headed as the match began. He had just received his first cap from two Bajan legends. Joel Garner, beaming as ever, passed the treasured maroon cap to Sir Garry Sobers, who duly handed it over to Campbell, seconds before he took guard to his first ball from Test cricket, which went for four. What a way to start the day. Campbell, a stocky left-hander from Jamaica, looked the part against the seamers. He easily outscored Kraigg Brathwaite, which was not difficult since the West Indies\u2019 regular opener took 59 balls to reach double figures.

Weinstein, who is battling sexual assault charges in New York, parted ways with his high-powered lawyer Benjamin Brafman and brought on new lawyers to represent him in the case. Lawyer Jose Baez confirmed that he and Harvard Law School professor Ronald Sullivan have been hired by Weinstein. \u201cMr Weinstein steadfastly maintains his innocence in this matter and we are looking forward to assisting Mr Weinstein in his defense,\u201d Baez said on Wednesday. The pair were also lawyers for McGowan, an actor who says Weinstein raped her, when she faced drug charges in Virginia. McGowan ripped the lawyers for going to work for the one-time movie mogul, who is accused of rape, assault and harassment by multiple women. \u201cThis is a major conflict of interest, but I knew there was shadiness going on behind the scenes,\u201d she told the Daily Beast. McGowan pleaded no contest to the charges, which stemmed from cocaine found in a wallet she left on a plane, and got no jail time. Baez is known for his defense of Casey Anthony, who was acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter. He and Sullivan also worked on the defense of the former Patriots player Aaron Hernandez. Weinstein is also bringing on attorneys Duncan Levin and Pamela Mackey, the Wall Street Journal and others reported. The parties are due in court on Friday morning before Judge James Burke, who will have to sign off on the change in lawyers.

      "body": "<p>A fugitive who<strong> </strong>was convicted of killing a woman in a speedboat crash on the Thames has been arrested in Georgia.</p> \n<p>Jack Shepherd, 31, was sentenced in his absence to a six-year jail term for the manslaughter by gross negligence of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown. Police issued an arrest warrant after he failed to attend his trial at the Old Bailey in July.</p> \n<p>In a statement, the Metropolitan police said: \u201cWe have received information from the National Crime Agency (NCA) that Jack Shepherd, who is wanted on an international arrest warrant, is in the custody of police in Georgia.\u201d</p> \n<p>Georgia\u2019s embassy in London said he surrendered himself to police on Wednesday, after Ms Brown\u2019s family increased their calls for him to return to face justice.</p> \n<p>Her father, Graham Brown, celebrated the \u201coverwhelming\u201d development, writing on Facebook: \u201cJustice for Charlotte is close!\u201d</p> \n<p>Shepherd and Ms Brown met on the dating website OkCupid and were on their first date when they were involved in a speedboat crash on 8 December 2015. Shepherd had taken her for a meal at the Shard before suggesting they take a late-night boat ride past the Houses of Parliament.</p> \n<p>The boat hit a submerged log near Wandsworth Bridge and capsized, flinging Ms Brown into the river. Shepherd was rescued after being found clinging to the upturned hull. Ms Brown was found unconscious and unresponsive. A postmortem found she died from cold water immersion.</p> \n<p>A jury heard the boat\u2019s lifejackets had been tucked away, the kill cord was not connected and the boat had a number of defects including faulty steering. The prosecutor, Aftab Jafferjee QC, told the court it was \u201csheer madness\u201d to take the boat out that night.</p> \n<p>Shepherd, originally from Exeter, was sentenced in his absence, but despite being on the run, he applied to the court of appeal via his lawyers for the right to appeal against his conviction in August. He was granted permission on 19 December.</p> \n<p>The family of Ms Brown, known to loved ones as Charli, raised the pressure in recent weeks. They met the home secretary, Sajid Javid, on Tuesday and renewed calls for Shepherd to surrender himself.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday a spokesman for the Georgian embassy said Shepherd had \u201cjust surrendered himself to the Georgian police\u201d who were now carrying out \u201crelevant detaining formalities\u201d.</p> \n<p>Footage on the Georgian television station Rustavi2 showed a heavily bearded Shepherd, wearing a long coat, jeans and a checked scarf, smiling as he entered a police station in the country\u2019s capital, Tbilisi.</p> \n<p>He told reporters: \u201cYes my name is Jack Shepherd.

      "bodyText": "A fugitive who was convicted of killing a woman in a speedboat crash on the Thames has been arrested in Georgia. Jack Shepherd, 31, was sentenced in his absence to a six-year jail term for the manslaughter by gross negligence of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown. Police issued an arrest warrant after he failed to attend his trial at the Old Bailey in July. In a statement, the Metropolitan police said: \u201cWe have received information from the National Crime Agency (NCA) that Jack Shepherd, who is wanted on an international arrest warrant, is in the custody of police in Georgia.\u201d Georgia\u2019s embassy in London said he surrendered himself to police on Wednesday, after Ms Brown\u2019s family increased their calls for him to return to face justice. Her father, Graham Brown, celebrated the \u201coverwhelming\u201d development, writing on Facebook: \u201cJustice for Charlotte is close!\u201d Shepherd and Ms Brown met on the dating website OkCupid and were on their first date when they were involved in a speedboat crash on 8 December 2015. Shepherd had taken her for a meal at the Shard before suggesting they take a late-night boat ride past the Houses of Parliament. The boat hit a submerged log near Wandsworth Bridge and capsized, flinging Ms Brown into the river. Shepherd was rescued after being found clinging to the upturned hull. Ms Brown was found unconscious and unresponsive. A postmortem found she died from cold water immersion. A jury heard the boat\u2019s lifejackets had been tucked away, the kill cord was not connected and the boat had a number of defects including faulty steering. The prosecutor, Aftab Jafferjee QC, told the court it was \u201csheer madness\u201d to take the boat out that night. Shepherd, originally from Exeter, was sentenced in his absence, but despite being on the run, he applied to the court of appeal via his lawyers for the right to appeal against his conviction in August. He was granted permission on 19 December. The family of Ms Brown, known to loved ones as Charli, raised the pressure in recent weeks. They met the home secretary, Sajid Javid, on Tuesday and renewed calls for Shepherd to surrender himself. On Wednesday a spokesman for the Georgian embassy said Shepherd had \u201cjust surrendered himself to the Georgian police\u201d who were now carrying out \u201crelevant detaining formalities\u201d. Footage on the Georgian television station Rustavi2 showed a heavily bearded Shepherd, wearing a long coat, jeans and a checked scarf, smiling as he entered a police station in the country\u2019s capital, Tbilisi. He told reporters: \u201cYes my name is Jack Shepherd. I was involved in a tragic accident \u2026 in which a lady called Charlotte Brown tragically died.\u201d Following the meeting with the home secretary on Tuesday, Graham Brown said Javid had underlined his personal commitment to the hunt for Shepherd. \u201cOur message is clear: there can be no hiding place for Jack Shepherd,\u201d Brown said. \u201cNo one should give support, assistance or encouragement to him other than to do what he should have done in the first instance, which is to hand himself in. \u201cJack Shepherd was able to abscond whilst on unconditional bail. The police and other agencies have a responsibility to do whatever it takes to ensure that justice is served.\u201d In a statement, the home secretary said he had told the family the authorities would \u201cstrain every sinew and explore every option to bring them the justice they deserve\u201d. On Wednesday evening, Brown told BBC Radio 5 Live he felt \u201can overwhelming sense of emotion\u201d at the news. \u201cMy opinions towards Jack Shepherd is that he\u2019s a very crass, reckless man, who managed to abscond and stick two fingers up at the judiciary,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s got to come back to atone for all that and I think that he\u2019s done the right thing, and thank goodness he\u2019s realised that now and handed himself in.\u201d Katie Brown, Charlotte\u2019s sister, voiced surprise about Shepherd\u2019s \u201csmug\u201d appearance on clips aired by a Georgian TV channel. She told BBC News: \u201cI feel very surprised at how smug he looks to be honest. \u201cIt just shows a very arrogant man. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how someone can go on the run for two crimes and be found guilty and still then just walk straight in with a very smug look on his face and claim innocence. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d She said she found his claims of innocence \u201cbaffling\u201d. She added: \u201cThe thing that I find quite baffling is he\u2019s still maintaining his innocence. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s run away from this doesn\u2019t scream an innocent man\u2019s actions to me. Why did he run away if he\u2019s claiming innocence?\u201d Javid said: \u201cWe will seek to swiftly extradite him to Britain. It is vital Charlotte Brown\u2019s family see justice done.\u201d The family\u2019s local MP, James Brokenshire, said Shepherd\u2019s \u201cwanton and selfish actions\u201d had heaped further strain on the family \u201cat a time of unimaginable grief\u201d. \u201cNothing can take away their loss, but I hope this may now offer some sense of justice,\u201d the communities secretary added. Scotland Yard, the force leading the investigation, said officers had been updated by the National Crime Agency on the development and were awaiting confirmation of Shepherd\u2019s identity. But, the Metropolitan police added that once identity was secured, extradition proceedings \u201cwill begin immediately\u201d against Shepherd, who was wanted on an international arrest warrant. Georgian law states that extradition is granted over convicted individuals if they have been sentenced to at least four months\u2019 imprisonment.",

Prices in Sydney have now fallen by 11.4% since their peak in mid-2017 but the median house price in Sydney remains above the $1m mark first set in 2015.

He said the proposal to not allow public hearings for public-sector cases \u2013 as opposed to investigations of law enforcement \u2013 made no sense. Nor did the proposed body\u2019s narrow remit, the high burdens of proof needed to initiate an investigation, its inability to take public tip-offs and its lack of resources. </p> <p><strong>The funeral of international student Aiia Maasarwe, who was murdered in Melbourne last week, has taken place in Israel. </strong>Maasarwe, a Palestinian citizen of Israel who was studying in Melbourne, was killed after getting off a tram near La Trobe University at Bundoora. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/24/aiia-maasarwes-funeral-held-in-israel-a-week-after-her-in-melbourne\">The 21-year-old was buried in her hometown of Baka al-Gharbiyye</a>, an hour north of Tel Aviv.

A sign outside the mosque read \u201cviolence is the language of filthy ones\u201d in Arabic. After prayers, Maasarwe\u2019s coffin was carried out by close family members draped in silver cloth and lowered into the ground just after 11am local time.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"daa539f379903d36a434ae424827f54227e6d309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/daa539f379903d36a434ae424827f54227e6d309/0_38_3510_2106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Assange on a balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian Assange on a balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Wikileaks founder Julian Assange</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/23/julian-assange-launches-legal-challenge-against-trump-administration-extradition\">is launching a legal challenge against the Trump administration</a>. </strong>Assange\u2019s lawyers are attempting to \u201cunseal\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/16/julian-assange-wikileaks-have-criminal-charges-been-prepared-us\">secret US charges against him</a>, to try and prevent Assange\u2019s extradition to the US at a time that a new Ecuadorian government has been making his stay in the central London apartment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/29/assange-must-follow-new-ecuador-embassy-rules-says-judge\">increasingly inhospitable</a>.</p> <p><strong>The European Union\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, warned that the \u201cdefault\u201d for the UK is crashing out, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/23/michel-barnier-warns-against-time-limited-irish-backstop\">if MPs could not coalesce around a new vision of its future outside the bloc</a><strong>. </strong>\u201cThere appears to be a majority in the Commons to oppose a no-deal but opposing a no-deal will not stop a no-deal from happening at the end of March,\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, has declared himself interim president of the beleaguered South American country,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/23/enezuela-trump-president-juan-guaido-maduro-recognition-news-latest\">in a dramatic escalation of efforts to force President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power.</a> </p> <p><strong>More than 500 people are being ousted from a refugee reception centre in a town close to Rome,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/23/italy-evicts-more-than-500-people-refugee-centre-near-rome\">in the first major eviction</a> since Italy\u2019s rightwing populist government enacted hardline immigration measures into law. </p> <h2>Opinion and analysis</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fef2eff24f487bde31a733cb2aa260ed0b4014f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fef2eff24f487bde31a733cb2aa260ed0b4014f4/159_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A student from Covington Catholic High School stands in front of Native American Vietnam veteran Nathan Phillips in Washington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A student from Covington Catholic High School stands in front of Native American Vietnam veteran Nathan Phillips in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kaya Taitano/Social Media/Kaya Taitano/Social Media/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The standoff between students and a Native American man reveals who gets compassion, and who doesn\u2019t,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/23/native-american-racism-video-covington-school-nick-sandmann\">writes Julian Brave NoiseCat.</a> The US is still not ready to examine its \u201cugly racism\u201d against Native Americans, and those tensions came to the fore this week when an old man and a young, white Trump supporter locked eyes. \u201cAs an Indian, the fear of a face-to-face encounter with a sneering white superior is deeply engrained in my psychology.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 24 January. Top stories House prices in Sydney have recorded their sharpest downturn in more than two decades, falling by 10% in the past 12 months. The latest report from Domain Group for the fourth quarter of 2018 has revealed Australia\u2019s housing market has continued to slow, with national prices recording the steepest annual fall in 15 years while Sydney house prices are back to mid-2016 levels. Prices in Sydney have now fallen by 11.4% since their peak in mid-2017 but the median house price in Sydney remains above the $1m mark first set in 2015. Nationally, house prices fell by 1.8% over the quarter and 6.5% over the year to $766,438. A former judge of Victoria\u2019s highest court has attacked the Coalition\u2019s proposal for an anti-corruption body, describing it as a sham designed to shield politicians and public servants from scrutiny. Stephen Charles, a retired Victorian court of appeal judge, said there was simply \u201cno justification\u201d for the Coalition\u2019s proposal to limit the commission\u2019s powers when investigating the public sector. He said the proposal to not allow public hearings for public-sector cases \u2013 as opposed to investigations of law enforcement \u2013 made no sense. Nor did the proposed body\u2019s narrow remit, the high burdens of proof needed to initiate an investigation, its inability to take public tip-offs and its lack of resources. The funeral of international student Aiia Maasarwe, who was murdered in Melbourne last week, has taken place in Israel. Maasarwe, a Palestinian citizen of Israel who was studying in Melbourne, was killed after getting off a tram near La Trobe University at Bundoora. The 21-year-old was buried in her hometown of Baka al-Gharbiyye, an hour north of Tel Aviv. After arriving from Australia, her coffin was transported to the local mosque, where prayers were held for her. Cars jammed the streets, many displaying black flags. A sign outside the mosque read \u201cviolence is the language of filthy ones\u201d in Arabic. After prayers, Maasarwe\u2019s coffin was carried out by close family members draped in silver cloth and lowered into the ground just after 11am local time. World Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is launching a legal challenge against the Trump administration. Assange\u2019s lawyers are attempting to \u201cunseal\u201d secret US charges against him, to try and prevent Assange\u2019s extradition to the US at a time that a new Ecuadorian government has been making his stay in the central London apartment increasingly inhospitable. The European Union\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, warned that the \u201cdefault\u201d for the UK is crashing out, if MPs could not coalesce around a new vision of its future outside the bloc. \u201cThere appears to be a majority in the Commons to oppose a no-deal but opposing a no-deal will not stop a no-deal from happening at the end of March,\u201d he said. Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, has declared himself interim president of the beleaguered South American country, in a dramatic escalation of efforts to force President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power. More than 500 people are being ousted from a refugee reception centre in a town close to Rome, in the first major eviction since Italy\u2019s rightwing populist government enacted hardline immigration measures into law. Opinion and analysis The standoff between students and a Native American man reveals who gets compassion, and who doesn\u2019t, writes Julian Brave NoiseCat. The US is still not ready to examine its \u201cugly racism\u201d against Native Americans, and those tensions came to the fore this week when an old man and a young, white Trump supporter locked eyes. \u201cAs an Indian, the fear of a face-to-face encounter with a sneering white superior is deeply engrained in my psychology. I cannot watch that film and not think about the youth hockey opponent who knocked me down while yelling \u201cIndian boy!\u201d Or the man who accused my father and I of stealing our own car.\u201d On Wednesday, Treasury released a department discussion paper on how to tax those who work in the share economy for companies such as Uber and Airbnb. It shines a spotlight on how those who often earn below award rates gain little benefit from the flexibility of being treated as individual contractors, compared with the companies that reap profits from such earnings, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cThere is no real issue with Uber drivers having to pay tax \u2013 all workers should do that \u2013 but the treatment of them as independent contractors despite some working effectively a full-time level of hours highlights the lack of security such workers have.\u201d Sport Serena Williams, her movement cramped late in the match by a rolled ankle, blew a third-set 5-1 lead, four match points, a rematch with Naomi Osaka and a chance to equal the 24 slam titles of Margaret Court in a dramatic Australian Open quarter-final in Melbourne. Karolina Pliskova remained calm as Williams disintegrated physically after her left ankle collapsed under her during a foot-fault when in sight of victory, and went on to win 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. Usain Bolt will long be remembered as one of the greatest runners the world has ever seen, but he has finally given up on his dream of playing professional football, saying his \u201csports life is over\u201d. Novak Djokovic is into the Australian Open semi-finals after his opponent Kei Nishikori retired 6-1, 4-1. Nishikori sustained a thigh injury early on in what has been described as an \u201cappalling\u201d match. Djokovic will play France\u2019s Lucas Pouille in semi-finals Thinking time: who\u2019s set to sweep Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100? Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100 is being counted down this Sunday \u2013 moved, for the second year in a row, from Australia Day. Our music columnist Nathan Jolly runs down the songs hotly tipped to claim the top spots, with Australian acts set to dominate the top 20. Sydney band Ocean Alley is the frontrunner for No 1, with Childish Gambino\u2019s racially charged This is America another strong contender. Jolly writes: \u201cThe only other song with a real chance of taking #1 is Amy Shark\u2019s I Said Hi, a blistering kiss off to record label executives who rejected her music during the early days of her career.\u201d Media roundup A group of conservative Coalition MPs are calling for Australia Day to be protected by legislation, and the date to remain unchanged, the Australian reports. South Australia and Victoria are bracing for \u201cscorching\u201d conditions today, the ABC reports, with climate records broken in both states this past week. Described as a \u201csevere heatwave\u201d, experts expect more records will be smashed today. Kimberley MP Josie Farrer is calling on the state government to allow the use of traditional Aboriginal laws in a bid to tackle high youth suicide rates, the West Australian reports. Farrer says \u201cwhite man\u2019s\u201d response to Indigenous social issues and crime has failed, and left her feeling \u201c \u201cangry, frustrated and powerless\u201d after a spate of deaths. Coming up Weather forecasters say heat records across South Australia could topple today. Adelaide is forecast to hit 45C, but the Bureau of Meteorology says the city\u2019s 80-year-old record high of 46.1C is within reach.

Other shareholders are considering legal action after their investments in Patisserie Holdings, the parent company of brands including Patisserie Valerie, Druckers Vienna Patisserie and Philpotts, were wiped out when the business went into administration on Tuesday. More than 900 staff have already lost their jobs as the administrator, KPMG, announced on Wednesday that 71 outlets had closed immediately, including the original Patisserie Valerie outlet, which has been trading on Old Compton Street in central London since the 1940s.

      "bodyText": "The US Department of Labor (DoL) has accused the tech firm Oracle of widespread discrimination against women and people of color, including more than $400m in lost wages and rampant exclusion of black and Hispanic people in hiring. A federal complaint filed on Tuesday said that out of roughly 500 people hired into technical jobs over a four-year period, only five were Hispanic and only six were African American. The DoL has also alleged that more than 5,000 women have been underpaid, with disparities as high as 20%, and that more than 11,000 Asian employees have been underpaid, with gaps as high as 8%. The extraordinary claims from US labor officials targeting one of the largest corporations in Silicon Valley build upon evidence civil rights lawyers outlined in a class-action gender discrimination case last week. The DoL\u2019s new complaint is significant because it includes a detailed analysis of both Oracle\u2019s hiring practices and the way women and people of color face \u201cextreme\u201d disparities throughout their careers at the firm. The case also represents a remarkable challenge to the tech sector, with serious allegations coming from a branch of Trump\u2019s conservative administration, which has generally been hostile on issues of labor rights, racial discrimination and gender equality. The DoL complaint echoes labor investigators\u2019 claims against Google, which has battled high-profile accusations of systemic wage disparities.

This means \u201can increasing pay gap as those employees devote more of their lives to Oracle\u201d, the DoL wrote. The disparity in pay for women in product development, IT and support jobs from 2013 to 2016 corresponds to losses of at least $165m in total compensation, the complaint said. The DoL\u2019s analysis controlled for employees\u2019 time at the company, experience, job category and other factors. The fewer than 30 black employees at Oracle have also been underpaid relative to their white counterparts, suffering pay disparities as high as 7.5%, the complaint said. The DoL first sued Oracle in 2017, just before Trump was inaugurated, and the new complaint this week asks the courts to require Oracle to pay lost wages and correct discriminatory compensation and hiring practices.

      "bodyText": "A powerful House committee now led by Democrats has launched an investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s use of security clearances, accusing the White House and the 2016 presidential transition team of \u201cgrave breaches\u201d in the process that awards access to some of the nation\u2019s most closely guarded secrets. The inquiry by the House oversight and reform committee, announced on Wednesday, takes direct aim at some of those closest to the president over the past two years, including the former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and former White House aide Rob Porter. The review also sets up one of the first potential fights between a Democrat-led House committee and a White House bracing for a number of investigations in the wake of last year\u2019s midterm elections that eroded Republican control in Congress. Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the oversight committee chairman, said in a letter to the White House that he was undertaking the investigation in response to \u201cgrave breaches of national security at the highest level of the Trump administration\u201d. \u201cThe goals of this investigation are to determine why the White House and Transition Team appear to have disregarded established procedures for safeguarding classified information, evaluate the extent to which the nation\u2019s most highly guarded secrets were provided to officials who should not have had access to them, and develop reforms to remedy the flaws in current White House systems and practices,\u201d he wrote. Questions over security clearances have long plagued the Trump White House. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn maintained a security clearance even after lying to the FBI about his secret conversations with the Russian ambassador to the US. Trump\u2019s former staff secretary Rob Porter operated on an interim security clearance despite allegations of spousal abuse. And the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was forced to revise his form three times after omitting 100 foreign contacts while applying for top-level security clearance. That move resulted in Kushner having his access downgraded, though it was restored last May after the completion of his background check. Cummings has also requested documents pertaining to the former White House chief of staff John Kelly\u2019s own internal review of the security clearance process in 2018, which according to his statement \u201cfound that 34 White House officials who had started working on the first day of the Trump administration were still working with interim security clearances as of November 2017 and that more than 130 political appointees in the Executive Office of the President were working with interim security clearances as of that date\u201d. In addition to investigating specific security clearances granted to White House officials, Cummings is asking the White House to explain why it has failed to provide Congress with information about its security clearance process as required by a law passed last year. The law required the White House to provide Congress a report on its security clearance procedures by last August. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Emerging from a meeting with Theresa May in Downing Street, Sturgeon said the prime minister was pursuing a strategy that is \u201cdestined to fail\u201d by trying to win over Brexiters instead of seeking a cross-party consensus. \u201cTo be frank, there wasn\u2019t much indication that the prime minister is listening to, or hearing, the concerns of the people of Scotland and no doubt across the UK about trade and the economy and population,\u201d Sturgeon said. \u201cThere\u2019s no real sign of any willingness to compromise on the red lines that have so constrained the position she finds herself in. \u201cIt seems to me that her priority is trying to win support from the DUP and the hardline Brexiters in her own party, rather than genuinely trying to compromise to bring others onside \u2013 and that strikes me as a course of action that is destined to fail. So I remain really concerned that we\u2019re in a position now where we need to be seeking an extension of A50, otherwise the no-deal cliff-edge gets ever closer.\u201d May has summoned a series of \u201csenior parliamentarians\u201d to Downing Street for meetings in recent days, and will meet union leaders on Thursday. Number 10 highlights promises on workers\u2019 rights, and a pledge to involve parliament more in the next stage of Brexit negotiations, as evidence that May is willing to be flexible. But like several others who have met the prime minister since her Brexit deal was defeated by a historic majority of 230, Sturgeon said she detected little sign of compromise. The past week has seen a significant change in Sturgeon\u2019s tone. Last Thursday, she told the Scottish parliament that she would set out her plans for a second independence referendum \u201cin the coming weeks,\u201d even if Article 50 is extended, having previously insisted that she wanted to wait for the \u201cfog\u201d of Brexit uncertainty to clear. On Wednesday she referenced the SNP\u2019s \u201ccast-iron\u201d mandate to hold a second independence referendum: \u201cTheresa May fears she would lose an independence referendum and is clearly running scared of the verdict of the Scottish people, who must be sick and tired of being told what the prime minister wants. \u201cFrankly, what Scotland needs is much more important than what the prime minister wants.\u201d A government spokesman said Sturgeon and the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, would be asked to attend meetings of a new cabinet subcommittee to discuss Brexit \u2013 and added that May had \u201cmade clear that the right way to rule out no deal is to agree a deal, and that is what the government wants to achieve.\u201d It is not clear how much the ongoing pressure from those pro-independence activists who are anxious to kickstart a referendum campaign before the SNP mandate runs out at the next Holyrood elections in 2021 has influenced Sturgeon\u2019s thinking. She is also embroiled in a bitter row with her predecessor Alex Salmond about the Scottish government\u2019s handling of a botched investigation into claims of sexual harassment against the former first minister. Sturgeon must balance calls from within her own party for a clearer signal about her referendum plans with those who caution that public opinion on independence has not shifted sufficiently, despite Scottish voters\u2019 hostility to Brexit, and that the party has yet to build a substantial case for leaving the UK that offers convincing arguments to questions around currency, borders and EU membership. The SNP MP and prominent People\u2019s Vote supporter Joanna Cherry raised the possibility of holding a second independence referendum during the transition period on Twitter on Wednesday. And on Monday the long-serving SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil called on Sturgeon to drop support for a second EU referendum and instead put the case for a fresh vote on Scottish independence to the fore. Earlier, at prime minister\u2019s questions, May appeared to harden her objection to another independence referendum. Previously, she had insisted, \u201cnow is not the time\u201d for another vote. But responding to a question from the Scottish Conservative Stephen Kerr, May said: \u201cThe last thing we want is a second independence referendum. The United Kingdom should be pulling together, and should not be being driven apart.\u201d",

In much less doubt are his personal fortunes: the MP is receiving almost \u00a3100,000 from two part-time business posts. The latest register of MPs interests shows Davis has acquired two new jobs on top of his role representing Haltemprice and Howden in parliament. One, as an \u201cexternal adviser\u201d to JCB, makes him \u00a360,000 for 20 hours of work a year. Anthony Bamford, the digger company\u2019s chairman, is among the few high-profile businesspeople to be a strong advocate of Brexit. Bamford, a Conservative peer, quit the CBI in protest against the business group\u2019s contrary view. Another of Davis\u2019s new interests is as board member for Mansfelder Kupfer und Messing, a German manufacturing company, for which he is paid \u00a336,085 for the six months from December. He is also \u201celigible for the management incentive plan\u201d. For both appointments, the entry says, Davis has consulted the government\u2019s advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), which rules on the sort of jobs former ministers and other senior government figures can do after departing, to avoid issues such as potential conflicts of interest. While MPs can take outside jobs, within certain parameters, serving ministers cannot \u2013 which can mean their overall incomes fall despite the extra ministerial salary. Geoffrey Cox, when he was made attorney general in July, had to give up his private QC activities, which made him anything up to \u00a3600,000 a year on top of his MP\u2019s salary. The financial fortunes of Boris Johnson, who also left the cabinet in protest against Theresa May\u2019s planned Brexit deal, have also risen since he returned to the backbenches. The register of interests shows Uxbridge and South Ruislip\u2019s MP, who is paid almost \u00a323,000 a month for his Daily Telegraph column, received \u00a328,900 for a single speaking engagement in December.",

All our hearts are very red.\u201d</p> <p>Mick was 13 when his father sustained a brain injury in a skiing accident from which he has yet to recover. He has since pursued a careful path that has put him on the brink of F1 and potentially to follow his father into the most prized seat in motorsport.</p> <p>He entered the European F3 Championship in 2017 and, after a season getting to grips with the series last year, won eight of the final 15 races to take the title. This year he steps up to F2 with the same Prema team and the move comes with no little expectation.</p> <p>The Italian team have won six of the seven European F3 championships in which they have competed. In GP2 (now F2), they have two out of three \u2013 boasting drivers\u2019 champions in Pierre Gasly in 2016 and Charles Leclerc in 2017.

Just being on the books of the Prancing Horse comes with great responsibility before you throw the Schumacher name into the mix.</p> <p>The attention he will now receive will be of another level. Equally, he must come to terms with a new car and the Pirelli tyres it uses amid experienced competitors such as Nyck de Vries and Britain\u2019s Jack Aitken.</p> <p>On top of which it is likely he will make his debut in an F1 car. There are two scheduled tests in 2019 and out of the four days two must be run by a driver who has competed in fewer than two F1 races, a criteria Mick meets.</p> <p>A Schumacher once again behind the wheel of Ferrari, even for a test, would lead to a media frenzy and he has already tasted what might be coming. In December 2014 he had a minor off in testing at the Lausitzring speedway that was reported as a \u201cterrifying crash\u201d.</p> <p>Holding it together under the harshest of spotlights is his new task but there is confidence he will be up to it. Lewis Hamilton is optimistic Mick can cope. \u201cHe has got great talent like his dad,\u201d the world champion has said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it will be a burden.\u201d</p> <p>If he is feeling that weight, Mick has worn it well. At Oschersleben he went from 19th to ninth and a podium place for best rookie. The crowd filed out happy they had perhaps been there for the start of something special. Mick has gone on to prove he has every intention of living up to the Schumacher name but the real challenge lies ahead.</p>",

All our hearts are very red.\u201d Mick was 13 when his father sustained a brain injury in a skiing accident from which he has yet to recover. He has since pursued a careful path that has put him on the brink of F1 and potentially to follow his father into the most prized seat in motorsport. He entered the European F3 Championship in 2017 and, after a season getting to grips with the series last year, won eight of the final 15 races to take the title. This year he steps up to F2 with the same Prema team and the move comes with no little expectation. The Italian team have won six of the seven European F3 championships in which they have competed. In GP2 (now F2), they have two out of three \u2013 boasting drivers\u2019 champions in Pierre Gasly in 2016 and Charles Leclerc in 2017. Leclerc, also a member of the Ferrari academy at the time, completed a superb season for Sauber last year and will join Sebastian Vettel at Ferrari this season. Leclerc was a star in the making but even in 2017 when I interviewed him at Prema he was accompanied by a Ferrari representative. Just being on the books of the Prancing Horse comes with great responsibility before you throw the Schumacher name into the mix. The attention he will now receive will be of another level. Equally, he must come to terms with a new car and the Pirelli tyres it uses amid experienced competitors such as Nyck de Vries and Britain\u2019s Jack Aitken. On top of which it is likely he will make his debut in an F1 car. There are two scheduled tests in 2019 and out of the four days two must be run by a driver who has competed in fewer than two F1 races, a criteria Mick meets. A Schumacher once again behind the wheel of Ferrari, even for a test, would lead to a media frenzy and he has already tasted what might be coming. In December 2014 he had a minor off in testing at the Lausitzring speedway that was reported as a \u201cterrifying crash\u201d. Holding it together under the harshest of spotlights is his new task but there is confidence he will be up to it. Lewis Hamilton is optimistic Mick can cope. \u201cHe has got great talent like his dad,\u201d the world champion has said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it will be a burden.\u201d If he is feeling that weight, Mick has worn it well. At Oschersleben he went from 19th to ninth and a podium place for best rookie. The crowd filed out happy they had perhaps been there for the start of something special. Mick has gone on to prove he has every intention of living up to the Schumacher name but the real challenge lies ahead.",

      "bodyText": "Until very recently, Juan Guaid\u00f3, the 35-year-old leader of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-controlled national assembly, was an unknown figure on the international stage. That changed on Wednesday, when the young politician stood before thousands of protesters in Caracas and swore himself in as interim president \u2013 a move that was immediately greeted by the US and Canadian governments. Guaid\u00f3 first signalled that he was willing to mount a serious challenge to the country\u2019s president in early January when Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, began his second term of office following elections last summer that were widely denounced as fraudulent. The inauguration was met with a chorus of international disapproval, and Guaid\u00f3, just six days into his post, told the world he was ready to assume the presidency until free and fair elections could be held \u2013 provided he had the vital support of the military. His announcement was a rare open challenge to Maduro\u2019s rule, and won support from the head of the Organisation of American States \u2013 but also prompted fears it could provoke a fresh crackdown on the opposition. Maduro, who has overseen deepening economic and political turmoil, made light of his relatively inexperienced challenger. \u201cA lot of people in Venezuela are going to ask what is this \u2018Guaid\u00f3\u2019?\u201d he joked in a Friday night TV address. But days later, Guaid\u00f3 was briefly detained by the intelligence services \u2013 something Maduro\u2019s administration blamed on rogue operatives. \u201cLook what they are doing,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told a rally of supporters following his release. \u201cThey are desperate in [the presidential palace] Miraflores \u2026 We are survivors, not victims!\u201d Raised in La Guaira, a port city 20 miles from Caracas, Guaid\u00f3 cut his political teeth during 2007 student protests against Maduro\u2019s late predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who was then seeking to consolidate power. Ch\u00e1vez put various constitutional amendments, including the abolition of presidential term limits and the ability to unilaterally declare a national emergency, to a public referendum. But the vote handed Ch\u00e1vez his only electoral defeat in a nine-year presidency, and emboldened a nascent opposition movement, including Guaid\u00f3\u2019s charismatic but divisive mentor, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, who has been under house arrest and barred from political office since early 2014. It was L\u00f3pez who tapped Guaid\u00f3, 12 years his junior, to lead his Popular Will party\u2019s coalition in the national assembly when its mandate began on 5 January. Guaid\u00f3 had just finished his first full term as a legislator, having been elected in 2015. Though largely defined by his opposition to Maduro, Guaid\u00f3 supports a market economy and granting fiscal autonomy to regional governments, in line with the party\u2019s policies. \u201cGuaid\u00f3 is a fighter and an eternal optimist \u2026 he\u2019s humble and sincere,\u201d said Freddy Guevara, an opposition leader and friend of Guaid\u00f3, in a telephone call from the Chilean ambassador\u2019s residence in Caracas, where he is seeking asylum. \u201cHe gets along with everyone and doesn\u2019t have the typical profile of a politician.\u201d Many in Venezuela thought Maduro had successfully neutered the assembly in 2017, when he sidelined it in favour of a more pliant constituent assembly via elections which were also widely labelled a sham. L\u00f3pez, was one of the opposition\u2019s most radical and confrontational leaders, but few had expected his protege Guaid\u00f3 to mount such a brazen challenge to Maduro. \u201cHe was incredibly brave and now runs risks that he\u2019ll be jailed, tortured or need to go into exile,\u201d said David Smolansky, an opposition leader, who was also forced to flee Venezuela and is now living in the US. \u201cHowever, he decided to go ahead. He\u2019s part of my generation; a brave generation that grew up under a dictatorship.\u201d Guaid\u00f3 is no stranger to adversity. His family survived a devastating landslide in his hometown in 1999 that killed as many as 30,000 people, and he claims to bear scars on his neck from rubber bullets fired at protesters in 2017 in Caracas. On Wednesday, he told the crowd he knew he was taking a potentially risky step. \u201cWe know that this will have consequences,\u201d he told supporters. \u201cTo be able to achieve this task and to re-establish the constitution we need the agreement of all Venezuelans.\u201d",

The shadow justice secretary told the court he agreed that the logo of Hitler\u2019s SS is a \u201cglobally recognised symbol of unparalleled evil\u201d but claimed he did not see any similarity between the Nazi logo and the \u201cS\u201d in the image posted by Dream Troll. At one point proceedings paused briefly while lawyers explained the identity of the singer Lemmy from Mot\u00f6rhead to the high court judge, amid lengthy discussions over the current popularity of Black Sabbath in the United Kingdom and Burgon\u2019s views on the use of gothic typography by the band Kiss. The court heard of WhatsApp messages sent by Labour adviser Ben Foley discussing how to respond to the Sun\u2019s inquiry about Burgon\u2019s involvement with the band, amid concerns that the story could have wider consequences. \u201cThey could seek to turn this into another \u2018problem with antisemitism\u2019 story, especially as they can time this with passover,\u201d he said. Burgon was also shown a series of Nazi posters and asked to repeatedly agree that Nazi imagery relied heavily on the same red, white and black colour scheme used in the post by Dream Tr\u00f6ll. Burgon insisted that a similar colour scheme was also used by the likes of Sunderland football club and the Sun. \u201cI did not associate with a band that delights in Nazi iconography and would not do so,\u201d he said. Burgon\u2019s lawyer said the Sun had deliberately exaggerated the story to create a political controversy: \u201cThe intention behind any work of art is crucial to the understanding of it \u2026 The defendants accept that Mr Burgon is not a Nazi and there have never been any grounds to believe that he is, that Mr Burgon is not an antisemite, that Dream Tr\u00f6ll are not Nazis, that they are not Nazi sympathisers, and crucially they do not delight in using Nazi symbols or iconography.\u201d Burgon, who employed the services of libel lawyers Carter-Ruck for the case, did not know about the artwork until he was approached by the newspaper and has known the members of the band since they were teenagers. The court heard that Newton Dunn was first alerted to Burgon\u2019s connection with the band by an email tip from a Labour councillor. The story was allegedly pulled forward because the Sun\u2019s politics team had a thin newslist for the Good Friday edition of the paper and it was originally listed internally with the headline: \u201cWhat a Nazi Justice Secretary\u201d. The journalist then called the Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke to provide \u201csome political comment\u201d on the story, and the Dover MP provided criticism of Burgon without having seen the Black Sabbath album cover. Burgon\u2019s team insisted that the Sun took the social media post out of context and knowingly misrepresented it. They are seeking damages. The trial continues.",

The Davos mental health panel is getting a good reception. Here\u2019s some early reaction: Elsewhere in Davos, international trade secretary Liam Fox has held constructive talks with his Israeli counterpart - and not a champagne glass in sight. Fascinatingly, Prince William now suggests that Britain\u2019s wartime generation have been hurting themselves bottling up their feelings - rather than breaking down the stigma of mental health. British people are particularly bad at expressing emotions, the Duke jokes. He suggests it goes back to the war (he doesn\u2019t specify if he means world war 1 or 2). When people lost so many loved ones, and dealt with such devastation, they concluded that talking wouldn\u2019t fix the issue, William says. A whole generation decided this was the best way to deal with it, and then by accident they passed it onto their children, he explains. They learned the lesson that: This is how you deal with problems - you don\u2019t talk about them. Now, though, William believes a new generation has realised that this is not how to deal with the situation. Then, with his voice cracking briefly, he explains that there was \u2018one particular job\u2019 that really challenged his mental health. The packed hall at Davos sits, engrossed, in silence as Prince William explains his own mental health issues. He says he began feeling issues when he worked as an air ambulance, dealing with a lot of trauma every day. This has given him empathy and solidarity with the medical profession. They say it\u2019s a job, but my goodness they do a very hard job every day. It\u2019s normal to feel these emotions, William continues, adding: If you don\u2019t feel anything, you should get checked out for that. Prince William is now talking about the importance of removing the stigma around mental health. Since launching the Heads Together campaign, the Duke says, he regularly has people around the world thanking him -- because either they\u2019ve been affected, or they know someone who has. They\u2019re just grateful that someone has made it easier to discuss these issues, he says, adding: Ten years ago I knew nothing about mental health. I read about it, and became immersed in it, because it was a key social problem, globally, and someone had to burst the bubble. The Prince now warns that the scale of the mental health problem is enormous. We\u2019ve got to start tackling it now, because there are still so many people who are suffering in silence. There is still this stigma attached to mental health that we\u2019ve got to completely obliterate before we can move to the next stage. On the corporate side, HSBC CEO John Flint is discussing his efforts to make staff feel safe and secure in the workforce. There\u2019s a spectrum on mental health, and everyone is on it, he says. Flint then pays tribute to those within HSBC\u2019s workforce of 238,000 people who have been through mental illness, and come out the other side.. Those who have recovered often possess a resilience and a resourcefulness and an interest in human nature and an empathy and an EQ that the rest of us often don\u2019t possess. They are an absolute asset, and a community we should celebrate, he adds. Dr Dixon Chibanda, Director of the African Mental Health Research Initiative, is describing an important project called the \u2018Friendship Bench\u2019 , that aims to improve mental health. It\u2019s based on the idea of a physical bench where people in need can sit down and talk to someone. More details here. There\u2019s a friendship bench here at Davos: Now Jacinda Ardern explains that her government is prioritising mental health, because it affects everyone. One of the sad facts for New Zealand is that everyone knows someone who has taken their own life. We\u2019re a small country, of less than 5 million people, but last year more than 600 people committed suicide, she adds. Arden explains how she has been affected personally: I have lost friends, and I wouldn\u2019t have to look far in my cabinet to find other people who have too. The Duke of Cambridge is talking about how his charity work turned him into a committed, and pioneering, campaigner on mental health issues. Prince William says he has realised there is an \u201celephant in the room\u201d in all the charities he worked with - from addiction and homelessness to veterans\u2019 welfare and young disadvanted people. That was mental health. No-one was talking about it. No-one wanted to talk about it. So he, and the Duchess of Cambridge, created their Heads Together campaign to \u2018lance the boil\u2019 and let people speak and express themselves. But it wasn\u2019t easy. William reveals that not a single celebrity wanted to help his campaign, when he did a big ring round to drum up support. He says: No-one was interested in being part of Heads Together, because it was about mental health. But once the ball was rolling, and people saw how committed he and Catherine were, some \u201cvery brave\u201d people and celebrities came forward to speak out. Q: So have people who turned you down before now asked to be involved? It\u2019s much easier to get people involved now, he replies diplomatically. Becky Quick of CNBC is moderating the panel, and starts by warning that mental health isn\u2019t getting the attention it deserves. Poor mental health costs 2.5 trillion dollars in lost productivity and is a \u201cleading cause of disability worldwide.\u201d 90% of people with depression in low and middle-income get no help to all, Quick adds. The session begins with a video showing the scale of the mental health crisis, and some of the details are extremely serious. Suicide rates have spiked, it warns, with one person taking their own life every 40 seconds. Everyone, everywhere, must have someone to turn to in time of need. The world of business, government and education must come together to address this problem, with the time and money needed to make a difference. Now it\u2019s time for the WEF session on mental health. Prince William and Jacinda Ardern, PM of New Zealand, are appearing on a panel, alongside HSBC chief executive John Flint, and Bernard J. Tyson of Kaiser Permanente. The panel will discuss how the global community can promote mental health - a vital issue, given that one in four of us will experience mental illness in our lifetime. As well as the human cost, there\u2019s an economic cost too (hey, this is the World Economic Forum). Mental illness is expected to cost the global economy an estimated $6 trillion by 2030. The session is packed, as Davos delegates squeeze in to hear what the panel have to say. Boom! Chinese vice-president Wang Qishan has offered a hand of friendship to America. He says neither side wins from confrontation, and they should focus on creating a win-win situation instead. Unfortunately, with the US delegation back home, there\u2019s no-one to grasp it, as the clock ticks towards the end-of-February deadline for a trade war deal. Three protesters were arrested on the sidelines of the WEF this afternoon. Leo Hyde from the Public Services International Trade Union, who was among those arrested, said they were dressed as \u201ccorporate wolves\u201d to protest against investor state dispute settlement, which allows multinationals to sue governments in secretive international courts. They set up just outside of the main security barriers leading to the congress centre and released around an hour ago. He said they were arrested after just 30 seconds. \u201cDavos isn\u2019t a friendly place for protests,\u201d Hyde, who hails from France, said. \u201cWe were arrested and brought to an underground garage where the police took all our belongings, searched through our bags etc. \u201cWe were held there for around an hour and not allowed to speak to each other. They then made me delete some of the footage/photos off my SD card. We are not sure if we will be charged with anything or not.\u201d Back in London, Jeremy Corbyn challenged Theresa May at their weekly prime minister\u2019s questions session about why six cabinet ministers were going to Davos. Speaking afterwards, her official spokesman told journalists that ministers were there on business: \u201cI think you can see from the issues which they\u2019re due to be discussing, it\u2019s an important event, it\u2019s an opportunity to discuss investment opportunities in the UK, and it\u2019s an opportunity to discuss some really important technological issues which will help people\u2019s lives, such as AI\u201d Confirming that Philip Hammond (chancellor), Liam Fox (international trade secretary), Greg Clark (business secretary), Penny Mordaunt (international development) Jeremy Wright (culture, media and sport) and Matt Hancock (health), will all be there, he insisted, \u201cIf you look across the policy briefs of those ministers - the fact that Matt Hancock\u2019s there and Jeremy Wright\u2019s there - that does reflect the role technology\u2019s going to play going forward, the importance of government\u2019s industrial strategy. They will be focused on developing technologies in a way that can make a difference to people back home.\u201d Wang concludes with an absolutely classic piece of Davos-speak: In this changing world, making advance is like climbing a mountain. It is commitment, conviction and confidence that drive us forward. In this era of unfolding economic globalization, all of us mankind share a common stake. As a Swiss proverb goes, \u201cTorches light up each other.\u201d Let us illuminate the path ahead, progress together, ascend to the summit and jointly create a great future for all mankind. China\u2019s vice-president Wang Qishan has fired a couple of barbs at the west. On technology (a hot topic given the concerns over China\u2019s Huawei), Wang says: It is imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony, interfering in other countries\u2019 domestic affairs, and conducting, shielding or protecting technology-enabled activities that undermine other countries\u2019 national security. We need to respect the independent choices of model of technology management and of public policies made by countries, and their right to participating in the global technological governance system as equals. And on globalisation, Wang says inequality should be addressed - without stopping the global \u2018economic pie\u2019 growing. He calls for a targeted approach to address the problems created by globalization\u201d. What we need to do is make the pie bigger while looking for ways to share it in a more equitable way. The last thing we should do is to stop making the pie and just engage in a futile debate on how to divide it. Shifting blame for one\u2019s own problems onto others will not resolve the problems. Now Wang Qishan, Vice President of China, is addressing Davos. He starts by saying 2019 is the 40th anniversary of China\u2019s involvement in WEF (which is 49 this year), and the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Those seven decades have seen \u201cremarkable achievements\u201d, talking of a historical transformation in social productivity and national strength. This has deliver prosperity to its people who were once struggling to meet their basic living needs, Wang continues (breezily ignoring the tens of millions who died in the Great Leap Forwards). Wang claims China is becoming \u201can important force for upholding world peace and promoting common development\u201d. He gives Davos a history lesson, taking about how China fell behind because its emperors closed their doors to the world, when the west was industrialising and exploring the oceans. That was reversed by the Communist Party of China, as it began to create a New China 70 years ago. Taking questions, Angela Merkel speaks of how emotional it felt to sign the Aachen treaty with France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday [it will deepen ties between the two countries, but doesn\u2019t go as far as some had hoped]. She touches on the role of inequality in populism; if a businessman can make more money from selling a business than a craftsman can earn in a lifetime, people will wonder what is their work worth today? We cannot afford a split in society between those who want progress [and benefit from it], and those who carry the burden, she adds. Merkel also declines to say whether she\u2019d come back to Davos once she\u2019s stepped down as chancellor. You have me today, so you should be grateful for what you have, she jokes before leaving the stage. Angela Merkel summed up her defence of the current world order: \u201cWe have populist challenges, we have to stand up against them. I will come out strongly in favour of a multilateral order, not ending with the EU, but one that gives good answers to challenges of tomorrow Having rattled through her speech at her usual rapid pace, Merkel ends by telling the (now-packed) Davos congress hall that she will continue to defend the world order from attack. The existing world order must not be ruined, she concludes, returning to her earlier defence of globalisation and the institutions that underpin it. Onto Brexit! Where Merkel says \u201cwe must deal with the shock\u201d that Britain wants to leave the EU. All my efforts are devoted to making Brexit happen in as \u201cwell-ordered\u201d a manner as possible, she adds. We want to have a good future partnership with the UK she continues, saying that in key areas such as defence Germany is \u201cabsolutely dependent\u201d on its partnership with Britain. And on the issue of HOW Britain leaves, Merkel says that the less complicated relations with Britain are, the better. [But she doesn\u2019t offer any suggestion of new flexibility over the withdrawal deal or future relationship] Merkel shifts to the migration crisis that gripped Europe a couple of years ago. Germany\u2019s demographic changes mean we now have a policy of immigration for skilled labour, says Merkel (one of the big decisions by her new coalition government - and a change from the earlier open door approach Merkel pioneered). We need to manage migration better, but over recent years we have made great strides. She also urges Davos delegates to see Africa as a continent of hope, and of opportunity On climate change, Angela Merkel says it\u2019s a crucial problem, world leaders have a responsibility to solve it. BUT in almost the next breath, she hits out at calls for Germany to end its use of coal. Merkel points out that Berlin is also planning to end its nuclear power industry by 2020. The only energy source that can generate energy all the time is brown coal (cheaper and polluting) and hard coal, Merkel says. A commission is working its final conclusions, but Merkel seems to have pre-empted it, saying that Germany needs coal. We will continue to receive Russian natural gas, and other sources. If we leave coal, if we leave nuclear, we will need more natural gas - and energy needs to be affordable, she says. This will disappoint environmental groups, who have hoped that Merkel could play a decisive role in ending the era of coal. This is the key message from Angela Merkel\u2019s speech: Merkel now turns to artificial intelligence, saying we need agreements for \u2018ethical guidelines\u2019, both for AI and bioethics. Merkel says leaders should remember their national interest - but also remember that other people have national interest. Factor them in, and you can have a \u201cwin-win situation.\u201d [a more globalist approach than Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA strategy] The German chancellor then launches a defence of the global world order - as it comes under attack from populists and nationalists. Merkel says the world order is under pressure, but it\u2019s important to remember that key decisions underpinning its institutions were made 74 years go, after the second world war. After the horrors of the second world war, the people in charge had certain instincts, Merkel says firmly. We shouldn\u2019t cast their decisions aside, and treat it lightly, as they took them against a wealth of experience, she insists. But.. Merkel also chides international organisations are slow at reforming. If a system doesn\u2019t react quickly enough, some will create new institutions who will throw their weight around. And in a nod to emerging economies, Merkel says such institutions should be reformed so that \u201cthat the balance of power is realistically represented\u201d A decade after the financial crisis, you can still see the impact of the crash on the banks, Merkel. But she also sees reasons for optimism. One is the fall in extreme poverty. She\u2019s pleased that the sustainable development goals have been adopted, and confident that we will be able to eliminate extreme policy. She also cites agreements on migration. There\u2019s a buzz in the congress hall again, as German chancellor Angela Merkel arrives to give her special address. She starts by talking about the stable coalition government in Germany - after a rather rocky start, we\u2019re all working together well, she smiles. Merkel cites two concerns - the threat of cyber-espionage, and disquiet in the international system as a whole, which leads to the IMF lowering its growth projections. On the whole, the picture is rather gloomy. But many people are prepared to strengthen the global order, she insists. Business leaders don\u2019t seem to be holding out any hope they\u2019ll get clarification around Brexit from UK ministers who on the ground in Davos, including Chancellor Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox (writes Kalyeena Makortoff). There are also very low expectations that the UK team will come back with any trade pacts. One British industry chairman, who spoke to me on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting the UK to come back with any deals (from Davos)\u201d but \u201cFox will pretend\u201d he was successful. The chancellor is set to give a speech at the annual British business lunch on Thursday afternoon, but the chairman said he\u2019s \u201cnot expecting any more clarity from Hammond, though he may repeat what he said on the call\u201d, referring to a conference call with business leaders following the parliamentary vote on May\u2019s exit deal earlier this month. But few guests will be keen to air their views or push back hard on the Chancellor. \u201cThe politics of Brexit is so toxic, no business leader will be expressing a big view,\u201d he said, explaining that with the risk is too high. \u201cWith 140 people attending, nothing will stay private.\u201d European markets have erased earlier losses, boosted by a rise in Wall Street futures. The FTSE 100 is the exception, still in the red, as the rise in the pound bites. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,889 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 11,121 France\u2019s CAC: +0.4% at 4,867 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 19,538 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.2% at 9,144 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 356 AM Bono has changed his tune on the IMF. He once saw it as a \u2018great Satan\u2019, due to its emphasis on structural reforms and \u201cbullying of junior economies. Now, though, Bono says the development community \u201creally values\u201d the tough-mindedness shown by Christine Lagarde. During her time at Davos, Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI\u2019s director general, has detected worries that Brexit is weighing on the world economy. She tells us: At my meetings at Davos, there is a recognition that the causes of the vulnerability of the global economy now include Brexit. It is everyone\u2019s interest that Britain leaves the EU in a way that works for the British economy, the European economy and indeed the global economy.\u201d Fairbairn added: \u201cThe most critical thing is to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Business wants no deal ruled out for March 29 as soon as possible. The boost to confidence and investment would be immediate. Without that happening, there will be a continuing drain on jobs and investment across the country.\u201d [Apologies, our earlier entry contained errors so has been deleted. My mistake. GW] Brexit has been one of the key topics on the sidelines of Davos so far and rising expectations that the EU divorce date will be delayed are pushing up the pound. Sterling is above the $1.30 mark for the first time in 10 weeks, and is currently up 0.5% at $1.3026. The pound is also at a 10-week high against the euro, up 0.5% at \u20ac1.1462. Lukman Otunuga, analyst at currency firm FXTM, says that the boost to the pound could be short-lived: Sterling bulls were instilled with a renewed sense of confidence today with the GBPUSD breaking above 1.30 as fears over a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit continued to ease. Growing speculation over the government extending article 50 to avoid a nightmare no-deal outcome is likely to continue supporting sterling in the near term. However, the pound\u2019s medium- to longer-term outlook remains shrouded by Brexit\u2019s endless uncertainty. Sterling volatility and sensitivity to Brexit headlines are likely to increase ahead of the parliamentary debate on January 29th. One must always expect the unexpected when dealing with Brexit. Jeremy Wright, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, says he\u2019s attending the World Economic Forum to discuss artificial intelligence, arguing the UK can be a world leader regardless of Brexit. Speaking as he arrived at WEF, Wright explained that he\u2019s holding \u201ca number of meetings\u201d, and will attend the Global Council on AI on Thursday morning. Wright said he expects Brexit will come up during his meetings, but insists that\u2019s not why he\u2019s at Davos. He says: \u201cActually, what we\u2019re trying to get across is there\u2019s more to the UK than Brexit. \u201cWhen you talk about artificial intelligence, the fundamentals of why we can do well in artificial intelligence are going to remain strong regardless of the Brexit outcome.\u201d Those fundamentals include the UK\u2019s world class universities, and \u201cvery highly-skilled technical companies\u201d who choose to locate in the UK because of the regulatory and tax background. But what about concerns that you\u2019re in Davos drinking champagne with the elite? Wright denied that he was in Davos to drink champagne, insisting he certainly hadn\u2019t had any yet - Q: Will you be having any champagne? \u201cI very much doubt it\u201d, Wright insisted. \u201cI very much doubt it.\u201d Shinzo Abe struck a note of defiance and optimism in his speech. Here is quick summary. He started by outlining Japan\u2019s progress since he became prime minister for a second time in 2012 - in getting more women into work, increasing the numbers of over 65s in work, and with a record number (98%) of college graduates finding work. Abe said child poverty has fallen during his administration, and that Japanese GDP has grown by 10.9%, or $490bn. Hope is the most important factor for growth. He then looked forward to the G20 summit which will be held in Osaka, Japan, in June, and focused on a couple of key areas that he hopes to discuss: The free flow of data. Abe said that while personal data, intellectual property and national security intelligence should be protected, medical, industrial, traffic and other non-personal data should flow freely, without borders. The need for new innovations to tackle climate change. He said Japan is already doing its bit to meet the aims for 2050 set out by the IPCC. AM Shinzo Abe finishes with his hopes for Japan as one of the most open countries in the world, drivers of peace and growth: Hope, is about looking forward to tomorrow, next year, the year after next, and 10 or 20 years down the road. Fortune has embraced my country. Events we are hosting over the next decade begin with this year\u2019s G20 and rugby world cup and extend to Tokyo 2020 for the Olympics and Paralympics and to World Expo 2025, OsakaKansai. Most importantly, this year, for the first time in as long as 200 years, His Majesty the Emperor of Japan will abdicate and a new Emperor will take the throne. It is the dawn of a new era. Japan, now reinvigorated and revitalized, with your embrace, will continue to be one of the foremost open, democratic, and law-abiding contributors to peace and growth in the world. That\u2019s the end of the speech. Abe says he will make a third and final point: My third and last point is about Japan\u2019s commitment. Japan is determined to preserve and committed to enhancing the free, open, and rules-based international order. I am so very much pleased and proud to tell you that on December 30, 2018, we finally brought TPP11 [the trans-pacific trade agreement] into effect. Now, I must say, I am just as pleased and just as proud to make another announcement. Effective the first of February, which is just around the corner, the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement will enter into force. I call on all of us to rebuild trust toward the system for international trade. That should be a system that is fair, transparent, and effective in protecting IP and also in such areas as e-commerce and government procurement. Japan\u2019s Prime Minister moves to his second point: the importance of innovation in tackling climate change. We need disruptions to remind us that the IPCC\u2019s recent 1.5 degrees report tells us that [net carbon pollution] will have to come down to zero by 2050. We must have more disruptive innovations before it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s time now to think about CCU - carbon capture and utilisation. My government is aiming to reduce the cost of hydrogen by at least 90% by the year 2050 to make it cheaper than natural gas. We will be inviting to Japan top experts in science and technology from G20 member countries to combine forces in accelerating innovations. Spending money for a green earth and a blue ocean, once deemed costly, is now a growth generator. Decarbonisation and profit making can happen in tandem. We policymakers must be held responsible to make it happen, as I will be stressing [at the G20] in Osaka this year. He says to applause: May I now solemnly declare that defeatism about Japan is now defeated. He moves on to the G20 summit to be hosted in Japan later this year: Let there be hope and optimism for the future, providing reassurance that it is possible to achieve a hope-driven economy. As always, at that summit we\u2019re going to discuss a range of issues. But today I\u2019ll focus on two big issues - only two. First off: data governance. It will be data driving our economy forward. We had better act now. A delay of one year will be light years behind. We must on the one hand be able to out our personal data and intellectual property, national security and so on under careful protection. On the other hand we must enable the free flow of medical, industrial traffic and other useful non-personal data to see no borders. Repeat: no borders. The regime we need is data free flow with trust. Abe says industry 4.0 (the next industrial revolution) will being about society 5.0 in Japan. Data must be the great gap buster. It will bring about a new reality for humanity. Our cities will be made much more liveable for all sorts of people, from all walks of life. The engine for growth will be fuelled more and more by digital data, not gasoline. AM Out of every 100 college graduates looking to work, 98 find employment - a record number, Abe says. Wages have risen 2% year on year. As a result, during my six years in office, GDP has grown by 10.9%, adding $490bn. In order to make growth long lasting, we are encouraging investment which will enhance productivity. We are inviting skilled workers to Japan from abroad. How about the gap between the rich and the less affluent? During my administration, the child relative poverty rate, which had never before gone down, did go down for the first time, and did so significantly. He says the number of children from single parent homes attending college has risen from 24% to 42% during his time as PM. It will go up further as we are going to expand our free education from October this year. We are not widening the gap, we are narrowing it. Despair was wiped out by hope. Hope, ladies and gentlemen is the most important thing for growth. Breaking away from Shinzo Abe briefly, Liam Fox has also warned UK businesses that MPs won\u2019t be able to block a no-deal Brexit. He\u2019s be arguing at Davos that delaying Britain\u2019s departure would be even worse than crashing out without a deal (something many business groups would dispute) Shinzo Abe takes to the stage to address delegates. He says it was five years since he was last at Davos. I\u2019m very glad to be back. Abe says that back in 2012 (when he became PM for a second time), a lot of people thought \u201cJapan is doomed\u201d, with an ageing population. Japan could not grow, or so the argument went. It was a wall of despair and pessimism. Since that time our working population has dropped by about 4.5m people. We have responded by encouraging more women to work. As a result we now have 2 million more - I repeat - 2 million more women working. WEF\u2019s founder Klaus Schwab is introducing Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s Prime Minister. Dr Liam Fox has rejected claims that UK government ministers are in Davos for a jolly, as he races through the congress centre. Asked whether he was simply at the World Economic Forum to quaff champagne with the global elite, the secretary of state for international trade snaps back: \u201cDoes it look like it.\u201d ...before vanishing into a secure area at WEF for a meeting. Yesterday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn declared: \u201cHaving botched Brexit and created a deadlock in Parliament, it\u2019s shocking that a third of the Cabinet have the audacity to run off to sip champagne with the world\u2019s elite.\u201d Fox\u2019s department says he is holding 18 bilateral meetings while at Davos, including trade ministers from South Korea, Hong Kong, Canada, Colombia and Israel. He\u2019ll be working to ensure \u201ccontinuity of trade for UK businesses trading with nations covered by existing EU trade agreements\u201d after Brexit. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, will be giving a special address in Davos at 10.15am UK time. We\u2019ll be blogging the speech here. IKEA boss Jesper Brodin has joined wildlife and environmental campaigners in using Davos as a platform to talk about climate. He tells CNBC: The biggest concern we have is that the clock is ticking when it comes to climate and resource scarcity. We need to find new business models, we need to find new equations for material in order to be able to serve the many people. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in a hurry. Big corporates need to take the role of responsibility. Being a big corporate we assume the responsibility. AM Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for economics affairs has been speaking in Davos about Brexit. He says it\u2019s now up to the UK to tell the EU where they want to go, adding that a delay to Brexit is possible: Of course, we are ready to discuss. You ask me about a delay ... this is a possible scenario, but for that there are two things that are required. First, we need to have unanimity on that - I\u2019m not so worried about that because until now the 27 EU states are really united and I don\u2019t see why this would change. Second we need a reason to extend. We need to know why to extend, what for, what\u2019s the plan. The ball is clearly in the British side. AM Back in the sustainable development session, Lagarde also warns that it\u2019s simply impossible poor countries to mobilise enough resources domestically to meet basic development goals for sectors such as health education roads and water. To meet UN sustainable development goals by 2030 will mean investment worth 15% of GDP for low income countries. Lagarde says: \u201cThat\u2019s monumental. No way can that be done by domestic resource mobilisation. Business has to be part of it.\u201d Marco Lambertino, director general of WWF International says humans are becoming detached from nature and have a moral responsibility to reverse this trend. Speaking on a Davos panel about the decline in wildlife populations, he also spoke of his own, lifelong passion for nature. I was born crazy about nature and wildlife. When I was 12 I joined WWF and I started raising funds to save the last 20 wolves in my country. Now in Italy there are 3,000 wolves, in my country. There are a lot of success stories and it\u2019s all about co-existence and understanding that the web of life that is made of wolves and bees and so many other things, are the foundation of the functioning of the planet. Only recently we became detached from nature, we are in cities and the majority of the population is beginning to create a barrier between us and nature. We should be sad about the loss of nature and we should be very worried. Nature is providing to us every day for free fundamental services. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the water we use for agriculture and industries.. all this stuff we take for granted and we shouldn\u2019t. The loss of nature is something we should fight against for the moral responsibility of species and our own self interest. AM At the Sustainable Development panel, Bono says capitalism has lifted people more out of poverty than \u201cany other ism\u201d, but warns: \u201cIt is a wild beast. If it is not tamed it can chew up a lot of people along the way.\u201d Populism is the result of people being chewed up, he adds. IMF chief Christine Lagarde is also warning emerging market world leaders that corruption will put off investors from investing. Just in: UK chancellor Philip Hammond has dropped off a Davos panel scheduled for Friday morning, on the state of the global economy, we hear. He\u2019s no longer listed as a speaker for the \u201cGlobal Economy in Transition: Shaping a New Architecture\u201d session, alongside the World Bank\u2019s Kristalina Georgieva, South African central bank governor Lesetja Kganyago, economics professor Mariana Mazzucato, IMF chief Christine Lagarde and Haruhiko Kuroda of the Bank of Japan. However, we think Hammond is still visiting Davos (he\u2019s due to speak to business leaders on Thursday) That Economic outlook panel is traditionally the final set-piece event of Davos, with top politicians and central bankers giving their views. More as we get it.... Guardian commentator Aditya Chakrabortty sums up the problem with the \u2018global elite\u2019 at Davos this week: They care about other people\u2019s problems \u2013 so long as they get to define them, and it\u2019s never acknowledged that they are a large part of the problem. Which they are. If they want capitalism to carry on, the rich will need to give up their winnings and cede some ground. That point evades them. Welcoming Donald Trump last year, Klaus Schwab, Davos\u2019s majordomo, praised the bigot-in-chief\u2019s tax cuts for the rich and said, \u201cI\u2019m aware that your strong leadership is open to misconceptions and biased interpretations.\u201d The super-rich don\u2019t hate all populists \u2013 just those who refuse to make them richer. World leaders, rightly, get heavily criticised for preaching sustainability and equality at Davos before nipping off to a exclusive dinner date. So after an underwhelming, pro-business speech yesterday, Brazil\u2019s new president Jair Bolsonaro will have wanted to strike a different tone. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Brazilian government has released a photo, showing Bolsonaro apparently serving himself a self-service supermarket restaurant. No frills here!.... Except, Bolsonaro has also been spotted at a very exclusive dinner last night, with some top-level tech CEOs at one of Davos\u2019s luxury hotels. Not quite so man of the people.... As Davos day two gets underway, investors are finding little to cheer about in what has been a gloomy week so far for markets. Global growth fears, Brexit uncertainty and fading hopes of a speedy resolution to China\u2019s trade spat with the US are all weighing on sentiment. Trading is underway in Europe, and markets have followed Wall Street and Asia lower: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 6,870 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 11,032 France\u2019s CAC: -0.4% at 4,829 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.8% at 19,288 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 9,011 STOXX 600: -0.5% at 353 AM Not everyone is Davos is keen on the World Economic Forum. Within view of the main security cordon, local residents have hung protest signs accusing WEF chief executive Klaus Schwab of ruining the Swiss mountain town of Davos and blaming his \u201cfriends\u201d (assumedly, Davos attendees) of destroying the world. \u201cKlaus Schwab fucked up our town,\u201d one reads. \u201cHis friends fuck up the world,\u201d another says, in big block letters. \u201cWipe out WEF\u201d and \u201cClimate change kills\u201d signs are also hung across the homes. The Guardian\u2019s Kalyeena Makortoff went to investigate.... I took a quick trek up the hill to see whether we could speak to the residents. One of the upstairs neighbours came in with his daughter, clad in ski gear. He directed me to the downstairs tenants. A middle aged woman opened the door but didn\u2019t want to speak. I\u2019m sure the WEF badge didn\u2019t help.... Good morning from Davos. Heavy-hitting world leaders are in town today, as the second day of the World Economic Forum kicks off. Germany chancellor Angela Merkel, Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and China\u2019s vice-president Wang Qishan will all address the global elite. Trade war concerns, and anxiety over the slowing global economy, should be on the agenda. Mental health is also getting some well-deserved attention. Prince William and New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern will examine an issue that will affect one in four people. Pop star activist Bono is in town too, pushing for more money for sustainable development. And Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the Web, is talking about how to create safe online environments - another key issue in the era of social media abuse and trolling (not what Sir Tim had in mind for his creation) UK government ministers are also in town and likely to be buttonholed by anxious business chiefs -- as several push the Brexit panic button. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on the agenda 8.15am GMT/9.15 Davos time: Bono and Christine Lagarde on sustainable development 9am GMT/10am Davos: Press conference on mental health, with Wellcome Trust\u2019s Jeremy Farrer, Elisha London of United Global Mental Health, and Paul Stoffels of Johnson &amp; Johnson 10.15am GMT/11.15am Davos: Japanese PM Shinzo Abe\u2019s special address 1.15pm GMT/2.15pm Davos: German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s special address 2pm GMT/3pm Davos: Chinese vice-president Wang Qishan\u2019s special address 3pm GMT/4pm Davos: Panel on mental health matters including the Duke of Cambridge, Jacinda Ardern, and HSBC\u2019s John Flint 4pm GMT/5pm Davos: Panel on \u2018speaking out under stress\u2019, including Sir Tim Berners-Lee",

In his keynote address, the political scientist John Curtice argued that the practical problem with Brexit is that <a href=\"https://whatukthinks.org/eu/searching-in-vain-the-hunt-for-a-brexit-compromise/\" title=\"\">there is very little middle ground on which the two sides can make trades</a>.

      "bodyText": "Any advantage that politicians see in attending the World Economic Forum are these days weighed against the disadvantage of being seen to attend. Brexit has kept Theresa May away from Davos this year. The gilets jaunes protests have persuaded Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, to give it a miss. Both leaders are too busy grappling with crises born in a backlash against globalisation to visit a jamboree for business elites. Of western Europe\u2019s three most powerful states, only Germany is represented by the head of government. In a sombre speech on Wednesday, Angela Merkel warned of brittleness in the international rules-based order. She pledged to defend the \u201cglobal architecture\u201d but warned also that reform is essential to win back legitimacy in the eyes of people who feel financially insecure, left behind, and who turn to extremists for redress. This is a familiar diagnosis, even in Davos, but there is not much consensus on remedies. The forum itself can hardly advertise itself as a place of antidotes to nationalist demagoguery when its keynote speaker this year was Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s new far-right president. Last year that role was taken by Donald Trump. Both were given sycophantic receptions, yet these men embody the problem that Mrs Merkel identified. They are not interested in healing social division when stoking grievance is the means by which they take power.

Sophocleous, a retired headmaster who spent 26 months in prison in the UK before Cyprus gained independence in 1960, said more than 50 years later many of the victims still bore scars as much in mind as in body. \u201cSome were left blind, or with spinal injuries, or deaf,\u201d added the 86-year-old, who heads the Eoka veterans\u2019 association. \u201cBut the scars are as much mental. It was inhuman treatment. We have nothing against the English now, it is history, but if the Germans can say sorry, the English should say sorry too.\u201d Britain\u2019s desire to retain close ties with Cyprus, where it continues to have military bases, during the Brexit process is also believed to have played a role in the settlement decision. \u201cThe government is fighting so many battles on so many fronts, it\u2019s in such disarray that to spend any more time on this would not have been the best use of government resources,\u201d said the Labour MP Bambos Charalambous, whose family hailed from Cyprus. \u201cI am very glad it finally saw sense and settled what would have been a very embarrassing situation had the case continued through the courts.\u201d In his statement, Duncan stressed the need to look forward. \u201cWe must not forget the past \u2013 and indeed we must learn from it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is most important to look to the future. Today, the bilateral relationship that the UK shares with Cyprus is one of friendship and close partnership.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Metro Bank has revealed a major blunder in how it classifies its loan book, an admission that drove its share price down by nearly 40% on Wednesday, wiping \u00a3800m off the value of the company. The bank, which has been opening new branches as established rivals cut back, revealed that hundreds of millions of pounds of commercial property loans and loans to commercial buy-to-let operators had been wrongly classified in risk terms, and should have been among its \u201crisk-weighted assets\u201d (RWAs). After the blunder emerged, Metro\u2019s shares plummeted 39% from \u00a322 to close at \u00a313.45 as analysts feared the bank might have to raise fresh capital, just six months after tapping shareholders for \u00a3300m to finance its rapid expansion plans. When a bank has higher risk-weighted assets, regulators require higher amounts of capital to be set aside. Metro launched in 2010 and has opened new banking halls in city centres across the south of England. It floated on the stock market in March 2016 at \u00a320 a share, which rose to more than \u00a340 a share in March last year, but has since been falling. Metro Bank chief executive Craig Donaldson said \u201ccredit quality has remained robust\u201d and that \u201cnotwithstanding the RWAs, the bank continues to do well\u201d. The company said it had called in a \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firm to audit the loan classification, and had immediately reported the issue to the Prudential Regulatory Authority, one of the successors to the Financial Services Authority. When Metro Bank reassessed its loan portfolios, it found that around a 10th of its \u00a314.5bn loan book had been given incorrect risk weightings. It found that many of the commercial property loans had been assigned a 50% risk weighting when they should have been 100%. The situation was worse in the commercial buy-to-let book, where many loans had been given a 35% risk weighting when they should have been 100%. The bank also revealed that tougher trading conditions meant underlying profits for 2018 were \u00a350m, significantly below expectations of \u00a359m but 136% up on a year earlier. Mortgage margins have been hit by harsher competition in the sector and general uncertainty in the property market over Brexit, it said. Metro insisted its growth plans remained on track, with Donaldson saying the market \u201cshould not assume\u201d that the bank would be seeking extra capital. Its total capital ratio fell from 19.1% to 15.8% after the loans reclassification, but Metro said it remained comfortably above the 12.6% regulatory minimum. It said that in the fourth quarter it opened 100,000 new customer accounts. Six new branches took its total to 66 and further expansion in the West Midlands was planned for 2019. Donaldson said: \u201cMetro Bank remains well positioned to support our growth strategy as we navigate an uncertain period for the UK.\u201d",

It then claims that \u201cwell over a quarter of all deaths in 2017 in the Netherlands were induced\u201d. In fact in 2017 voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands accounted for only 4.4% of deaths. Palliative sedation is a common medical practice with patients at the very end of life, both in countries that do and those that do not have some form of assisted dying law. Research has suggested there may be as many as 96,000 palliative sedation deaths each year in the UK, and the Association for Palliative Medicine, which represents doctors in the UK and Ireland, is explicit that there are circumstances where patients \u201crequire sedating medication to diminish awareness of their suffering\u201d.</p> <p>The article also characterises Dutch law as having been written for people with cancer and then having been changed to encompass other groups.

At the age of 80, I arranged (for a modest fee) for an assessment through the Institute of Advanced Motoring. At 83, I arranged a further assessment and recently, after my 86th birthday, I did the same. The assessment involves driving for about an hour with an experienced assessor beside you. Afterwards you get an overall rating and some words of advice. For the first two sessions I was rated \u201csafe and competent\u201d but my recent rating was better \u2013 \u201cexcellent\u201d \u2013 largely because of my taking advice to improve use of my wing mirrors.

      "bodyText": "Margaret Hodge is absolutely right about the absurdity of the lax rules on driving in old age (When is it time to call it a day? That\u2019s the age old problem, 23 January). She writes that older people should be properly checked \u2013 and they can be. At the age of 80, I arranged (for a modest fee) for an assessment through the Institute of Advanced Motoring. At 83, I arranged a further assessment and recently, after my 86th birthday, I did the same. The assessment involves driving for about an hour with an experienced assessor beside you. Afterwards you get an overall rating and some words of advice. For the first two sessions I was rated \u201csafe and competent\u201d but my recent rating was better \u2013 \u201cexcellent\u201d \u2013 largely because of my taking advice to improve use of my wing mirrors. It is gratifying to identify a skill that has actually improved between 80 and 86. If the assessor had thought I was unfit to drive, I would have been told so. Such assessments should be mandatory at 80 and every three years subsequently. The elderly should pay for them if they want to continue driving. Professor Philip Graham London \u2022 After a lifetime of milking my own cows I lost my car licence at the age of 72 through a compulsory eyesight test. This morning a five-mile round trip to the nearest shop by bicycle saw me return with loaded panniers and seven metres of wood. I never get off my bike feeling depressed (although Herefordshire hills can be challenging) and am exposed to a multitude of sensory pleasures. Previously the milking parlour was for thinking, now the bicycle is. Both my cycles were handmade in a Worcestershire garden shed, providing local employment, and have taken me to places only dreamed about, eg Bhutan. There is a worthwhile life of freedom after the loss of a car licence, and anyway I think I look sexy in Lycra. A Howlett OMIL (Old Man in Lycra) Bromyard, Herefordshire \u2022 If, following police investigations into his recent accident, the Duke of Edinburgh is charged with a motoring offence which is subsequently heard at the crown court, will it be the case of the Queen versus Prince Philip? Adrian Brodkin London \u2022 I fear this new campaign to encourage older drivers to hand in their car keys (Letters, 22 January) will result in a swell of mobility scooters thronging the streets and pavements, adding to the perils for pedestrians.

(To hold a proper, legally valid referendum, Edinburgh needs permission from London.) When<strong> Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, the Scottish first minister, called in 2017 for a second independence referendum,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/16/theresa-may-rejects-nicola-sturgeons-scottish-referendum-demand\"> May brushed this aside with the response: \u201cNow is not the time.\u201d</a></p> <p>This afternoon, in response to a question from the Scottish Conservative Stephen Kerr, May seemed to rule one out for good. She told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last thing we want is a second independence referendum. The United Kingdom should be pulling together, and should not be being driven apart.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon has responded firmly. In a statement issued ahead of her meeting with May at Number 10 this afternoon, she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Theresa May fears she would lose an independence referendum and is clearly running scared of the verdict of the Scottish people - who must be sick and tired of being told what the prime minister wants</p> <p>Frankly, what Scotland needs is much more important than what the prime minister wants. On a daily basis, Brexit is illustrating this fundamental point - Scotland needs the power to take our own decisions. That\u2019s the only way to stop Tory ideologues driving us to disaster and Westminster governments imposing polices we didn\u2019t vote for.</p> <p>The mandate to give the people of Scotland a choice over their future is cast-iron. A majority of MSPs and Scottish MPs returned at the last two general elections support holding an independence referendum in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a far stronger statement of intent than even the comments that Sturgeon made in advance of her trip to London, when she said that \u201cwe have the right to consider other options for our future, including independence.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s worth remembering that Sturgeon must balance not only the demands of this Brexit endgame but also calls within her own party for a clearer signal about her referendum plans.</p> <p>The SNP MP and prominent People\u2019s Vote supporter<strong> Joanna Cherry</strong> has been tweeting today about the possibility of holding a second independence referendum during the transition period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joannaccherry/status/1088105660334641154\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> deal, during the transition period Scotland will require to decide whether our social, political &amp; economic future lies within a market of 500 million or 60 million &amp; in a union of equal partners or unequal partners <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nobrainer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nobrainer</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/indyref2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#indyref2</a></p>&mdash; Joanna Cherry QC MP (@joannaccherry) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joannaccherry/status/1088105660334641154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 23, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In contrast to Cherry, yesterday the long-serving SNP MP <strong>Angus Brendan MacNeil</strong> called on Sturgeon to drop support for a second EU referendum and instead put the case for a fresh vote on Scottish independence to the \u201cfore\u201d, as did <strong>Alex Neil</strong>, the former SNP health secretary and Brexiteer, last week.</p> <p>Also this week, former justice secretary<strong> Kenny MacAskill </strong>yesterday called for Sturgeon\u2019s husband, the SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, to \u201cmove on\u201d from his position in order to avoid the impression that he was shielding his wife from criticism over her handling of the Alex Salmond sexual harassment investigation. </p> <p>Some paint these critics as elder statesman figures speaking for others who are reluctant to voice their concerns about party strategy in public because of their own, more active positions; others point out that these older, white, male voices represent a particular constituency within the party but do not reach beyond that. Nor is it clear what influence, if any, these voices have on Sturgeon\u2019s thinking.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, activists within the SNP and across the wider yes movement are split, with some demanding that Sturgeon use her mandate immediately and others urging caution, particularly given the lack of dramatic movement in the polls. Will the waiting be over soon?

The suggestion this morning, prompted by extracts released in advance (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/23/brexit-latest-news-developments-pmqs-may-corbyn-wont-be-able-to-use-vote-next-week-to-stop-no-deal-liam-fox-claims-politics-live?page=with:block-5c483615e4b058cfe6d956e2#block-5c483615e4b058cfe6d956e2\">10am), </a>that Rees-Mogg was going to signal a significant softening of Tory Brexiter opposition to Theresa May\u2019s deal turned out to be premature. Rees-Mogg, who is influential because the European Research Group that he chairs has led the Tory fight against the deal, did say that he thought a deal could be achieved. But he did not sound as if he, or the ERG, were willing to compromise much themselves, and he restated his willingness to see the UK leave the EU with no deal if necessary.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rees-Mogg said that Theresa May should close parliament temporarily if necessary (or prorogue it, to use the technical term) to stop MPs passing a bill blocking a no-deal Brexit. </strong>He also said that, if May refused to do this, she would be to blame for the bill passing, and Brexiters would hold her to account. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If no deal were taken off the table, her majesty\u2019s government would have had to connived in doing it. It cannot be done if the government is determined to stop it.</p> <p>If the House of Commons undermines our basic constitutional conventions, then the executive is entitled to use other vestigial constitutional means to stop it, by which I basically mean prorogation. Prorogation normally lasts for three days, and any law that is in the process before prorogation falls. I think that would be the government\u2019s answer. That is the government\u2019s backstop, to use a choice phrase. </p> <p>And if the government allows no deal to be taken off the table, that would be a failure of the government, and then it would be the job of backbench MPs to hold the government to account. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that May\u2019s deal could be amended to make it acceptable to Brexiters - but he implied that he expected the EU to compromise more than his own side.</strong> In his speech he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think at last things are going our way. We have heard stories coming out of Ireland that they would like to have a bilateral agreement to keep the border open as the EU has toughened its line on the border between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. We have heard the Poles saying that they are more interested in their relationship with the United Kingdom because of our strong ties than they are particularly concerned about the Irish border ... We\u2019ve heard that the Italians are beginning to think that these arrangements are not entirely satisfactory. And [Angela] Merkel has said she is willing to work day and night to get something done.</p> <p>So I think there is good news for us - a hope that a reformation of this deal could be achieved that could make it acceptable.</p> <p>But it is not there yet. And until it is, people like me will vote against the deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the Q&amp;A, when asked why he thought the EU was willing to compromise, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the truth is that everybody wants a deal; the prime minister wants a deal, the EU wants a deal, the Irish want a deal. And if the only way to get it is by re-opening the text, that is what they will have to do. This is realpolitik.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Rees-Mogg said he would not back the withdrawal agreement until the backstop was removed</strong>. That was the only absolute condition he set for backing the deal. But he was specific.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As long as the backstop is there, I will not vote for the deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that any change removing the backstop would have to be legally binding, and he said that he and his colleagues were \u201con the alert for meaningless soft soap\u201d - ie, worthless apparent concessions.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He implied that it would not matter if there were no deal because, the closer the UK got to 29 March, the closer it got to leaving.</strong> He ended his speech saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is hope. There are two types of hope. One is, we will get a better deal. The other hope - tick tock goes the clock, and as it ticks down we get closer to leaving. And when we leave, we have taken back control, we are in charge.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that attempts by Yvette Cooper and other MPs to pass legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit were a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d intended to keep the UK in the EU.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f494d5ea6eb96a30250fedb175354e8d915d6d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f494d5ea6eb96a30250fedb175354e8d915d6d2/0_183_4857_2914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Ress-Mogg addressing the Bruges Group in London.

He devoted all his questions to Brexit, and mostly focused on challenging May to rule out no deal, and to accept the case for the UK staying in a customs union. On the latter point, May was reasonably clear, restating her opposition to a CU on the grounds that it would not allow the UK to strike its own trade deals. On no deal, she was more evasive. Corbyn asked at one point if she would accept the amendments tabled ahead of next week\u2019s vote, designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit, if they are passed. This is a crucial question, because it is not clear that the amendments will actually have the impact the MPs who have tabled them hope, and May did not address this point at all, beyond saying that extending article 50 does not absolutely rule out no deal because it only postpones the decision point. The point Corbyn made at the end about May ruling out the two propositions for which there is majority support in the Commons was a strong one. But it was not a clear-cut win for him. Predictably, but not entirely unfairly, May clobbered him in her first response for his decision to boycott her cross-party talks on Brexit by imposing a precondition. (Many people have said he would have been better advised to just turn up, and denounce her inflexibility afterwards.) May also had a good riff about technical aspects of Labour\u2019s CU policy, which the party has not been able to address. This attack line was well-founded too. But, overall, she came over as harsh and defensive, confirming the jibe Corbyn made about her having an open door but a closed mind. This was probably the best soundbite of the exchange. It was not actually Corbyn\u2019s, because Hilary Benn first used this line in the Commons on Monday, but so what? Most viewers won\u2019t have realised, and it worked.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-23T13:26:55.684Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c485a36e4b024f0efeacb1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-23T12:16:07.467Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says Liam Fox could not name one country he has reached a trade deal with.

That would make the question of the backstop less prominent.</p> <p>Looking at it objectively, I have the impression that the backstop is not the central issue. Ultimately, the debate in Britain is about what the future of the UK will look like. I believe that we can overcome the current difficulties when we discuss that issue together.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also claimed there was a \u201creadiness in London\u201d for this sort of approach (although it is not clear if, by \u201cLondon\u201d, he meant the government or parliament). He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re cooperating with the British government. Things could start moving rapidly. This depends on the future relationship, like I already said. We are ready to be more ambitious if the British decide to shift their red lines, for example by remaining in a customs union, or participating in the single market. I believe there is a readiness in London for that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He conceded the EU could agree to extend article 50 in certain conditions. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If Britain asks for an extension, it has to be approved by EU leaders. They will only agree if three questions are answered: first and second, why and how long? And third, will not that be a problem for holding the EU elections in May? I have no clear legal answer to the third question yet. It is important that the EU\u2019s democratic processes are not disturbed by this, however.</p> <p>The first two questions are complex and interconnected: it needs a stable majority in London for all laws related to Brexit that need to be adopted. This will need time.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said, if the UK leaves the EU with no deal, there will have to be checks on goods crossing the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</strong> When it was put to him that the UK did not need to accept the backstop, because in the event of a no-deal Brexit the UK and the EU would try to avoid a hard border anyway, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will be checks in case of a no-deal-Brexit. We will do everything possible to enforce them unobtrusively. However, that will not be possible with everything. How should we control animals crossing the border? There will have to be checks. Again, the problem arose from Brexit and we expect the UK to take responsibility.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He reaffirmed the EU\u2019s opposition to putting a time limit on the backstop. </strong>This is one of Theresa May\u2019s key demands. But Barnier said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The backstop is like an insurance. It is not there to be used. And if so, only provisionally. However, we cannot tie the backstop to a time limit.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, the Tory Brexiter, seems to be implying in the speech is he giving to today that the EU may be willing to compromise over the backstop.

The ERG represents the 60-odd Tories most committed to a harder Brexit and it has led the opposition to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. Rees-Mogg celebrated the defeat of May\u2019s deal by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/jacob-rees-mogg-hosts-champagne-party-after-may-brexit-defeat\">hosting a champagne reception </a>and ERG members regularly argue that they would be happy to see the UK leave without a deal. </p> <p>But now, according to a briefing from the speech sent out to journalists in advance, Rees-Mogg will say the backstop is the only \u201cabsolute obstacle\u201d to a deal (in the past the ERG has highlighted many other objections to it), and he will suggest that he and his fellow Brexiters are in a mood to compromise.</p> <p>Rees-Mogg will say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are outbreaks of realism all around I see.</p> <p>All along we have been asking merely for the possible, not the impossible.

Assuming the amendment gets called, given the number of rebel Tories in favour, this means it is highly likely to pass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1087844362183004160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYvette Cooper has put an amendment down, which I think is sensible,\u201d says Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell adding \u201cit\u2019s increasingly likely\u201d Labour would back her amendment<a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@johnmcdonnellMP</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/newsnight?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#newsnight</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HoeCAK7TA1\">pic.twitter.com/HoeCAK7TA1</a></p>&mdash; BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1087844362183004160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>You can read the Cooper amendment, and all the others, on<a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP190123.pdf\"> the order paper (pdf), </a>staring from page 49. My colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong> has written a good guide to what they all mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/21/from-backstop-tweaks-to-no-no-deal-possible-amendments-to-mays-next-brexit-motion\">here.</a></p> <p>But would the Cooper amendment actually stop a no-deal Brexit if it were passed? On the Today programme,<strong> Liam Fox</strong>, the Brexiter international trade secretary, claimed that it would not. He claimed that it was constitutionally improper. But he also claimed it would not work. Asked about it, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think it is possible to do it [block a no-deal Brexit] in the way that they suggest. Some of the amendments being spoken about, where the House of Commons would take control over the initiation of legislation - there\u2019s a real danger here, and it\u2019s a much bigger constitutional one. </p> <p>We have an arrangement in our country where the executive - ie, the government of the day - puts forward legislation, parliament scrutinises it, parliament amends it, parliament can decide to pass it or not pass it. What is being suggested here is the House of Commons both initiates the legislation and scrutinises it, which is a huge change to our constitution. And the danger here is, you change our constitutional conventions for one reason, but it has huge consequences elsewhere. And in effect, in this motion, we are being asked to change it without any real debate about the constitutional significance.</p> </blockquote> <p>(In fact, parliament regularly debates and passes legislation proposed by backbenchers - there is a formal procedure for this - but never mind ...)</p> <ul> <li><strong>MPs will not be able to use an amendment next week to stop no deal, Fox claims.</strong></li> </ul> <p>As the interviewer, <strong>Nick Robinson,</strong> pointed out, Fox\u2019s argument bluntly contradicted what <strong>Philip Hammond</strong>, the chancellor, told business leaders in a conference call last week after MPs voted down Theresa May\u2019s deal. Hammond urged them not to worry too much about a no-deal Brexit happening because MPs would block it. \u201cI can simply as a parliamentarian say it is clear to me there is a large majority in the Commons that is opposed to no deal in any circumstances,\u201d Hammond said.</p> <p>In his interview, when it was put to him that even May admits a no-deal Brexit would be very bad for the UK, Fox claimed it would be better than delaying Brexit. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there are many who talk about delaying Brexit when what they really mean is not having Brexit at all. And I think the worst outcome in this political process would be for parliament, having given a guarantee to the voters that they would honour the result of the referendum, to turn round and break that contract with the voters ...</p> <p>I think the most dangerous thing for Britain, politically, is for Brexit to be denied to the British people when they were specifically promised it. I think it would open up a gulf of trust between parliament and the people that might be difficult to repair, and with unknowable consequences.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Fox claims delaying Brexit would be even worse for the UK than no deal.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>10am:</em> Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</p> <p><em>1pm:</em> Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, gives a speech to the Bruges Group.</p> <p><em>4pm: </em>Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee.</p> <p>As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has warned that the move led by Labour MP Yvette Cooper to block the prime minister from delivering a no-deal Brexit is doomed to fail unless a majority for an alternative agreement is found. Labour looks set to whip its MPs to back Cooper\u2019s amendment, paving the way for legislation that would mandate ministers to extend article 50 if a no-deal Brexit looked imminent. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, has said May should close parliament temporarily if necessary (or prorogue it, to use the technical term) to stop MPs passing a bill blocking a no-deal Brexit. (See 3.14pm.) Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has reasserted the SNP\u2019s right to call a referendum on Scottish independence after May used PMQs to firm up her opposition to the idea. (See 5.04pm.) Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has said that May\u2019s plan is probably still the most popular of all the various Brexit options being discussed by MPs. Giving evidence to the Lords EU committee, and referring to the various Brexit options that have emerged from the cross-party talks on Brexit, and from the amendments tabled ahead of next week\u2019s debate, he said: The prime minister\u2019s deal probably is the one with the most support, but clearly not sufficient support. He also said the priority was to find changes to the backstop that would make it acceptable to MPs. Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism chief has said he fears the far right will exploit Brexit tensions with their propaganda triggering rises in hate crime and creating an atmosphere that terrorists can exploit. Theresa May could be persuaded to think about a so-called citizens\u2019 assembly as a way out of the Brexit impasse, according to one of the MPs leading efforts at parliament to promote the idea. Sadiq Khan will make a campaign for wide-ranging rent control the key plank of his 2020 re-election bid, asking the government to give the London mayoralty the power to combat soaring rents in the capital. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Talking of David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard points out that he has got a new job - which pays \u00a33,000 an hour. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. Sir Ivan Rogers, the former British ambassador to the EU, has established himself, mostly in a series of speeches, as the most incisive critic of the government\u2019s Brexit strategy. He delivered another last night and you can read it here (pdf). I haven\u2019t read it myself yet (they are never short), but I\u2019m told it is as good as all the others. The Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster has posted some highlights in a Twitter thread, starting here. This is from Politico Europe\u2019s Tom McTague. The Yvette Cooper bill intended to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal would oblige the PM to seek an extension of article 50 until the ned of 2019 in the event of no deal being agreed by 26 February. McTague suggests that this nine-month extension could turn into a three-month extension as the price for Labour supporting the bill. The European Commission has adopted two legislative proposals to soften the impact on the EU fishing industry if there is a no-deal Brexit, the Press Association reports. The proposals provide for compensation to fishermen and operators in the case of a sudden closure of UK waters to EU boats. And they prepare the way for the EU to offer UK boats access to its waters until the end of 2019 on condition that Britain grants access to its waters for EU boats in return. And this is from the Financial Times\u2019 Alex Barker. Back in the Lords committee, Barclay is saying more about the legislation that would have to be passed in the event of a no-deal Brexit. On the issue of whether there is enough time, Barclay says \u201crisk appetite\u201d would be a factor taken into account. The business managers would have to take a decision. At PMQs Theresa May firmed up her opposition to allowing Scotland to hold a second independence referendum. (To hold a proper, legally valid referendum, Edinburgh needs permission from London.) When Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, called in 2017 for a second independence referendum, May brushed this aside with the response: \u201cNow is not the time.\u201d This afternoon, in response to a question from the Scottish Conservative Stephen Kerr, May seemed to rule one out for good. She told MPs: The last thing we want is a second independence referendum. The United Kingdom should be pulling together, and should not be being driven apart. Sturgeon has responded firmly. In a statement issued ahead of her meeting with May at Number 10 this afternoon, she said: Theresa May fears she would lose an independence referendum and is clearly running scared of the verdict of the Scottish people - who must be sick and tired of being told what the prime minister wants Frankly, what Scotland needs is much more important than what the prime minister wants. On a daily basis, Brexit is illustrating this fundamental point - Scotland needs the power to take our own decisions. That\u2019s the only way to stop Tory ideologues driving us to disaster and Westminster governments imposing polices we didn\u2019t vote for. The mandate to give the people of Scotland a choice over their future is cast-iron. A majority of MSPs and Scottish MPs returned at the last two general elections support holding an independence referendum in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves. This is a far stronger statement of intent than even the comments that Sturgeon made in advance of her trip to London, when she said that \u201cwe have the right to consider other options for our future, including independence.\u201d It\u2019s worth remembering that Sturgeon must balance not only the demands of this Brexit endgame but also calls within her own party for a clearer signal about her referendum plans. The SNP MP and prominent People\u2019s Vote supporter Joanna Cherry has been tweeting today about the possibility of holding a second independence referendum during the transition period. In contrast to Cherry, yesterday the long-serving SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil called on Sturgeon to drop support for a second EU referendum and instead put the case for a fresh vote on Scottish independence to the \u201cfore\u201d, as did Alex Neil, the former SNP health secretary and Brexiteer, last week. Also this week, former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill yesterday called for Sturgeon\u2019s husband, the SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, to \u201cmove on\u201d from his position in order to avoid the impression that he was shielding his wife from criticism over her handling of the Alex Salmond sexual harassment investigation. Some paint these critics as elder statesman figures speaking for others who are reluctant to voice their concerns about party strategy in public because of their own, more active positions; others point out that these older, white, male voices represent a particular constituency within the party but do not reach beyond that. Nor is it clear what influence, if any, these voices have on Sturgeon\u2019s thinking. Meanwhile, activists within the SNP and across the wider yes movement are split, with some demanding that Sturgeon use her mandate immediately and others urging caution, particularly given the lack of dramatic movement in the polls. Will the waiting be over soon? Sturgeon finally pledged last week to set out her plans for a second independence referendum \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d even if article 50 is extended. Back in the Lords EU committee Barclay claims that some of the opposition to Theresa May\u2019s deal can be \u201coverplayed\u201d. He says the fact that the government was likely to lose meant some opposition MPs, who in other circumstances might have backed the government, decided not to. Turning away from the committee hearing for a moment, this, from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, is interesting ... Hilary Armstrong, a former Labour chief whip, is asking the questions now. Q: What does the PM mean when she says she will change the way she engages with parliament? And when will the government decide it is too late to get a deal? Barclay says the government does not like the way MPs have been using \u201chumble addresses\u201d to get private government papers. So the government has been thinking about how else it can brief MPs. He mentions confidential briefings, and briefings for select committees as option. He suggests committees work more effectively than the Commons chamber. On timing, Barclay says the government wants a decision \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Barclay says the government is not running down the clock. If there is a deal, it will have to pass legislation, he says. And even if there were to be no deal, the government would still have to pass legislation to prepare for that, he says. Barclay says government would need to pass legislation to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Barclay is talking about the proposal to keep the UK in the customs union. He says, if the government pivots in one direction, as well as picking up votes, it may lose them. Q: How is the process working? Barclay says there is an interplay. The EU want to know what the Commons would pass. And the government is trying to work out what different groups in the Commons would accept. The backstop is the main issue; in particular, how it would affect the union of the UK, and whether it would be permanent, he says. Barclay says the prime minister\u2019s deal is the Brexit option \u201cwith the most support\u201d in the Commons, although not sufficient support. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is being questioned by the Lords EU committee. Lord Boswell, the committee chair, starts by asking Barclay about the amendments tabled ahead of next week\u2019s Brexit debate. Barclay says it is right to recognise that the government suffered \u201ca very significant defeat\u201d. Theresa May is now reaching out to MPs from across the Commons, he says. He says she wants to find out what the House will back. One thing Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, did not mention in his prepared speech today (see 3.33pm) was a possible extension of Brexit talks, which shows how carefully the EU is treading on this subject. The decision to prolong article 50 lies with the EU\u2019s 27 leaders who must agree unanimously to extend Brexit talks beyond 29 March 2019 - if there is a request from the UK. So far Theresa May has ruled out prolonging talks, although EU sources think she is in denial about the time constraints. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s pointman on Brexit, signalled an important shift in thinking yesterday, when he said the EU needed to be \u201cfirm and flexible\u201d on any extension. The MEP previously ruled out extra time beyond the European elections. One EU source described the discussion on extension as \u201cstill very messy\u201d and unclear, but added that it was difficult to imagine the EU slamming the door on the UK, if the British wanted more time, even if Brexit was still unresolved. The official said: I find it hard at that stage to imagine, following an 11th-hour request, EU leaders would say \u2018sorry, it is too late, you have to face the music\u2019. The question [ on extension] would be for how long and what for. For the sake of clarity, we will only know [the decision] when it lands on the table of the European council. This is about the position they take ahead of national elections in their country \u2026 Would you really want no-deal just before the new European parliament takes office? If you are looking for a break from Brexit, then do read my colleague Jim Waterson\u2019s story about the opening of the libel case involving Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, suing the Sun over claims he recorded a track with a heavy metal band which adopted Nazi imagery. It\u2019s quite a tale ... Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has warned the UK it will forfeit the EU\u2019s trust and the Brexit transition period if it fails to ratify the withdrawal deal. In a speech at the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels, one of the EU\u2019s lesser-known institutions, Barnier said: Without ratification there will be neither a withdrawal agreement nor a transition period, nor will there be the mutual trust that we need, in order to construct the future relationship on a sound basis His point is not a new one, although it is often missed by prominent Brexit supporting MPs. Esther McVey, who resigned as work and pensions secretary over Brexit, said recently it appeared possible to get an \u201cimplementation period\u201d without signing the withdrawal agreement. The former Brexit secretary, David Davis, has made similar claims. Barnier said there were only two ways to leave the EU: \u201can orderly withdrawal\u201d based on the current agreement; or \u201ca disorderly withdrawal\u201d, which he said would set the UK back decades. If we fail in the Brexit negotiations, we will be stepping back, or at least the UK will be stepping back, to a time before it was a member of the EU and the single market, when customs duties were part of the day-to-day life of our businesses. So this no-deal scenario can\u2019t be excluded today. Opposing \u2018no-deal\u2019 will not stop \u2018no-deal\u2019 from happening at the end of March. To stop \u2018no-deal\u2019, a positive majority for another solution will need to emerge. Barnier also devoted significant time explaining why checks would be needed to control goods coming into the EU from the UK, although he did not say these checks would be done at the Irish border. \u201cThe border with Ireland is the border of our 27 countries,\u201d he said, pointing out that the EU needed to carry out checks on all products coming into the single market to protect consumers, companies and government budgets. This is the latest sign that the EU is stepping up its communications effort to explain what happens on the island of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Barnier also revealed mounting EU exasperation with the UK over the border issue, nothing that the all-UK backstop was based on \u201ca specific request from the UK\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t our idea\u201d. The backstop is the insurance plan to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border, if trade talks fail to find a solution in time. British negotiators regard the all-UK backstop as a win over the EU\u2019s initial proposal of a Northern Ireland-only backstop, which Theresa May said no prime minister could ever accept because she thinks it creates unacceptable differences within the UK. Here is my colleague Jonathan Freedland on the pro-Brexit James Dyson\u2019s decision to move his company HQ to Singapore. And here is an extract. Whether it\u2019s Nigel Farage taking care to ensure two of his children can live, work and travel freely across the EU by having German passports, or Nigel Lawson, who lives in France, taking the precaution of applying for French residency, the pattern is familiar. It suggests a Brexiteer elite who believe that the pain of Brexit is for the little people. They are rich or powerful or connected enough to be insulated from the damage it will cause, making them free to sound off about its supposed benefits in the abstract \u2013 sovereignty! control! \u2013 while everyone else deals with the grim reality. Here are the main points from Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A at the Bruges Group. The suggestion this morning, prompted by extracts released in advance (see 10am), that Rees-Mogg was going to signal a significant softening of Tory Brexiter opposition to Theresa May\u2019s deal turned out to be premature. Rees-Mogg, who is influential because the European Research Group that he chairs has led the Tory fight against the deal, did say that he thought a deal could be achieved. But he did not sound as if he, or the ERG, were willing to compromise much themselves, and he restated his willingness to see the UK leave the EU with no deal if necessary. Here are the main points. Rees-Mogg said that Theresa May should close parliament temporarily if necessary (or prorogue it, to use the technical term) to stop MPs passing a bill blocking a no-deal Brexit. He also said that, if May refused to do this, she would be to blame for the bill passing, and Brexiters would hold her to account. He said: If no deal were taken off the table, her majesty\u2019s government would have had to connived in doing it. It cannot be done if the government is determined to stop it. If the House of Commons undermines our basic constitutional conventions, then the executive is entitled to use other vestigial constitutional means to stop it, by which I basically mean prorogation. Prorogation normally lasts for three days, and any law that is in the process before prorogation falls. I think that would be the government\u2019s answer. That is the government\u2019s backstop, to use a choice phrase. And if the government allows no deal to be taken off the table, that would be a failure of the government, and then it would be the job of backbench MPs to hold the government to account. He said that May\u2019s deal could be amended to make it acceptable to Brexiters - but he implied that he expected the EU to compromise more than his own side. In his speech he said: I think at last things are going our way. We have heard stories coming out of Ireland that they would like to have a bilateral agreement to keep the border open as the EU has toughened its line on the border between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. We have heard the Poles saying that they are more interested in their relationship with the United Kingdom because of our strong ties than they are particularly concerned about the Irish border ... We\u2019ve heard that the Italians are beginning to think that these arrangements are not entirely satisfactory. And [Angela] Merkel has said she is willing to work day and night to get something done. So I think there is good news for us - a hope that a reformation of this deal could be achieved that could make it acceptable. But it is not there yet. And until it is, people like me will vote against the deal. In the Q&amp;A, when asked why he thought the EU was willing to compromise, he replied: I think the truth is that everybody wants a deal; the prime minister wants a deal, the EU wants a deal, the Irish want a deal. And if the only way to get it is by re-opening the text, that is what they will have to do. This is realpolitik. Rees-Mogg said he would not back the withdrawal agreement until the backstop was removed. That was the only absolute condition he set for backing the deal. But he was specific. As long as the backstop is there, I will not vote for the deal. He also said that any change removing the backstop would have to be legally binding, and he said that he and his colleagues were \u201con the alert for meaningless soft soap\u201d - ie, worthless apparent concessions. He implied that it would not matter if there were no deal because, the closer the UK got to 29 March, the closer it got to leaving. He ended his speech saying: There is hope. There are two types of hope. One is, we will get a better deal. The other hope - tick tock goes the clock, and as it ticks down we get closer to leaving. And when we leave, we have taken back control, we are in charge. He claimed that attempts by Yvette Cooper and other MPs to pass legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit were a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d intended to keep the UK in the EU. Jeremy Corbyn will hold meetings with Labour backbenchers Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves this afternoon. Both MPs have tabled amendments to the government\u2019s motion, aimed at averting a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman would not say whether Labour would whip its MPs to support either move next week - though shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested last night the Cooper-Boles amendment might be attractive if the extension to article 50 it provided for was shorter than nine months. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at all mechanisms to take no deal off the table and to give parliament more of a say\u201d, the spokesman said. He also insisted Corbyn\u2019s decision to refuse the prime minister\u2019s invitation for talks on Brexit, which she mentioned repeatedly at PMQs, had been, \u201cvindicated by subsequent events\u201d. He went: Unless she makes clear that she is prepared to move, and compromise, and accept the reality that took place, in the scale of the defeat of her own deal, then she is simply trying to run down the clock, and prevent any real solution to this crisis. Asked whether Corbyn would change his mind about discussions with May if one of these amendments passes, the spokesman said: If the prime minister accepts that that means that no deal is off the table then of course he will engage. And that is the end of the Q&amp;A. I will post a summary soon. Q: Does the backstop have to removed from the withdrawal agreement? Or would you accept an end date? Rees-Mogg says it will have to be clear that the backstop does not apply. Q: The PM did not rule out customs union membership in the Commons this afternoon? What would you do if May did that? Rees-Mogg repeats the point about not thinking that the Labour votes are there to encourage May to go down this route. But he would vote against the customs union, he says. That is how the EU started. Q: Are you saying the withdrawal agreement has to be re-opened, to remove the backstop text? Or would you accept an alternative legal agreement? Rees-Mogg says it depends on the detail. The withdrawal agreement is superior law. Any alternative side text would have to have equal legal standing. Rees-Mogg says the government cannot get its deal through with Labour votes. The numbers are not available, he says. Q: If no deal is taken off the table, will you encourage MPs to back May\u2019s deal? Rees-Mogg says no deal cannot be taken off the table without the connivance of the government. He says if the Commons passes a no-deal bill, there are other mechanism available to the government. It could prorogue parliament, he says. Rees-Mogg says government should if necessary prorogue parliament to stop Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill to block a no-deal Brexit. Proroguing is what happens to parliament at the end of a session. It is not the same as dissolving parliament (which is what happens before a general election), but it would involve closing parliament for a few days. Rees-Mogg is suggesting it because, if parliament did get prorogued, bills which were going through parliament but not yet on the statute book would automatically. Rees-Mogg is now taking questions. Q: It has been reported that you are shifting position. You say there might be a deal. What do you know that we don\u2019t know? Rees-Mogg asks how he could possibly know more than the BBC. The truth is, everyone wants a deal: the government, the EU, the Irish. And so if the only way to do that is to re-open the text, that is what will happen. But he will only back the deal if there is meaningful change. He says he is \u201con the alert for meaningless soft soap\u201d. Rees-Mogg says Brexit will be \u201ca rebirth, a retaking of control\u201d, to establish a new politics for a generation. We will take back control, he says. \u201cAnd Yvette Cooper will not stop us.\u201d Rees-Mogg says there are two types of hope. One is that the UK will get a better deal. The other is \u201ctick tock\u201d - as time goes one, the UK gets closer to Brexit, he says. Rees-Mogg says the Brexiter are a broad church. He was handed a Communist party leaflet on his way in, he says. He said it took him a while to realise, because it was sound on the EU. Rees-Mogg waves his copy of the withdrawal agreement. Under it, the UK would not leave the EU properly, he says. He says he reads in the papers that he has become \u201ca soft touch\u201d. This deal does not deliver Brexit, he says. The biggest problem is the backstop, he says. As long as that backstop is there, I will not vote for this deal. He says the deal needs \u201cfundamental change\u201d. But he claims things \u201cat last are going our way\u201d. The Irish have expressed a willingness to compromise, he suggests. He says the Poles and the Italians have expressed reservations. And Angela Merkel has said she will work day and night to get a deal, he says. Rees-Mogg says, in 1832, when the reform bill was being debated and parliament was deadlocked, it was thought at one point that the King might have to prorogue parliament in person. He says he hopes that is not necessary this time, and that the Queen\u2019s stay at Sandringham is not interrupted. Rees-Mogg starts by saying he may have to disappear at short notice, because a vote is due in the Commons soon. He says there are people trying to obstruct Brexit. That is what the Yvette Cooper bill is about, and that is what the \u201closers\u2019 vote\u201d (ie, the second referendum) is about, he says. He says Cooper et al claim they are asserting the right of the Commons to control things. But it can do that by a confidence vote, he says. He says a majority of MPs voted for Brexit, through the article 50 act and the EU Withdrawal Act. Blocking Brexit would be \u201ca constitutional outrage\u201d, he says. The person introducing Rees-Mogg says Rees-Mogg has become \u201ca beacon of hope for those who believe in conservative values\u201d. Jacob Rees-Mogg is about to start his speech to the Bruges Group now. Ireland will by bound by EU rules to impose checks on controls on the Irish border, in the event of no deal, a trade lawyer and expert on EU and World Trade Organisation rules told the Northern Ireland select committee this morning. Isabelle Van Damme told MPs: It will be difficult for Ireland to unilaterally to take particular action in regards to trade. The Irish side has obligations as a matter of EU law to apply the common customs code. Ireland will be bound by EU rules and that will be difficult to reconcile that with its desire not to have the hard border. This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. And this is from the Independent\u2019s Tom Peck. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who chairs the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, is about to speak at a Bruges Group event. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. Judging by a short excerpt released in advance (see 10am), Rees-Mogg may signal that the ERG are in a mood to compromise. The event has started, by Rees-Mogg won\u2019t be speaking for a while. The current speaker has just been going on about Theresa May\u2019s deal turning the UK into a \u201cvassal state\u201d. (It is that sort of event.) When Rees-Mogg does speak, I will cover what he is saying. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs. Generally, no one was very impressed. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Jason Beattie From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From the Times\u2019 Patrick Kidd From the Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh From Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Hutton From HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh From Sky\u2019s Kate McCann Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, also used his questions to ask about Brexit. He started by asking Theresa May if she had done an economic analysis of her deal. He pointed out that the one published by the government last year did not cover it specifically. May said the economic analysis published last year did look at different aspects of trade. It made clear that the deal put on the table by the government was the best one, she said. Blackford replied: I can only take it from that answer that there is no analysis of the government\u2019s plan. When we reflect on the paper that came out last November, Brexit will lead to a loss of up to 9% of GDP throughout the United Kingdom, costing jobs. It is the height of irresponsibility for the prime minister to bring a deal to this parliament, and we haven\u2019t seen the economic impact. People up and down the United Kingdom are going to lose their jobs, are going to lose economic opportunity, because of the ideology of this government. It is important that this house stands up and reflects on this ... We have to be honest with people. We need to go back to the people and have a people\u2019s vote. May said the government had reflected on the economic needs of the country. That is why it negotiated a deal for an ambitious trade deal. She said if Blackford was interested in people\u2019s economic interests, he should accept the economic analysis showing that being in the UK was worth \u00a310bn in extra public spending to Scotland, or almost \u00a31,900 for every single person in Scotland. If [Blackford] is interested in economics, stay in the United Kingdom and stop your policy of independence. Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, wishes May a happy Cumbria day. He invites her to join him at a reception afterwards to sample Cumbrian food. John Bercow, the Speaker, describes Farron as a \u201cone-man tourist board\u201d. May says, while Cumbria has good produce, so does Berkshire. James Gray, a Conservative, asks may to confirm that Dyson is completely committed to the UK, even though it is moving its HQ to Singapore. May says the firm is committed to the UK. What matters to firms like Dyson is having a government committed to business. Labour\u2019s Liz McInnes says Santander is closing its branch in Middleton. What is the government doing to help high streets, other than \u201cmanaged decline\u201d. May says the government is concerned about managing high streets. The budget contained plans to help councils protect high streets. The SNP\u2019s Stewart Hosie asks about a constituent who has waited 10 years to renew his passport. He has raised this before with May, but only had a holding answer. May apologies to Hosie for not giving him a proper response. He says the home secretary will meet Hosie to discuss the case. Lucy Allan, a Conservative, asks about the amount of time taken for the Telford child abuse inquiry. May says the inquiry should be set up as soon as possible. Labour\u2019s John Mann is asking about a teenage constituent who took his own life. Does May agree that teenagers who need emergency mental health support should be able to access it within 24 hours? May offers her condolences to the boy\u2019s family. Every life lost is a tragedy. She says suicides are deeply concerning. That is why the government is increasing spending on mental health. PMQs - snap verdict: A high-scoring, and fairly evenly-matched PMQs, where Corbyn probably had the upper hand, because by the end he sounded more reasonable. He devoted all his questions to Brexit, and mostly focused on challenging May to rule out no deal, and to accept the case for the UK staying in a customs union. On the latter point, May was reasonably clear, restating her opposition to a CU on the grounds that it would not allow the UK to strike its own trade deals. On no deal, she was more evasive. Corbyn asked at one point if she would accept the amendments tabled ahead of next week\u2019s vote, designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit, if they are passed. This is a crucial question, because it is not clear that the amendments will actually have the impact the MPs who have tabled them hope, and May did not address this point at all, beyond saying that extending article 50 does not absolutely rule out no deal because it only postpones the decision point. The point Corbyn made at the end about May ruling out the two propositions for which there is majority support in the Commons was a strong one. But it was not a clear-cut win for him. Predictably, but not entirely unfairly, May clobbered him in her first response for his decision to boycott her cross-party talks on Brexit by imposing a precondition. (Many people have said he would have been better advised to just turn up, and denounce her inflexibility afterwards.) May also had a good riff about technical aspects of Labour\u2019s CU policy, which the party has not been able to address. This attack line was well-founded too. But, overall, she came over as harsh and defensive, confirming the jibe Corbyn made about her having an open door but a closed mind. This was probably the best soundbite of the exchange. It was not actually Corbyn\u2019s, because Hilary Benn first used this line in the Commons on Monday, but so what? Most viewers won\u2019t have realised, and it worked. Corbyn says Liam Fox could not name one country he has reached a trade deal with. He will sell jobs down the river. Why? May says she wants a deal that protects jobs. She says Corbyn stands up and delivers phrases. But he does not know what those phrases mean, she says. And Corbyn has not mentioned the employment figures. Corbyn says May has not mentioned poverty. The door may be open, but minds are closed, he says. He says a third of her government are at the billionaires\u2019 jamboree at Davos. He says May has ruled out the two issues on which there is a majority in Commons \u2013 ruling out no deal and a customs union. May asks why Corbyn won\u2019t come and talk about it. She says borrowing is at its lowest level for 16 years, the IMF is predicting higher growth than for some other big economies, and the biggest threat to that would be a Labour government. Corbyn says a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs and undermine living standards. Is her government ruling out a customs union with the EU? May says Labour has an amendment on this. But what does Labour mean by staying in the customs union? She rattles off a series of questions, and says she would like to talk to Corbyn about it. If he won\u2019t talk about it, he has not got a clue. Corbyn says it is a simple question. The TUC backs his policy, she says, and the CBI, and the first minsters of Wales and Scotland. Can May explain why she is ruling it out? She could, for once, answer the question. May says she will try to help. She says when people talk about it, they want businesses to be able to export to the EU without facing tariffs or rules-of-origin checks. Her deal allows that, but also allows the UK to strike its own trade deals. Jeremy Corbyn starts by also mentioning Holocaust Memorial Day, and condemning antisemitism and racism. He says the chancellor and the business secretary say there is a large majority in the Commons against no deal. So will she take it off the table? May says the way to avoid no deal is to pass a deal. She says she wants to sit down and talk about how to secure support for a deal. Corbyn has been willing to sit down with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA without pre-conditions. But he won\u2019t sit down with May. In this case, he is neither present nor involved. Corbyn says he did offer to meet May last autumn. While May\u2019s door may be open, her mind is closed. Will May confirm that, if the anti no-deal amendments are passed, they will rule out no deal. May says the amendments do not solve the issue, because they just delay Brexit. Stephen Kerr, a Conservative, says the UK is the most successful political union that the world has ever known. When Nicola Sturgeon demands a second independence referendum, the UK government should say no, he says. May agrees. People in Scotland voted to stay in the UK. And at the last general election people indicated that they opposed a second referendum. A second referendum is \u201cthe last thing we want\u201d, she says. Theresa May starts by saying MPs will want to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Sunday. It is a reminder we must all challenge prejudice and hatred, she says. From the Times\u2019 Patrick Kidd PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. The Irish border backstop would constrain the UK\u2019s negotiating position during post-separation trade talks, a pro-Brexit legal expert said. As the Press Association reports, Martin Howe QC, who chairs Lawyers for Britain, said there would be no incentive for the EU to make concessions if the backstop was the default. Giving evidence to the Northern Ireland affairs committee, he said: You cannot hold out for your essential interests. If you fail to reach agreement these terms come into effect, that constrains your negotiating power. Why should the other side give you better terms unless you are able to offer them something else in return that is better for them? ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston has written an interesting Facebook post about Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s speech later today. (See 10am.) He sees it as evidence that Brexiters are \u201cpanicking that a referendum and staying in the EU will soon become the default position\u201d.\u201d But he is not convinced that a degree of flexibility from the ERG means a deal with the EU will be possible. He says: So although the PM will take considerable comfort from the moves by Mogg and the DUP to tone down their rhetoric against the broader tapestry of her deal (which of course still repels them), she will need much more from them if the EU27 leaders are to make the kind of compromise which all history suggests they will never make. The Brexiters and DUP will need to prove beyond reasonable doubt both that they would vote for a withdrawal agreement stripped of the [backstop], and that they command sufficient numbers of votes to carry it over the line. It is that requisite very public endorsement by Mogg of May and the iteration of Brexit he despises that, to put it mildly, stretches credibility. Have stranger things ever happened? Incidentally, what the \u201csenior official\u201d from an EU capital quoted by Peston says about the need for Theresa May to have a \u201clarge and stable\u201d majority to get Brexit legislation through parliament sounds very similar to what Michel Barnier was saying in his Luxembourg Times interview. (See 10.50am.) In evidence to the Commons justice committee, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, explained why he thought the publication of his legal advice on the Brexit backstop before Christmas should not be allowed to set a precedent for the future. Asked if it should, he replied: No, I would argue not, because the principle [that government legal advice is kept private] is so vital to the conduct of good government, even more acutely so in circumstances of great public interest and controversy. If every time the attorney general now has to consider whether or not his advice is going to be put up on a 24-hour rolling news programme and pulled apart in a 45-second analysis \u2013 without the nuance, without the context, without the bits that weren\u2019t in bold, and only those bits in bold accentuated \u2013 he is going to have to consider how does he express himself in future ... The attorney by definition tends only to give advice in exceptional circumstances and the more exquisitely sensitive and controversial they are, it is even more important that his advice should be able to be candid and frank and targeted. Sitting in cabinet ... he knows the issues with which his colleagues are struggling, he knows those which have to be accentuated and emphasised to drive home the point and he knows those points which are not necessarily so important. That particularly focused and targeted advice on the need of the moment will sometimes be given in a manner \u2013 because it is designed for that moment \u2013 that at another time, where there are different priorities and different understandings, he might have expressed himself differently. This morning the Guardian reports on British fishermen\u2019s anxieties about direct action from France in the event of a no-deal Brexit: the fishing community is becoming increasingly concerned that blockades by French crew, angry at no longer being able to fish in UK waters, could leave their catch rotting at the border. These concerns would seem to be bolstered by an interview with Olivier Lepr\u00eatre, a Boulogne trawler skipper who is vice-president of France\u2019s CNPMEM fishermen\u2019s committee. He says that French fishermen will have nothing to lose by taking action, warning: \u201cNot a single kilo of seafood from Britain will be allowed into Europe.\u201d He tells the Fisker Forum, an online fishing news service for the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia: If we are sacrificed to Brexit, then we have nothing left to lose. We will get rid of every British flagged vessel, regardless of its ownership. That\u2019ll be hard luck for the opportunists. It\u2019s hard to gauge just how damaging direct action in France could be. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen\u2019s Federation, told the Guardian that he believed any protests would be short-lived, but Elaine Whyte, who represents smaller fishing operations on the Clyde, warned that she feared some would go to the wall if live catch was not able to make it to its EU destination. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has given an intriguing interview to the Luxembourg Times. Here are the main points. Barnier said the UK could minimise the problem posed by the backstop by opting for a softer form of Brexit. He said: If the UK government wants to be more ambitious in its future relationship which is not part of the withdrawal agreement, we can do so, and then come to an agreement on the entire package. That would make the question of the backstop less prominent. Looking at it objectively, I have the impression that the backstop is not the central issue. Ultimately, the debate in Britain is about what the future of the UK will look like. I believe that we can overcome the current difficulties when we discuss that issue together. He also claimed there was a \u201creadiness in London\u201d for this sort of approach (although it is not clear if, by \u201cLondon\u201d, he meant the government or parliament). He said: We\u2019re cooperating with the British government. Things could start moving rapidly. This depends on the future relationship, like I already said. We are ready to be more ambitious if the British decide to shift their red lines, for example by remaining in a customs union, or participating in the single market. I believe there is a readiness in London for that. He conceded the EU could agree to extend article 50 in certain conditions. He said: If Britain asks for an extension, it has to be approved by EU leaders. They will only agree if three questions are answered: first and second, why and how long? And third, will not that be a problem for holding the EU elections in May? I have no clear legal answer to the third question yet. It is important that the EU\u2019s democratic processes are not disturbed by this, however. The first two questions are complex and interconnected: it needs a stable majority in London for all laws related to Brexit that need to be adopted. This will need time. He said, if the UK leaves the EU with no deal, there will have to be checks on goods crossing the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. When it was put to him that the UK did not need to accept the backstop, because in the event of a no-deal Brexit the UK and the EU would try to avoid a hard border anyway, he replied: There will be checks in case of a no-deal-Brexit. We will do everything possible to enforce them unobtrusively. However, that will not be possible with everything. How should we control animals crossing the border? There will have to be checks. Again, the problem arose from Brexit and we expect the UK to take responsibility. He reaffirmed the EU\u2019s opposition to putting a time limit on the backstop. This is one of Theresa May\u2019s key demands. But Barnier said: The backstop is like an insurance. It is not there to be used. And if so, only provisionally. However, we cannot tie the backstop to a time limit. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, seems to be implying in the speech is he giving to today that the EU may be willing to compromise over the backstop. (See 10am.) Barnier\u2019s interview suggests otherwise. Barnier insisted that the Irish border problem was an issue for the EU as a whole, and not just for Ireland. He said: This is a pan-European problem because it is to do with the integrity of the European single market. A product that enters the market in Northern Ireland and then Ireland will find itself in the European market and could continue to travel to Luxembourg. Here we have an obligation to protect European consumers and businesses and therefore we have to control these goods. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon is meeting Theresa May, along with the Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford, later today for further Brexit talks, but it\u2019s fair to say that no one is expecting the conversation to be particularly constructive. In advance of the meeting, Sturgeon warned May to \u201cstop blaming everybody else\u201d for the worse political crisis in decades, and \u201cstart listening\u201d. The Scottish government has consistently complained that its opinion has been sidelined in Brexit-related talks over the past three years, although May insisted on Monday that devolved administrations would now be more closely involved in discussions. SNP MPs have been involved in cross-party attempts to block a no-deal scenario. Meanwhile, Sturgeon said that she would urge May to extend article 50 and consider a second referendum. She said: Theresa May\u2019s current strategy is to rule out the possible \u2013 extending the article 50 period \u2013 while pursuing the impossible \u2013 changes to the backstop. At today\u2019s meeting I will be making clear to the prime minister that it is she who needs to change her position \u2013 not everybody else. The time has come for the Brexit clock to be stopped, through a formal extension of article 50 to allow a second referendum on EU membership to be held. We simply cannot afford to be dragged any closer to the cliff edge of No-deal \u2013 an outcome which should now be explicitly and definitively ruled out. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter who chairs the European Research Group, is giving a speech at lunchtime, and it sounds as if it is going to be significant. The ERG represents the 60-odd Tories most committed to a harder Brexit and it has led the opposition to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. Rees-Mogg celebrated the defeat of May\u2019s deal by hosting a champagne reception and ERG members regularly argue that they would be happy to see the UK leave without a deal. But now, according to a briefing from the speech sent out to journalists in advance, Rees-Mogg will say the backstop is the only \u201cabsolute obstacle\u201d to a deal (in the past the ERG has highlighted many other objections to it), and he will suggest that he and his fellow Brexiters are in a mood to compromise. Rees-Mogg will say: There are outbreaks of realism all around I see. All along we have been asking merely for the possible, not the impossible. And late in the day as the EU has inevitably left it, I\u2019m sure common sense and practicality will now prevail. The backstop doesn\u2019t work for unionists in the Tory party, or the DUP. The pretence that we might ever swallow it is now over. It\u2019s long past time to get on and just do the feasible deal that has always been there to do. (These words were supposed to be released under embargo, but the press notice sent to journalists did not make this particularly clear, and others have posted them on Twitter, and so I am putting them up now.) Without having read the full speech, it is hard to know quite how real this shift it, but it could be evidence that the prospect of Brexit being blocked by the Commons has made Tory Brexiters more eager to support a deal that makes it happen. Nadine Dorries, another Tory Brexiter, made this argument in a Newsnight interview on Monday. The next big parliamentary vote on Brexit comes next week and last night there was good news for those who want to amend the government motion to force the government to rule out a no-deal Brexit. There are various amendments on the order paper designed to do this, and one of the main ones has been tabled by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper. It would create time for MPs to debate her bill (pdf) saying Theresa May would have to seek an extension of article 50 until the end of the year if MPs have not approved a Brexit deal by 26 February. On Newsnight last night John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, all but announced that Labour will support the Cooper amendment. He said it was a \u201csensible proposal\u201d and that it was \u201cincreasingly likely\u201d that Labour would vote for it. Assuming the amendment gets called, given the number of rebel Tories in favour, this means it is highly likely to pass. You can read the Cooper amendment, and all the others, on the order paper (pdf), staring from page 49. My colleague Jessica Elgot has written a good guide to what they all mean here. But would the Cooper amendment actually stop a no-deal Brexit if it were passed? On the Today programme, Liam Fox, the Brexiter international trade secretary, claimed that it would not. He claimed that it was constitutionally improper. But he also claimed it would not work. Asked about it, he said: I don\u2019t think it is possible to do it [block a no-deal Brexit] in the way that they suggest. Some of the amendments being spoken about, where the House of Commons would take control over the initiation of legislation - there\u2019s a real danger here, and it\u2019s a much bigger constitutional one. We have an arrangement in our country where the executive - ie, the government of the day - puts forward legislation, parliament scrutinises it, parliament amends it, parliament can decide to pass it or not pass it. What is being suggested here is the House of Commons both initiates the legislation and scrutinises it, which is a huge change to our constitution. And the danger here is, you change our constitutional conventions for one reason, but it has huge consequences elsewhere. And in effect, in this motion, we are being asked to change it without any real debate about the constitutional significance. (In fact, parliament regularly debates and passes legislation proposed by backbenchers - there is a formal procedure for this - but never mind ...) MPs will not be able to use an amendment next week to stop no deal, Fox claims. As the interviewer, Nick Robinson, pointed out, Fox\u2019s argument bluntly contradicted what Philip Hammond, the chancellor, told business leaders in a conference call last week after MPs voted down Theresa May\u2019s deal. Hammond urged them not to worry too much about a no-deal Brexit happening because MPs would block it. \u201cI can simply as a parliamentarian say it is clear to me there is a large majority in the Commons that is opposed to no deal in any circumstances,\u201d Hammond said. In his interview, when it was put to him that even May admits a no-deal Brexit would be very bad for the UK, Fox claimed it would be better than delaying Brexit. He explained: I think there are many who talk about delaying Brexit when what they really mean is not having Brexit at all. And I think the worst outcome in this political process would be for parliament, having given a guarantee to the voters that they would honour the result of the referendum, to turn round and break that contract with the voters ... I think the most dangerous thing for Britain, politically, is for Brexit to be denied to the British people when they were specifically promised it. I think it would open up a gulf of trust between parliament and the people that might be difficult to repair, and with unknowable consequences. Fox claims delaying Brexit would be even worse for the UK than no deal. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 1pm: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, gives a speech to the Bruges Group. 4pm: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary after PMQs and another at the end of the day, after the Barclay hearing. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

The study, published in the journal Nature on Thursday, examined data on brittle sea stars pulled from 1,500 research voyages in the southern hemisphere from the equator to Antarctica. Brittle stars, five-legged alien-like creatures that make up the class Ophiuroidea, are abundant on the seafloor and make an \u201cexcellent model for studying patterns across all depths and latitudes,\u201d researchers said. The study identified a \u201cmuseum zone\u201d in the upper deep regions near the equator, where ancient species with a long lineage could be found alongside key commercial fishing species. \u201cThe dinosaur-type things are all in the tropical deep sea \u2026 things that have just hung on for a long time and are on their last legs,\u201d said lead researcher Dr Tim O\u2019Hara, the senior curator of marine invertebrates at Museums Victoria. \u201cIt\u2019s not really an environment that\u2019s being highlighted in conservation. People think of the need to conserve coral reefs, and that\u2019s quite true, but equally we have to consider what are we doing to the depths between 200 and 800 metres. \u201cThat\u2019s where a lot of fisheries are, for example. And yet that\u2019s where all these ancient animals, quite vulnerable animals, are living.\u201d Animals in the very deep ocean, dropping down to 4km below sea level, were much younger because they relied on the oxygen-rich cold water from the ice caps to be habitable. \u201cIf the world is in a really hot time, like it was when the dinosaurs were around, there is no flow to the deep sea, the deep sea goes anoxic, and all of those animals are largely wiped out,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. \u201cSo there\u2019s kind of this little sweet spot in the upper deep sea about 200 to 800 metres that seems to survive those sorts of environmental destructive climatic events.\u201d The study is the first published piece of research from a deep-sea expedition conducted by Museums Victoria and the CSIRO in 2017. It examined 160,000 records of brittle stars, covering 596 species and 417 genera. The animals, which O\u2019Hara called \u201cthe garbage collectors of the sea,\u201d are one of the few species that occur in abundance from the tropics to Antarctica. Some are small-scale scavengers, others are more predatory. The stars showed that the freezing deep sea below Antarctica was an evolutionary hot spot, overturning previous assumptions that the cold temperatures had slowed the pace of change. O\u2019Hara attributed the \u201chigh speed\u201d of diversification to the recent \u2013 in evolutionary terms \u2013 establishment of the ice caps, which have only been in place for 33 million years. \u201cOnce the glaciers came and the ice caps formed it was so cold around that area that really the existing animals couldn\u2019t cope and they largely died out, and a whole new fauna had to evolve,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty-three million years later it\u2019s still going gangbusters.

      "bodyText": "A controversial procedure that can spread particular genes through an entire wild species has been demonstrated in mammals for the first time. Researchers in the US showed that a \u201cgene drive\u201d could rewrite the genetic makeup of mice so that the rodents carried DNA that had been designed by the scientists. Gene drives work by breaking the normal rules of inheritance to ensure certain genes, often modified versions, are passed on from one generation to another at a higher rate than normal. The procedure has drawn huge interest from researchers because of its potential to combat diseases such as malaria by rewriting the genetic makeup of mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite. Experimental gene drives have already been used to make disease-carrying mosquitoes infertile. If these insects were released into the wild, it is likely mosquito populations would crash. Other gene drives have boosted the insects\u2019 resistance to infection by the parasites. Many scientists suspect that the same approach might prove a more effective alternative to the laborious and costly eradication projects used to clear remote islands of invasive species. Last year, the world\u2019s largest eradication effort finally declared South Georgia free of the mice and rats that had devastated its wildlife for more than 250 years. But, for all their potential, many researchers are cautious about gene drives because those that go awry could cause substantial damage to ecosystems. In 2016, the US National Academies of Science ruled that far more work was needed to understand and control gene drives before they can safely be used in the wild.

      "body": "<p>Four former Barclays executives have appeared in court charged with fraud in relation to the multibillion-pound rescue of the bank by Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>John Varley, the former chief executive of Barclays, is the first boss of a major bank to face a jury trial over alleged crimes during the global financial crisis a decade ago.</p> <p>Ed Brown QC, prosecuting on behalf of the Serious Fraud Office, said the case would examine \u201chow those at the very top of the bank responded to the pressure that it created\u201d.</p> <p>As the trial, which is expected to last four to six months, began at Southwark crown court on Wednesday, the judge Mr Justice Robert Jay told the jury to to put aside their feelings towards bankers and the damage the financial crisis caused to society.</p> <p>\u201cThe backdrop of this case is the global financial crisis of 2008,\u201d Brown told the jury. \u201cThe first obvious and outward sign of it, at least to the UK public, was the closing of the doors of the bank Northern Rock in 2007.

      "bodyText": "Four former Barclays executives have appeared in court charged with fraud in relation to the multibillion-pound rescue of the bank by Qatar during the 2008 financial crisis. John Varley, the former chief executive of Barclays, is the first boss of a major bank to face a jury trial over alleged crimes during the global financial crisis a decade ago. Ed Brown QC, prosecuting on behalf of the Serious Fraud Office, said the case would examine \u201chow those at the very top of the bank responded to the pressure that it created\u201d. As the trial, which is expected to last four to six months, began at Southwark crown court on Wednesday, the judge Mr Justice Robert Jay told the jury to to put aside their feelings towards bankers and the damage the financial crisis caused to society. \u201cThe backdrop of this case is the global financial crisis of 2008,\u201d Brown told the jury. \u201cThe first obvious and outward sign of it, at least to the UK public, was the closing of the doors of the bank Northern Rock in 2007. However, the crisis in the UK and across the world worsened and deepened as time went on and into 2008.\u201d Brown alleged that Varley, and the other former Barclays bosses, made secret payments to Qatar in order to secure investment from the Gulf state and therefore avoid a UK government bailout. Brown said the Barclays executives were \u201cvery anxious\u201d about controls the government would impose on Barclays if it had to accept a taxpayer bailout like Lloyds Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland. \u201cThose at the top of Barclays were very anxious to avoid accepting government money, thereby placing itself under greater government control and scrutiny,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that Barclays\u2019 future as an independent bank was in jeopardy in September and October of 2008.\u201d Brown said the Barclays bosses determined that the way to avoid a government bailout was to raise investment via a capital raising \u2013 selling a stake in the bank to investors. He said it was normal for investors to be paid fees associated with capital raisings, but the Barclays bosses paid extra and hidden fees to Qatar that were not available to other investors. \u201cIt is the hiding of these additional commission fees which lies at the heart of this case and the conspiracies alleged against the defendants, disguising and hiding extra fees to the tune, ultimately, of a total of nearly a third of a billion pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very clear to the defendants that the only way of securing the Qataris\u2019 investment, but also avoiding paying others at the same rate or looking weak to the market, was to pay the money demanded by the Qataris [and] to hide the true position from the market,\u201d Brown said. All four defendants deny the charges and state that the extra fees were paid for genuine advisory services agreements (ASAs) provided by the Qatari investors. Brown said the ASAs were \u201cnothing more than a smokescreen\u201d to try to \u201clegitimise what had gone before\u201d. \u201cThose agreements were in truth not genuine agreements of services,\u201d Brown alleged. \u201cThey were dishonest mechanisms to hide additional fees being paid to the Qataris for their investment.\u201d Brown said the men conspired to commit the alleged fraud, and were motivated by their desire to secure the future of the bank as well as concern about the scale of their personal bonuses. \u201cThere were also obvious personal motivations for the individual conspirators,\u201d he said. \u201cThe security of their jobs and the very large bonuses that they might receive in addition to their salaries were in jeopardy if the future and the security of the bank was in doubt, or placed in the hands of the UK government.\u201d The four men \u2013 Varley, who was CEO of Barclays between 2004 and 2011; Roger Jenkins, the former head of the investment banking division Barclays Capital; Tom Kalaris, who was boss of Barclays\u2019 wealth management division; and Richard Boath, the former head of its European financial institutions group \u2013 were charged with conspiring to commit fraud by making false representations. Varley and Jenkins face an additional charge related to a second round of fundraising. Barclays former finance director Chris Lucas was also named as a co-conspirator, but is suffering from a serious illness and will not stand trial.

      "body": "<p>The film-maker Jonas Mekas, widely regarded as the godfather of underground cinema, has died aged 96. Born in Lithuania, he fled the Nazis and went on to work with the cream of the New York 1960s avant garde, including Allen Ginsberg, Andy Warhol, John Lennon and Yoko Ono.</p> <p>Mekas\u2019s death was announced on hi<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jonasmekas/\">s Facebook page</a>, which said: \u201cJonas passed away quietly and peacefully early this morning. He was at home with family. He will be greatly missed but his light shines on.\u201d</p> <p>The director made some 60 films, usually with an impressionistic, diaristic style in which flickering images revealed quiet, intimate moments rather than a grand narrative. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/01/jonas-mekas-avant-garde-film-interview\">He told the Observer\u2019s Sean O\u2019Hagan in 2012</a>: \u201cIt is important to know that what I do is not artistic. I am just a film-maker. I live how I live and I do what I do, which is recording moments of my life as I move ahead. And I do it because I am compelled to. Necessity, not artistry, is the true line you can follow in my life and work.\u201d</p> <p>His Manhattan loft became a nexus for artistic experimentation. The Velvet Underground rehearsed there; Mekas is said to have introduced their frontman Lou Reed to Warhol, who produced their debut album. Salvador Dal\u00ed also visited the space, curious about New York\u2019s underground scene, which resulted in a Mekas film called Salvador Dal\u00ed at Work, which featured the artist covering the model Veruschka in shaving cream.</p> <p>His work influenced generations of film-makers from John Waters and Jim Jarmusch to Harmony Korine and beyond. Korine called Mekas \u201ca true hero of the underground and a radical of the first degree \u2026 he sees things that others can\u2019t\u2026 his cinema is a cinema of memory and soul and air and fire. There is no one else like him. His films will live for ever.\u201d</p> <p>A 1965 film about a military prison, The Brig, won the Grand Prix at the Venice Film Festival, while <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069172/\">Reminiscences of a Journey to Lithuania</a>, from 1972, was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Mekas co-founded <a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/\">Anthology Film Archives</a>, which continues to screen experimental films in New York\u2019s East Village, and has the largest library of such material in the world.</p> <p>The director\u2019s final film, released in 2012, was titled Out-takes from the Life of a Happy Man. An anthology of Mekas\u2019s columns in the Village Voice, <a href=\"http://spectorbooks.com/conversations-with-filmmakers\">Conversations With Filmmakers</a>, was published in 2018. Mekas engaged in a tour to promote the book including a talk at London\u2019s Serpentine gallery, which in 2012 had staged a retrospective of his work. That show was accompanied by a season of his films at the BFI, and another at the Pompidou in Paris.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/24/jonas-mekas-last-interview-godfather-underground-film-avant-garde-john-yoko-dali-warhol\">'I was very angry' \u2013 the last interview with Jonas Mekas, godfather of avant garde film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mekas, who was also a poet who published 20 books, was born in Semeni\u0161kiai, Lithuania, in 1922. Leaving the country in 1944, Mekas\u2019s train was stopped by the Nazis and he and his brother Adolfas were taken to a labour camp, escaping after eight months to hide on a farm near the Danish border. After the war they lived in displaced persons\u2019 camps, then Mekas studied philosophy at Mainz university. In 1949 the brothers were taken by the UN Refugee Organisation to New York.</p> <p>Mekas scraped together the money to buy a Bolex camera with which he documented his new life, and rapidly became involved in the city\u2019s avant garde scene. In 1954 the brothers founded <a href=\"http://petersalisbury.com/movingimage/settingthescene/selections-from-film-culture-magazine-1955-1996/\">Film Culture magazine</a>; four years after that, he became New York paper the Village Voice\u2019s first film critic. By the 60s Mekas was showing experimental films in his loft \u2013 one 1964 screening of <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/jack-smith-flaming-creatures-1962-1963/\">Jack Smith\u2019s Flaming Creatures</a> had him arrested for obscenity \u2013 to a crowd including Warhol, Ono and Robert Frank. Mekas subsequently worked on <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/89507\">Empire</a>, Warhol\u2019s eight-hour film of the Empire State Building.</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, Mekas also struck up a friendship with Jackie Kennedy, tutoring her children in filmmaking. He was also the first person John Lennon and Yoko Ono rang when the pair moved to New York in 1976. He told O\u2019Hagan: \u201cIt was late at night and I was in bed, when I got a call from Yoko, who had just landed with John at JFK. She said, \u2018Jonas, John wants an espresso. Do you know a good place that is still open in New York?\u2019 It was a little crazy, but that was how it was back then.\u201d</p>",

Born in Lithuania, he fled the Nazis and went on to work with the cream of the New York 1960s avant garde, including Allen Ginsberg, Andy Warhol, John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Mekas\u2019s death was announced on his Facebook page, which said: \u201cJonas passed away quietly and peacefully early this morning. He was at home with family. He will be greatly missed but his light shines on.\u201d The director made some 60 films, usually with an impressionistic, diaristic style in which flickering images revealed quiet, intimate moments rather than a grand narrative. He told the Observer\u2019s Sean O\u2019Hagan in 2012: \u201cIt is important to know that what I do is not artistic. I am just a film-maker. I live how I live and I do what I do, which is recording moments of my life as I move ahead. And I do it because I am compelled to. Necessity, not artistry, is the true line you can follow in my life and work.\u201d His Manhattan loft became a nexus for artistic experimentation. The Velvet Underground rehearsed there; Mekas is said to have introduced their frontman Lou Reed to Warhol, who produced their debut album. Salvador Dal\u00ed also visited the space, curious about New York\u2019s underground scene, which resulted in a Mekas film called Salvador Dal\u00ed at Work, which featured the artist covering the model Veruschka in shaving cream. His work influenced generations of film-makers from John Waters and Jim Jarmusch to Harmony Korine and beyond. Korine called Mekas \u201ca true hero of the underground and a radical of the first degree \u2026 he sees things that others can\u2019t\u2026 his cinema is a cinema of memory and soul and air and fire. There is no one else like him. His films will live for ever.\u201d A 1965 film about a military prison, The Brig, won the Grand Prix at the Venice Film Festival, while Reminiscences of a Journey to Lithuania, from 1972, was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Mekas co-founded Anthology Film Archives, which continues to screen experimental films in New York\u2019s East Village, and has the largest library of such material in the world. The director\u2019s final film, released in 2012, was titled Out-takes from the Life of a Happy Man. An anthology of Mekas\u2019s columns in the Village Voice, Conversations With Filmmakers, was published in 2018. Mekas engaged in a tour to promote the book including a talk at London\u2019s Serpentine gallery, which in 2012 had staged a retrospective of his work. That show was accompanied by a season of his films at the BFI, and another at the Pompidou in Paris. Mekas, who was also a poet who published 20 books, was born in Semeni\u0161kiai, Lithuania, in 1922. Leaving the country in 1944, Mekas\u2019s train was stopped by the Nazis and he and his brother Adolfas were taken to a labour camp, escaping after eight months to hide on a farm near the Danish border. After the war they lived in displaced persons\u2019 camps, then Mekas studied philosophy at Mainz university. In 1949 the brothers were taken by the UN Refugee Organisation to New York. Mekas scraped together the money to buy a Bolex camera with which he documented his new life, and rapidly became involved in the city\u2019s avant garde scene. In 1954 the brothers founded Film Culture magazine; four years after that, he became New York paper the Village Voice\u2019s first film critic. By the 60s Mekas was showing experimental films in his loft \u2013 one 1964 screening of Jack Smith\u2019s Flaming Creatures had him arrested for obscenity \u2013 to a crowd including Warhol, Ono and Robert Frank. Mekas subsequently worked on Empire, Warhol\u2019s eight-hour film of the Empire State Building. Perhaps surprisingly, Mekas also struck up a friendship with Jackie Kennedy, tutoring her children in filmmaking. He was also the first person John Lennon and Yoko Ono rang when the pair moved to New York in 1976. He told O\u2019Hagan: \u201cIt was late at night and I was in bed, when I got a call from Yoko, who had just landed with John at JFK. She said, \u2018Jonas, John wants an espresso. Do you know a good place that is still open in New York?\u2019 It was a little crazy, but that was how it was back then.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tensions between Italy and France have deepened after the Italian deputy prime minister urged French people not to support Emmanuel Macron in forthcoming elections, provoking a withering response from Paris. Matteo Salvini called on voters to shun the French president\u2019s En Marche party in European parliamentary elections in May, prompting Nathalie Loisseau, France\u2019s European affairs minister, to dismiss his comments as insignificant and insisting they would not trigger a \u201ccompetition of the stupidest\u201d. \u201cIn France they have a bad government and a bad president of the Republic,\u201d Salvini, who also leads the far-right Northern League, wrote on Facebook. \u201cMacron speaks about being welcoming, but then rejects immigrants at the border. The French people deserve better and the European elections of 26 May will provide a good signal.\u201d To stoke the fire further, Luca Morisi, Salvini\u2019s social media strategist, posted a photo of the minister with Marine Le Pen, his French far-right counterpart who was defeated by Macron in the 2017 elections, on his Facebook page alongside the caption: \u201cMatteo + Marine, Macron\u2019s worst nightmare!\u201d Salvini has forged a partnership with Le Pen as part of a nationalist drive to \u201csave the real Europe\u201d in the EU elections. Salvini seized the opportunity to attack Macron after Luigi Di Maio, his coalition partner and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, caused a storm by accusing France of creating poverty in Africa and causing mass migration to Europe. The Italian envoy in France, Teresa Castaldo, was summoned on Monday over what the French foreign ministry described as \u201chostile\u201d remarks. In response, Loisseau said the insults were \u201cuseless\u201d and would have no effect on French policy. She said: \u201cIn France, we have an expression that says whatever is excessive is insignificant. When remarks are excessive \u2026 they are, therefore, insignificant.\u201d She added she would not be visiting Italy until \u201cthe climate calms.\u201d Salvini also called on Macron to return 14 Italian fugitives living in France. It is the second time he has made the request since Cesare Battisti, a former leftwing guerrilla fighter convicted of four murders in the late 1970s, was extradited from South America last week after almost 40 years on the run. \u201cI would like the French president to show the same good sense as [Brazilian president Jair] Bolsonaro did,\u201d Salvini said. Italy and France enjoyed good relations before the coalition came to power last June. Things got off to a bad start after Macron spoke about \u201cpopulist leprosy\u201d in a reported dig against the new government.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May could be persuaded to think about a so-called citizens\u2019 assembly as a way out of the Brexit impasse, according to one of the MPs leading efforts at parliament to promote the idea. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said the current main objection to the idea \u2013 a lack of time \u2013 would no longer be in place if the Brexit deadline was pushed back with an extension to article 50, as seems likely. Lucas is one of a group of MPs and experts meeting at parliament on Wednesday evening to promote the idea, which sees a representative but randomly selected group of people called together to seek possible solutions to major national issues. She is also among a cross-party group of 18 opposition MPs who have signed up to an amendment to May\u2019s Brexit plan tabled by Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy, which calls for a citizens\u2019 assembly to be created. Citizens\u2019 assemblies have been used in other countries at a local and national level for decades, with recent topics including constitutional reform in Iceland and abortion in Ireland. Lucas said that when she met May in talks with opposition MPs following the crushing defeat of May\u2019s Brexit plan last week, she discussed the idea of a second referendum with the prime minister, who made it clear she disagreed. \u201cBut when I talked about a citizens\u2019 assembly she was genuinely interested and did want to know more about it,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cMy sense is that Downing Street is probably looking for ways out of the corner they\u2019ve painted themselves into.\u201d No 10 have not specifically ruled out the idea, but say there is no plan for such a system to be used. Among those speaking at parliament on Wednesday was Graham Smith, professor of politics at Westminster university, who has researched the subject for 20 years. A key aspect of citizens\u2019 assemblies, he said, was not just that governments did not have to agree with their findings, but that the people involved did not have to all agree with the conclusions. \u201cYou\u2019re creating the conditions for which people can understand where they\u2019ve got shared interests, which is really important. But what you\u2019re not doing is forcing them to come up with a consensus opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cYou give them the space to disagree. Most of these assemblies make recommendations as a majority, often a significant one. But there will always be minority opinions.\u201d Creasy\u2019s amendment, signed by a series of Labour and Lib Dem MPs, calls for an extension of article 50 to allow time for a 250-member citizens\u2019 assembly to hear a range of opinions on Brexit and present recommendations within 10 weeks. While no Conservatives have yet signed up, the influential Tory backbencher George Freeman, who formerly headed May\u2019s policy unit, tweeted that it was a possible route out of deadlock. \u201cThere is definitely growing interest in this in parliament,\u201d Creasy said, stressing that these were by no means just MPs, like her, who back a second referendum: \u201cThere are a range of people who support a range of outcomes, but the one thing we are agreed on is that we have to find a better way to hear what the public think of things.\u201d Others who have supported the broader idea include Gordon Brown, and a group including the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the musician Damon Albarn, who wrote a letter to the Guardian in December to back it. Lucas said that the appeal of the idea was that as well as finding a way forward on Brexit, a citizens\u2019 assembly could be part of creating a more consensual, inclusive politics. \u201cIt feels to me that a citizens\u2019 assembly is a way of going back to people, and using the wisdom of a number of people over a period of time to wrestle with the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also it\u2019s important to re-engage people with the democratic process, and it feels to me that Brexit has really revealed the huge amount of democratic and economic exclusion in our country.\u201d",

In an interview with Le Monde, Rzeczpospolita and Luxemburger Wort published earlier on Wednesday, Barnier made public his belief that May\u2019s strategy of trying to secure a time-limit was doomed to fail. In comments that appear to put a wrecking ball to the prime minister\u2019s strategy, he said the withdrawal agreement in all its facets was the \u201cthe only possible option\u201d for Britain as it leaves. \u201cThe question of limiting the backstop in time has already been discussed twice by European leaders\u201d, Barnier said. \u201cThis is the only possible option because an insurance is of no use if it is time limited. \u201cWe cannot tie the backstop to a time limit\u201d, he added. \u201cImagine if your home\u2019s insurance was limited to five years and you\u2019d have a problem after six years \u2026 That\u2019s difficult to justify.

Under the backstop, the UK would stay in a customs union with the EU unless an alternative arrangement could avoid the imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. In her statement to the Commons on Monday, May had said she would seek further concessions from Brussels having acknowledged that a large number of Conservative and Democratic Unionist party MPs \u201cfear that we could be trapped in it\u201d. The Tory MP and Brexiter Andrew Murrison has resubmitted a \u201csunset clause\u201d amendment in the Commons, which offers support for May\u2019s deal if the backstop can be time-limited to the end of 2021.

He worked on the Tanganyika groundnut scheme at Kongwa (now in Tanzania) in the 1940s, initially living and working in tents until houses were built. The scheme, intended to supply vegetable oil for the UK\u2019s poswar diet, folded in 1952 and Peter moved to the research station of the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation (later the Cotton Research Corporation) at Namulonge, Uganda, until 1963. Returning to Tanzania, Peter worked on fertiliser use for tropical soils at Ukiriguru. In 1965 he had the honour of escorting President Julius Nyerere, for whom he had great respect, around the research plots. Born in Eccleston, St Helens, Lancashire, Peter, and his brother, Proctor, grew up in a Quaker family.

According to the South Florida water management agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sfwmd.gov/our-work/cerp-project-planning/eaa-reservoir\">website</a>, the 240,000 acre-feet reservoir is necessary to ease the pressure on Lake Okeechobee and reduce harmful lake discharges to estuaries to the east and west.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/17/everglades-climate-change-threatens-work-to-reverse-manmade-damage\">Everglades: climate change threatens years of work to reverse manmade damage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the board caused outrage in November when it approved a hasty motion to award Florida Crystals an eight-year extension to its existing lease on a 16,500-acre parcel within the land upon which the reservoir is set to be built. Eikenberg said the vote was illegal under Florida law because public notice was not given until 9pm the night before.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a big double cross,\u201d he said. \u201cFor weeks Scott\u2019s water management district was talking about a need to be aggressive and demonstrate a sense of urgency, then two days after DeSantis was elected they pulled the rug from millions of Floridians who want to see this reservoir built. And they did it to the benefit of big sugar.</p> <p>\u201cWhat DeSantis has said is he wants a new start and an agency that\u2019s going to be focused on natural resources, the Everglades and cleaning up the algae, not an agency working for the special interests of the sugar industry.\u201d</p> <p>The agency sees things differently. A spokesman referred the Guardian to an 8 November <a href=\"https://www.sfwmd.gov/news/nr_2018_1108_eaa_storage_reservoir\">press release</a> in which the governing board chair, Federico Fernandez, claimed work on the project was already under way and that the granting of the lease was required under state law to prevent agricultural land lying fallow until it was needed.</p> <p>Of the nine board members, one resigned in January for unrelated reasons and two, Dan O\u2019Keefe and Carlos Diaz, agreed to DeSantis\u2019s request to stand down.

      "bodyText": "Barely a week after positioning himself as the new champion of Florida\u2019s polluted waterways and beaches, the new Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, is facing an early test of the environmental credentials that have put him at odds with his predecessor, Rick Scott. DeSantis has called for the mass resignation of Scott\u2019s hand-picked team of water policy managers, after they defied his request to delay awarding an eight-year land lease extension to the sugar industry giant Florida Crystals in the fragile Everglades wetlands. The land, south of Lake Okeechobee, is earmarked for a $1.6bn clean-water storage reservoir that DeSantis wants completed within four years, to hasten restoration of the state\u2019s famous River of Grass. But several of the directors of the South Florida water management district, which is responsible for water quality from Orlando to the Florida Keys, are continuing to refuse his demand that they step down, setting the stage for DeSantis to forcibly remove them from office over a snap November land lease vote that environmental groups criticised as \u201cillegal, shameful and undemocratic\u201d. The fight with Scott\u2019s panel of industry-friendly representatives highlights DeSantis\u2019s desire to seize control of Florida\u2019s water policy in the wake of the red tide epidemic of toxic algae that swamped the state, wrecked tourism and killed tens of thousands of marine animals last year. While red tide is a naturally occurring bacterial phenomenon, environmentalists say the outbreak was made far worse by fertilisers and other poisonous agricultural run-off from farming and sugar industries. \u201cOur water and natural resources are the foundation of our economy and our way of life in Florida,\u201d DeSantis said in announcing a $2.5bn package of environmental improvements. \u201cThe protection of water resources is one of the most pressing issues facing the state.\u201d He also said red tide had \u201cdevastated our local economies and threatened the health of our communities\u201d. The spat also highlights substantial policy differences with Scott that have led to DeSantis being cast as \u201cthe green governor\u201d by some. Scott, elected as a US senator in November after two terms in Tallahassee, has a long record of campaign contributions from the sugar industry and was accused by environmental groups of favouring industry over ecology in numerous policy decisions. DeSantis refused money from so-called big sugar and promised to reduce the industry\u2019s influence on Florida politics and the amount of pollutants it pumps into waterways in the the form of agricultural run-off contaminated by phosphorus and nitrogen. DeSantis was the surprise winner of last summer\u2019s primary against the agricultural commissioner, Adam Putnam, who received more than $8m, either directly or indirectly, from sugar industry donations. His early break with Scott\u2019s pro-business stance came just days after he declared at his inauguration that the environment would be his top priority and unveiled the $2.5bn package designed to help clean up the Everglades, tackle rising seas and block offshore drilling. The DeSantis agenda also creates a taskforce to look into solutions for red tide and blue-green algae, another naturally occurring phenomenon that has clogged inland rivers and canals. And notably for a candidate who won a close race for the governor\u2019s mansion after aligning himself closely with Donald Trump, the US president who claims climate change is a hoax, DeSantis is creating an office of environmental accountability and transparency, to be led by a \u201cchief science officer\u201d. DeSantis said during the campaign he \u201cwasn\u2019t a climate change denier\u201d and neither did he want to be labelled a believer, but the appointment would place a scientist at the head of state environmental policy for the first time. To advocates weary of what they saw as Scott\u2019s \u201celection-year environmentalism\u201d, DeSantis offers a welcome change of direction. \u201cTo come out less than 48 hours after taking office with a bold executive order full of about a dozen items, I\u2019d say he is as serious as a heart attack,\u201d said Eric Eikenberg, the chief executive of the Everglades Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s a new day to have a Republican governor, or any governor, saying he specifically wants a chief science officer, and an office of resiliency is a clear indication this governor wants to tackle the difficult issues.\u201d Eikenberg also stressed the importance of the storage reservoir at the centre of DeSantis\u2019s tussle with the outgoing administration, a $1.6bn project designed by the US army corps of engineers and jointly funded by the state and Congress. In October, Trump signed the America\u2019s Water Infrastructure Act that funded the reservoir as well as the restoration of wetlands damaged by hurricanes in several states and Puerto Rico. According to the South Florida water management agency\u2019s website, the 240,000 acre-feet reservoir is necessary to ease the pressure on Lake Okeechobee and reduce harmful lake discharges to estuaries to the east and west. But the board caused outrage in November when it approved a hasty motion to award Florida Crystals an eight-year extension to its existing lease on a 16,500-acre parcel within the land upon which the reservoir is set to be built. Eikenberg said the vote was illegal under Florida law because public notice was not given until 9pm the night before. \u201cIt was a big double cross,\u201d he said. \u201cFor weeks Scott\u2019s water management district was talking about a need to be aggressive and demonstrate a sense of urgency, then two days after DeSantis was elected they pulled the rug from millions of Floridians who want to see this reservoir built. And they did it to the benefit of big sugar. \u201cWhat DeSantis has said is he wants a new start and an agency that\u2019s going to be focused on natural resources, the Everglades and cleaning up the algae, not an agency working for the special interests of the sugar industry.\u201d The agency sees things differently. A spokesman referred the Guardian to an 8 November press release in which the governing board chair, Federico Fernandez, claimed work on the project was already under way and that the granting of the lease was required under state law to prevent agricultural land lying fallow until it was needed. Of the nine board members, one resigned in January for unrelated reasons and two, Dan O\u2019Keefe and Carlos Diaz, agreed to DeSantis\u2019s request to stand down. But four others refused to resign, according to Treasure Coast newspapers, including three whose terms expire in March. \u201cThe arrogance displayed over the past 24 hours by the board is indicative of how they have operated for the better part of a decade \u2013 without transparency and with disdain,\u201d said Brian Mast, a US congressman and a DeSantis ally and environmental policy adviser, in a statement. \u201cThey have failed to exercise even the most basic, legally required level of transparency and therefore should be removed for cause.\u201d Florida Crystals, whose subsidiary the New Hope Sugar company was the lease beneficiary, did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "bodyText": "House prices in Sydney have recorded their sharpest downturn in more than two decades, falling by 10% in the past 12 months. The latest report from Domain Group for the fourth quarter of 2018 has revealed Australia\u2019s housing market has continued to slow, with national prices recording the steepest annual fall in 15 years while Sydney house prices are back to mid-2016 levels. One leading economist signalled there was even worse to come for Sydney and Melbourne. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP, revised his forecast for prices in the big two cities and now thinks they could fall 25%, citing the plunging auction clearance rate and accelerated price falls late last year. But while the continued downward trend in the harbour city\u2019s overheated housing market will give hope to first-home buyers, the median house price in Sydney remains above the $1m mark first set in 2015. Prices in Sydney have now fallen by 11.4% since their peak in mid-2017. It\u2019s only the second time since Domain began keeping records in 1993 that prices in the city have fallen for four consecutive quarters. \u201cThe depth of Sydney\u2019s current house price downturn is the sharpest in more than two decades, although the duration is yet to surpass the 2004-06 slump,\u201d Domain\u2019s senior research analyst Nicola Powell said. However Powell said the downturn was not unexpected. The almost six years of price growth, coupled with changes to macroprudential lending policies that tightened lending restrictions, meant the market was less crowded by investors. \u201cAffordability is improving in the harbour city,\u201d Powell said. \u201cFirst-home buyers have fewer investors to compete against, greater choice and a wider window to make their purchase. This also provides opportunity for the upsize buyer. \u201cIt may mean selling at a lower price point compared to the boom, but if buying and selling under the same market conditions, it is likely to be offset by a more affordable upsize purchase.\u201d Nationally, house prices fell by 1.8% over the quarter and 6.5% over the year to $766,438. Only two cities \u2013 Hobart and Adelaide \u2013 saw increases, while prices in Melbourne fell by 8.4% over the year to $833,321. Powell said while lending restrictions had hit Melbourne and Sydney the hardest, Melbourne was in \u201cbetter shape\u201d thanks to a \u201cgrowing employment sector, lower affordability hurdles and stronger population growth supporting the underlying demand for housing\u201d. While Adelaide saw 1.7% growth over the last year, Hobart continued to buck the national trend by recording an 8.8% rise over the last 12 months. Powell said while the city remained the most affordable capital in Australia, if it continued to grow it could soon outstrip Adelaide and Darwin. \u201cHouse prices have had a record period of growth, rising for 11 consecutive quarters,\u201d she said. \u201cPopulation-fuelled demand has outstripped supply, resulting in two years of double-digit growth. \u201cHobart continues to be the standout performer for capital gains, bucking the national downward trend. However, even though the city continues to record growth, the pace has slowed from the peak rate of growth recorded at the end of 2017 and early in 2018.\u201d The latest falls in the national market follow a steady decline since the end of 2017, which saw the Deutsche Bank last year identify a potential Australian housing crash as one of the top 30 risks to the global economy.",

      "bodyText": "Australia must roll out an emergency national response to an invasive plant disease that is rapidly pushing at least four plant species to imminent extinction, experts have told Guardian Australia. A draft emergency action plan for the fungal disease myrtle rust proposes that a rapid collection of seeds and plant material needs to be mobilised before several species disappear altogether. Botanist Bob Makinson, vice-president of the Australian Network for Plant Conservation, has coordinated the action plan with input from about 90 experts around the country. He says the pathogen could result in at least four species becoming extinct within five years \u2013 Lenwebbia sp. \u2018Blackall Range\u2019 , Lenwebbia sp. \u2018Main Range\u2019 and Rhodamnia rubescens (scrub stringybark, brush turpentine, or brown mallet wood), Rhodomyrtus psidioides (native guava) \u2013 with others to follow. \u201cThis is extremely urgent. We are almost eight years down the track and we now have species faced with imminent extinction and a problem that\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d Myrtle rust, first found at a New South Wales nursery in 2010, attacks trees in the myrtaceae family. In Australia, that includes 2,253 species, including iconic trees such as paperbarks and bottle brush. Many exist only in Australia. About 358 Australian species are already known hosts of myrtle rust, and that number is likely to rise. Makinson says myrtle rust is now \u201cfully naturalised\u201d from Moruya, 300km south of Sydney, to Cape York, and west to the Great Dividing Range. The disease has also appeared in the north of the Northern Territory and has been found in gardens and nurseries in Victoria and Tasmania. Andrew Cox, chief executive of the Invasive Species Council, says: \u201cWe absolutely need this plan. We could lose an entire series of myrtle plants and we don\u2019t know what could happen then. \u201cThese are complex ecological systems and this could wreak havoc across the Australian plant world. This call cannot be ignored any longer. We could and we should have acted years ago.\u201d Dr Rod Fensham, of the University of Queensland, is leading a small research effort through the National Environmental Science Program to work out just which myrtaceae are most at risk and what options there might be. \u201cIf you can\u2019t grow, then you die \u2013 and with myrtle rust it\u2019s a pretty slow death. Some of these species will just drop of their perch and nobody will notice. \u201cIt\u2019s looking pretty grim so far,\u201d he says, adding about a dozen are heading for extinction. \u201cThat extinction is the end point of millions of years of evolution so, to me, that\u2019s pretty profound.\u201d Most of those imperilled dozen are absent from state and federal lists of threatened species \u2013 such is the relative speed of myrtle rust\u2019s march. Myrtacea are an \u201cenormously important\u201d family of trees, says Fensham, providing fruit and habitat for native species and, in the wet tropics, stabilising riverbanks. Some have adapted to quickly colonise gaps in forests caused by events such as cyclones. Once gone, this role, says Fensham, will be filled by another invasive, lantana. \u201cThat\u2019s causing enough problems already,\u201d he says. With no nationally coordinated monitoring program, Bob Makinson says there is still much uncertainty about the true breadth of the pathogen\u2019s impact. \u201cWe have had seven years of encroachment of this disease and the decline of these species with no co-ordination at a national level. \u201cThis is a difficult disease because it is spread by airborne spores. There\u2019s no magic bullet for it, but there are meaningful actions that could be taken.\u201d One of the worst affected ecosystems, says Makinson, could be the wetlands in the east and north of Australia where broad-leaved paperbark trees that are susceptible to the disease dominate the ecosystem. \u201cThe potential for knock-on impacts in those areas is enormous,\u201d says Makinson. Priorities for action include a \u201crapid field assessment\u201d of 45 species, capturing seed and plant material for the most at-risk species, researching resistant plants and preventing the arrival of other strains of the disease. \u201cOf particular concern is that there are two other strains of the same pathogen \u2013 known as eucalyptus rust \u2013 and if they were to get to Australia, we could be in very serious trouble,\u201d says Makinson. The southwest of Western Australia, which is home to more than 1,000 species in the myrtle family, is currently free of the disease, but modelling suggests that area\u2019s climate could suit myrtle rust. Preventing the spread there is another priority. Makinson says New Zealand\u2019s national response to the 2017 arrival of myrtle rust is \u201ca lesson for Australia\u201d. \u201cNew Zealand has a national approach with a wide range of community stakeholders including Indigenous stakeholders. New Zealand only has about 30 species of native myrtaceae, but they have invested $13m to deal with the problem. \u201cAustralia, by contrast, has no coordinated response and has invested only about $4.2m and has done very little on the environmental aspects of this.\u201d He says Australia\u2019s response to myrtle rust could aid the country\u2019s ability to respond to future invasive pathogens.

Born in Surbiton, south-west London, John was brought up on Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean, and then in Tanzania, where his father, Bill Lanchbery, a mechanical engineer, ran a power station. His mother, Betty (nee Ball), was a furnishings designer. John returned to Britain to take his A-levels at Dulwich college, in south London. John\u2019s early career was at ERA Technology in the development of innovative thin film and microelectronics technologies for a variety of applications. Meanwhile he studied part-time for a degree in mathematics at the Open University and then a master\u2019s in solid state physics at the City of London Polytechnic (now London Metropolitan University). A year teaching at the Open University followed and in 1991 he started at Vertic, the NGO that supports the implementation of international agreements, working on climate change monitoring, which led to his engagement in the climate negotiations and ultimately working for the RSPB. John operated through calm consideration, in both his scientific and personal lives. He was a rock for colleagues and a friend and mentor to many. He would always find time to explain the intricacies of the climate negotiations, enlivening the driest of topics with amusing anecdotes \u2013 especially over a glass of wine. John is survived by his partner of 28 years, Nicola Jenkins, his son, Christopher, and daughter, Alexandra, from a marriage that ended in divorce; and by a granddaughter, Pippa.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>A VICTORIAN VICTORY FOR THE AGES</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s one of the banner occasions in the football calendar: the semi-finals of England\u2019s secondary knockout competition, Tin Pot! There have been some memorable ties down the years. The Fiver recalls Chelsea beating Wycombe Wanderers 4-0. One time, West Brom saw off Carlisle 4-1. And there was that season Manchester City battered West Ham 9-0 on aggregate. But anyway, those memorable ties we were talking about. Well, we vaguely remember fourth-tier Bradford City humiliating five-time winners Aston Villa. The Arsenal-Tottenham stramash in 1987 was fairly epic. And \u2026 erm \u2026 actually, sod it, that\u2019ll do. QED!</p> <p>Sadly, looking at the state of this year\u2019s second legs, it doesn\u2019t look as though either of the ties will end up in the pantheon alongside Bradford-Villa, Arsenal-Spurs and that time treble-chasing Liverpool scored 78 own goals against QPR. You see, Thursday night\u2019s match is to be contested between a knackered Tottenham squad stretched beyond breaking point and with hamstrings to match, and a bunch of lads from Chelsea who even their own manager freely admits can\u2019t be bothered. We\u2019ll be looking forward to that one, then (and you can thank us for tempting fate when it ends 6-6). As for Wednesday\u2019s return between Burton Albion and Manchester City, well for goodness\u2019 sake.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/23/burton-rallies-round-nigel-clough-manchester-city-carabao-cup-semi-final\">Burton rallies around Clough\u2019s men as City arrive with 9-0 head start</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Burton are, of course, a mere nine goals adrift after the first leg at the Etihad degenerated into dismal farce.

On Boxing Day 1894, City travelled to Burton Wanderers in the old Second Division and went down 8-0, still a club-record defeat. Three months later, City beat Lincoln 11-3, setting their league record for most goals scored and developing a habit for glorious unpredictability from the get-go.</p> <p>Anyway, Burton Wanderers merged with Burton Swifts to become Burton United, Burton United merged with Burton All Saints to become Burton Town, and Burton Town were folded into a new entity called Burton Albion after the war. And here we are now! Hey, so you don\u2019t think the modern Burton could draw on the precedent set by their illustrious predecessors and make this a contest, do you?

It seems strange, then, that a medical establishment would impose this break on those taking the pill, given that there is no health benefit.</p> <p>To understand where the seven-day break really came from, we need to know a bit about how this <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jhmas/article/57/2/117/740421\" title=\"\">society-changing</a> drug works: the combined hormones in the pill prevent ovulation by tricking the body into thinking it is pregnant. Perhaps unexpectedly, early trials of combined hormonal contraception started out among patients trying to conceive. A gynaecologist with a hunch suspected that patients with unexplained infertility might fall pregnant more easily once the body had experienced pregnancy. Therefore patients with infertility were given a combination of hormones for a few months. After they stopped taking the hormones a number <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462239/\" title=\"\">later became pregnant</a>.</p> <p>However, there was a problem \u2013 the early forms of the pill had significantly higher doses than today\u2019s versions. This meant that women in this trial had <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-team-that-invented-the-birth-control-pill/380684/\" title=\"\">early pregnancy symptoms</a>, including morning sickness. This gave many distressing false hope. First they believed they were pregnant when taking hormones, and then discovered they weren\u2019t when they stopped. So it was suggested that allowing the women on these early pills to take a monthly break could assure them they were not pregnant. Thus, the seven-day break was born \u2013 not, as Professor Guillebaud claims, because of any need to persuade the pope.</p> <p>As it happens, the co-creators of the pill did try <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/664981\" title=\"\">to convince the Catholic church</a> to permit this new contraceptive, but they based their arguments on an appeal to nature. They reasoned that the pill makes use of hormones that the body itself produces \u2013 the ingredients and the way they prevent pregnancy is arguably as natural as the rhythm method, which the Catholic church already allowed.</p> <p>We might be tempted to ask whether it matters if the hormone-free break was to appease the pontiff or to reassure early adopters of the pill. But by blaming the pope for 60 years of suboptimal contraception use, as Guillebaud suggested, we fail to ask the more important question: why did the seven-day break become such a mainstay of reproductive health for 60 years?</p> <p>The answer, I believe, is far more complicated than the intervention of Catholic doctrine, and requires some real work to fix. <a href=\"https://www.fpa.org.uk/factsheets/contraception-patterns-use#Nd61\" title=\"\">Two-thirds of women aged 20-24</a> take the combined contraceptive pill \u2013 that\u2019s a huge proportion of a large part of our population.

Activists also lodged complaints with RT\u00c9 and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, saying Linehan was unqualified to comment on trans issues. A picket organiser, Noah Halpin, told the gathering that RT\u00c9 should have omitted Linehan and included more than two trans people in the panel of 10 contributors. \u201cNo one is more expert in trans lives than trans people. This conversation must include trans people, and those with educated experience in subjects relating to trans identities. This is who Prime Time should be featuring to ensure complete accuracy,\u201d he said. Linehan has more than 650,000 followers on Twitter and has used the platform to critique what he calls a \u201ctrans ideology\u201d that bullies and misrepresents trans people and lesbians. A trailer for the programme included a clip from a pre-recorded interview with Linehan in which he said: \u201cYou do not tell kids that they have been born into the wrong body, just as you don\u2019t tell [people with anorexia] that they are fat.\u201d Speaking to the Irish Independent before the broadcast, Linehan said his views on transgender issues were based on difficulties faced by his transgender and lesbian friends because of trans activism. Last year West Yorkshire police gave the writer a verbal warning after a transgender activist complained Linehan referred to her as \u201che\u201d and called her by names used before she transitioned to a woman. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 May 2019 to clarify the manner of the police communication with Linehan.",

      "bodyText": "Labour looks set to whip its MPs to back Yvette Cooper\u2019s amendment, paving the way for legislation that would mandate ministers to extend article 50 if a no-deal Brexit looked imminent. The amendment, tabled by Cooper to a motion laid by the government after the defeat of its Brexit deal, would give parliamentary time for the private member\u2019s bill to be debated, which it otherwise would not get. Cooper and her fellow Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who has put down a separate amendment on extending article 50, met Jeremy Corbyn for talks about the party\u2019s strategy on Wednesday. It is understood the party leadership would prefer the legislation to contain a shorter extension than the nine months specified in Cooper\u2019s bill, which would mean going beyond the European elections. Cooper, who has devised the plan with former Tory ministers Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin, has previously said the nine-month extension is a starting point and they would expect MPs to amend their bill to find a sensible consensus about how long the extension should be. Labour has also been cautious about the potential constitutional implications of allowing MPs to dictate time for a bill but party sources have indicated they are likely to back the amendment as a way of closing down the prospect of no deal. The motion, and any amendments selected by the Speaker, will be voted on next Tuesday. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, signalled Labour could back the plan in an interview with BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight. \u201cYvette Cooper has put an amendment down, which I think is sensible ... so I think it\u2019s increasingly likely already that we\u2019ll have to take that option because the government has run the clock down,\u201d he said. McDonnell said the party would need to go through its own process to make a final decision. \u201cIt\u2019s highly likely but we\u2019ll go through our normal process of consultation with our members,\u201d he said.

It\u2019s amazing how this sketch has stood the test of time, even though the millennial generation is supposed to be an entirely different kettle of fish. Aren\u2019t we all just winging our way through careers and life? Especially \u2013 it seems more and more obvious \u2013 the business class. This bit was made two decades ago, and yet here we are, with fresh-out-of-uni graduates spouting big words leading to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">sub-prime mortgage crises</a>.</p> <h2>Hair</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84qUAWT8jVk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/84qUAWT8jVk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One area where Smack the Pony excelled, for obvious reasons, was humour specifically aimed at \u2013 or at least particularly understood by \u2013 women. As Ian Hislop once said of the show: \u201c\u201cI was aware that these sketches would not have been produced by men\u201d.</p> <p>Hair was a running theme because, as we know, hair is a feminist issue. Women\u2019s hair, wherever anatomically it may be, is apparently always up for public scrutiny and comment. But the flip-side is the genuine conversations and insecurities women share among themselves. Here, Mackichan shows her incredible bush or, as she puts it, \u201ca few little wisps\u201d. Then there\u2019s the bit on full-body waxing to remove \u201can Airedale up my bum crack\u201d.</p> <h2>Leaves</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L627u4T3zFE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L627u4T3zFE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Smack the Pony always did random absurdism just as well as its skewering of social mores. A great example of this was Leaves, in which Allen is pursued down a street by a seemingly dangerous leaf while ominous horror movie music plays over stylised blue-hued camerawork. It was the kind of \u201clunatic silliness\u201d (to quote Hislop again) that the Smack the Pony stars could really make work, such was their comic chops.

      "bodyText": "In news that will have comedy fans feeling that perhaps 2019 will not be a totally grim year \u2013 as the world seemingly falls apart at the seams \u2013 the cast of the much loved sketch show, Smack the Pony, has told the Guardian it is working on new material. When the show first aired on Channel 4, it was a female produced-and-fronted vehicle in a very male-dominated medium. (Unfortunately, still an issue not overcome 20 years down the line.) There were female comics \u2013 Victoria Wood, French and Saunders \u2013 but it was the explosion of the Spice Girls and their brand of girl power that apparently gave then-Channel 4 comedy commissioner, Caroline Leddy, the impetus to pilot a brand new female sketch show. Producer Vicky Pile \u2013 who followed up Smack the Pony\u2019s success with the likes of Green Wing \u2013 once explained the genesis of the show thus: \u201cWe set out to show that women could be sexy and self-deprecating and stupid \u2026 and still be funny and appealing.\u201d It made stars of its leads: Fiona Allen; Doon Mackichan; Sally Phillips and Sarah Alexander, who had before appeared in smaller roles in shows such as The Day Today or I\u2019m Alan Partridge. To celebrate this hopeful news, here\u2019s a look at some of the best Smack the Pony sketches, and incredibly, how they don\u2019t seem to have aged at all. Young professionals Phillips and Alexander\u2019s characters are in the back of a black cab, both wearing suit jackets and exaggerated power shirts \u2013 with Harry Hill-type collars \u2013 talking awful corporate speak, before looking at each other and screaming with laughter at the idea they have \u201ca pretty good understanding of the marketplace\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re 27!\u201d guffaws Phillips. The denouement provides the biggest laugh as Phillips wrestles for quite a time with the FT. \u201cI can\u2019t even hold a big newspaper!\u201d she cackles. It\u2019s amazing how this sketch has stood the test of time, even though the millennial generation is supposed to be an entirely different kettle of fish. Aren\u2019t we all just winging our way through careers and life? Especially \u2013 it seems more and more obvious \u2013 the business class. This bit was made two decades ago, and yet here we are, with fresh-out-of-uni graduates spouting big words leading to sub-prime mortgage crises. Hair One area where Smack the Pony excelled, for obvious reasons, was humour specifically aimed at \u2013 or at least particularly understood by \u2013 women. As Ian Hislop once said of the show: \u201c\u201cI was aware that these sketches would not have been produced by men\u201d. Hair was a running theme because, as we know, hair is a feminist issue. Women\u2019s hair, wherever anatomically it may be, is apparently always up for public scrutiny and comment. But the flip-side is the genuine conversations and insecurities women share among themselves. Here, Mackichan shows her incredible bush or, as she puts it, \u201ca few little wisps\u201d. Then there\u2019s the bit on full-body waxing to remove \u201can Airedale up my bum crack\u201d. Leaves Smack the Pony always did random absurdism just as well as its skewering of social mores. A great example of this was Leaves, in which Allen is pursued down a street by a seemingly dangerous leaf while ominous horror movie music plays over stylised blue-hued camerawork. It was the kind of \u201clunatic silliness\u201d (to quote Hislop again) that the Smack the Pony stars could really make work, such was their comic chops. Smack the Pony gave the actors the freedom to \u201cjust let women be clowns\u201d, as Mackichan has put it. The pole A series three gem in which Mackichan\u2019s character, laden with shopping bags and dressed sensibly in trench coat and trousers, breaks out of quotidian monotony by pole-dancing around a streetlamp. I haven\u2019t worked up the courage to do this yet, but there\u2019s still time. The kiss This scene of Phillips and Mackichan as two soap actors sharing a lesbian kiss has the triple recommendations of: being very funny indeed; subtle commentary on attitudes to sexuality; and also, at the start of the millennium, still a relatively rare example of same-sex snogging on the box. Phillips\u2019 actor is clearly enamoured with her co-star, whose attitude to the on-screen kiss could not be more unaccepting. \u201cDisgusting,\u201d she says, as an offscreen director yells cut. \u201cCall my fiancee, tell him I love him\u201d. Phillips, with a cheeky grin, makes them go again, \u201cmaybe with tongues?\u201d It\u2019s a smart rendering of the casual homophobia that exists in Mackichan\u2019s character, but also, in Phillips\u2019 performance \u2013 as any LGBT person either in the closet or coming to terms with their sexuality will recognise \u2013 the escape of feelings often not fully expressed. Goodbye In a genius combination of physical comedy and beautifully observed social humour, Goodbye is one of the most memorable sketches \u2013 and it works on many levels. Even before the final curveball, the mocking of middle-class dinner parties (\u201cWhat an amazing thing to do with a trout!\u201d) and what Bridget Jones would call \u201csmug marrieds\u201d is belly-laugh perfect. The perfect man There could be no roundup of the best Smack the Pony moments without including one of the fan-favourite video dating scenes. Smack the Pony was way ahead of its time in mocking the burgeoning tech hook-up trends, which have now exploded to become as everyday as air. One of the best examples was Phillips\u2019 take on people\u2019s ridiculously high expectations \u2013 no, nigh impossible expectations \u2013 of potential paramours. If this character existed in 2019 (and hopefully will again soon), she would be swiping left on every Tinder profile. \u201cI want a man who has a really high-powered job, maybe in the City. But he shouldn\u2019t be motivated by money at all.\u201d \u201cHe should be really spontaneous when it comes to presents. But it should be mainly be stuff that I wanted already.\u201d \u201cHe should have quite a large penis \u2013 but he shouldn\u2019t feel that he has to use all of it, all of the time.\u201d The sketch is as fresh and relatable now as it was then, and given the pace of change in the intervening 20 years, that is quite something.

      "body": "<p>Aspirin has long been believed to help prevent heart attacks and strokes, and some studies have shown it to have a protective effect against some cancers. As a result, some people religiously pop a low-dose aspirin after breakfast every day (never take one on an empty stomach). But now its status as a wonder drug has dipped somewhat, following a major review of the trial evidence.</p> <p>The Journal of the American Medical Association <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2721178\" title=\"\">has just published</a> a meta-analysis (a review of the results of a large number of trials, which can therefore come to more certain conclusions) of the association of aspirin use with cardiovascular and bleeding events. It found that the well-known risk that aspirin can cause internal bleeding is as great \u2013 or sometimes higher \u2013 than the benefits of preventing heart attacks and strokes.</p> <p>Aspirin thins the blood, helping to prevent blood clots, and is unquestionably a really good drug for protecting people who have already had a heart attack or stroke from having another. However, the 164,225 people in these trials had no history of cardiovascular disease. They were monitored for an average of six years, during which time they took a daily aspirin or placebo. Among those who took aspirin, there were about 11% fewer heart attacks and strokes but a 43% higher likelihood of a major bleeding episode in the stomach, brain or intestine. (The researchers found no effect on cancer.)</p> <p>Dr Sean Zheng, academic clinical fellow in cardiology at King\u2019s College London, said that taking a daily aspirin couldn\u2019t be recommended for healthy people, but that there might still be a case for people with a higher risk of a heart attack or stroke, including those with type 2 diabetes. However, it would be important to consider the bleeding risk.</p> <p>\u201cAspirin use requires discussion between the patient and their physician, with the knowledge that any small potential cardiovascular benefits are weighed up against the real risk of severe bleeding,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The findings reflect the average likelihood of bleeds or heart attacks among the patients in all the trials.

      "bodyText": "Aspirin has long been believed to help prevent heart attacks and strokes, and some studies have shown it to have a protective effect against some cancers. As a result, some people religiously pop a low-dose aspirin after breakfast every day (never take one on an empty stomach). But now its status as a wonder drug has dipped somewhat, following a major review of the trial evidence. The Journal of the American Medical Association has just published a meta-analysis (a review of the results of a large number of trials, which can therefore come to more certain conclusions) of the association of aspirin use with cardiovascular and bleeding events. It found that the well-known risk that aspirin can cause internal bleeding is as great \u2013 or sometimes higher \u2013 than the benefits of preventing heart attacks and strokes. Aspirin thins the blood, helping to prevent blood clots, and is unquestionably a really good drug for protecting people who have already had a heart attack or stroke from having another. However, the 164,225 people in these trials had no history of cardiovascular disease. They were monitored for an average of six years, during which time they took a daily aspirin or placebo. Among those who took aspirin, there were about 11% fewer heart attacks and strokes but a 43% higher likelihood of a major bleeding episode in the stomach, brain or intestine. (The researchers found no effect on cancer.) Dr Sean Zheng, academic clinical fellow in cardiology at King\u2019s College London, said that taking a daily aspirin couldn\u2019t be recommended for healthy people, but that there might still be a case for people with a higher risk of a heart attack or stroke, including those with type 2 diabetes. However, it would be important to consider the bleeding risk. \u201cAspirin use requires discussion between the patient and their physician, with the knowledge that any small potential cardiovascular benefits are weighed up against the real risk of severe bleeding,\u201d he said. The findings reflect the average likelihood of bleeds or heart attacks among the patients in all the trials. There will be people among them who would be better off taking aspirin and those who will be worse. We\u2019re not all the same. It\u2019s yet another situation where we need to weigh up our individual risk and benefit \u2013 maybe with the help of an understanding GP. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 January 2019.

Media outlets have been <a href=\"https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/dont-doubt-what-you-saw-with-your-own-eyes-1831931203\">effectively gaslighted</a>, and many <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/julie-irwin-zimmerman-i-failed-covington-catholic-test/580897/\">climbed down</a> from coverage which was based on the most clear and obvious interpretation of the boys chanting, making gestures and making tomahawk chops. <br><br>What it tells us is that in 2019, conservatives understand they can construct a parallel reality and have it accepted. They can act in bad faith and prevail, using tried and tested tactics that liberal media continue to fall for. Those are:</p> \n<h2>1. Reframe the debate as soon as possible</h2> \n<p>One thing that rightwing media understands much better than their liberal counterparts is that the ubiquity of recording devices at any current protest tends to shatter the public record into dozens of pieces.<br><br>A particular version of events based on early footage can always be called into question, and another version put forward as definitive, as more footage, and alternative edits of footage emerge. Partisans can pick and choose, knowing that a definitive version of what happened may not emerge before the news cycle has moved on.<br><br>Just as importantly, additional footage allows the discussion to be reframed. Instead of asking why a group of schoolboys were protesting wearing hats that many in the community view as a symbol of racism, conservatives <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2019/01/20/critics-covington-maga-critics-push-back-against-portrayal-of-catholic-high-school-as-racist-to-native-american/\">quickly turned it</a> into a game of who approached whom, and began discussing the teenagers as if they were <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-covington-catholic-bonfire-at-the-stake/\">literal martyrs</a>.<br><br>The most influential <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/01/20/covington-catholic-nathan-phillips-video\">revisionist account</a> of the confrontation to emerge was written by Reason\u2019s Robbie Soave. In a commentary on the two-hour version of the original video (which readers were unlikely to watch in full), where Soave reframed the discussion to include the actions of a group unrelated either to the students or to Native protesters, and claimed that there had been no wrongdoing on the part of the students. <a href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/01/22/the-covington-fiasco-is-a-perfect-example-of-why-the-founders-distrusted-democracy/\">Conservatives</a> <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2019/01/21/adults-involved-failed-covington-catholic-school-boys-ashamed/\">picked</a> this ball up and <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2019/01/22/media-now-accusing-covington-catholic-kids-black-face-sad-desperate-attempt-keep-narrative-alive/\">ran</a> with it as far as they could.</p> \n<h2>2. Pick your narratives</h2> \n<p>So far, conservative media has been unified and resolute in hammering the narrative that Nathan Philips, a Native American veteran, somehow provoked the boys by coming between them and a small group of Black Hebrew Israelites, to whose insults they had responded with chants.<br><br>No amount of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roflinds/status/1087486166939680768\">additional footage</a> showing their Maga-yelling <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cbouzy/status/1087403613754978305\">rowdy behavior</a> and sexist comments before the event \u2013 not even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe1FbEiLECU\">clear and concise edits</a> showing how aggressive and provocative the teens were and how calm Phillips was \u2013 is capable of knocking them off this course.<br><br>If you want a lesson in how this kind of persistence works, look at the coverage from <a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/\">Gateway Pundit</a> since Saturday. Very early on, Jim Hoft recognized the symbolic value of the confrontation, doggedly pushed his own, partial interpretation of events, <a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/01/it-gets-worse-far-left-activist-nathan-phillips-told-reporters-he-served-in-vietnam-in-1976-us-withdrew-in-1973/\">smeared everyone</a> on the other side, and then brought the entirety of conservative media with him. (Earlier, even some <a href=\"https://twitchy.com/brettt-3136/2019/01/19/appalling-catholic-school-students-harass-native-american-veteran-on-lincoln-memorial-steps/\">conservative outlets</a> had been critical of the boys). His reward was seeing that version of events <a href=\"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2019/01/21/naming-names-tucker-slams-media-folks-who-attacked-catholic\">trumpeted</a> by Tucker Carlson on Monday night, who also launched a broadside at any conservatives who had wavered from exonerating the teens.</p> \n<p>That night, and Tuesday, Carlson\u2019s fellow Fox News hosts were singing from the same songsheet. And if Fox News presents a unified message, the president frequently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1087689415814795264\">echoes it</a>.</p> \n<h2>3. Focus on the extremes of the other side</h2> \n<p>Another tactic conservative media uses is to only consider the most appalling versions of opposing arguments, and to focus their audience\u2019s anger on reliable scapegoats.</p> \n<p>To avoid confronting reasonable arguments or new evidence, conservatives emphasize the worst of the other side \u2013 like tweets calling for <a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/01/hollywood-producer-calls-for-covington-catholic-kids-to-go-screaming-into-the-woodchipper/\">violence</a> or doxxing. Tweets calling for violence or doxxing against high school students are obviously and clearly unacceptable, but nor are they typical of the criticisms made of the boys, their school and their conduct.<strong> </strong>They also focus the audience on liberal <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/streiff/2019/01/20/buzzfeed-editor-says-brett-kavanaugh-lot-like-covington-catholic-high-school-kid/\">journalists</a> and <a href=\"https://twitchy.com/gregp-3534/2019/01/21/alyssa-milano-says-the-red-maga-hat-is-the-new-white-hood/\">celebrities</a> \u2013 mostly women \u2013 who their audience feel comfortable in deriding and dismissing.<br><br>As of Wednesday, as a result of these well-worn tactics, liberal media has almost completely backed away from their initial, justified take on the story. <br><br>When will we ever learn?</p>",

The relentlessly repeated talking point \u2013 that there was a collective \u201crush to judgment\u201d on the boys because they were Trump supporters \u2013 was used by conservative anchors Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham to attack mainstream media and left leaning social media users. On Wednesday morning, Sandmann got almost nine minutes of airtime on a national breakfast program to make his case, after his family hired a Republican-linked PR firm. In making this happen, conservative media have normalized the boys\u2019 aggressive form of political expression, and tried to further discredit both fact-oriented media and high-profile liberals. Media outlets have been effectively gaslighted, and many climbed down from coverage which was based on the most clear and obvious interpretation of the boys chanting, making gestures and making tomahawk chops. What it tells us is that in 2019, conservatives understand they can construct a parallel reality and have it accepted. They can act in bad faith and prevail, using tried and tested tactics that liberal media continue to fall for. Those are: 1. Reframe the debate as soon as possible One thing that rightwing media understands much better than their liberal counterparts is that the ubiquity of recording devices at any current protest tends to shatter the public record into dozens of pieces. A particular version of events based on early footage can always be called into question, and another version put forward as definitive, as more footage, and alternative edits of footage emerge. Partisans can pick and choose, knowing that a definitive version of what happened may not emerge before the news cycle has moved on. Just as importantly, additional footage allows the discussion to be reframed. Instead of asking why a group of schoolboys were protesting wearing hats that many in the community view as a symbol of racism, conservatives quickly turned it into a game of who approached whom, and began discussing the teenagers as if they were literal martyrs. The most influential revisionist account of the confrontation to emerge was written by Reason\u2019s Robbie Soave. In a commentary on the two-hour version of the original video (which readers were unlikely to watch in full), where Soave reframed the discussion to include the actions of a group unrelated either to the students or to Native protesters, and claimed that there had been no wrongdoing on the part of the students. Conservatives picked this ball up and ran with it as far as they could. 2. Pick your narratives So far, conservative media has been unified and resolute in hammering the narrative that Nathan Philips, a Native American veteran, somehow provoked the boys by coming between them and a small group of Black Hebrew Israelites, to whose insults they had responded with chants. No amount of additional footage showing their Maga-yelling rowdy behavior and sexist comments before the event \u2013 not even clear and concise edits showing how aggressive and provocative the teens were and how calm Phillips was \u2013 is capable of knocking them off this course. If you want a lesson in how this kind of persistence works, look at the coverage from Gateway Pundit since Saturday. Very early on, Jim Hoft recognized the symbolic value of the confrontation, doggedly pushed his own, partial interpretation of events, smeared everyone on the other side, and then brought the entirety of conservative media with him. (Earlier, even some conservative outlets had been critical of the boys). His reward was seeing that version of events trumpeted by Tucker Carlson on Monday night, who also launched a broadside at any conservatives who had wavered from exonerating the teens. That night, and Tuesday, Carlson\u2019s fellow Fox News hosts were singing from the same songsheet. And if Fox News presents a unified message, the president frequently echoes it. 3. Focus on the extremes of the other side Another tactic conservative media uses is to only consider the most appalling versions of opposing arguments, and to focus their audience\u2019s anger on reliable scapegoats. To avoid confronting reasonable arguments or new evidence, conservatives emphasize the worst of the other side \u2013 like tweets calling for violence or doxxing. Tweets calling for violence or doxxing against high school students are obviously and clearly unacceptable, but nor are they typical of the criticisms made of the boys, their school and their conduct. They also focus the audience on liberal journalists and celebrities \u2013 mostly women \u2013 who their audience feel comfortable in deriding and dismissing. As of Wednesday, as a result of these well-worn tactics, liberal media has almost completely backed away from their initial, justified take on the story. When will we ever learn?",

It excels in being a British station for anyone from any background.\u201d</p> <p>Sunrise, however, is resolutely sticking to its formula. \u201cI don\u2019t think Asian music would be absorbed into the mainstream, I don\u2019t think it can be,\u201d breakfast presenter Raj Ghai says. \u201cIt would be suicide to put it on Radio 1 since it would alienate English listeners.\u201d Lit is more measured, but agrees that \u201ca hybrid service playing both Asian and English music would not work now \u2013 people want something they know and trust.\u201d</p> <p>For Ghosh, there needs to be an amalgam: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a really specific cultural heritage but we\u2019re also part of a multicultural society.

It\u2019s multicultural and pluralistic.\u201d</p> <p>Multicultural Britain is one built by a generation of immigrants such as my grandma, tax-paying workers whose colonial passports made them as proud to be British as they were to stay rooted to their cultures. My grandma passed away suddenly, aged 89, while I wrote this article, after over 50 years living in England. This year, I\u2019ll be \u2013 for once \u2013 tuning in to her favourite station, not just for remembrance but to appreciate how something as simple as a song can bring back the memory of home.</p>",

It excels in being a British station for anyone from any background.\u201d Sunrise, however, is resolutely sticking to its formula. \u201cI don\u2019t think Asian music would be absorbed into the mainstream, I don\u2019t think it can be,\u201d breakfast presenter Raj Ghai says. \u201cIt would be suicide to put it on Radio 1 since it would alienate English listeners.\u201d Lit is more measured, but agrees that \u201ca hybrid service playing both Asian and English music would not work now \u2013 people want something they know and trust.\u201d For Ghosh, there needs to be an amalgam: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a really specific cultural heritage but we\u2019re also part of a multicultural society. We have to be separate and we have to be together.\u201d Sawhney, meanwhile, has the pithy maxim: \u201cWhere there is cross-fertilisation there is relevance, where there is ghettoisation, it is complete fucking bullshit.\u201d He continues that while Asian radio may pigeonhole talent, it is a necessary means to visibility: \u201cAsian radio makes sure people have a perception of Asians being part of an integrated society, so they don\u2019t start talking about Britain being a country of only white people. It\u2019s multicultural and pluralistic.\u201d Multicultural Britain is one built by a generation of immigrants such as my grandma, tax-paying workers whose colonial passports made them as proud to be British as they were to stay rooted to their cultures. My grandma passed away suddenly, aged 89, while I wrote this article, after over 50 years living in England. This year, I\u2019ll be \u2013 for once \u2013 tuning in to her favourite station, not just for remembrance but to appreciate how something as simple as a song can bring back the memory of home.",

      "body": "<p>By now, you\u2019ve surely seen the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FogNIr2x40\">video</a>.</p> <p>On the steps outside the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, a white teenager sporting the red cap accoutrements of the Trump campaign stands nose-to-nose with a bespectacled Native American elder singing and playing a hand drum. The teen is smirking \u2013 his expression, for me, oozes entitlement. Behind him an unruly crowd \u2013 all male, all white, many also wearing the conspicuous Maga apparel \u2013 is jeering the elder in a frenzy of Lord of the Flies privilege. (In another video, some of the boys can be seen cackling while war-whooping and making the <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/craig-melvin/watch/the-tomahawk-chop-and-other-reasons-why-the-incident-at-lincoln-memorial-is-offensive-1429428291889\">tomahawk chop gesture</a> popularized by sports teams with Native American mascots like the Atlanta Braves.)</p> <p>Against the rabble, the old man is steadfast. In the stare-down, he never breaks eye contact. He just keeps singing. Off-camera, you can hear one or two voices rising with his.</p> <p>You probably didn\u2019t recognize the song the elder is singing against the fracas, but I did: it\u2019s the anthem of the American Indian Movement. We used to gather around the drum to sing it after powwow dance practice every Thursday night at the Intertribal Friendship House in Oakland, California. Some say it was composed to honor the life of Raymond Yellow Thunder, an Oglala Lakota beaten to death by two white men in Gordon, Nebraska, in 1972. Our elders told us to carry forward the legacy of the men and women who sang it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Against the rabble, the old man is steadfast. In the stare-down, he never breaks eye contact</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When that clip first appeared on my Twitter feed, I could not click play. As an Indian, the fear of a face-to-face encounter with a sneering white superior is deeply engrained in my psychology. I cannot watch that film and not think about the youth hockey opponent who knocked me down while yelling \u201cIndian <em>boy</em>!\u201d Or the man who accused my father and I of stealing our own car. Or the Raiders fans who yelled epithets at a group of Native dancers and me performing for a heritage month celebration at their home game. Or the dirty looks I get in many parts of this country as a brown man with a braid hanging down my back.</p> <p>I saw that thumbnail image and thought about the Indian agents who kidnapped and assaulted my grandmother and took her away to Catholic school. I thought about my relatives. I feared that men younger than I still believed us all to be inferior; that an elder who reminded me of uncles, cousins and so many other Native men I\u2019ve met and loved could still be put in his place; that the songs we sing are, to the Maga youth, a laughingstock.</p> <p>Many on the internet were moved as I was. But others were not. They saw, in the teens, their <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/01/covington-catholic-is-the-terrible-sequel-to-the-kavanaugh-case/\">sons</a> and their own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByronTau/status/1086685218076090368\">adolescence</a>. They feared that a social justice witch-hunt was afoot.</p> <p>There were many ways to follow this story. They revealed less about what actually happened at the Lincoln Memorial on Friday and more about who has the power to tell the story and the biases underlying how that story is told. From opposite sides of the socioeconomic-political-cultural-racial divide, reporters and citizen journalists followed the facts in opposite directions.</p> <p>We <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/nathan-phillips-activist-song-peaceful-resistance-hope\">learned</a> that the elder was a sacred <a href=\"https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/news/an-interview-with-nathan-phillips-on-the-magayouth-incident-7wUkJHLjtUa2-k2Fx14MvQ/\">pipe carrier</a>, activist veteran from the Omaha Nation named Nathan Phillips. We learned that he was a founder of the Native Youth Alliance who helped lead <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/projects/13542941/return-to-standing-rock/\">prayer walks</a> after Standing Rock and participates in an annual gathering for Native veterans at Arlington National Cemetery. We learned that he was in town for the Indigenous Peoples March. Some of us noted that the Washington DC National Football League team name, the Redskins, is a dictionary-definition racial slur. And in later interviews, we learned that Phillips was singing <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/21/us/nathan-phillips-maga-teens-interview/index.html\">to pray</a> for the young men staring him down.</p> <p>We learned that the youth was an 11th-grade student at the expensive all-boys Covington Catholic private school in Kentucky. (Upon learning this, some of us may have noted that private schools sprouted up in the south to <a href=\"https://www.southerneducation.org/Our-Research/Race-Ethnicity-Report-Series/A-History-of-Private-Schools-Race-in-the-American.aspx\">preserve segregation</a>.) We learned that his school has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arlenparsa/status/1086992437111865346\">no women or people of color</a> in authority positions. A photo has circulated of Covington Catholic basketball fans, some in <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/covington-catholic-black-paint/\">black face</a>, yelling at an African American opponent. We learned that his mother is a vice-president at Fidelity Investments. We learned that the school sent its students to the capital to participate in the anti-abortion <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/1/22/18192908/covington-catholic-video-nick-sandmann-maga\">March for Life</a>.</p> <p>And after we learned many of these details, we learned the boy\u2019s name was Nicholas Sandmann and that his family hired a<a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2019/01/21/covington-catholic-runswitch-pr-helped-student-in-controversial-video/2638400002/\"> PR firm</a> to respond to the controversy.</p> <p>But as more videos and reports emerged, we also learned that there was a group of Black Hebrew Israelites who were yelling insults at both the students and the Native Americans. They may have instigated the confrontation. We learned that Phillips approached the students in part to defuse those tensions.

      "bodyText": "By now, you\u2019ve surely seen the video. On the steps outside the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, a white teenager sporting the red cap accoutrements of the Trump campaign stands nose-to-nose with a bespectacled Native American elder singing and playing a hand drum. The teen is smirking \u2013 his expression, for me, oozes entitlement. Behind him an unruly crowd \u2013 all male, all white, many also wearing the conspicuous Maga apparel \u2013 is jeering the elder in a frenzy of Lord of the Flies privilege. (In another video, some of the boys can be seen cackling while war-whooping and making the tomahawk chop gesture popularized by sports teams with Native American mascots like the Atlanta Braves.) Against the rabble, the old man is steadfast. In the stare-down, he never breaks eye contact. He just keeps singing. Off-camera, you can hear one or two voices rising with his. You probably didn\u2019t recognize the song the elder is singing against the fracas, but I did: it\u2019s the anthem of the American Indian Movement. We used to gather around the drum to sing it after powwow dance practice every Thursday night at the Intertribal Friendship House in Oakland, California. Some say it was composed to honor the life of Raymond Yellow Thunder, an Oglala Lakota beaten to death by two white men in Gordon, Nebraska, in 1972. Our elders told us to carry forward the legacy of the men and women who sang it. When that clip first appeared on my Twitter feed, I could not click play. As an Indian, the fear of a face-to-face encounter with a sneering white superior is deeply engrained in my psychology. I cannot watch that film and not think about the youth hockey opponent who knocked me down while yelling \u201cIndian boy!\u201d Or the man who accused my father and I of stealing our own car. Or the Raiders fans who yelled epithets at a group of Native dancers and me performing for a heritage month celebration at their home game. Or the dirty looks I get in many parts of this country as a brown man with a braid hanging down my back. I saw that thumbnail image and thought about the Indian agents who kidnapped and assaulted my grandmother and took her away to Catholic school. I thought about my relatives. I feared that men younger than I still believed us all to be inferior; that an elder who reminded me of uncles, cousins and so many other Native men I\u2019ve met and loved could still be put in his place; that the songs we sing are, to the Maga youth, a laughingstock. Many on the internet were moved as I was. But others were not. They saw, in the teens, their sons and their own adolescence. They feared that a social justice witch-hunt was afoot. There were many ways to follow this story. They revealed less about what actually happened at the Lincoln Memorial on Friday and more about who has the power to tell the story and the biases underlying how that story is told. From opposite sides of the socioeconomic-political-cultural-racial divide, reporters and citizen journalists followed the facts in opposite directions. We learned that the elder was a sacred pipe carrier, activist veteran from the Omaha Nation named Nathan Phillips. We learned that he was a founder of the Native Youth Alliance who helped lead prayer walks after Standing Rock and participates in an annual gathering for Native veterans at Arlington National Cemetery. We learned that he was in town for the Indigenous Peoples March. Some of us noted that the Washington DC National Football League team name, the Redskins, is a dictionary-definition racial slur. And in later interviews, we learned that Phillips was singing to pray for the young men staring him down. We learned that the youth was an 11th-grade student at the expensive all-boys Covington Catholic private school in Kentucky. (Upon learning this, some of us may have noted that private schools sprouted up in the south to preserve segregation.) We learned that his school has no women or people of color in authority positions. A photo has circulated of Covington Catholic basketball fans, some in black face, yelling at an African American opponent. We learned that his mother is a vice-president at Fidelity Investments. We learned that the school sent its students to the capital to participate in the anti-abortion March for Life. And after we learned many of these details, we learned the boy\u2019s name was Nicholas Sandmann and that his family hired a PR firm to respond to the controversy. But as more videos and reports emerged, we also learned that there was a group of Black Hebrew Israelites who were yelling insults at both the students and the Native Americans. They may have instigated the confrontation. We learned that Phillips approached the students in part to defuse those tensions. We learned, surprisingly, that Sandmann is a fan of the politically conscious rapper Logic. And we learned, unsurprisingly, through Sandmann\u2019s press release that the he does not believe what he did was hateful or racist. It is the job of the press and the discerning reader and viewer to compile and synthesize these messy facts and statements into a coherent narrative. And in that task a great deal of the press and a large portion of the discerning have failed. Early coverage of Phillips and Sandmann\u2019s encounter was, for me, in a small sense, encouraging: outrage suggested that maybe the media and the multitude could grapple with anti-Indian racism. That my experience \u2013 what I and many other Native people felt when we watched that clip \u2013 could be met with compassion and perhaps even a moment of reflection on the enduring psychology of racial entitlement that snatched this continent out from under our ancestor\u2019s feet and still today deprives elders like Nathan Phillips of their dignity.

      "bodyText": "CBS has rejected a Super Bowl television ad calling for the legalization of medical marijuana sponsored by one of the largest cannabis investment companies. Marijuana is now legal in some form in 33 US states and the Trump administration, while making no move to decriminalize marijuana at a federal level, has shown no interest in enforcing existing statutes that would affect the fast-growing, multibillion marijuana industry. But the still-fluid legal situation appears to have put CBS off taking the ad from New York-based Acreage Holdings during the 3 February game between New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the news but somewhat unsurprised,\u201d Allen told CNN Business. \u201cStill, we developed the ad in the spirit of a public service announcement. We feel it\u2019s our responsibility to advocate on behalf of our patients.\u201d Scott Greiper, the president of Viridian Capital Advisors, one of the largest investment advisers in the space, said the tricky legal status of marijuana \u201ccauses large companies like CBS concern to promote a federally illegal substance\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, and it\u2019s conservative, but their concerns are legitimate.\u201d Acreage Holdings is one of the largest players in the US market and comes with a stated vision \u201cin the transformational power that cannabis has to heal and change the world\u201d and a mission to bring \u201csafe, affordable cannabis to everyone who needs it\u201d. Underscoring how rapidly the marijuana business has moved from its counterculture roots, the company counts the former House speaker John Boehner and former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney among its board members. Acreage, which is valued at more than $2.4bn, was proposing to broadcast the ad, which would have cost $5m for a 30-second spot, to \u201ccreate an advocacy campaign for constituents who are being lost in the dialogue\u201d of the medical marijuana debate, according to Allen. The Super Bowl is the most high profile advertising event of the year where companies and advocacy groups fight for slots that will be seen by its huge audience. Last year\u2019s game attracted 103.4 million TV viewers. While the ads may be weed free, the players won\u2019t be. The majority of NFL players smoke marijuana, according to players, many to help cope with injuries \u2013 and a large proportion of NFL fans do too.",

The only way to prevent something similar happening in the future is if we understand the cause of it.\u201d Thompson and Venables were both released in 2001 and given new identities. Venables was returned to prison in 2010 over child pornography offences; after being released in 2013, he pleaded guilty to child pornography offences in 2018, and is currently imprisoned. The Oscar winners will be announced on 24 February.",

The elevation of Gandhi, 47, is the latest chapter for the Nehru-Gandhi family that helped lead India to independence 71 years ago and which has ruled the country for much of the time since. Less than three months before Indians are expected to begin voting in the world\u2019s largest elections, commentators said her formal entry into politics could boost Congress party momentum and refresh a dynasty that some commentators have said is exhausted. Gandhi, who also goes by the surname Vadra since her marriage, has been appointed as the party\u2019s general-secretary for eastern Uttar Pradesh, overseeing an area containing one of the constituencies of the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, in a state of more than 200 million people with the most parliamentary seats on offer. She is considered a more charismatic campaigner than her brother, the current Congress party chief, Rahul Gandhi, with presence and an appearance that are often compared to that of her grandmother Indira Gandhi, a formidable and controversial prime minister, who was assassinated in 1984. It is not clear if she will contest a seat herself. Shortly after the announcement on Wednesday, Congress party workers in the Uttar Pradesh capital, Lucknow, held up posters reading: \u201cIndira is back.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re fired up &amp; ready to go!\u201d the party said on its Twitter account under a list of the new appointments, including Gandhi\u2019s. Gandhi, the daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter of Indian prime ministers, has campaigned informally in the family\u2019s ancestral homelands in eastern Uttar Pradesh but has resisted entering politics herself for more than two decades. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve figured out why myself,\u201d she said of her reluctance in a 2009 interview. \u201cBut I\u2019m very clear I don\u2019t want to be in politics. I\u2019m very happy living my life the way I am. I think there are certain aspects of politics which I\u2019m just not suited to.\u201d Author and journalist Sagarika Ghose, a biographer of Indira Gandhi who has interviewed Priyanka several times, said she had the potential to command voters\u2019 attention in Uttar Pradesh and had particular appeal among women. \u201cA woman Gandhi is a very powerful symbol and Indira Gandhi\u2019s mystique lives on,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a ballsy move. Let\u2019s face it: she\u2019s striking and photogenic and this is the politics of spectacle.\u201d Gandhi is regarded as a forceful and engaging presence on the campaign trail. She caused a minor stir in 2008 when she attended a speech by her brother in parliament wearing jeans and a blouse, eschewing the traditional sari that most women in the chamber wear. But Ghose said the next months would also be an unprecedented test of Gandhi\u2019s political skills. \u201cSo far she\u2019s been able to just dip her toe in politics and then come out of it and go on holidays,\u201d Ghose said. \u201cNow she has actually taken the plunge and will really have to prove herself.\u201d The ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) is likely to use the appointment to sharpen its attack on Congress as a party of nepotism. Modi told party workers after the announcement that for Congress, a family was the party, unlike the BJP, for which the party was family. \u201cThe Congress has basically publicly announced that Rahul Gandhi has failed and needs crutches from within the family,\u201d said BJP spokesman Sambit Patra. He said the announcement was intended to boost party morale after the Congress party appeared to be sidelined from an alliance of opposition parties that has formed in recent weeks to take on Modi. \u201cBecause of his rejection by grand alliance parties, he has opted for a family alliance,\u201d Patra said. Gandhi\u2019s husband, Robert Vadra, has also been accused of engaging in corrupt land deals by political opponents, allegations he says are baseless but which could be given a fresh airing after Wednesday\u2019s announcement. Modi enters India\u2019s election season appearing as weak as he has ever been while in power after losing three state elections in December and amid wide discontent with an economy that is growing quickly but failing to create enough good jobs to match the aspirations of a young and restless country. But his personal popularity is still thought to be high and no other figure, either within his party or among his opponents, has emerged as a strong alternative leader.",

      "bodyText": "European objections have forced the United States to backtrack on plans to stage a two-day conference in Poland focused on building a global coalition against Iran. The conference is now being described as a wider brainstorming session about the Middle East. In announcing the summit earlier this month, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had explicitly said the summit\u2019s purpose was to focus on Iran\u2019s influence and terrorism in the region. But the joint official announcement of the summit did not mention Iran, instead highlighting issues connected with Iran \u2013 \u201cterrorism and extremism, missile development and proliferation, maritime trade and security, and threats posed by proxy groups across the region\u201d. The change of emphasis follows signs that many European countries, including the EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, will avoid the two-day event on 12 and 13 February, and instead head to the Munich security forum later in the week. The US has been trying to persuade the EU to drop its support for the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and has been using the threat of US secondary sanctions to press EU firms not to trade with Iran. The UK is one of the countries most conflicted about attending the Polish conference since the UK is traditionally close to both Poland and the US, but has stood by the Iran nuclear deal. The broadening of the agenda may be designed to make it easier for the UK to attend. Jonathan Cohen, US representative at the UN, described the scope of the discussion as \u201cmuch broader than any one country or set of issues\u201d. He said it would be a \u201cglobal brainstorming session\u201d and stressed that it was \u201cnot the venue to demonise or attack Iran.\u201d Issues such as the humanitarian crises in Syria and Yemen, missile development and cyber security would be discussed, Cohen told the UN security council. The Polish envoy to the UN, Joanna Wronecka, also said the ministerial conference in Warsaw would bring \u201cadded value to the efforts to peace in the Middle East by creating a positive vision to the region\u201d. She said 70 countries all over the world had been invited but stressed the summit would address \u201ca range of horizontal issues that touch on the whole region. We do not intend to focus on particular countries during the conference\u201d. Poland\u2019s deputy foreign affairs minister Maciej Lang travelled to Iran to reassure Tehran this week, and Poland on Wednesday said it may yet add Iran to the invitation list. Iran is sceptical that the US will be interested in anything other than a two-day Iran-bashing fest. Russia has already said it will not attend the summit, and a wider boycott, or attendance by low-level officials, would demonstrate the United States\u2019 international isolation. Iran\u2019s foreign minister Javad Zarif tweeted that his country had welcomed over 100,000 Polish refugees during the second world war. \u201c[The] Polish government can\u2019t wash the shame: while Iran saved Poles in the second world war, it now hosts a desperate anti-Iran circus.\u201d European states have remained largely remained united behind the nuclear deal, even if its patience with Iranian ballistic missile tests is wearing thin. The summit may also serve to highlight the inability of the EU to assemble a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d (SPV) meant to serve as a back channel to handle financial transactions and bypass US sanctions on Iran. The SPV has been delayed for months. The new EU-Iran alliance has suffered due to accusations that Iran has been behind assassination plots on European soil, a matter being closely followed up by the Dutch and Danish governments.",

Lawyers for the Australian activist have filed an urgent application to the Washington-based Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) aimed at forcing the hand of US prosecutors, requiring them to \u201cunseal\u201d any secret charges against him. The legal move is an attempt to prevent Assange\u2019s extradition to the US at a time that a new Ecuadorian government has been making his stay in the central London apartment increasingly inhospitable. He has been staying in the Knightsbridge flat, which houses the embassy, since 2012 when he fled extradition proceedings at the UK\u2019s supreme court. Swedish prosecutors have since dropped their request to extradite him to Stockholm over a rape investigation. If he were to walk out on to the street, Assange is likely to face contempt of court charges for fleeing British justice. His chief fear, however, is that once arrested, the US authorities would begin fresh extradition proceedings against him alleging security offences. It is believed American prosecutors have been investigating Assange since at least 2011, when a grand jury hearing was opened into the whistleblowing website\u2019s publication of hundreds of thousands of US diplomatic cables, in conjunction with a number of international newspapers including the Guardian. The IACHR monitors human rights in the Americas and hears appeals on individual cases. The Trump administration, however, has boycotted its recent hearings. The 1,172-page submission by Assange\u2019s lawyers calls on the US to unseal any secret charges against him and urges Ecuador to cease its \u201cespionage activities\u201d against him. Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, the prominent Spanish judge who has pursued dictators, terrorists and drug barons, is the international coordinator of Assange\u2019s legal team.

      "bodyText": "A new road in the West Bank that separates Palestinian and Israeli drivers was closed by protesters on Wednesday, before they were dispersed by Israeli police deploying teargas and stun grenades. Route 4370 is dubbed the \u201capartheid road\u201d by some campaigners because of its 8-metre dividing wall of concrete and metal. The western side of the road is principally for Israelis, and the eastern side principally for Palestinians. The road, which opened earlier this month, allows residents of Jewish settlements in the West Bank to reach Jerusalem faster than if they had to pass through the congested Hizma checkpoint north of the city. The Palestinian side of the road is designed to take cars into an underpass that will eventually connect the Palestinian cities of Ramallah and Bethlehem without motorists having to drive through Jerusalem. Most Palestinians living in the West Bank do not have permits to enter Jerusalem. A group of protesters, comprising Israeli, Palestinian and international activists, blocked access to the road for about 30 minutes on Wednesday morning, holding a banner saying \u201cNo to apartheid, no to annexation\u201d. One person was arrested and another injured. \u201cWe came to protest against the opening of what is essentially an apartheid road. This road is mainly meant to benefit settlers. We don\u2019t support segregated roads built on Palestinian land,\u201d said Maya Rosen, one of the protesters. She said police had used teargas and stun grenades to disperse protesters. Israeli police could not be contacted for comment. Israeli officials say that both sides of the roads are open to Israelis and Palestinians as long as they have the correct documentation. Yisrael Gantz, the head of the Binyamin regional council, which represents more than 40 settlements and outposts in the West Bank, said the new road was \u201cno less than an oxygen line for the region\u2019s residents, who work, study and go out for entertainment in Jerusalem\u201d. Access to the city had been \u201crevolutionised\u201d, he said. \u201cThe claim that this is an apartheid road is complete nonsense. Apartheid is discrimination based on ethnic and racial background,\u201d Gantz told CNN. \u201cThe entry to Jerusalem through the [eastern] road is allowed to all those who have a legal entry permit, regardless of their nationality, religion, ethnic or racial background.\u201d At the road\u2019s opening ceremony, Gilad Erdan, Israel\u2019s minister of public security, said the road was \u201cone move of many to strengthen \u2026 sovereignty in the region.\u201d He added: \u201cThe road that was opened today is an example of how we can create mutual life between Israelis and Palestinians, while at the same time safeguarding all the existing security challenges.\u201d Hanan Ashwari, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) executive, said: \u201cThe creation of this new apartheid road affirms Israel\u2019s wilful intent to entrench its racist colonial regime and superimpose \u2018Greater Israel\u2019 on all of historic Palestine. \u201cWith the blanket support of the current US administration, including endorsement of Israel\u2019s egregious violations and total disdain for international law and the global consensus, Israel is successfully destroying the territorial contiguity and territorial integrity of the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) to enhance its colonial settlement enterprise and facilitate the creation of bantustans throughout occupied Palestine.\u201d Bantustans or \u201chomelands\u201d were areas set aside for black South Africans under the apartheid regime. Israel has previously segregated roads in the West Bank. A section of route 443 was barred to Palestinian vehicles \u2013 easily identifiable by their green number plates \u2013 for eight years before Israel\u2019s high court ordered the policy to end in 2010.",

In a little-noticed practice direction released this month, the lord chief justice, Ian Burnett, and the senior president of tribunals, Sir Ernest Ryder, set out rules for a \u201clibrary of closed judgments\u201d covering cases in England and Wales. Human rights groups and the media have repeatedly raised concerns about the impact of a body of secret law emerging which is neither properly indexed nor available for the public to consult. The library of closed judgments \u2013 a term reminiscent of an institution in a Harry Potter novel \u2013 will be opened to security-cleared special advocates and judges. Only senior judges are deemed to have sufficient security clearance. In a decision ahead of the inquest into the Russian businessman Alexander Perepilichnyy, it was ruled that coroners could not see sensitive security and intelligence material. Many lawyers feared that without an accessible repository of secret judgments only the intelligence agencies would hold a detailed record of such decisions. Increasing numbers of cases are heard in \u201cclosed material procedures\u201d (CMP) during which security-sensitive information is given \u201cin camera\u201d, secretly. The frequency of such trials has grown since the 2013 Justice and Security Act extended them into civil courts. Often judgments handed down by tribunals, such as the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, produce two versions of a decision \u2013 one public but with sections redacted, the other in full but only shown to judges and security-cleared special advocates in the case. The number of such secret judgments over the past two decades is believed to run into the hundreds, creating a problem of how, if precedents are set or secrecy issues decided, lawyers approaching fresh cases discover significant, relevant decisions. Until now, \u201cclosed\u201d or secret judgments have been locked in a variety of locations, including government departments and agencies.

The new practice direction said: \u201cA single printed copy and an electronic copy of each closed judgment and any related open judgment must be lodged with the [Royal Courts of Justice] senior information officer within 14 days of being delivered or handed down, for consideration for inclusion in the library of closed judgments now established in the Royal Courts of Justice.\u201d Not all secret judgments will be retained. Some would \u201cbe disposed of securely\u201d. Those kept \u201cmust at all times be maintained under secure handling provisions as set down in closed judgments library \u2013 security guidance of 2017\u201d, it said. The guidance has not been published. The new practice direction follows legal arguments developed after the court of appeal\u2019s 2016 decision when the Guardian and other news organisations objected to restrictions imposed on reporting the Old Bailey terror trial of Erol Incedal. It did not, however, refer to media coverage of CMP cases. Dr Lawrence McNamara of the University of York, who monitors courts\u2019 use of closed judgments, said: \u201cThis puts into practice what people have been pressing for. There needs to be a properly-indexed repository of closed decisions and it is good to see this is now in place, with a reasonable scope. \u201cFrom what has so far been made public, it\u2019s not clear what are the criteria for deciding which judgments should be retained and which disposed of. It is not clear who will be consulted in the decision-making process. \u201cThere are hugely important public interest cases. The Belhaj case \u2013 which involved rendition and mistreatment \u2013 resulted in a public apology in parliament. Closed material procedures were sought in that case; we need to know whether those will be retained.\u201d Corey Stoughton, the advocacy director at at the human rights organisation Liberty, said: \u201cAny court which is premised on secrecy goes against the principles of open justice on which our legal system is based. \u201cAs long as secret tribunals such as the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, are in use, they must be subject to the most stringent scrutiny that circumstances allow to ensure that security services do not infringe on our civil liberties. It is welcome that lawyers will have better access to vital information, but if government is to be held to account in a way that adequately protects our liberty, this level of secrecy has no place in our justice system.\u201d",

They may use works that already exist, reimagine or recontextualise them, or create them anew.</p> <p>In my novel <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-gunners.html\">The Gunners</a>, music appears in various contexts. Classical music enthusiast Mikey Callahan is losing his vision and has begun to assign specific pieces of music to cherished images he wants to remember with as much clarity as possible \u2013 such as the faces of his childhood friends, around whom the novel is based. Another character, a pianist, attended a conservatory in Manhattan on a full scholarship until her career was devastated by a mysterious injury.

The story is loosely based on Cather\u2019s friend, the opera singer <a href=\"https://www.literaryladiesguide.com/literary-musings/willa-cathers-inspiration-for-song-of-the-lark-olive-fremstad/\">Olive Fremstad</a>. The book offers a hard look at the complexity of ambition and seems to wonder if a life spent in single-minded pursuit of art (and recognition for it) can ultimately be anything but self-centred. This is probably the least known of the trilogy that also includes O Pioneers! and My \u00c1ntonia, but to me it\u2019s the standout.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1998/dec/31/guardianobituaries2\">The Recognitions by William Gaddis</a> </strong><br>This book is a monster, with almost 1,000 pages and what feels like 10,000 characters. But it\u2019s well worth the effort \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most comical books I\u2019ve ever read.

It is one of my favourite novels of recent years, and I have read it in a single day on two separate occasions.

The story, with Stockholm syndrome at its core, accelerates at a surprising clip while offering wonderful insights and lines about music: \u201cNever had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God\u2019s own voice poured from her.\u201d</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/norwegian-wood-2.html\">Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami</a><br></strong>This early Murakami novel is named after the narrator Toru Watanabe\u2019s favourite Beatles song. When he happens to hear an orchestral version many years later, the melody transports him back to the days of student revolt in the 1960s. Music is similarly potent for the other characters in a story that was a huge success in Japan and made the author a reluctant star. </p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/04/swing-time-by-zadie-smith-review\">Swing Time by Zadie Smith</a> </strong><br>Two girls\u2019 love of the golden age of musicals drives their life paths. The book moves from London to the US to Africa, and tackles themes of class, creativity, talent and ambition. In interviews, Smith has spoken about her own love of singing and dancing in her younger years, as well as the musical pursuits of her family members, and it\u2019s great fun to see these personal interests come to life in her fiction. </p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/station-eleven-review-emily-st-john-mandel\">Station Eleven by Emily St John Mandel</a><br></strong>\u201c\u2018The thing with the new world,\u2019 the tuba had said once, \u2018is it\u2019s just horrifically short on elegance.\u2019\u201d Members of the Traveling Symphony roam a post-apocalyptic world performing Shakespeare and musical numbers for the remaining humans. The book opens with a scene from King Lear and uses classic motifs throughout. It is a wonderfully bizarre and haunting tribute to the endurance of art in the face of an unrecognisable world.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/13/jennifer-egan-visit-goon-squad\">A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan</a><br></strong>The 13 chapters of this book are told from different perspectives and non-chronologically. They are mostly about the lives of Bennie, an ageing record producer, and Sasha, his kleptomaniac assistant, and are vivid and precise slice-of-life stories. The whole book explores the passage of time and the bonds that bind us to one another, for better or for worse.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/amsterdam-9.html\">Amsterdam by Ian McEwan</a><br></strong>The death of photographer Molly Lane brings together several men with whom she had relationships including Clive Linley, a composer who has been commissioned to write a symphony to premiere in Amsterdam. The book shows great interest in ethical questions relating to privacy, politics, assisted suicide and displacement of responsibility, and explores them to great effect, without preaching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8383570bee57537c1c80a6a44768d53f21389b43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8383570bee57537c1c80a6a44768d53f21389b43/182_375_1860_1116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kazuo Ishiguro at home with his guitars.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kazuo Ishiguro at home with his guitars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/nocturnes.html\">Nocturnes by Kazuo Ishiguro</a></strong> <br>This collection is subtitled Five Stories of Music and Nightfall. In straightforward prose, Ishiguro offers tales of loss and longing and unrealised potential in music and in love. My favourite story is Nocturne, in which the narrator, a saxophonist whose manager has demanded he get plastic surgery in order to compete with less proficient but handsomer players, rooms next to a wealthy American woman while he is healing from his surgery. Their friendship results in absurdity, hilarity, and a surprisingly tender and devastating conclusion.</p> <p>\u2022 The Gunners by Rebecca Kauffman is published by Profile, priced \u00a312.99. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-gunners.html\">It is available from the Guardian bookshop for \u00a311.43, including free UK p&amp;p</a>.</p>",

Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami This early Murakami novel is named after the narrator Toru Watanabe\u2019s favourite Beatles song. When he happens to hear an orchestral version many years later, the melody transports him back to the days of student revolt in the 1960s. Music is similarly potent for the other characters in a story that was a huge success in Japan and made the author a reluctant star. 6. Swing Time by Zadie Smith Two girls\u2019 love of the golden age of musicals drives their life paths. The book moves from London to the US to Africa, and tackles themes of class, creativity, talent and ambition. In interviews, Smith has spoken about her own love of singing and dancing in her younger years, as well as the musical pursuits of her family members, and it\u2019s great fun to see these personal interests come to life in her fiction. 7. Station Eleven by Emily St John Mandel \u201c\u2018The thing with the new world,\u2019 the tuba had said once, \u2018is it\u2019s just horrifically short on elegance.\u2019\u201d Members of the Traveling Symphony roam a post-apocalyptic world performing Shakespeare and musical numbers for the remaining humans. The book opens with a scene from King Lear and uses classic motifs throughout. It is a wonderfully bizarre and haunting tribute to the endurance of art in the face of an unrecognisable world. 8. A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan The 13 chapters of this book are told from different perspectives and non-chronologically. They are mostly about the lives of Bennie, an ageing record producer, and Sasha, his kleptomaniac assistant, and are vivid and precise slice-of-life stories. The whole book explores the passage of time and the bonds that bind us to one another, for better or for worse. 9. Amsterdam by Ian McEwan The death of photographer Molly Lane brings together several men with whom she had relationships including Clive Linley, a composer who has been commissioned to write a symphony to premiere in Amsterdam. The book shows great interest in ethical questions relating to privacy, politics, assisted suicide and displacement of responsibility, and explores them to great effect, without preaching. 10. Nocturnes by Kazuo Ishiguro This collection is subtitled Five Stories of Music and Nightfall. In straightforward prose, Ishiguro offers tales of loss and longing and unrealised potential in music and in love. My favourite story is Nocturne, in which the narrator, a saxophonist whose manager has demanded he get plastic surgery in order to compete with less proficient but handsomer players, rooms next to a wealthy American woman while he is healing from his surgery. Their friendship results in absurdity, hilarity, and a surprisingly tender and devastating conclusion. \u2022 The Gunners by Rebecca Kauffman is published by Profile, priced \u00a312.99. It is available from the Guardian bookshop for \u00a311.43, including free UK p&amp;p.",

      "bodyText": "The household cleaning products aisle at Sainsbury\u2019s is not usually the place for epiphanies about capitalism. But a few days ago, my eyes fell on a yellow sticker on a bottle that proclaimed: \u201cShock! This product actually works!\u201d (It\u2019s called Bath Power \u2013 and, yes, it does. Other cleaning products are available, and some of them may work too.) It has come to this. Such is the depth of weary cynicism and disbelief among shoppers that manufacturers are forced to plead that if you just hand over a few quid you might finally, for once, get what you thought you were paying for. Shock! The game is up. Business has brought this cynicism on itself. It has too often over-promised and under-delivered, while not paying its workers (except its bosses) enough and poisoning the planet at the same time. No wonder so many attempts to persuade consumers that company X or Y has a heart and really cares about the state of the world end in embarrassing failure. In 2010 KFC\u2019s \u201cbuckets for the cure\u201d campaign to raise money for research into breast cancer provoked ridicule. High-fat fast food seemed an unlikely partner in the quest for better public health. Starbucks\u2019 \u201c#RaceTogether\u201d campaign in 2015 was similarly disdained, as if writing a few uplifting words on excessively large coffee cups might help tackle the root causes of racism in the US. Pepsi\u2019s \u201cLive for now\u201d ad starring Kendall Jenner was pulled after only a day, when its images of happy Pepsi-drinking protesters was mocked mercilessly on social media and beyond. Yet no humiliation can ever be too great, it seems, to teach business a lesson it will learn. This week Avon, the cosmetics company, has been the latest to be forced to apologise after promoting \u201ccellulite-busting\u201d creams. Its \u201c#nakedproof\u201d ads told potential customers that \u201cdimples are cute on your face (but not on your thighs)\u201d. On its website Avon boasts: \u201cOur founder was a pioneer of women\u2019s empowerment, long before women\u2019s rights were widely recognised, and we continue to drive this powerful mission for women today.\u201d This passion for women\u2019s empowerment seems to have diminished somewhat over time. In response to these ads, the actor Jameela Jamil tweeted: \u201cStop shaming women about age, gravity and cellulite. They\u2019re inevitable, completely normal things. To make us fear them and try to \u2018fix\u2019 them, is to literally set us up for failure.\u201d The power of celebrity worked its magic. Soon Avon had replied: \u201cHi Jameela, we intended this to be light-hearted and fun, but we realise we missed the mark. We\u2019ve removed this messaging from all marketing materials. We support our community in loving their bodies and feeling confident in their own skin.\u201d Which is nice. Last week\u2019s flurry over Gillette\u2019s \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d ad was another sign that customer cynicism is now deeply entrenched. Even if the content of the ad was quite carefully judged, and seemed to have caused difficulty mainly for a few toxic males, the idea that a vast corporation might want to discuss social change rather than just sell more razor blades was a novel one. Similarly, Nike\u2019s entry into the row surrounding the American football star Colin Kaepernick may have been good brand promotion and helpful for sales, but not necessarily a wholly sincere piece of political protest. Business\u2019s reputation is bad for business. It is startling to drop into the Twitter feed of Which?, formerly the Consumers\u2019 Association, and see that its pinned tweet is currently the phrase \u201cLoyalty does not pay\u201d repeated over and over. Our great consumer champion seems to be suggesting that we just can\u2019t trust business at all.

      "bodyText": "The government of Omar al-Bashir in Sudan has launched an \u201calarming\u201d crackdown on journalists covering weeks of protests against the regime. At least five reporters have been detained by the national intelligence security services and are being held at undisclosed locations. Dozens of others have been arrested and held before being released. Khartoum has also revoked the work permits of correspondents working for two Arab-language regional news networks preventing them from working in the country. \u201cWe expect the blackout to get worse and more violations by the authorities against the media as the protests continue,\u201d said Khalid Ahmed of the Sudanese Journalists\u2019 Network. The crackdown comes with Sudan\u2019s embattled president due in Qatar on Wednesday to seek support in the face of protests at home against his 29-year rule. Bashir will meet Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, to discuss possible aid to Sudan, which is suffering from deep economic problems. While Sudan has long had a poor reputation for freedom of media expression \u2013 the country is rank 174th out of 180 countries for press freedom \u2013 the latest crackdown is linked explicitly to protests against Bashir that broke out on 19 December. The five detained have been named as Qureshi Awad and Kamal Karar of Al-Midan newspaper, Adil Ibrahim of El Jareeda and Ogeel Naaim of Almijhar al-Siyasi. Speaking to the Guardian, Mazahir Ibrahim, Adil\u2019s older sister, said she was concerned about her 39-year-old brother, who suffers from high blood pressure. She said authorities had refused to allow his family to supply him with his medication. The authorities have issued warrants for the arrest of another 38 journalists \u2013 28 of them based abroad \u2013 accused of \u201cincitement and spreading fake news\u201d, which carries a potential sentence of three years in jail. Among those held and released was award-winning journalist Faisal Mohamed Salih, 62, who described security officers beating reporters. \u201cThe first time I was arrested when I was taken from my office. The first interrogation was designed to send a message back,\u201d he said. \u201cThey treated me as if I was a spokesman of the protests and wanted to say the protests will not topple down the regime because it\u2019s strong. \u201cThey acknowledged there were problems in the country but said demanding Bashir go is too big a demand.\u201d As well as those working for Sudanese media, journalists working for Arab-language news outlets of Al Arabyia television and the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera network have been targeted. In a statement earlier this week, Al-Jazeera said its Khartoum office had been informed that their journalists\u2019 credentials were revoked. The network denounced the move as \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201clacking any credible justification\u201d. The moves follow the blocking of social media sites. Some newspapers have also been prevented from distributing copies. Printing was stopped at the El-Jareeda daily according to publisher Awad Awad. \u201cWhenever there are protests national intelligence security services [censors] take out more than 80% of the content of the paper. We refuse because our credibility is more important. So they prevent printing,\u201d he said. Noting over 90 violations of freedom of the press since the protests broke out, Arnaud Froger, of Reporters Without Borders, said: \u201cWe unreservedly condemn these new arrests, the latest escalation in the government\u2019s harassment of media outlets and journalists who try to cover the ongoing events in their country. \u201cThe policy of systematically confiscating newspapers and arbitrarily arresting reporters is reaching alarming levels.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism chief has said he fears the far right will exploit Brexit tensions with their propaganda triggering rises in hate crime and creating an atmosphere that terrorists can exploit. The Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Neil Basu, head of counter-terrorism policing, told the Guardian he was concerned that far rightwing rhetoric from those lawfully allowed to operate will fuel tensions that spill over, in the same way Islamist propaganda incites terrorism. He also said a no-deal Brexit leading to a loss of intelligence and data-sharing with Europe would leave its 27 nations and Britain less safe and was of \u201cdeep concern\u201d. Basu, who briefs the prime minister and home secretary regularly, said police were working to minimise the damage but operations would be slower and more cumbersome if Britain left without a deal \u2013 and ministers knew this. Every part of policing is struggling to deal with the different Brexit scenarios, from no deal through to no Brexit, as Britain nears the 29 March deadline to leave the EU mired in uncertainty. While that is in the balance, the mounting divisions around Brexit led the senior police chief to voice his concerns about the effect in Britain. Basu said: \u201cMy concern is the polarisation, and I fear the far-right politicking and rhetoric leads to a rise in hate crime and a rise in disorder.\u201d He said he was seeing an increase in far right activity from small but vocal groups as the Brexit saga continues, adding: \u201cI am concerned about a small number of individuals trying to make a name for themselves such as Tommy Robinson.\u201d Basu drew a distinction between the far right whose rhetoric and activity is lawful, and the extreme right wing, which includes proscribed terror groups such as National Action. Basu, who is also Britain\u2019s most senior minority ethnic police officer, said far right rhetoric may not be illegal, but it fuels tensions and he fears its potential effects. \u201cIt generates a permissive atmosphere to people who want to take their argument to more extreme levels,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a difference between being offensive and criminally offensive behaviour, and that is the line we have to monitor.\u201d Asked for examples, Basu said: \u201cThe melodramatic claim that this country is being overtaken by sharia law, that kind of far right discourse, that Asians are only interested in grooming children.\u201d While debate about such issues is lawful, the exploitation for extremist purposes concerns Basu because it could push susceptible people towards more extreme behaviour \u201cin the same way extremist Islamist rhetoric radicalises people\u201d. Basu said indicators used by police to measure how communities are feeling were already showing some rise in tensions. While there was no intelligence of public order threats, police were planning for them, he said. \u201cWe are monitoring if the intelligence suggests public order difficulties because of Brexit. So far it is not. We are planning for it, because it is sensible to plan for it. That potential exists.\u201d Basu is well regarded in Whitehall and tipped as a future commissioner of Britain\u2019s biggest force. He was speaking to promote a new advert in cinemas urging people to report suspicious terrorist activity as figures show 18 plots have been thwarted since March 2017, with 14 inspired by Islamist extremism and four from the extreme far right. Basu\u2019s counter-terrorism network remains under pressure, with Isis\u2019s loss of lands in Iraq and Syria not leading to a decrease in work for police and the security services, with a record 700 live investigations ongoing. Against that backdrop he spoke out about the damage no deal would cause, meaning a loss of key intelligence and data-sharing measures, with replacements being slower. The three key tools that he said were of \u201cdeep concern\u201d to counter-terrorism investigators were fast-time access to intelligence and data through the SIS II [Schengen information system 2] database, as well as passenger name records, and the ability to use European arrest warrants. Basu said the damage from a no-deal Brexit to policing and security could be serious. \u201cIt is a very serious flaw in our security arrangements,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have no-deal Brexit, and we could not share that information, and if we lose access to those systems, it will inevitably make the UK and Europe less safe than it is today.\u201d Basu added: \u201cThere will be gaps, and it will be slower and clunkier.

Biden is 76 years old today and would be 78 when starting his first term as president. That is eight years older than Trump was in 2016 and nine years older than Ronald Reagan in 1980.

According to most polls, former vice-president Joe Biden is the frontrunner of the Democratic hopefuls: 76% of the potential Democratic electorate holds a favorable opinion of him, whereas only 12% is either unfavorable or neutral/doesn\u2019t know him. Biden supporters will use this as evidence that he is the best presidential candidate for the Democratic party \u2013 but they are wrong.

An earlier version said Joe Biden would be five years older at a potential inauguration than Ronald Reagan was on taking office. This has been corrected to nine years: Reagan was 69 when he became president.",

      "body": "<p>Across the road from Victoria Station is one of London\u2019s longest-running musicals, <a href=\"https://www.wickedthemusical.co.uk/\">Wicked</a>. Walk further on, past the history-making hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/21/hamilton-review-musical-london-victoria-palace-lin-manuel-miranda\">Hamilton</a>, and you\u2019ll find a smaller theatre where a crack squad of performers are putting on their own musical. This one is guaranteed to both open and close on the same night, but it\u2019s no flop. The idea behind the Olivier award-winning <a href=\"http://www.theshowstoppers.org/\">Showstopper! The Improvised Musical</a> is that the cast creates a new, never-to-be-repeated production every evening, entirely improvised from audience suggestions. On Wednesday night, they will create their 1,000th show from scratch, more than 10 years after their debut.</p> <p>The Showstopper! phenomenon started with an outlandish challenge laid down by theatrical maverick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/01/obituary.ken.campbell\">Ken Campbell</a>. Adam Meggido, who co-created the format with Dylan Emery and still performs with him in the show, recalls attending Campbell\u2019s \u201cworkshops in eccentric performance\u201d in a north London squat. \u201cKen had just come back from Canada where he\u2019d seen a group called <a href=\"http://www.edmontonfringe.ca/play/die-nasty-the-live-improvised-soap-opera-at-the-fringe/\">Die Nasty</a>. For over 25 years now they\u2019ve done a weekly improvised soap opera. Ken said it was better than stuff that\u2019s scripted.\u201d When Campbell was commissioned to create an entertainment for the <a href=\"http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/\">Globe</a>, to be performed on Shakespeare\u2019s birthday, he floated the idea of a group of actors improvising Shakespeare \u2013 but he had a caveat. Meggido convincingly adopts Campbell\u2019s nasal inflections as he remembers being told: \u201cThe thing is, it\u2019s got to be <em>better</em> than the original.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0b070e5fd39e807c0db5dfb9c3c932495cffb28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0b070e5fd39e807c0db5dfb9c3c932495cffb28/0_857_3481_2089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s got to be better than Shakespeare\u2019 \u2026 Ken Campbell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s got to be better than Shakespeare\u2019 \u2026 Ken Campbell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Shakespeare gig led to similar improv shows at the Royal Court and the group began to riff on the dramatic style of Pinter and Sondheim in their performances. Increasingly, Campbell would tell them: \u201cDo it like it\u2019s a musical. That\u2019s a winner.\u201d Meggido, whose parents were musical-theatre actors, already knew the art form inside out. He learned more about the craft of improvisation from Emery, who was combining an unlikely pair of careers: financial journalism and improv comedy. They built up a team called the Showstoppers; today\u2019s company comprises 17 performers including Lucy Trodd and Pippa Evans. Several of them have been members since the early days.</p> <p>The show has been expanded and the formula fine-tuned since their first trip to the Edinburgh fringe. In 2008, they performed in an 89-seat Portakabin at the festival in an 11.30pm slot. It sold out from day one. \u201cWe had no idea why,\u201d says Meggido. \u201cThere were other groups all over the world doing that kind of thing, but I don\u2019t think anyone else was trying to make it a musical in the same way we were.\u201d</p> <p>Meggido and Emery are hopelessly devoted to the art of the show tune: they genuinely want to create a great musical each night, not just pastiche the genre and have some knockabout fun. So they dress like they mean business. \u201cA lot of improv happens in bars and improvisers generally dress very casually,\u201d explains Emery. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in a theatre you want the audience to know this isn\u2019t mucking around.\u201d Meggido adds: \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to look and feel like improv. I wanted it to look and feel like a musical.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0a00f60bc1581214f2f6079056975eb927388d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0a00f60bc1581214f2f6079056975eb927388d1/0_83_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dylan Emery as The Writer, background, with Pippa Evans and Justin Brett in Showstopper!

The Improvised Musical.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For each show, a six-strong squad of Showstoppers wear colour-coded red and black outfits with matching bowling shoes. They are introduced by a sharp-suited character called The Writer (usually played by Emery). The Writer takes a call from a producer named Cameron (one of many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/30/cameron-mackintosh-interview\">winks to the audience</a>) who desperately needs a new musical. The audience must help by supplying a setting, a title and assorted musical styles from which the actors will spin a story.</p> <p>On the night I see them at The Other Palace (for production number 998), we set the show in a funeral parlour (narrowly beating second choice Stonehenge), name it Stiff! and request songs in the key of rock musical Six, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/19/songs-musicals-hamilton-lin-manuel-miranda-hamildrops\">Alan Mencken</a>\u2019s The Little Mermaid and Sondheim (\u201ceasy to copy,\u201d deadpans The Writer).</p> <p>Almost instantly, the six Showstoppers have created their characters, are singing choruses, keeping just-about-in-sync for salsa routines and finding satisfying rhymes for \u201cformaldehyde\u201d. Their synergy is staggering and a three-piece band onstage don\u2019t miss a beat either. The Writer interrupts proceedings for us to add suggestions. Emery says it\u2019s a highwire act for the cast and The Writer\u2019s job is to wobble the wire if they ever look too comfortable: \u201cYou put them in a new situation and see what they can do.\u201d</p> <p>As an audience member you can\u2019t help but try to \u201csolve\u201d the show. Are those melodies pre-arranged? Are there stock characters or situations they use? How much has really been pre-prepared? Nothing, says Meggido. \u201cAudiences want to come back to see the \u2018trick\u2019 or find secret signals. But there aren\u2019t any. People think there are set things we fall back on but it\u2019s harder to have something in the back of your mind to fall back on than it is to genuinely improvise the musical. It\u2019s easier just to make it all up.\u201d The Showstoppers, he says, are like a sports team: they train hard, communicate well and \u201cuse their skills in the moment\u201d.</p> <p>In the interval, the audience is encouraged to tweet further suggestions for the second half. I wonder if this is when they map out the rest of the show between them backstage but Meggido says they concentrate on firming up the story from Act I, as it all moves so quickly. (Emery later records the title and synopsis of each show they do in an <a href=\"http://www.theshowstoppers.org/category/2018-archive/\">online archive</a>.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4b3837bcf228d0678fe3dad40a439fd0bea418bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b3837bcf228d0678fe3dad40a439fd0bea418bc/0_0_2627_3543/741.jpg\" alt=\"The Showstoppers team in 2013.\" width=\"741\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Showstoppers team in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Ullathorne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The show uses minimal, multi-purpose props and those red-and-black outfits have been cleverly designed, by <a href=\"http://www.gabriellaslade.co.uk/#/showstopper/\">Gabriella Slade</a>, to suit a range of musical styles and eras. Emery uses a frock coat as an example: \u201cYou put it on and you could be an American general in the civil war, a doorman at the Dorchester or an 18th-century gentleman.\u201d</p> <p>The Showstoppers empire now includes a 45-minute version for kids. \u201cWe only take suggestions from the children,\u201d explains Meggido. \u201cIt\u2019s just a big game of \u2018what happens next?\u2019 We do whatever the kids say.\u201d Emery says the older children are often very good at making sense of the plot and creating a structure, while the younger ones \u201care more likely to go somewhere fun and exciting. You need both elements to create a really satisfying story. The kids show is probably the most fun we have. We\u2019re basically doing as little improvisation as possible. It\u2019s so liberating and it\u2019s good training because, in the main show, everyone is worried constantly about where the story is going. Is it making sense? Are people emotionally attached to it?\u201d</p> <p>I wonder how stressed they get each night \u2013 for most of us in the audience, singing a song onstage would be bad enough, never mind making up your own lyrics and dance routines. Meggido explains the ethos: \u201cI want us to be a bunch of naive clowns who don\u2019t get how terrifying what they\u2019re doing is.\u201d The key, he says, is \u201cto be completely present and free from tension as much as possible. Anything I\u2019ve done in my life creatively that felt any good, it didn\u2019t feel like I was doing it. It felt like I was a channel for something that was happening \u2026 The more relaxed I am, the more present, it becomes obvious what to do next. The more tense and less connected I am, the more I have to strain. But it\u2019s not necessarily a better or worse result. You can create through relaxation or tension.\u201d</p> <p>One day, they plan to perform a show with all 17 of the Showstoppers on stage for the full chorus-line effect. In the meantime, a handful of them will continue to turn up at the theatre in Victoria each night, arriving without a character\u2019s name, a line of dialogue or a single lyric between them. And then these improv wizards will teach Elphaba a thing or two about defying gravity.</p> <ul> <li><p>Showstopper!

      "bodyText": "Across the road from Victoria Station is one of London\u2019s longest-running musicals, Wicked. Walk further on, past the history-making hit Hamilton, and you\u2019ll find a smaller theatre where a crack squad of performers are putting on their own musical. This one is guaranteed to both open and close on the same night, but it\u2019s no flop. The idea behind the Olivier award-winning Showstopper! The Improvised Musical is that the cast creates a new, never-to-be-repeated production every evening, entirely improvised from audience suggestions. On Wednesday night, they will create their 1,000th show from scratch, more than 10 years after their debut. The Showstopper! phenomenon started with an outlandish challenge laid down by theatrical maverick Ken Campbell. Adam Meggido, who co-created the format with Dylan Emery and still performs with him in the show, recalls attending Campbell\u2019s \u201cworkshops in eccentric performance\u201d in a north London squat. \u201cKen had just come back from Canada where he\u2019d seen a group called Die Nasty. For over 25 years now they\u2019ve done a weekly improvised soap opera. Ken said it was better than stuff that\u2019s scripted.\u201d When Campbell was commissioned to create an entertainment for the Globe, to be performed on Shakespeare\u2019s birthday, he floated the idea of a group of actors improvising Shakespeare \u2013 but he had a caveat. Meggido convincingly adopts Campbell\u2019s nasal inflections as he remembers being told: \u201cThe thing is, it\u2019s got to be better than the original.\u201d The Shakespeare gig led to similar improv shows at the Royal Court and the group began to riff on the dramatic style of Pinter and Sondheim in their performances. Increasingly, Campbell would tell them: \u201cDo it like it\u2019s a musical. That\u2019s a winner.\u201d Meggido, whose parents were musical-theatre actors, already knew the art form inside out. He learned more about the craft of improvisation from Emery, who was combining an unlikely pair of careers: financial journalism and improv comedy. They built up a team called the Showstoppers; today\u2019s company comprises 17 performers including Lucy Trodd and Pippa Evans. Several of them have been members since the early days. The show has been expanded and the formula fine-tuned since their first trip to the Edinburgh fringe. In 2008, they performed in an 89-seat Portakabin at the festival in an 11.30pm slot. It sold out from day one. \u201cWe had no idea why,\u201d says Meggido. \u201cThere were other groups all over the world doing that kind of thing, but I don\u2019t think anyone else was trying to make it a musical in the same way we were.\u201d Meggido and Emery are hopelessly devoted to the art of the show tune: they genuinely want to create a great musical each night, not just pastiche the genre and have some knockabout fun. So they dress like they mean business. \u201cA lot of improv happens in bars and improvisers generally dress very casually,\u201d explains Emery. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in a theatre you want the audience to know this isn\u2019t mucking around.\u201d Meggido adds: \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to look and feel like improv. I wanted it to look and feel like a musical.\u201d For each show, a six-strong squad of Showstoppers wear colour-coded red and black outfits with matching bowling shoes. They are introduced by a sharp-suited character called The Writer (usually played by Emery). The Writer takes a call from a producer named Cameron (one of many winks to the audience) who desperately needs a new musical. The audience must help by supplying a setting, a title and assorted musical styles from which the actors will spin a story. On the night I see them at The Other Palace (for production number 998), we set the show in a funeral parlour (narrowly beating second choice Stonehenge), name it Stiff! and request songs in the key of rock musical Six, Alan Mencken\u2019s The Little Mermaid and Sondheim (\u201ceasy to copy,\u201d deadpans The Writer). Almost instantly, the six Showstoppers have created their characters, are singing choruses, keeping just-about-in-sync for salsa routines and finding satisfying rhymes for \u201cformaldehyde\u201d. Their synergy is staggering and a three-piece band onstage don\u2019t miss a beat either. The Writer interrupts proceedings for us to add suggestions. Emery says it\u2019s a highwire act for the cast and The Writer\u2019s job is to wobble the wire if they ever look too comfortable: \u201cYou put them in a new situation and see what they can do.\u201d As an audience member you can\u2019t help but try to \u201csolve\u201d the show. Are those melodies pre-arranged? Are there stock characters or situations they use? How much has really been pre-prepared? Nothing, says Meggido. \u201cAudiences want to come back to see the \u2018trick\u2019 or find secret signals. But there aren\u2019t any. People think there are set things we fall back on but it\u2019s harder to have something in the back of your mind to fall back on than it is to genuinely improvise the musical. It\u2019s easier just to make it all up.\u201d The Showstoppers, he says, are like a sports team: they train hard, communicate well and \u201cuse their skills in the moment\u201d. In the interval, the audience is encouraged to tweet further suggestions for the second half. I wonder if this is when they map out the rest of the show between them backstage but Meggido says they concentrate on firming up the story from Act I, as it all moves so quickly. (Emery later records the title and synopsis of each show they do in an online archive.) The show uses minimal, multi-purpose props and those red-and-black outfits have been cleverly designed, by Gabriella Slade, to suit a range of musical styles and eras. Emery uses a frock coat as an example: \u201cYou put it on and you could be an American general in the civil war, a doorman at the Dorchester or an 18th-century gentleman.\u201d The Showstoppers empire now includes a 45-minute version for kids. \u201cWe only take suggestions from the children,\u201d explains Meggido. \u201cIt\u2019s just a big game of \u2018what happens next?\u2019 We do whatever the kids say.\u201d Emery says the older children are often very good at making sense of the plot and creating a structure, while the younger ones \u201care more likely to go somewhere fun and exciting. You need both elements to create a really satisfying story. The kids show is probably the most fun we have. We\u2019re basically doing as little improvisation as possible. It\u2019s so liberating and it\u2019s good training because, in the main show, everyone is worried constantly about where the story is going. Is it making sense? Are people emotionally attached to it?\u201d I wonder how stressed they get each night \u2013 for most of us in the audience, singing a song onstage would be bad enough, never mind making up your own lyrics and dance routines. Meggido explains the ethos: \u201cI want us to be a bunch of naive clowns who don\u2019t get how terrifying what they\u2019re doing is.\u201d The key, he says, is \u201cto be completely present and free from tension as much as possible. Anything I\u2019ve done in my life creatively that felt any good, it didn\u2019t feel like I was doing it. It felt like I was a channel for something that was happening \u2026 The more relaxed I am, the more present, it becomes obvious what to do next. The more tense and less connected I am, the more I have to strain. But it\u2019s not necessarily a better or worse result. You can create through relaxation or tension.\u201d One day, they plan to perform a show with all 17 of the Showstoppers on stage for the full chorus-line effect. In the meantime, a handful of them will continue to turn up at the theatre in Victoria each night, arriving without a character\u2019s name, a line of dialogue or a single lyric between them. And then these improv wizards will teach Elphaba a thing or two about defying gravity. Showstopper! The Improvised Musical is at The Other Palace, London, until 16 March 2019",

Holy moly. \u201cWe had to stop working in one part of the country last year,\u201d says Phillips, \u201cbecause there was a \u00a325,000 bounty put on his head. It was believed to be linked to an organised crime group and the relevant authorities were informed.\u201d So Scamp is a wanted \u2026 er \u2026 dog? That\u2019s right. He\u2019s like a modern-day Eliot Ness. If Eliot Ness ate with his face in a bowl and worked for trading standards. They should make a movie about Scamp. Well, he has already starred in Dog Detectives on Quest TV, alongside his partner Yoyo. Is Scamp the charming maverick, while Yoyo does things by the book? I\u2019m not sure. In one episode, Yoyo misses a cache of cigarettes then redeems himself after a period of extra training. Fantastic. And maybe Yoyo\u2019s last partner was killed in a raid on a mislabelling gang? Then, after a rocky start, Scamp earns his grudging respect? That might be a bit of a stretch. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand that they\u2019re doing such a valuable, worthwhile job,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a game to them. All they\u2019re looking for is their toy.\u201d Do say: \u201cThis is just a game to you! Dammit, Scamp, people\u2019s lives are at stake!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cLet\u2019s sniff ass!\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An overlooked note that may have been written by Jane Austen\u2019s great-niece Fanny Caroline Lefroy could put an end to the long-running question mark over an oil painting its owners believe is a depiction of the novelist as a teenager \u2013 a claim that has long been disputed by art experts. Showing a young girl in a flowing white muslin dress with a cap of brown hair and a charming half-smile, the painting is owned by the Rice family, direct descendants of one of Austen\u2019s brothers. The Rices claim it shows Austen herself, and that it was commissioned from the portrait painter Ozias Humphry in 1788, when 12-year-old Jane and her sister Cassandra were taken to visit their great-uncle Francis in Kent. According to the Rices, Humphry\u2019s 1788 accounts, now held at the British Library, list a bill to Francis Austen for 13 guineas.

      "body": "<p>To me, January always smells of marmalade \u2013 the frantic rush <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/seville-orange-marmalade-recipe\" title=\"\">to make as much as possible</a> during the sour Seville orange\u2019s fleeting season, and the herculean effort to finish up last year\u2019s stock in preparation. Not that you need any such excuse to make this deliciously citrussy pudding, as warming and fluffy as a big bobble hat and equally welcome on a cold winter\u2019s evening.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/nov/01/how-to-cook-perfect-syrup-sponge\" title=\"\">syrup sponge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/30/nigel-slater-classic-roly-poly\" title=\"\">jam roly-poly</a>, marmalade pudding belongs to a category often rather dismissively referred to as \u201cnursery puddings\u201d, a term that carries an offputting whiff of the Rees-Mogg. Whether or not you grew up with them, such dishes are our finest culinary hour \u2013 I would say export, except we don\u2019t really. Perhaps you have to live in the UK\u2019s peculiarly damp, grey climate to truly appreciate them; as historian Dr Annie Gray writes in the foreword to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pride-and-pudding.html\" title=\"\">Regula Ysewjin\u2019s glorious survey Pride and Pudding</a>, \u201cpudding and Britishness are inexplicably linked\u201d. Stodgy and sweet, comforting and solid \u2013 whatever happens this year, at least we\u2019ll always have pudding.</p> <h2>The form</h2> <p>Even leaving aside the modern usage as a synonym for dessert, puddings are a remarkably wide class of foodstuffs. Ysewijn lists no fewer than six categories in her introduction, from haggis to jelly, and recipes for marmalade pudding show a similar diversity of form. <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/185/185687/arabella-boxer-s-book-of-english-food/9781905490998.html\" title=\"\">Arabella Boxer\u2019s Book of English Food</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/28/joyce-molyneux-female-chef-michelin\" title=\"\">Joyce Molyneux</a>\u2019s The Carved Angel Cookery Book and Shirley Spear of Skye\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.threechimneys.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Three Chimneys restaurant</a> all go for the traditional steamed version, with Molyneux making it in roly-poly form. I\u2019m unable to find a hinged pudding sleeve of the size Molyneux recommends, which makes me doubly sad: first, because I can\u2019t try her recipe, and, second, because there seems to be no demand for such things. Whither the roly-polys of yesteryear?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"52aeb86e23dd26da16276b4ab3e9b8e458f76037\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52aeb86e23dd26da16276b4ab3e9b8e458f76037/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigella Lawson's baked marmalade sponge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigella Lawson\u2019s \u2018fluffy and buttery\u2019 baked marmalade sponge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moving on swiftly, <a href=\"https://www.nigella.com/recipes/marmalade-pudding-cake\" title=\"\">Nigella Lawson makes a baked sponge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rivercottage.net/recipes/marmalade-pudding\" title=\"\">Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall a kind of creamy flan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/clarissa-dickson-wright\" title=\"\">Clarissa Dickson Wright</a> a batter pudding she attributes to her Aberdonian grandmother \u2013 \u201cScotland is, as you probably know, the home of marmalade as we know it\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14371152.england-strips-scotland-of-title-as-land-which-invented-marmalade/\" title=\"\">a controversial claim</a> I\u2019ll step hastily away from).</p> <p>All are, of course, very different beasts, and delicious in their own right, though the unfortunate combination of vagueness about cooking vessels and precision about cooking times leads to a bit of a disaster involving liquid batter in Dickson Wright\u2019s case. The cooked edge I try, as I scrape it sadly into the bin, is pleasant enough, though, like all decent egg-heavy batters, undeniably stodgy. Lawson\u2019s is far more successful. Fluffy and buttery, it\u2019s simplicity itself to make, especially if you happen to have a food processor and, unlike Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s luxuriously rich version, works well with custard \u2013 a must, as far as I\u2019m concerned.</p> <p>Most popular of all, however, particularly among those who didn\u2019t have to tend them for two hours, are the steamed puddings, which have a pleasingly open texture that forestalls any accusations of heaviness, and the kind of moist, sticky texture you just don\u2019t get in the oven. Though they take longer to cook, they\u2019re generally quicker to prepare, and, really, topping up a saucepan with boiling water every 30 minutes is hardly the most onerous of tasks.</p> <h2>The structure</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a276f1d3e28a378140406f0f07da71212de324cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a276f1d3e28a378140406f0f07da71212de324cb/0_187_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shirley Spear's steamed marmalade sponge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shirley Spear\u2019s version uses brown breadcrumbs, which give a better flavour and colour than white.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the recipes I try make use of stale breadcrumbs, much like a treacle tart. Spear mixes them with a little wholemeal self-raising flour, while Fearnley-Whittingstall and Boxer rely on crumbs alone. Lawson\u2019s straightforward sponge recipe uses just flour, as does Dixon-Wright\u2019s batter. Although it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/nov/01/how-to-cook-perfect-syrup-sponge\" title=\"\">perfectly possible to make a steamed sponge</a> rather than a baked one, we all agree that we rather like the slightly drier, chewier texture that the crumbs bring to the party, but a little flour is very helpful as a binder, especially if your homemade breadcrumbs aren\u2019t quite as fine as the commercial variety (ahem). White bread is fine, of course, but Spear\u2019s brown gives a better flavour and, more noticeably, colour \u2013 and if you use a seeded loaf, as I did in extremis, a more interesting consistency, too. In fact, the odd crunch proves such a hit with testers that I\u2019m moved to add a handful of coarse oatmeal for your textural pleasure.</p> <h2>The fat</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0f5ca223246d73ecc90631e47d577aec12d513b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f5ca223246d73ecc90631e47d577aec12d513b9/0_311_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall marmalade sponge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s \u2018luxuriously rich\u2019 sponge is more like a \u2018creamy flan\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boxer uses suet, Spear and Lawson butter, and Fearnley-Whittingstall double cream and egg yolks to enrich the mixture. Double cream, so rarely a bad idea, dulls the sharp flavour of the citrus; and, much as I like the airy texture suet provides, here the combination of butter and marmalade feels too good to miss.</p> <h2>The raising agents</h2> <p>Only Boxer makes no attempt to lighten the load with raising agents. Lawson and Spear use baking powder and bicarbonate of soda, while Dickson Wright and Fearnley-Whittingstall both fold beaten egg whites into their batters. As Lawson and Spear\u2019s puddings are the runaway favourites here, I\u2019m going with the belt-and-braces approach and sticking in both baking powder and bicarb.</p> <h2>The sweetness</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"188ea18108d58aec2377cf5a3fa5b8b86eb1e6f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/188ea18108d58aec2377cf5a3fa5b8b86eb1e6f3/0_249_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarissa Dickson Wright\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clarissa Dickson Wright\u2019s take: a batter pudding she attributes to her Aberdonian grandmother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, choose your marmalade. Lawson knows whereof she writes: \u201cI love the bitter edge of a thick-shred, dark marmalade and so tend to go for a proper, glamorously auburn, tawny one.\u201d Indeed, I\u2019m accused of having forgotten to add it to the one recipe I try with shredless golden marmalade. Spear reckons that \u201chomemade is always the best\u201d, but then she\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.scotsmagazine.com/articles/toasting-the-three-chimneys-marmalade-bible/\" title=\"\">written a whole book on the subject</a>. There are many <a href=\"https://www.dalemain.com/winners-2018-marmalade-awards-announced/\" title=\"\">excellent commercially produced marmalades out there</a>, and you might not want to use up so much of your hard-won stash on one pudding, so go with whatever you happen to prefer, though make sure it has at least some peel in it, to give both flavour and texture. (If you don\u2019t like peel, this is probably not the pudding for you.)</p> <p>One might imagine that, much like treacle sponge, the marmalade simply sits on top of the pudding, as in Dickson Wright\u2019s version, but, in fact, it\u2019s more common to incorporate it into the batter. As Spear notes apropos of hers: \u201cIt is not, as some people imagine, a stodgy suet pudding with a dollop of marmalade at the bottom of the basin. The marmalade is combined throughout, giving the dessert a rich, amber colour.\u201d I miss the jammy, caramelised top, though, so, while I\u2019ve based my recipe on her excellent one, I\u2019m going to have my cake and eat it by adding a big spoonful of marmalade to the basin, too.</p> <p>Unless you are very spartan of taste, you\u2019ll also need some other sort of sweetener. Caster sugar is the most common choice, but I like the darker, caramelised flavour of Boxer and Spear\u2019s light muscovado, which works brilliantly with the marmalade.</p> <h2>Flavourings and sauces</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"595f84aab47f0132c9f17a21026f87db5af1a261\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/595f84aab47f0132c9f17a21026f87db5af1a261/0_89_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arabella Boxer's steamed marmalade sponge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arabella Boxer pairs her steamed pudding with a rich sauce made up of cream, marmalade and orange juice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dickson Wright adds ginger to her batter; a little spice is an excellent idea in a winter pudding. Sadly, none of us can taste the warming whisky in Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s batter, while a grating of citrus zest is another nice optional extra.</p> <p>Boxer, Spear and Dickson Wright all make sauces to pair with their puddings: Boxer a rich mixture of cream, marmalade and orange juice; Spear a Drambuie egg custard; and Dickson Wright a tangy orange and lemon juice number. All of which are very nice indeed. But, I must confess, I cannot be entirely objective here: puddings deserve custard. Plain custard, preferably cornflour-based custard to slip thickly over the fluffy batter rather than sinking in. Ice-cream or double cream are acceptable alternatives, at a push. All complaints should be addressed below.</p> <h2>Perfect marmalade pudding</h2> <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>2 hr</strong><br>Serves <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>120g butter</strong>, plus extra for greasing<br><strong>150g coarse-cut marmalade </strong><br><strong>150g fresh fine brown breadcrumbs </strong>(ie not dried, though stale is fine)<br><strong>25g coarse oatmeal </strong>(optional)<br><strong>25g wholemeal self-raising flour</strong><br><strong>120g light muscovado sugar</strong><br><strong>1 tsp ground ginger</strong> <br><strong>\u00bc tsp fine salt</strong><br><strong>3 large eggs</strong>, beaten<br><strong>Zest of 1 orange</strong><br><strong>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</strong></p> <p>Melt the butter and 120g of the marmalade in a pan, stirring to break it up.

      "bodyText": "To me, January always smells of marmalade \u2013 the frantic rush to make as much as possible during the sour Seville orange\u2019s fleeting season, and the herculean effort to finish up last year\u2019s stock in preparation. Not that you need any such excuse to make this deliciously citrussy pudding, as warming and fluffy as a big bobble hat and equally welcome on a cold winter\u2019s evening. Like syrup sponge and jam roly-poly, marmalade pudding belongs to a category often rather dismissively referred to as \u201cnursery puddings\u201d, a term that carries an offputting whiff of the Rees-Mogg. Whether or not you grew up with them, such dishes are our finest culinary hour \u2013 I would say export, except we don\u2019t really. Perhaps you have to live in the UK\u2019s peculiarly damp, grey climate to truly appreciate them; as historian Dr Annie Gray writes in the foreword to Regula Ysewjin\u2019s glorious survey Pride and Pudding, \u201cpudding and Britishness are inexplicably linked\u201d. Stodgy and sweet, comforting and solid \u2013 whatever happens this year, at least we\u2019ll always have pudding. The form Even leaving aside the modern usage as a synonym for dessert, puddings are a remarkably wide class of foodstuffs. Ysewijn lists no fewer than six categories in her introduction, from haggis to jelly, and recipes for marmalade pudding show a similar diversity of form. Arabella Boxer\u2019s Book of English Food, Joyce Molyneux\u2019s The Carved Angel Cookery Book and Shirley Spear of Skye\u2019s Three Chimneys restaurant all go for the traditional steamed version, with Molyneux making it in roly-poly form. I\u2019m unable to find a hinged pudding sleeve of the size Molyneux recommends, which makes me doubly sad: first, because I can\u2019t try her recipe, and, second, because there seems to be no demand for such things. Whither the roly-polys of yesteryear? Moving on swiftly, Nigella Lawson makes a baked sponge, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall a kind of creamy flan and Clarissa Dickson Wright a batter pudding she attributes to her Aberdonian grandmother \u2013 \u201cScotland is, as you probably know, the home of marmalade as we know it\u201d (a controversial claim I\u2019ll step hastily away from). All are, of course, very different beasts, and delicious in their own right, though the unfortunate combination of vagueness about cooking vessels and precision about cooking times leads to a bit of a disaster involving liquid batter in Dickson Wright\u2019s case. The cooked edge I try, as I scrape it sadly into the bin, is pleasant enough, though, like all decent egg-heavy batters, undeniably stodgy. Lawson\u2019s is far more successful. Fluffy and buttery, it\u2019s simplicity itself to make, especially if you happen to have a food processor and, unlike Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s luxuriously rich version, works well with custard \u2013 a must, as far as I\u2019m concerned. Most popular of all, however, particularly among those who didn\u2019t have to tend them for two hours, are the steamed puddings, which have a pleasingly open texture that forestalls any accusations of heaviness, and the kind of moist, sticky texture you just don\u2019t get in the oven. Though they take longer to cook, they\u2019re generally quicker to prepare, and, really, topping up a saucepan with boiling water every 30 minutes is hardly the most onerous of tasks. The structure Many of the recipes I try make use of stale breadcrumbs, much like a treacle tart. Spear mixes them with a little wholemeal self-raising flour, while Fearnley-Whittingstall and Boxer rely on crumbs alone. Lawson\u2019s straightforward sponge recipe uses just flour, as does Dixon-Wright\u2019s batter. Although it\u2019s perfectly possible to make a steamed sponge rather than a baked one, we all agree that we rather like the slightly drier, chewier texture that the crumbs bring to the party, but a little flour is very helpful as a binder, especially if your homemade breadcrumbs aren\u2019t quite as fine as the commercial variety (ahem). White bread is fine, of course, but Spear\u2019s brown gives a better flavour and, more noticeably, colour \u2013 and if you use a seeded loaf, as I did in extremis, a more interesting consistency, too. In fact, the odd crunch proves such a hit with testers that I\u2019m moved to add a handful of coarse oatmeal for your textural pleasure. The fat Boxer uses suet, Spear and Lawson butter, and Fearnley-Whittingstall double cream and egg yolks to enrich the mixture. Double cream, so rarely a bad idea, dulls the sharp flavour of the citrus; and, much as I like the airy texture suet provides, here the combination of butter and marmalade feels too good to miss. The raising agents Only Boxer makes no attempt to lighten the load with raising agents. Lawson and Spear use baking powder and bicarbonate of soda, while Dickson Wright and Fearnley-Whittingstall both fold beaten egg whites into their batters. As Lawson and Spear\u2019s puddings are the runaway favourites here, I\u2019m going with the belt-and-braces approach and sticking in both baking powder and bicarb. The sweetness First, choose your marmalade. Lawson knows whereof she writes: \u201cI love the bitter edge of a thick-shred, dark marmalade and so tend to go for a proper, glamorously auburn, tawny one.\u201d Indeed, I\u2019m accused of having forgotten to add it to the one recipe I try with shredless golden marmalade. Spear reckons that \u201chomemade is always the best\u201d, but then she\u2019s written a whole book on the subject. There are many excellent commercially produced marmalades out there, and you might not want to use up so much of your hard-won stash on one pudding, so go with whatever you happen to prefer, though make sure it has at least some peel in it, to give both flavour and texture. (If you don\u2019t like peel, this is probably not the pudding for you.) One might imagine that, much like treacle sponge, the marmalade simply sits on top of the pudding, as in Dickson Wright\u2019s version, but, in fact, it\u2019s more common to incorporate it into the batter. As Spear notes apropos of hers: \u201cIt is not, as some people imagine, a stodgy suet pudding with a dollop of marmalade at the bottom of the basin. The marmalade is combined throughout, giving the dessert a rich, amber colour.\u201d I miss the jammy, caramelised top, though, so, while I\u2019ve based my recipe on her excellent one, I\u2019m going to have my cake and eat it by adding a big spoonful of marmalade to the basin, too. Unless you are very spartan of taste, you\u2019ll also need some other sort of sweetener. Caster sugar is the most common choice, but I like the darker, caramelised flavour of Boxer and Spear\u2019s light muscovado, which works brilliantly with the marmalade. Flavourings and sauces Dickson Wright adds ginger to her batter; a little spice is an excellent idea in a winter pudding. Sadly, none of us can taste the warming whisky in Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s batter, while a grating of citrus zest is another nice optional extra. Boxer, Spear and Dickson Wright all make sauces to pair with their puddings: Boxer a rich mixture of cream, marmalade and orange juice; Spear a Drambuie egg custard; and Dickson Wright a tangy orange and lemon juice number. All of which are very nice indeed. But, I must confess, I cannot be entirely objective here: puddings deserve custard. Plain custard, preferably cornflour-based custard to slip thickly over the fluffy batter rather than sinking in. Ice-cream or double cream are acceptable alternatives, at a push. All complaints should be addressed below. Perfect marmalade pudding Prep 10 min Cook 2 hr Serves 6 120g butter, plus extra for greasing 150g coarse-cut marmalade 150g fresh fine brown breadcrumbs (ie not dried, though stale is fine) 25g coarse oatmeal (optional) 25g wholemeal self-raising flour 120g light muscovado sugar 1 tsp ground ginger \u00bc tsp fine salt 3 large eggs, beaten Zest of 1 orange 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda Melt the butter and 120g of the marmalade in a pan, stirring to break it up. Set aside. Butter a two-pint pudding basin. Put the breadcrumbs, oatmeal, flour, sugar, ginger and salt into a large bowl and stir together. Add the eggs and the orange zest, then stir in the melted buttery marmalade mix. Dissolve the bicarbonate of soda in a tablespoon of cold water and stir into the batter. Spoon the remaining 30g of marmalade into the bottom of the basin, then pour in the batter. Cover tightly, either with a lid or a pleated piece of greaseproof paper and the same of foil, secured with a string handle (this video may help if this is your first time making a steamed pudding; the important thing is that it\u2019s steam-tight). Put the basin in a steamer (or a saucepan with a lid), and fill with boiling water to about halfway up the basin. Steam on low heat for about two hours, topping up with boiling water as necessary. Lift out the pudding basin, leave to sit for five minutes, then remove the lid and turn out on to a serving dish. Don\u2019t worry if some of the marmalade topping sticks to the basin \u2013 just spoon it back on top. Serve immediately, or leave to cool and reheat in a microwave or the steamer. Serve with custard, ice-cream or cream. \u2022 Is this pudding the best use of marmalade outside hot-buttered toast, or do you have other dishes up your sleeve? And does anyone know what\u2019s happened to roly-poly tins?",

Nearly 450 student union officers and staff \u2013 from caretakers to academic staff and the vice-chancellor \u2013 have been trained in how to recognise and act on early warning signs. \u201cIt\u2019s not helpful just to tell students to go and seek help,\u201d says Dickens. \u201cIf someone is in obvious emotional pain, then literally a few minutes of your time could save them. You haven\u2019t got to sit there for three hours \u2013 that\u2019s not your job. But we must respond with compassion.\u201d How to look after yourself As a postgraduate, you will have many demands on your time. But if you don\u2019t stay healthy, or work too long on autopilot, you might lose attention to detail, miss opportunities and burn out personally and professionally. If the world around you is not going to slow down, says psychologist Dr Audrey Tang, who wrote The Leader\u2019s Guide to Mindfulness, you\u2019ll need to find a way to manage. Looking after yourself, she says, is not unnecessary or indulgent: if you\u2019re physically, emotionally and mentally healthy, you\u2019ll perform better for yourself and others. Set \u201coffice hours\u201d and don\u2019t engage in work-related matters after a certain time (as much as teaching requirements allow). Fresh air and time away from your work always does you good. A daily walk \u2013 maybe with a friend or family \u2013 will re-energise you. Yoga, tai chi and other relaxation therapies can clear the mind. Just 30 minutes exercise three times a week has been proved to lift mood. Make sure you take a proper lunch break \u2013 that means physically stepping away from where you\u2019re working. Break down tasks \u2013 completing achievable goals will give you a sense of satisfaction. Identify mood patterns and try to plan your day to suit these. Go to social and wellbeing events on offer. \u201cAttend any extra seminars, lectures and events in your field \u2013 you can build common ground. It\u2019s a boost for academic and pastoral wellbeing,\u201d says former postgraduate Philippa Bunch. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out and ask for help, companionship or just a chat. If you feel lonely or anxious in new social situations, take it slowly \u2013 or try a class where you can immerse yourself in the activity, rather than focus on needing to speak to people straight away. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org. You can contact the mental health charity Mind by calling 0300 123 3393, or by visiting mind.org.uk",

      "bodyText": "The Nobel prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa has resigned as emeritus president of Pen International after the writers\u2019 freedom of expression group called for the release of two jailed Catalan civil society leaders and claimed Catalans been persecuted \u201cin a way not seen since the Franco dictatorship\u201d. Jordi Cuixart, the president of \u00d2mnium Cultural, and Jordi S\u00e0nchez, former president of the powerful grassroots group the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), have been in pre-trial detention since October 2017. Both men have been charged with sedition and rebellion over their alleged roles in orchestrating pro-independence protests in September 2017, during which police officers were trapped inside a Barcelona building and their vehicles destroyed. Jennifer Clement, the president of Pen International, described the charges as \u201cclearly excessive\u201d and said they ought to be dropped. In a joint statement released on Monday, Pen International and the group\u2019s regional branch, Pen Catal\u00e0, said: \u201cIn light of our commitment to defending the right to freedom of expression, we call on the Spanish authorities to drop the charges against S\u00e0nchez and Cuixart and to release them immediately. \u201cBeyond having expressed their ideas peacefully, they have also ensured, from the organisations over which they preside, the free circulation of the ideas of writers in Catalonia.\u201d The statement was also signed by the Irish writer Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, the Angolan writer Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa, and PEN chapters in countries including Mexico and Argentina. The calls drew a furious response from Vargas Llosa, who was born in Peru but holds Spanish citizenship and has been an outspoken critic of the Catalan independence movement. In a letter to Clement published in El Pa\u00eds on Tuesday, the author said the joint statement had been \u201cfull of lies and slanders\u201d against Spain\u2019s democratic government. Vargas Llosa also described the October 2017 unilateral independence referendum \u2013 held unilaterally and in defiance of the Spanish government and constitution \u2013 as \u201can attempted coup\u201d by pro-independence Catalans. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that an organisation like Pen International, which possesses such clean credentials when it comes to defending human rights and freedom of expression, should buy into the fairytales of the Catalan Pen, which is a militant organ of the Catalan independence movement, which has been rolling out an international campaign to distort the truth and which, judging by your statement, has managed to catch out many Pen groups, among them some Latin American ones, by presenting Spain as a country that crushes freedom of expression and locks up critical and dissident writers.\u201d Twelve former Catalan leaders are due to stand trial at Spain\u2019s supreme court over the coming weeks charged with rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds relating to the failed referendum and subsequent unilateral declaration of independence.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Top story: Two duelling bills to face Senate vote on Thursday The US Senate will vote on two bills designed to end the partial government shutdown on Thursday. A Republican-backed measure would include the $5.7bn in funding for a southern border wall demanded by Donald Trump, while a bill brought by Democrats would extend funding for government agencies until 8 February to allow further time for negotiations. Whether either bill can pass remains to be seen, but their introduction marks the first sign of legislative movement amid the shutdown, now in its 33rd day. Vote numbers. Democrats probably have enough votes to block any proposal that funds Trump\u2019s wall, and they would need at least 13 Republicans to back their bill to reach the necessary 60-vote threshold. So neither bill seems likely to pass. Deadly business: free-market groups help tobacco industry A Guardian investigation has revealed that more than 100 free-market thinktanks on several continents are supporting cigarette manufacturers by taking favourable positions against tobacco control policies or accepting donations from the tobacco industry. Major firms including Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco have made donations, while leading US thinktanks such as the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute are among those in the Guardian\u2019s database who have accepted them and gone on to comment on tobacco policy. Cancer links. One Africa-based thinktank questioned whether the link between cancer and smoking \u201cwas yet to be empirically established\u201d before walking the claim back. Malaysia deaths. An influential thinktank helped quash a World Health Organization recommendation to increase cigarette taxes in Malaysia, where smoking kills more than 27,200 people every year. Florida governor\u2019s green credentials tested by water battle Ron DeSantis, the new Republican governor of Florida, is facing the first challenge to his fresh environmental approach after trying to wrest control of state water policy from industry interests, in stark contrast to his predecessor, Rick Scott. DeSantis has demanded the mass resignation of Scott\u2019s water management team, after they refused to delay a lease extension for a sugar corporation on land in the Everglades wetlands, which DeSantis wants earmarked for a clean-water storage reservoir. Green governor. DeSantis recently unveiled a $2.5bn environmental package, partly in response to the \u201cred tide\u201d of toxic algae that afflicted Florida in 2018, and which DeSantis said had \u201cdevastated our local economies and threatened the health of our communities\u201d. Bolsonaro proclaims end of \u2018Bolivarian\u2019 left in Davos debut Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has declared the demise of South America\u2019s \u201cBolivarian\u201d left in his first appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, insisting the region is entering an era of uncorrupted governance under conservative leadership such as his. But his international debut was eclipsed by domestic scandal as his son Fl\u00e1vio, a recently elected senator, was linked to a violent organised crime group in Rio de Janeiro in a report by one of the country\u2019s leading newspapers. Rainforest road. Bolsonaro\u2019s government has announced plans to privatise and pave the Trans-Amazonian Highway, a route that is widely blamed for extensive deforestation in the Amazon. Crib sheet Mike Pence has issued a video message in support of anti-government protesters in Venezuela, after a wave of unrest in Caracas piled further pressure on the country\u2019s embattled president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. A state judge has struck down Iowa\u2019s \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d abortion law, declaring it unconstitutional. The most restrictive such law in the US would have banned abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Trump has defended a group of Maga-hat-wearing schoolboys filmed in a face-off with native American activists, describing the students from Covington Catholic high school in Kentucky as \u201csymbols of fake news\u201d. The deaths of two Saudi Arabian sisters, found taped together and washed up on a New York City waterfront last October, have been ruled a double suicide. Listen to Today in Focus: Delhi\u2019s deadly air India\u2019s capital, Delhi, suffers from some of the world\u2019s worst air pollution. The Guardian\u2019s south Asia correspondent, Michael Safi, takes a ride with one of the city\u2019s rickshaw drivers, who says the deadly air is damaging both his health and his livelihood. Must-reads The Oscarbait films that failed in 2019 Roma and The Favourite deservedly lead the Oscar field with 10 nominations apiece, writes Peter Bradshaw, but the Academy overlooked several great films by female directors. Meanwhile Benjamin Lee rounds up the awards prospects that failed to convert buzz into votes. Resistance and activism reawaken in the Trump era In the two years since Trump\u2019s inauguration, millions of Americans have been motivated to march, strike and otherwise protest against his presidency as part of movements such as Black Lives Matter and the Women\u2019s March, as Amanda Holpuch reports. How selfie dysmorphia is driving people to seek surgery The cosmetic doctor Tijion Esho coined the term \u201cSnapchat dysmorphia\u201d when he noticed his patients were asking to alter their features to more closely resemble their filtered selfies IRL. Elle Hunt investigates a digital phenomenon made flesh. What one cleaner saw in America\u2019s homes A single parent stuck in a series of low-wage jobs, Stephanie Land finally found regular work cleaning the homes of the better-off. As she publishes a book about what she saw \u2013 including porn, opioids and a freezer full of cigarettes \u2013 she tells Sian Cain what she learned from America\u2019s dirty laundry. Opinion The Davos elite are terrified by the speed at which the world order they created is crumbling, writes Aditya Chakrabortty.

      "bodyText": "The son of James Gandolfini is to take on the late actor\u2019s most recognisable role, by playing Tony Soprano in the film prequel to acclaimed series The Sopranos. Michael Gandolfini, 19, will appear as a younger version of the New Jersey mob boss in The Many Saints of Newark. The film, which is currently in pre-production, is set in 1967 and recalls the race riots between Italian- and African-Americans in the city. In a statement Michael Gandolfini said, \u201cit\u2019s a profound honour to continue my dad\u2019s legacy while stepping into the shoes of a young Tony Soprano. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that I am going to have the opportunity to work with David Chase and the incredible company of talent he has assembled for The Many Saints of Newark.\u201d James Gandolfini, who died of a heart attack in 2013 aged 51, found fame and critical acclaim with his portrait of Tony Soprano, a violent mobster who seeks help from a therapist after suffering panic attacks. In total the actor received three Emmy awards and a Golden Globe for his performance in the series, which aired from 1999 to 2007. Currently without a release date, The Many Saints of Newark is written by Sopranos creator David Chase and will centre on the character of Dickie Moltisanti, father to series regular Christopher Moltisanti, as he mentors Tony. Vera Farmiga, Alessandro Nivola and Jon Bernthal are among the actors cast in the film, which will be directed by Alan Taylor, who directed multiple episodes of the original series. Michael Gandolfini is currently appearing in David Simon\u2019s HBO series The Deuce and had a minor role in 2018 heist movie Ocean\u2019s 8.",

To witness when someone is with you, fully alive, and the next minute no longer exists is beyond mystery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/22/funerals-personal-coffin-colours\">Funerals should be personal, but new coffin colours aren\u2019t the answer | Louise Winter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How terrible, then, when the world in all its practicality, its routines of order and procedure intrudes upon that precious moment. And yet that is what happens after as many as half of deaths happening in this country. It is the law of the land that an \u201cunexplained\u201d death must be referred to the coroner. In making a programme for the BBC Radio 4 series <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09kgksn\" title=\"\">We Need to Talk About Death</a>, we have found how coroners, inquests and postmortems can arrive in the lives of the recently bereaved. </p> <p>Before a death certificate can be issued, four questions must be answered: who, when, where and how. The same degree of scrutiny that is ascribed to public acts of violence must be applied to domestic deaths in intimate family settings. </p> <p>We encountered several stories in making our programme. Bridget\u2019s mother, 92-year-old Mel, was not feeling well one evening. Bridget tried to get her to bed but found she couldn\u2019t lift her. Mel collapsed on the bathroom floor so Bridget called an ambulance. Paramedics confirmed that Mel had died and that the death would have to be referred to the coroner. In practice that meant Mel\u2019s body had to remain under continuous supervision, lying there on the bathroom floor. Police arrived later that night and stayed until the body was collected by the undertaker next day. Bridget felt like a suspect, but she also missed those final intimate moments to say goodbye to her mother.</p> <p>The same happened to Caroline. Her husband, Robin, had had heart trouble for many years and been in and out of hospital. On a morning visit their GP decided Robin should again go to hospital and called an ambulance. The couple were both Catholics and Caroline called ahead to make sure a priest was at the hospital. Soon after Caroline arrived, a nurse explained that Robin had died. The priest administered the last rites. Then to Caroline\u2019s surprise and horror two policemen burst into the room where Robin lay and ordered her to \u201cstand away from the body\u201d, one of them adding, \u201cYou are disturbing forensic evidence.\u201d As a Catholic, Caroline believes that while the body is still warm the soul is still present and that her tender leave-taking of Robin\u2019s presence was brutally disrupted. Worse, she even felt she was being implicated in his death. Even now, two years later, she is haunted by these unhappy final memories.</p> <p>How many people are affected by such procedures? The chief coroner of England and Wales, Mark Lucraft QC, explained to us that of <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregistrationsummarytables/2017\" title=\"\">533,000 deaths</a> in 2017, 229,700 were referred to a coroner. About 30% of such referrals go to postmortem: an opening up of the body familiar to viewers of television dramas about forensics. This is only done when the coroner has failed to establish a clear cause of death \u2013 for the bereaved, such matters can be very traumatic.</p> <p>Some alternatives are emerging: in Leicester, for example, there is a cadre of medical examiners who can be called in on the spot to verify the cause of death. A recent, small-scale development is the use of scanning to trace the cause of death without procedures as invasive as a postmortem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/04/i-feel-my-mothers-absence-everywhere\">I feel my mother\u2019s absence everywhere | Gemma Carey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of more personal comfort is the establishment of the <a href=\"https://coronerscourtssupportservice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Coroners\u2019 Courts Support Service</a>, an organisation of trained volunteers who are there to give comfort and information to families attending an inquest. As is often the case, such an organisation has sprung from the initiative of an individual who herself went through a bad experience. Roey Burden went to the inquest of her cousin\u2019s son, David, who had died in a traffic accident abroad. Roey was appalled by how chaotic and impersonal it was. So she set about creating a network of people now trained and available at coroners\u2019 courts to explain and comfort those who don\u2019t know what to expect and feel pushed around by the officials.</p> <p>Not everyone knows about all this, but these are among the many ways in which we need to expand how we talk about death.</p> <p>\u2022 Joan Bakewell is a broadcaster, writer and Labour peer.

      "bodyText": "The experience of bereavement is one of the most intense that life has to offer. To be present when someone dies is to be consumed by thoughts of love, loss, sadness and even a degree of wonder. To witness when someone is with you, fully alive, and the next minute no longer exists is beyond mystery. How terrible, then, when the world in all its practicality, its routines of order and procedure intrudes upon that precious moment. And yet that is what happens after as many as half of deaths happening in this country. It is the law of the land that an \u201cunexplained\u201d death must be referred to the coroner. In making a programme for the BBC Radio 4 series We Need to Talk About Death, we have found how coroners, inquests and postmortems can arrive in the lives of the recently bereaved. Before a death certificate can be issued, four questions must be answered: who, when, where and how. The same degree of scrutiny that is ascribed to public acts of violence must be applied to domestic deaths in intimate family settings. We encountered several stories in making our programme. Bridget\u2019s mother, 92-year-old Mel, was not feeling well one evening. Bridget tried to get her to bed but found she couldn\u2019t lift her. Mel collapsed on the bathroom floor so Bridget called an ambulance. Paramedics confirmed that Mel had died and that the death would have to be referred to the coroner. In practice that meant Mel\u2019s body had to remain under continuous supervision, lying there on the bathroom floor. Police arrived later that night and stayed until the body was collected by the undertaker next day. Bridget felt like a suspect, but she also missed those final intimate moments to say goodbye to her mother. The same happened to Caroline. Her husband, Robin, had had heart trouble for many years and been in and out of hospital. On a morning visit their GP decided Robin should again go to hospital and called an ambulance. The couple were both Catholics and Caroline called ahead to make sure a priest was at the hospital. Soon after Caroline arrived, a nurse explained that Robin had died. The priest administered the last rites. Then to Caroline\u2019s surprise and horror two policemen burst into the room where Robin lay and ordered her to \u201cstand away from the body\u201d, one of them adding, \u201cYou are disturbing forensic evidence.\u201d As a Catholic, Caroline believes that while the body is still warm the soul is still present and that her tender leave-taking of Robin\u2019s presence was brutally disrupted. Worse, she even felt she was being implicated in his death. Even now, two years later, she is haunted by these unhappy final memories. How many people are affected by such procedures? The chief coroner of England and Wales, Mark Lucraft QC, explained to us that of 533,000 deaths in 2017, 229,700 were referred to a coroner. About 30% of such referrals go to postmortem: an opening up of the body familiar to viewers of television dramas about forensics. This is only done when the coroner has failed to establish a clear cause of death \u2013 for the bereaved, such matters can be very traumatic. Some alternatives are emerging: in Leicester, for example, there is a cadre of medical examiners who can be called in on the spot to verify the cause of death. A recent, small-scale development is the use of scanning to trace the cause of death without procedures as invasive as a postmortem. Of more personal comfort is the establishment of the Coroners\u2019 Courts Support Service, an organisation of trained volunteers who are there to give comfort and information to families attending an inquest. As is often the case, such an organisation has sprung from the initiative of an individual who herself went through a bad experience. Roey Burden went to the inquest of her cousin\u2019s son, David, who had died in a traffic accident abroad. Roey was appalled by how chaotic and impersonal it was. So she set about creating a network of people now trained and available at coroners\u2019 courts to explain and comfort those who don\u2019t know what to expect and feel pushed around by the officials. Not everyone knows about all this, but these are among the many ways in which we need to expand how we talk about death. \u2022 Joan Bakewell is a broadcaster, writer and Labour peer.

      "bodyText": "A Belarusian \u201csex trainer\u201d who had claimed she could prove a Russian oligarch\u2019s ties to the Trump campaign has been released from a Moscow jail, amid speculation that she may have cut a deal for her freedom. Anastasia Vashukevich, the escort and model who also calls herself Nastya Rybka, became an unlikely figure in the sprawling \u201cRussiagate\u201d saga after she offered to trade information about collusion with Russia in the 2016 US presidential elections for asylum in the United States. Before returning to Moscow last week, she had been held for nearly a year in a Thai prison for holding a sex workshop deemed illegal by the local authorities. She was deported from Thailand on Thursday after pleading guilty and was detained by Russian authorities \u201con suspicion of enticement to prostitution\u201d when her flight arrived in Moscow. In interviews to US media last year, she had claimed to have hours of audio recordings aboard a yacht with metals magnate Oleg Deripaska and claimed she could show that he met with three Americans in 2016 who said they had \u201ca plan for the election\u201d. Whether she ever had any real evidence remains unclear, and she now denies it. But a 2016 Instagram video she published aboard a yacht with Deripaska and a deputy prime minister of Russia touted Vashukevich as a possible font of information about the activities of powerful Russians before the US elections. Vashukevich, who has not spoken with the press since her sudden release from a Moscow jail on Tuesday and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment, is expected to make public remarks in Moscow on Wednesday. While she remains a suspect in a case for \u201centicement to prostitution\u201d in Russia, she has not been charged and her release on Tuesday means she is free from prison for the first time in nearly a year. The revelations about Vashukevich\u2019s proximity to Deripaska led to a year-long odyssey, which may finally be drawing to a close. After her video onboard Deripaska\u2019s yacht was publicised by a Russian opposition leader last February, Vashukevich and several friends were arrested in Thailand for running an illegal \u201csex training seminar\u201d. After 11 months in prison, she pleaded guilty and was deported back to Belarus via Russia on Friday. A video of the arrest at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport showed officials tossing Vashukevich into a wheelchair, prompting some outrage and concerns that she would be targeted for retribution for her public remarks against Deripaska and the Russian government. In a court appearance on Saturday, Vashukevich offered a truce. She said she would \u201cno longer compromise\u201d Deripaska and that he could \u201crelax\u201d. \u201cReally, I\u2019ve had enough,\u201d she said. Tuesday\u2019s sudden release after four days behind bars indicated that Vashukevich\u2019s troubles could be coming to an end, in a case that friends say was political from the very beginning. She was detained in Moscow with three others, including Alexander Kirillov, a self-described \u201csex guru\u201d who was leading the Thai seminar. \u201cIt was a political case [in Thailand], that was obvious, and clearly paid for by somebody,\u201d said Kristina Sheremetyeva, Kirillov\u2019s partner, in an interview. \u201cWe received threats from people who were tying themselves to some big names,\u201d she said, but said that those threats had not come from Deripaska. She was also critical of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who had publicised Vashukevich\u2019s videos as evidence of official corruption. \u201cLet him pay our legal costs,\u201d she said.

They were among tens of thousands who took to the streets to celebrate and support Colombia\u2019s LGBT community. Many annual Pride marches that were once solemn protests against repression have become celebrations of now-existing rights or progress, reflecting the strength of LGBT communities. In Bogot\u00e1, for example, the capital of a macho and socially conservative country, there has been surprising progress in LGBT rights. In March, Ang\u00e9lica Lozano Correa, a former member of the Bogot\u00e1 city council, became the first openly LGBT person to be elected to the country\u2019s Senate. In 2016 the country\u2019s government passed laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt and marry, and the previous year it granted transgender people the right to change their identity on official government documents \u2013 policies which have allowed more equality and openness. But while these laws and political representation might suggest Bogot\u00e1 is \u201cfriendly\u201d and tolerant of the LGBT community, the issue is not clear-cut. This year\u2019s Bogot\u00e1 Pride march was marked by an undertone of resistance to and fear of the right-wing government of the new president, Ivan Duque. Duque openly opposes the LGBT-inclusive peace agreement his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, signed with leftist rebels Farc in 2016. Activists claim he is also against same-sex marriage and adoption rights. \u201cAlthough the government promised there would be no setbacks to LGBT rights, the appointment of several anti-LGBT officials, cuts in resources for public policies and the continued strengthening of radical religious movements that promote hate speech and misinformation against the LGBT population are worrying,\u201d says Marcela S\u00e1nchez, director of Colombia Diversa, a leading LGBT rights organisation. Rough measures Indeed, determining a city\u2019s attitude towards the LGBT community is complex. Studies that try to do this often look at political or legal metrics such as freedom to marry, or laws protecting against discrimination. Equaldex, a collaborative knowledge base for the global LGBT movement that maps the legality of homosexuality, identifies a number of factors including freedom to change gender and to adopt \u2013 although it hasn\u2019t ranked countries or cities in order of best to worst. An index from the Human Rights Campaign looks at municipal services, law enforcement and the city leadership\u2019s public position on equality across the US. Seventy-eight out of 506 US cities had a \u201cperfect score\u201d of 100, for reasons such as introducing trans-inclusive health benefits to city employees, as in Brookings, South Dakota. Birmingham, Alabama, obtained a full score for passing comprehensive nondiscrimination ordinances, along with other cities such as Cleveland in Ohio, a state that had previously prohibited same-sex marriage and civil unions. However, the Human Rights Campaign clearly states its index does not and cannot reflect a city\u2019s friendliness. Other global surveys have tried to assess friendliness by covering public attitudes, access to nightlife and personal safety. A 2017 survey by the housing website Nestpick ranked the best LGBT cities by asking thousands of people how friendly they felt their city was based on safety and nightlife. Madrid, Amsterdam and Toronto came out as the top three. \u201cModern strongholds for LGBTQI culture remain in western Europe and Canada,\u201d says Merryn Johns, editor and chief for Curve, a lesbian-focused magazine in New York. Arguably the size of the LGBT population in urban areas could reflect the level of friendliness, as \u201cmany LGBTI folk head to cities from rural areas because of the promise of a freer, more tolerant life there,\u201d says Andr\u00e9 du Plessis, executive director of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association. A study of US metro areas found San Francisco has the biggest proportion of LGBT residents in the country at 6.2%, followed by Portland and Austin. San Francisco has often been called the \u201cgay capital of the world\u201d for its culture of tolerance and vibrant scene. But even when cities seem progressive on the surface, the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different story. \u201cFor a certain social strata [sic], Cape Town and Johannesburg are gay meccas, but at the same time black lesbians living in poor areas there are dealing with violence and targeted rape,\u201d says Graeme Reid, director of the LGBT rights programme at Human Rights Watch. A study in 2017 found that four in 10 LGBT South Africans know of someone who has been killed for \u201cbeing or suspected of being\u201d LGBT. Black members of this community are twice as likely (49%) as white people (26%) to know of an LGBT person who has been murdered. Even in London and Paris, which both have a reputation of being queer-friendly cities, hate crimes have increased in recent years. A report from Stonewall in 2017 found that 25% of London\u2019s LGBT community had experienced harassment or assault. Brazil\u2019s second-largest city, Rio de Janeiro, has been branding itself as an LGBT tourist destination for years. It has made huge efforts in providing anti-bullying projects aimed at students, and has outlawed discrimination in nightclubs. However, the last year has seen record numbers of violent attacks against the queer community. And with a newly elected far-right government, there are fears it could get worse. \u201cWith the election of an openly homophobic president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has infamously said he would rather have a dead son than a gay son, Rio\u2019s reputation as a destination city may falter, and violence increase,\u201d Reid says. \u201cRio is seen as a liberated city, but also has high levels of [homophobic] violence.\u201d \u2018Gay Disneyland\u2019 Conversely, in some countries with backward and dangerous attitudes to the LGBT community, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, discreet but vibrant underground scenes can thrive. This is even the case in Russia, where activists say two people were killed last week and nearly 40 detained, as part of a new homophobic crackdown by police in the Chechnya region. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a gay scene in many places that may surprise you,\u201d says Ed Salvato, an LGBT travel expert. \u201cSome places like Moscow and St Petersburghave vibrant gay communities, despite the homophobic laws there.\u201d In Dublin, an exciting scene exploded out of a staunchly Catholic country. \u201cDublin is like gay Disneyland now, and that wasn\u2019t the case 20 or 30 years ago,\u201d says Prof Andrew Reynolds, founder of the University of North Carolina\u2019s LGBTQ Representation and Rights Research Initiative. \u201cWith the last couple of referendums, Ireland and Dublin have embraced their new presentation as an inclusive, progressive and loving place.\u201d When Reynolds visited Ireland in 2016, many from the LGBT population told him stories of growing up in conservative coastal towns and moving away due to prejudice. The country was the first to legalise gay marriage by popular vote, in a 2015 referendum with a yes vote of 62%. He says: \u201cThey went to Australia. They went to America. Now they\u2019ve come home.\u201d Progress in politics The political glass ceiling has broken for many LGBT people across the world, which inevitably has ripple effects on the community. Minneapolis made US history last year by electing Andrea Jenkins, the first openly trans woman of colour to office in 2017. The gay stronghold of Palm Springs, California, has elected an entire city council that identifies as LGBT. And in November, Jared Polis became the first openly gay man to be elected as a US state governor. In Poland, one of Europe\u2019s most Catholic and conservative countries, voters in the small city of Slupsk this year elected a gay atheist mayor, Robert Biedron. Just a few years ago, Biedron was attacked on the streets of his city because of his sexuality. In Kathmandu, Nepal, Sunil Pant became Asia\u2019s first openly gay federal-level elected official in 2008, resulting in a spate of public scrutiny. \u201cI think that the spinoff is that Kathmandu is a lot more gay-friendly than it was before,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cWhilst it is not perfect by any stretch, like Bogot\u00e1, it is a place now that I feel like is much more friendly and accepting \u2013 and that\u2019s obviously coming from a place where the Hindu religion was not helpful before.\u201d As the most direct representatives of citizens, city officials are uniquely positioned to understand and address the needs of their communities, says Xavier Persad of the Human Rights Campaign, pointing to \u201cthe need to provide for one\u2019s family without the fear of being fired, to secure housing without the fear of eviction, and to participate in community life\u201d. \u201cWhen cities enact LGBTQ-inclusive protections,\u201d he adds, \u201cthey send a clear message that they value and welcome everyone, attracting the country\u2019s top talent and spurring economic growth.\u201d Ultimately, even the most progressive laws and equal representation at political levels do not necessarily reflect the efficiency of enforcement, or indeed capture the lived experience of discrimination and fear many LGBT people face every day.

Certainly the turnout in the first round of elections for the Parliament (apart from an exceptional performance by the Italians, attracted by superstar candidates and anxious to avoid the obloquy which that country reserves for abstainers) has been a disappointment: the Europe-wide average of 61 per cent, though almost twice as much as Britain could contrive, is still a long way below what is habitually achieved in national elections and a long way short of what Euro-enthusiasts had hoped for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52d58bcc604c784f557344cb9edd7d749a1e078e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52d58bcc604c784f557344cb9edd7d749a1e078e/0_161_3824_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Televised debate during the 1979 European elections: Simone Veil, Francois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Televised debate during the 1979 European elections: Simone Veil, Francois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger-Viollet/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/30/simone-veil-obituary\">Simone Veil obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The glamour and authority of the new Parliament must be tarnished by that sort of start. But such things are not beyond the power of the new Euro-MPs to correct.

France, where President Giscard has strengthened his hand still further at the Gaullists\u2019 expense \u2013 and perhaps undermined the whole future of the Gaullist movement \u2013 is one; West Germany, where the Right has at last moved clearly ahead of the Chancellor\u2019s Social Democrats and his Liberal allies, could be another. Denmark, where the anti-Market parties put themselves very firmly on the political map, may well be a third; and the Republic of Ireland perhaps another. Britain, emerging from a a general election, is unlikely to be so much stirred by the tepid events of these past few weeks. Yet there is at least one new ground for hope. Casting off their usual reluctance, the parties have this time chosen, and the voters returned, a notable crop of women candidates. If Mrs Castle, Mrs Ewing, Mrs Ann Clwyd (lately our correspondent in South Wales) and the rest can shake some life into the Parliament and give the consumer the same kind of vigorous advocacy which the farmer has so long enjoyed within the Community\u2019s institutions, then Westminster, in time, may learn to follow.

The European Conservatives are likely to adopt a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach towards the inevitable move towards a more integrated Community: that is to say they can be expected to fight the \u201cbureaucracy\u201d of the other EEC institutions including many of the Commission\u2019s proposals for economic intervention, harmonisation and industrial democracy. They can also be expected to promote the Common Market principle of competition and the free movement of capital and goods. Editorial: Small \u2018quake, not many hopes dead 12 June 1979 No election which puts people like Mr Willy Brandt and Mr Berlinguer and Mrs Simone Veil into the European Parliament, or which administers a fierce \u2013 perhaps even a fatal \u2013 blow to the throbbing ambition of Mr Jacques Chirac, can be dismissed as entirely unimportant or unmemorable. Certainly the turnout in the first round of elections for the Parliament (apart from an exceptional performance by the Italians, attracted by superstar candidates and anxious to avoid the obloquy which that country reserves for abstainers) has been a disappointment: the Europe-wide average of 61 per cent, though almost twice as much as Britain could contrive, is still a long way below what is habitually achieved in national elections and a long way short of what Euro-enthusiasts had hoped for. The glamour and authority of the new Parliament must be tarnished by that sort of start. But such things are not beyond the power of the new Euro-MPs to correct. If they can make the Parliament look and sound as though it matters, which the former unelected Parliament was never able to do, then their constituents will sit up and take notice. A set of elections fought ostensibly for places in a European Parliament may have left a lasting mark on the domestic politics of some member countries. France, where President Giscard has strengthened his hand still further at the Gaullists\u2019 expense \u2013 and perhaps undermined the whole future of the Gaullist movement \u2013 is one; West Germany, where the Right has at last moved clearly ahead of the Chancellor\u2019s Social Democrats and his Liberal allies, could be another. Denmark, where the anti-Market parties put themselves very firmly on the political map, may well be a third; and the Republic of Ireland perhaps another. Britain, emerging from a a general election, is unlikely to be so much stirred by the tepid events of these past few weeks. Yet there is at least one new ground for hope. Casting off their usual reluctance, the parties have this time chosen, and the voters returned, a notable crop of women candidates. If Mrs Castle, Mrs Ewing, Mrs Ann Clwyd (lately our correspondent in South Wales) and the rest can shake some life into the Parliament and give the consumer the same kind of vigorous advocacy which the farmer has so long enjoyed within the Community\u2019s institutions, then Westminster, in time, may learn to follow. That would indeed make June 7, 1979, a date worth remembering. This is an edited extract. Read the editorial in full.",

Watching the tiny girl babble to her mother behind the camera, I am distracted by how spotless the floor looks. Yet in the eyes of <a href=\"https://stepville.com/\" title=\"\">Stephanie Land</a>, the person who cleaned it, it was appalling: \u201cYears of dirt were etched into the floor. No matter how hard I scrubbed, I could never get it clean.\u201d</p> <p>People such as Land are perhaps the biggest threat to the myth of the American Dream: someone who worked hard, yet found her very country pitted against her success. Her new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/maid-9781409187370.html\" title=\"\">Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother\u2019s Will to Survive</a>, is both a memoir of her time working as a cleaner in middle-class households, and a dismantling of the lies the US tells itself about the poor: namely, that they don\u2019t work. As Land puts it, she was \u201coverwhelmed by how much work it took to prove I was poor\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe country lives by the myth that if you work hard enough, you\u2019ll make it,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, I felt like if I wasn\u2019t making it, I wasn\u2019t working hard enough.\u201d</p> <p>Frighteningly, before she arrived at that homeless shelter, Land\u2019s life was unremarkable. In her 20s, she wandered from low-paid to low-paid job: barista, dog daycare, stalls at farmers\u2019 markets. She had none of the usual factors society would pick out to explain her poverty: no alcohol problems, no history of drug use, a regular, if fractured, family life. At 28, she became pregnant. But the father, she writes, flew into rages, threatened and insulted her. With no family to rely on, Land entered the welfare system, moving to the shelter \u2013 where her daughter took her first steps \u2013 to transitional housing, to a trailer parked in a driveway, always desperately clinging to stability.</p> <p>Subsidising her meagre income with welfare meant submitting her life to relentless scrutiny: curfews and urine tests at the shelter; welfare officers wanting proof that her car wasn\u2019t too nice; supermarket cashiers silently judging her groceries when she used food stamps. She endured each indignity to look after her daughter, Mia.</p> <p>Searching for work in an economy that was still raw from the global financial crisis, Land began working as a cleaner for a private firm; $6 (\u00a34.65) an hour for tidying up houses she could only dream of affording.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you are willing to get on your knees to scrub a toilet, you will find work. No one is as desperate as a single parent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Strikingly, all her fellow cleaners were women and a huge proportion were single mums. Now 39, Land\u2019s explanation for this is simple: \u201cIt is flexible, most of the cleaning happens during school hours, you can bring your kid, and it is a job no one wants to do. As long as you are willing to get on your knees to scrub a toilet, you will always be able to find work. And no one is as desperate as a single parent.\u201d Eighty percent of the US\u2019s 12m single-parent households are headed by mothers \u2013 and 40% live below the poverty line.</p> <p>On such low income, money became a relentless weight: every car journey had to be weighed up against the cost of petrol. Providing food for Mia often meant going without herself, bolstering her stomach with instant coffee and, on the good days, a peanut butter sandwich. She would shop for groceries at night, to avoid the gaze of fellow shoppers; one man, after seeing the food stamps in her hand, shouted: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d as if he was personally paying for her to eat. In one of their homes, a tiny humid studio in Skagit valley, Washington, a relentless black mould continually resurfaced, making Mia constantly ill; kind hospital nurses tending to Mia gave her a dehumidifier.</p> <p>It is remarkable what a cleaner can learn about your life from the receipts on your fridge, the number of family photos on your walls, the papers on your desk. Going through middle America\u2019s dirty laundry gave Land the time and the perspective to mull over the myth that work always means success. She scrubbed vomit, mould and blood from the homes of people who, despite their 2.5 bathrooms and nice cars, seemed just as unhappy as her. In one house she dubbed the Porn House, she tries to figure out the lives of its owners: the husband with his Hustler magazines and lube always out on display in his bedroom, the wife\u2019s extensive collection of romance novels in hers. Popping ibuprofen to cope with the constant strain that cleaning took on her body, Land gazed longingly at the large opioid stash in the Chef\u2019s House. Wiping down the already spotless surfaces of the Cigarette Lady\u2019s House, she finds connection with the mysterious owner by discovering her secret: a freezer packed with Virginia Slims.</p> <p>After Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in 2016, much was made of the power of the disgruntled working poor. Yet Land encountered the most aggression from those on the other side of the \u201cwelfare cliff\u201d: those not quite poor enough to receive benefits. She straddled the line a few times: a few dollars more a month meant she could suddenly lose hundreds in benefits: \u201cI was penalised for working more, for working harder. Why, as an example, do some states require you to have less than $1,000 [\u00a3775] in savings? They are actively discouraging people from saving. Some people work really hard and still have no food in the fridge, while the wealthy are just getting wealthier while promoting this rhetoric that poor people are the ones taking all the money. And we still think they\u2019re the ones making the best decisions. Hell, I thought that when I went into their houses.\u201d</p> <p>Later on, when Land <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/27/why-i-came-out-as-being-poor\" title=\"\">\u201ccame out\u201d as poor</a>, some of her own friends told her that they were on food stamps or using Medicaid. \u201cI had no idea how many friends were struggling.

A month after graduating, she gave birth to a second daughter, Coraline, named after one of Neil Gaiman\u2019s heroines.

Every time I get something published, he tweets something like, \u2018I am really proud of her\u2019, which is nice.\u201d) She found a new balance with Jamie, Mia\u2019s father, but then married a man who later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/15/stephanie-land-book-divorce-husband-attack\" title=\"\">physically abused her</a>.</p> <p>While Land is no longer on welfare (although she still lives in low-income housing), money has not healed all wounds.

Now, Australia also has the best evidence plain packaging works. Government data has found a 0.5% reduction in smoking rates. However, researchers concede data is difficult to parse from other tactics such as graphic warnings, enacted around the same time.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Tobacco taxes</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Tobacco taxes increase the price of cigarettes, meant to encourage smokers to quit and make cigarettes unaffordable to young people. Taxes are the most effective, yet least utilized, tobacco control tool. The biggest hurdle to enacting taxes, experts say, is the industry\u2019s well-funded opposition.</p>\n    <p>Cigarette makers argue taxes fuel black market smuggling and counterfeit production. In turn, cigarette companies and their allies say increased taxes cause violence, revenue loss and lead to more harmful cigarettes. Tobacco control experts have found companies exaggerate smuggling evidence, and groups such as the Fraser Institute <a href=\"http://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/6/401\">often echo</a> those concerns.<br></p>\n    <p>In one study, an International Agency for Research in Cancer expert panel found tax avoidance does not wipe out the public health benefits of increased tobacco taxes.

The <a href=\"https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/50-years-of-progress/exec-summary.pdf\">US surgeon general</a>, in a report which marked 50 years since it declared smoking causes lung cancer, described taxes as \u201cone of the most powerful interventions we can make to prevent smoking and reduce prevalence\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Clean indoor air laws </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Clean indoor air laws ban smoking inside, because secondhand smoke can cause smoking-related illnesses.

It is absolutely ridiculous to imply that supporting an organization would result in a group taking action they otherwise would fundamentally oppose.</p> \n<p>\u201cClaims that our contributions to organizations committed to advancing positive change in public health create a conflict of interest cannot withstand any reasonable scrutiny, are irrational, and wrong.

He had met with the Confederation of Malaysian Tobacco Manufacturers, an editorial in the Malaysian newspaper <a href=\"https://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/2017/04/228635/losing-battle-against-illicit-cigarette-trade\">New Strait Times</a> reported. No tobacco tax hike would go forward, the finance minister said, citing the threat of smuggling.</p> \n<p>Threats of smuggling became a potent data point for opponents of the tax hike. The same day Ideas made a <a href=\"http://www.ideas.org.my/price-increase-will-fuel%E2%80%8B-illegal%E2%80%8B-cigarette-trade-says-think-tank-ideas/\">statement</a> which opposed a tax hike, the Confederation of Malaysian Tobacco Manufacturers <a href=\"http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cigarette-price-hike-will-reduce-government-revenue-collection-say-manufacturers\">argued</a> the government would lose money on the venture.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt 57.1% of market share, illegal cigarettes are a national issue,\u201d Guilherme Silva, managing director of Japan Tobacco International in Malaysia, told <a href=\"http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/no-cigarette-tax-hike-says-johari\">Edge Markets</a>. A tax increase would be a \u201cno-win situation for all parties \u2013 the ministry of health on its commitment to reduce consumption, the ministry of finance on its tax collection and the legitimate tobacco industry on its sustainability\u201d.</p> \n<p>Two reports backed up the cigarette manufacturers\u2019 position. One from Nielsen showed 57.1% of the country\u2019s cigarettes were smuggled. Another, from the consultancy group <a href=\"http://illicittobacco.oxfordeconomics.com/media/OXFO5304_Malaysia_2017_Report_V4.pdf\">Oxford Economics</a>, found 52.3% of Malaysian cigarettes were illicit. Both were funded by the tobacco industry.</p> \n<p>Estimates from the market research firm Euromonitor International in 2016 put the level of smuggling in Malaysia <a href=\"https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/monographs/21/docs/m21_14.pdf\">closer to 35%</a>. </p> \n<p>\u201cWhen a group or a consultant uses certain familiar buzzwords and pushes anti-health proposals, look deeper, and you will find the link to the tobacco industry,\u201d said Assunta, citing especially \u201cillicit trade\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Nielsen report, though widely cited by Malaysian media, is not publicly available. When the Guardian asked Nielsen for a copy, Nielsen referred the Guardian to the Confederation of Malaysian Tobacco Manufacturers. Nielsen, a spokesperson said, was \u201cnot able to share it\u201d. The second report, by Oxford Economics, was paid for by Philip Morris International Management, one of PMI\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4165214\">affiliates</a> in Switzerland.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.ideas.org.my/policy-paper-no-38-malaysias-tax-system-friend-or-foe-to-prosperity/\">Ideas</a> repeated figures from the two reports in press statements, amplifying their funders\u2019 conclusions and calling Malaysia a \u201cbreeding ground\u201d for illicit trade.</p> \n<p>When asked about the use of two industry-backed reports used to support its research, Ideas told the Guardian: \u201cWe did not consider this of relevance.\u201d</p> \n<p>The tobacco industry also had links to the experts who authored the Ideas reports and other thinktanks Ideas relied on for data. The author of one Ideas report was a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a free-market thinktank based in Washington DC which has repeatedly accepted donations from cigarette manufacturers and argued against regulation.</p> \n<p>Another report cited data from the Mackinac Center, yet another free-market thinktank which accepted tobacco industry funding, this time based in Michigan. Their findings were criticized in a <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/read/19016/chapter/6#105\">US government analysis</a> which found \u201csome systemic bias in the estimates\u201d that were \u201clikely overstating tax evasion\u201d.</p> \n<p>Julia Smith, an associate researcher at Simon Fraser University\u2019s Global Tobacco Research Programme, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in Canada the tobacco companies using research from thinktanks they have funded to support their arguments and submissions to governments around plain packaging or the illicit tobacco trade.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ideas responded: \u201cThere are multiple approaches to reduce public health harms including controls. Ideas has taken this view that government control measures alone cannot reduce tobacco usage and has encouraged to consider harm reduction approach.\u201d The group also said it believes \u201cwe need to align with the private sector to end smoking\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>International</strong></h2> \n<p>In countries such as Chile, Ghana, Australia, Nigeria and in Hong Kong, free-market thinktanks received funding from western embassies as they argued against the same tobacco controls those countries had in place.</p> \n<p>In Ghana, the Imani Centre for Policy and Education, one of Africa\u2019s most recognizable thinktanks, has vigorously opposed plain packaging, <a href=\"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Increasing-tax-on-sugar-cigarette-and-alcohol-to-sustain-NHIS-won-t-work-Franklin-Cudjoe-645831\">cigarette taxes</a> and a proposed <a href=\"https://www.modernghana.com/news/343763/24/imanis-cry-of-unfairness-misplacedban-on-smoking-i.html\">indoor smoking ban</a>. The executive director of Imani wrote an editorial <a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/146589-re-engagement-tobacco-debate-africa-franklin-cudjoe.html\">arguing</a> the link between smoking and lung cancer \u201cis yet to be empirically established\u201d. (Imani told the Guardian the group \u201cno longer holds this position\u201d.)</p> \n<p>The group\u2019s advocacy against tobacco control measures is so strong that Ghana\u2019s health department cited local advocates who described Imani as a group that \u201c<a href=\"http://apps.who.int/fctc/implementation/database/sites/implementation/files/documents/reports/ghana_2014_report.pdf\">fronts for the tobacco industry</a>\u201d in progress reports submitted to the WHO.</p> \n<p>Africa has the lowest number of tobacco deaths of any continent; however, its burgeoning economy and large proportion of young people has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/12/big-tobacco-dirty-war-africa-market\">made it a target</a> as the industry seeks to grow.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey have registered themselves as a very influential thinktank,\u201d said Jeorge Kingston, an anti-tobacco campaigner in Ghana. </p> \n<p>The Guardian could not find information on Imani\u2019s funding.

The group also said Transparify \u201cdid a totally shoddy job\u201d when it called the group opaque.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have always made our funding sources available,\u201d the group said, and listed the Danish government, the African arm of the Open Society Foundations run by billionaire George Soros, the Atlas Network and the Ford Foundation as its primary funders. As well, the group said it did not receive funding to oppose tobacco controls, but would continue to be a \u201chappy recipient\u201d of donations for its general fund, \u201cUNLESS AND UNTIL TOBACCO IS BANNED IN GHANA!!!!! [sic]\u201d.</p> \n<p>The same year it was rated highly opaque by Transparify, Imani became a key partner of a major foreign aid effort by the <a href=\"http://ghana.um.dk/en/danida-en/tax%20and%20development/\">Danish government</a>, and will receive \u201ccore funding\u201d through 2018.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca15e36bec093a284d77659e944fec8dd333d192\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca15e36bec093a284d77659e944fec8dd333d192/0_279_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street market vendor smokes a cigarette as she waits for customers at her clothes stall in Hong Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street market vendor smokes a cigarette as she waits for customers at her clothes stall in Hong Kong.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In Hong Kong, where smoking has nearly halved since the 1980s as tobacco control measures went into place, a local free-market thinktank called the Lion Rock Institute opposed multiple tobacco control measures. </p> \n<p>Lion Rock told the Guardian, their opposition to tobacco controls \u201cstems from the same belief those who support abortion rights or voluntary euthanasia shares.

      "bodyText": "Smoking kills more than 27,200 Malaysians every year. In March 2017, Malaysia\u2019s health ministry hoped to reduce that grim tally by floating a plan to sharply increase cigarettes taxes as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), and proposed by the deputy health minister, Dr Hilmi Yahaya, in the nation\u2019s legislature. The plan would increase the price of a pack from \u00a33.17 ($4.11) to \u00a33.91 ($5.06), a significant hike of 23% \u2013 and exactly the kind of move proven to cut smoking and related illness and death, experts said. But not everyone thought this was a good idea. Opponents included a politically connected thinktank called the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas), a partner of the Atlas Network, a global network of free-market advocacy groups based in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington DC. Then executive director Wan Saiful Wan Jan warned that while the health department had \u201cgood intentions\u201d, \u201ctheir proposed solution is wrong because it will only encourage illegal activities without reducing the number of smokers\u201d. The thinktank argued in a statement that \u201cone out of every two packs\u201d of Malaysian cigarettes are smuggled and a tax increase would feed the black market. The thinktank accepted donations from Philip Morris Singapore, Philip Morris Malaysia and Japan Tobacco International alongside money from the American, British and Canadian governments, according to financial disclosures by the thinktank. The proposal to increase taxes was dropped after just 10 days. But Ideas continued to advocate against tax hikes for months afterward, issuing statements, opinion pieces and two lengthy reports which used data paid for by tobacco companies to conclude taxes would fuel a black market. \u201cThe obvious question is: why the sudden keen interest in tobacco control?\u201d said Mary Assunta, senior policy adviser for the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (Seatca). \u201c[It] coincides with when it starting receiving funds from transnational tobacco companies. \u201cIdeas is a high-profile thinktank in Malaysia, and the tobacco industry selection of Ideas to front its position is consistent with its strategy seen in other countries,\u201d said Assunta. \u201cA 2014 Philip Morris International (PMI) strategy to counter the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control states it should find \u2018allies that cannot be ignored\u2019, and Ideas fits this criteria in Malaysia.\u201d The argument that taxes would fuel a black market remains one of the tobacco industry\u2019s most powerful tactics to dissuade governments from increasing \u201csin taxes\u201d. The US surgeon general, WHO and World Bank all support increased tobacco taxes. Anti-tobacco advocates the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids has said companies \u201cexaggerate\u201d how tobacco taxes affect smuggling to \u201cscare policymakers from taking science-based steps to reduce tobacco use\u201d. Patricio Marquez, lead specialist on health, nutrition and population at the World Bank, said: \u201cOne of the key ingredients of the influence to this process is to generate evidence to support the claims that tobacco taxation is regressive, it is going to affect the poor, that it will erode the tax base because you will have less smokers, therefore less people to tax, and you will be inundated by smuggling. \u201cIn order to set that story you need to have data, you need to engage reputable organizations.\u201d Ideas said the group follows \u201ca strict policy of editorial independence\u201d, and \u201cthus no donations influence our research and analytical outputs\u201d. The group also said it has disclosed its tobacco industry funding in annual financial records published on its website. \u201cIdeas is perhaps the only civil society organization in Malaysia which maintains this level of transparency. In these financial records, the names of tobacco firms are clearly mentioned and we have never denied this,\u201d it said. PMI told the Guardian: \u201cWe have worked, and will continue to work, with carefully selected organizations around the world who share our desire to promote policies that produce meaningful public health improvements. It is absolutely ridiculous to imply that supporting an organization would result in a group taking action they otherwise would fundamentally oppose. \u201cClaims that our contributions to organizations committed to advancing positive change in public health create a conflict of interest cannot withstand any reasonable scrutiny, are irrational, and wrong. Ideas are not for sale.\u201d Japan Tobacco International said: \u201cVarious groups across the world share our view that any regulation, tobacco-related or not, if untested and unproven, could have seriously negative knock-on effects.\u201d The company continued: \u201cIt is clear to everyone that there are health risks associated with smoking \u2013 we are fully transparent about this. And, as such, it is important that tobacco products are regulated.\u201d British American Tobacco (BAT) said the company supports \u201clike-minded organisations on issues that are important to our business and our consumers\u201d. \u201cWe support evidence-based regulation that is consultative in its development, delivers its policy aims, factors in potential unintended consequences, and respects our legal rights as a legal business selling a legal product,\u201d said Simon Cleverly, head of corporate affairs at BAT. \u201cWe believe publicly elected officials should be allowed to hear all sides of any debate when formulating policy and should be trusted to make informed decisions once they have heard and considered all the arguments.\u201d Altria, the American maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said: \u201cLike most major corporations, Altria and its companies support and are members of policy-oriented organizations focused on issues that affect our business \u2026 We develop and maintain partnerships with third-party organizations on issues important to our companies and that independently research, communicate and advocate on those issues.\u201d \u2018Look deeper\u2019 A little over a week after Malaysia\u2019s health minister proposed a tobacco tax increase, Malaysia\u2019s finance minister quashed it. He had met with the Confederation of Malaysian Tobacco Manufacturers, an editorial in the Malaysian newspaper New Strait Times reported. No tobacco tax hike would go forward, the finance minister said, citing the threat of smuggling. Threats of smuggling became a potent data point for opponents of the tax hike. The same day Ideas made a statement which opposed a tax hike, the Confederation of Malaysian Tobacco Manufacturers argued the government would lose money on the venture. \u201cAt 57.1% of market share, illegal cigarettes are a national issue,\u201d Guilherme Silva, managing director of Japan Tobacco International in Malaysia, told Edge Markets. A tax increase would be a \u201cno-win situation for all parties \u2013 the ministry of health on its commitment to reduce consumption, the ministry of finance on its tax collection and the legitimate tobacco industry on its sustainability\u201d. Two reports backed up the cigarette manufacturers\u2019 position. One from Nielsen showed 57.1% of the country\u2019s cigarettes were smuggled. Another, from the consultancy group Oxford Economics, found 52.3% of Malaysian cigarettes were illicit. Both were funded by the tobacco industry. Estimates from the market research firm Euromonitor International in 2016 put the level of smuggling in Malaysia closer to 35%. \u201cWhen a group or a consultant uses certain familiar buzzwords and pushes anti-health proposals, look deeper, and you will find the link to the tobacco industry,\u201d said Assunta, citing especially \u201cillicit trade\u201d. The Nielsen report, though widely cited by Malaysian media, is not publicly available. When the Guardian asked Nielsen for a copy, Nielsen referred the Guardian to the Confederation of Malaysian Tobacco Manufacturers. Nielsen, a spokesperson said, was \u201cnot able to share it\u201d. The second report, by Oxford Economics, was paid for by Philip Morris International Management, one of PMI\u2019s affiliates in Switzerland. Ideas repeated figures from the two reports in press statements, amplifying their funders\u2019 conclusions and calling Malaysia a \u201cbreeding ground\u201d for illicit trade. When asked about the use of two industry-backed reports used to support its research, Ideas told the Guardian: \u201cWe did not consider this of relevance.\u201d The tobacco industry also had links to the experts who authored the Ideas reports and other thinktanks Ideas relied on for data. The author of one Ideas report was a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a free-market thinktank based in Washington DC which has repeatedly accepted donations from cigarette manufacturers and argued against regulation. Another report cited data from the Mackinac Center, yet another free-market thinktank which accepted tobacco industry funding, this time based in Michigan. Their findings were criticized in a US government analysis which found \u201csome systemic bias in the estimates\u201d that were \u201clikely overstating tax evasion\u201d. Julia Smith, an associate researcher at Simon Fraser University\u2019s Global Tobacco Research Programme, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in Canada the tobacco companies using research from thinktanks they have funded to support their arguments and submissions to governments around plain packaging or the illicit tobacco trade.\u201d Ideas responded: \u201cThere are multiple approaches to reduce public health harms including controls. Ideas has taken this view that government control measures alone cannot reduce tobacco usage and has encouraged to consider harm reduction approach.\u201d The group also said it believes \u201cwe need to align with the private sector to end smoking\u201d. International In countries such as Chile, Ghana, Australia, Nigeria and in Hong Kong, free-market thinktanks received funding from western embassies as they argued against the same tobacco controls those countries had in place. In Ghana, the Imani Centre for Policy and Education, one of Africa\u2019s most recognizable thinktanks, has vigorously opposed plain packaging, cigarette taxes and a proposed indoor smoking ban. The executive director of Imani wrote an editorial arguing the link between smoking and lung cancer \u201cis yet to be empirically established\u201d. (Imani told the Guardian the group \u201cno longer holds this position\u201d.) The group\u2019s advocacy against tobacco control measures is so strong that Ghana\u2019s health department cited local advocates who described Imani as a group that \u201cfronts for the tobacco industry\u201d in progress reports submitted to the WHO. Africa has the lowest number of tobacco deaths of any continent; however, its burgeoning economy and large proportion of young people has made it a target as the industry seeks to grow. \u201cThey have registered themselves as a very influential thinktank,\u201d said Jeorge Kingston, an anti-tobacco campaigner in Ghana. The Guardian could not find information on Imani\u2019s funding. A 2015 report from transparency watchdogs Transparify rated the group one of the most opaque in Africa. In response to questions from the Guardian, Imani said it accepted donations from tobacco companies, \u201cprobably four years ago for our general advocacy programs\u201d. The group also said Transparify \u201cdid a totally shoddy job\u201d when it called the group opaque. \u201cWe have always made our funding sources available,\u201d the group said, and listed the Danish government, the African arm of the Open Society Foundations run by billionaire George Soros, the Atlas Network and the Ford Foundation as its primary funders. As well, the group said it did not receive funding to oppose tobacco controls, but would continue to be a \u201chappy recipient\u201d of donations for its general fund, \u201cUNLESS AND UNTIL TOBACCO IS BANNED IN GHANA!!!!! [sic]\u201d. The same year it was rated highly opaque by Transparify, Imani became a key partner of a major foreign aid effort by the Danish government, and will receive \u201ccore funding\u201d through 2018. In Hong Kong, where smoking has nearly halved since the 1980s as tobacco control measures went into place, a local free-market thinktank called the Lion Rock Institute opposed multiple tobacco control measures. Lion Rock told the Guardian, their opposition to tobacco controls \u201cstems from the same belief those who support abortion rights or voluntary euthanasia shares. The sovereignty over one\u2019s own body. We simply want smokers to have a right to kill themselves with dignity.\u201d In Chile, lawmakers aligned with the influential thinktank Libertad y Desarrollo slow-walked the legislation. Journalists later discovered Libertad y Desarrollo received donations from BAT at the time the bill was being considered. One of Libertad y Desarrollo\u2019s founders, Carlos F C\u00e1ceres, was named president of British American Tobacco Chile in 2014. C\u00e1ceres heads the Libertad y Desarrollo advisory council, according to the group\u2019s website. Libertad y Desarrollo did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. United States While Altria Client Services donated to thinktanks across the US, at least 14 free-market thinktanks commented in favor of a new product produced by the company\u2019s former owner, PMI. Thinktanks told the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that PMI did \u201ca great job\u201d in its application and said regulators would stifle \u201cinnovation\u201d if they did not approve the new product, called IQOS. The device heats tobacco but does not burn it, which cigarette companies argue makes the product safer and can help people quit. Groups including the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Tax Reform, Americans for Prosperity Foundation, FreedomWorks and TechFreedom all commented in favor of the product or urged regulators to approve the product for sale in testimony. For example, in 2017, the same year Independent Women\u2019s Forum received a donation from Altria, the group testified the FDA would \u201cpunish women\u201d if it did not approve IQOS because, the group argued, it is biologically more difficult for women to quit smoking. The same year, Heritage called on Congress to, \u201cstop blocking alternatives\u201d to smoking, and testified to the FDA that IQOS had an \u201cimpressive record\u201d. Australia Thinktanks also proved to be some of the loudest voices against a landmark anti-tobacco law in Australia, which became the world\u2019s first country to remove branding from cigarette packs. In 2010, when Australia\u2019s law was proposed, the American Legislative Exchange Council sent a letter directly to Australia\u2019s treasury. Alec, as the group is called in the US, is known mostly for circulating model legislation among state legislatures. In this letter, Alec warned Australian officials the laws would \u201camount to a government seizure of trademark\u201d. In 2011, after the law was passed, Alec publicly opposed its implementation. Philip Morris went on to sue Australia under those same international trade laws. Australia defended its law against a suit from Philip Morris, brought under a bilateral trade agreement with Hong Kong. Australia triumphed in 2015, but it cost Australian taxpayers $39m to defend. Between 1995 and 2010, Alec accepted more than $1.4m in support from the tobacco industry, according to tobacco company documents reported by PR Watch. Alec did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",

      "bodyText": "The entire website of Elon Musk\u2019s private charitable foundation is shorter than many of the Tesla CEO\u2019s contentious tweets. \u201cMusk Foundation. Grants are made in support of: Renewable energy research and advocacy; Human space exploration research and advocacy; Pediatric research; Science and engineering education,\u201d the site reads. Documents obtained by the Guardian reveal how the foundation has put that vague mission statement into practice. Together, the documents show that many of the organization\u2019s donations have gone far beyond its stated scope. Some have benefited the billionaire\u2019s own initiatives and, indirectly, his family, while others have tackled his pet peeves \u2013 the foundation has given more money to artificial intelligence research than to any of the more traditional charities it says it supports. As with many other of his achievements, Musk has publicly touted his charitable activities, whether during the Flint water crisis or amid international efforts to rescue a young soccer team trapped in a Thai cave. Musk has given personally to multiple causes and organizations, including multimillion-dollar donations to the Sierra Club and the XPrize Foundation, and a $1m grant to the Obama Foundation. But the bulk of his charitable giving has been through this private foundation, for which he provides the entirety of its funding. The Musk Foundation has disbursed more than $54m in 15 years of operations, more than a third in direct gifts to 160 charities, according to an analysis of filings with the Internal Revenue Services from its incorporation in 2001 to the middle of 2017. Most recorded awards totalled just a few thousand dollars, and many went to environmental, educational, medical and space advocacy organizations. Others, however, landed closer to home. Recipients have included a school attended by Musk\u2019s own children, a charity managed by his brother, a protest group fighting gridlock on Musk\u2019s commute to SpaceX, and even an art project at Musk\u2019s favorite festival, Burning Man. Giving it all away In 2012, Musk joined billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and Warren Buffett in signing The Giving Pledge, a commitment by some of the world\u2019s richest individuals to give away the majority of their wealth, either during their lifetimes or upon their deaths. Musk \u2013 who controls Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company \u2013 is worth an estimated $22bn, although almost all his wealth is tied up in his own companies. Musk had started organizing his charity givings more than a decade earlier. Musk launched his foundation in 2001, together with his younger brother Kimbal, who would serve as the organization\u2019s secretary and treasurer. Musk\u2019s first big gift to the foundation came the following year, shortly after eBay bought PayPal, the payments company that Musk had an interest in. Musk gave his organization 30,000 eBay shares, worth $2.1m. In those early days, the foundation made small, uncontroversial donations to Musk\u2019s alma maters in South Africa and the US, to other educational charities, space societies and children\u2019s hospitals such as the Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles. Between 2007 and 2014, Musk topped up the foundation\u2019s coffers with a little over $3.1m in cash. The list of its recipients grew longer \u2013 and began to feature more organizations with links to Musk\u2019s own family and interests. The foundation funded photovoltaic systems helping communities affected by the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 and the Fukushima earthquake in 2011. Musk\u2019s solar power company Solar City (now part of Tesla) participated in both installations. Also in 2010, the foundation spent $183,000 to help launch Kitchen Community, a Colorado-based charity headed by Kimbal that used \u201clearning gardens\u201d in underserved areas to help children grow and prepare fresh food. Kitchen Community, now called Big Green, has raised over $47m since its inception. It received a total of nearly half a million dollars over the next four years from the Musk Foundation \u2013 one of the foundation\u2019s largest direct awards at the time. As executive director and chairman of the project, Kimbal received nearly $85,000 in payments by Big Green between 2010 and 2016. The organization did not initially respond to a request for comment.

It also made three $25,000 payments to a tiny pressure group called Angelenos Against Gridlock. The group was lobbying for improvements to the notoriously congested Interstate 405 highway that Musk uses regularly to commute from his Bel-Air home to SpaceX. Angelenos Against Gridlock is now defunct, and Musk has turned his attention to building tunnels to whisk Tesla electric cars swiftly beneath the city\u2019s traffic instead. The high point of 2012 was possibly a $10,000 donation to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps), a non-profit that is developing medical therapies using marijuana and MDMA. That donation helped fund the Temple of Whollyness, a large wooden art structure that went up in smoke at the climax of 2013\u2019s Burning Man festival in Nevada.

      "bodyText": "When Andrea Bian applied to college last year, she made a difficult decision: she chose not to talk about her race, fearing that it would hurt her chances of admission. Bian is of Chinese descent, and she knew that at many US colleges, Asian-American applicants are accepted at lower rates than others with the same grades and test scores. She was ultimately admitted to Northwestern University, where she now studies journalism. But Bian thinks there\u2019s a bigger problem with college admissions \u2013 one \u201cthat doesn\u2019t concern minorities at all\u201d, she wrote in her college newspaper. \u201cIn fact, it almost exclusively applies to white people.\u201d She was talking about legacy preferences, a widespread and increasingly controversial factor in admission to top colleges. Many US colleges admit \u201clegacies\u201d, or students with a family connection to the university, at dramatically higher rates than other applicants. They are widely seen as a reliable source of alumni donations. \u201cThey do tend to be white, and they do tend to be wealthier,\u201d Bian said in an interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of unfair.\u201d At Harvard, the acceptance rate for legacy students is about 33%, compared with an overall acceptance rate of under 6%. Countless powerful Americans have followed their relatives to elite universities. In 1935, when John F Kennedy applied to Harvard, the first page of the application form asked where his father had graduated from college. \u201cHarvard 1912,\u201d he wrote. He was admitted, though his academic record was not especially strong. In 1964, George W Bush followed his father and grandfather to Yale, despite lackluster grades. A recent lawsuit has unexpectedly stoked passions around the issue of legacy applicants. In October, Harvard was taken to federal district court for allegedly discriminating against Asian Americans. The lawsuit against Harvard says that the admissions office gives lower average \u201cpersonal ratings\u201d to applicants of Asian descent. According to the group that filed the lawsuit, Students for Fair Admissions, this limits the number of Asian Americans in the student body. Though the lawsuit was meant to focus on race-conscious admissions, it has also added fuel to a fiery debate about wealth and privilege at elite institutions, and has helped to energize student demands for greater transparency in the admissions process. Students for Fair Admissions has not historically fought for the rights of Asian Americans. It is led by the conservative activist Edward Blum, who has waged a long war against laws that involve race and ethnicity. His organization\u2019s lawsuit against Harvard has the backing of Donald Trump\u2019s justice department. The issue of legacy admissions was brought up in court by Adam Mortara, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, who argued that universities should not give preferences to any category of students, whatever their racial or economic background. \u201cHarvard steadfastly refuses to even contemplate giving up legacy and donor preferences,\u201d he said in his opening remarks. He asked the dean of Harvard College, Rakesh Khurana, \u201cWhat is so special about wealthy people that Harvard needs to have them overrepresented by a factor of six on its campus?\u201d Khurana responded, \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to mirror the socioeconomic or income distribution of the United States. What we\u2019re trying to do is identify talent and to make it possible for people to come to Harvard,\u201d he said. Like the website of Harvard admissions, Khurana seemed to guide the conversation away from the number of wealthy Harvard students, and toward the opportunities afforded to low-income students. Despite the best efforts of Harvard administrators, the influence of wealthy alumni was on full display in court. At one point, lawyers shared internal emails addressed to Harvard\u2019s director of admissions. \u201cOnce again you have done wonders,\u201d wrote the head of Harvard\u2019s government school, after learning that applicants connected to potential donors had been accepted. \u201cI am simply thrilled by all the folks you were able to admit.\u201d One donor, he added, \u201chas already committed to a building\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Santander plans to close nearly one in five of its bank branches in the UK, putting more than 1,200 jobs at risk. The Spanish-owned bank, which has one of the largest high street networks in Britain, will shut 140 branches, leaving 614 after the closures, which will be completed by the end of the year. Santander said it expected to find new jobs for about a third of the 1,270 employees whose jobs are at risk. The British banking industry is undergoing rapid change as more and more customers bank online through websites and mobile apps, reducing the number of visitors to branches on the high street. Santander said branch transaction numbers have fallen by 23% over the past three years, while transactions via digital channels almost doubled over the same period. As well as relocation to other nearby branches, some staff may be able to find roles at call centres and larger central offices such as those in Glasgow and Milton Keynes. While the branch closures are spread throughout the UK, it is thought that employees in more remote branches in Wales, where relocation may not be a viable option, will be most exposed to redundancy. Linda Rolph, general secretary of Advance, a trade union representing Santander UK employees, described the job losses as \u201creally disappointing, but not a terribly big surprise given the way the industry is going\u201d. She said: \u201cOur main aim is to try and get as many jobs as we can to people.\u201d Other competitors among the British high street banks have also announced thousands of job cuts and branch closures in recent years. Research by the consumer group Which? shows that at least 3,101 branches have closed or are planned to close since the start of 2015 \u2013 a rate of more than 60 a month. Royal Bank of Scotland has gradually closed hundreds of branches in the past year. Lloyds, Britain\u2019s biggest high street lender, in November announced thousands of redundancies as it restructured its operations and launched a major digital recruitment drive.

The trade secretary also suggested a delay or suspension of Brexit could be worse than leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March because of a backlash against parliament and the government. His comments came hours after the shadow chancellor signalled that Labour was \u201chighly likely\u201d to support a proposal seeking to delay article 50 unless Theresa May could get a Brexit deal approved by the end of the month. Fox appeared to appeal to Conservative colleagues to reject amendments that will come before the House of Commons on Tuesday, which seek an extension to the UK\u2019s exit date. In an interview on the BBC Radio 4\u2019sToday programme, he said the political consequences of delaying leaving the EU could outweigh the economic consequences, adding: \u201cThere is no doubt that leaving with a deal and minimising disruption both to the UK and our EU trading partners is in our best interest. \u201cBut I think the most calamitous outcome would be for parliament, having promised to respect the result of the referendum, to turn around and say it wouldn\u2019t.

Many reported that the compensation scheme was so stressful it could re-trigger trauma. Survivors of violent crimes were asked to constantly repeat their story, and often faced delays, uncertainty and poor communication, Lady Newlove said.

The review engaged more than 200 victims, as well as police and crime commissioners, victim support services, criminal justice agencies and lawyers.",

But Scott Pollock \u2013 who made his Northampton Town debut in front of 4,849 people last Saturday \u2013 is no stranger to the spotlight after starring for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/14/hashtag-united-virtual-gamers-striking-rich-sport-2-0\" title=\"\">Hashtag United</a>, a team born online that, until recently, played matches in an imaginary league, watched on YouTube by millions. In fact, less than 18 months ago Pollock was man-marking Steven Gerrard in front of almost 35,000 against Tekkers Town in the Wembley Cup and taking home the man of the match award.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/14/hashtag-united-virtual-gamers-striking-rich-sport-2-0\">Hashtag United, Wimbly Womblys and the virtual gamers striking it rich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A week\u2019s trial at Crystal Palace followed after he caught the eye of Mark Bright, the club\u2019s ambassador who has commentated on the annual charity match since its inception four years ago. In the end, the verdict was that Pollock was too slight but that rejection was just the latest chapter in the teenager\u2019s extraordinary backstory.</p> <p>Initially born on the founder Spencer Owen\u2019s YouTube channel, Hashtag United have toured from Serbia to Spain and the United States but it was their decision to reach out to their 460,000-plus subscribers two years ago that rekindled Pollock\u2019s love for the game after the tragedy of losing his father, Simon, when he was 12.</p> <p>Owen, whose real surname is Carmichael-Brown, said: \u201cWe thought, how cool it would be if we could get one of the guys watching along for the ride, so we thought we\u2019d do this academy series.\u201d More than five million people watched what was in effect a talent contest, in which 20,000 applicants were whittled down to 250. They held trials, tactical, technical and skills challenges including interviews more akin to The Apprentice, while they also canvassed the opinions of professionals including Adebayo Akinfenwa, with the winner guaranteed a place in the Hashtag squad for the season and a \u00a33,000 cash prize.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like an X Factor for football over eight episodes,\u201d said Spencer\u2019s brother, Seb Carmichael-Brown, who is also a club director. \u201cScott won the big public vote at the end. The audience absolutely loved him.\u201d</p> <p>Seb still laughs now about his Wayne Rooney moment, when he told viewers to \u201cremember the name\u201d after a then-16-year-old midfielder \u2013 affectionately known as \u201cScotty P\u201d by Hashtag fans \u2013 went on a mazy run in episode one.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are people walking round in Hashtag United shirts in the Philippines, South America, Australia and Africa</p> <footer> <cite>Spencer Carmichael-Brown</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A lot has changed for both Pollock and Hashtag since then, though, with Spencer stepping down as manager and appointing Jay Devereux after successfully entering step 10 of the football pyramid. \u201cWhen I sign a new player, I\u2019m asking them to take on responsibilities they would never be asked to undertake at any other non-league club,\u201d said Devereux, previously of East Thurrock United and Dagenham &amp; Redbridge. \u201cWe have a social media policy \u2013 I doubt any others at our level have something like that \u2013 that they have to sign and adhere to. There is scrutiny on what we do.\u201d Being in charge of Hashtag, Devereux admits, is surreal. \u201cOn an almost daily basis, something happens that makes me think: \u2018This is nuts.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hashtag, who train once a week and groundshare Coles Park Stadium with Haringey Borough, did not win any of their first four games but now sit top of the Eastern Senior League Division One South. Steve Carmichael-Brown, Spencer\u2019s father, is the team physio, while every match \u2013 or pre-match and post-match team-talk \u2013 can be viewed in real-time online. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily believe that is entirely all to our benefit on the football pitch, and that\u2019s where we have to balance the two sides to our job, which is ultimately to win games,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cBut we also have a responsibility to our viewers, because we wouldn\u2019t exist without them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f63a6444e9ec222fd56a55b75b942131d5b4dd93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f63a6444e9ec222fd56a55b75b942131d5b4dd93/143_186_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hopefuls in the 2017 Hashtag Academy talent-seeking series listen to instructions from Spencer Owen (left) and his brother Seb Carmichael-Brown (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hopefuls in the 2017 Hashtag Academy talent-seeking series listen to instructions from Spencer Owen (left) and his brother Seb Carmichael-Brown (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are still three YouTubers in the team: Charlie Morley, Theo Baker and Jemel Akeem, who boast millions of subscribers between them. They also have the former Swansea defender Tom Williams and Matt Carter, formerly a teammate of Declan Rice at West Ham, among their ranks. Hashtag take flak over their name but they have turned down approaches from retired Premier League players to join and that is a marker of how serious they are about building the club sustainably, determined to prove they are no flash in the pan.</p> <p>One day, Hashtag even hope to have a home stadium of their own. They do not pay their players but have three-year contracts with Adidas and Football Manager as kit suppliers and sponsors respectively; the latter has even released a free version of the game in which all teams in their league are playable. Hashtag do, however, pay their esports stars, players who play the video game Fifa professionally. Spencer said: \u201cOur football side are at the bottom of the ladder trying to get up and our esports guys are at the top, competing with Man City, PSG, and often winning those battles.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/22/fearless-esports-racers-blur-lines-games-real-thing\">Fearless esports racers blur lines between games and the real thing | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For a team who attract modest crowds in the low hundreds to home games at Coles Park, Hashtag\u2019s global following is staggering. Hundreds of thousands watch every game online, react to every starting line-up. According to figures released by the sports management analyst <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deporfinanzas?lang=en\" title=\"\">Deportes &amp; Finanzas</a>, Hashtag had 7.49 million YouTube views between July and September last year, the seventh-most of any football club in the United Kingdom \u2013 more than Celtic, Everton and Rangers. \u201cWe are usually just outside the Europa League spots,\u201d Spencer joked. Worldwide, their monthly numbers often translate to them being among the top 20, dwarfing the likes of Milan and Galatasaray. \u201cWe are, without doubt, the best supported non-league club in the world. There are people walking round in Hashtag United shirts in the Philippines, South America, Australia and Africa. I don\u2019t know of any other non-league club that can say that.\u201d</p> <p>Seb, who adds that only 60% of their fanbase are UK-based, said: \u201cWe were born on the internet. Our fans didn\u2019t grow up watching us play down the road, they grew up watching us on their phones, iPads, on their computer screens. Our audience is as a global as any of the bigger league clubs. We do not have a local fanbase, but we are growing it. For some clubs at our level, getting people through the gate is the be-all and end-all but for us it\u2019s almost an insignificant line on the balance sheet. Gate receipts are not important to us financially whatsoever. Putting down local roots is next for us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pollock, meanwhile, was promoted to Northampton\u2019s Under-18s last summer. By making his debut against Cambridge United after being recalled from a work experience loan at St Neots Town last week, he became the first player to make a first-team appearance after graduating through Northampton\u2019s BTec football and education programme. Still a first-year scholar, it has been such a whirlwind journey that Pollock, who first joined the Cobblers as an under-14 and grew up admiring Akinfenwa, has been forced to give up his season ticket at Sixfields. \u201cWith the success of Scott, we think it\u2019s a no-brainer to try and do a second academy series,\u201d Seb said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When any 17-year-old makes his debut for his boyhood club, jangling nerves are to be expected. But Scott Pollock \u2013 who made his Northampton Town debut in front of 4,849 people last Saturday \u2013 is no stranger to the spotlight after starring for Hashtag United, a team born online that, until recently, played matches in an imaginary league, watched on YouTube by millions. In fact, less than 18 months ago Pollock was man-marking Steven Gerrard in front of almost 35,000 against Tekkers Town in the Wembley Cup and taking home the man of the match award. A week\u2019s trial at Crystal Palace followed after he caught the eye of Mark Bright, the club\u2019s ambassador who has commentated on the annual charity match since its inception four years ago. In the end, the verdict was that Pollock was too slight but that rejection was just the latest chapter in the teenager\u2019s extraordinary backstory. Initially born on the founder Spencer Owen\u2019s YouTube channel, Hashtag United have toured from Serbia to Spain and the United States but it was their decision to reach out to their 460,000-plus subscribers two years ago that rekindled Pollock\u2019s love for the game after the tragedy of losing his father, Simon, when he was 12. Owen, whose real surname is Carmichael-Brown, said: \u201cWe thought, how cool it would be if we could get one of the guys watching along for the ride, so we thought we\u2019d do this academy series.\u201d More than five million people watched what was in effect a talent contest, in which 20,000 applicants were whittled down to 250. They held trials, tactical, technical and skills challenges including interviews more akin to The Apprentice, while they also canvassed the opinions of professionals including Adebayo Akinfenwa, with the winner guaranteed a place in the Hashtag squad for the season and a \u00a33,000 cash prize. \u201cIt was like an X Factor for football over eight episodes,\u201d said Spencer\u2019s brother, Seb Carmichael-Brown, who is also a club director. \u201cScott won the big public vote at the end. The audience absolutely loved him.\u201d Seb still laughs now about his Wayne Rooney moment, when he told viewers to \u201cremember the name\u201d after a then-16-year-old midfielder \u2013 affectionately known as \u201cScotty P\u201d by Hashtag fans \u2013 went on a mazy run in episode one. A lot has changed for both Pollock and Hashtag since then, though, with Spencer stepping down as manager and appointing Jay Devereux after successfully entering step 10 of the football pyramid. \u201cWhen I sign a new player, I\u2019m asking them to take on responsibilities they would never be asked to undertake at any other non-league club,\u201d said Devereux, previously of East Thurrock United and Dagenham &amp; Redbridge. \u201cWe have a social media policy \u2013 I doubt any others at our level have something like that \u2013 that they have to sign and adhere to. There is scrutiny on what we do.\u201d Being in charge of Hashtag, Devereux admits, is surreal. \u201cOn an almost daily basis, something happens that makes me think: \u2018This is nuts.\u2019\u201d Hashtag, who train once a week and groundshare Coles Park Stadium with Haringey Borough, did not win any of their first four games but now sit top of the Eastern Senior League Division One South. Steve Carmichael-Brown, Spencer\u2019s father, is the team physio, while every match \u2013 or pre-match and post-match team-talk \u2013 can be viewed in real-time online. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily believe that is entirely all to our benefit on the football pitch, and that\u2019s where we have to balance the two sides to our job, which is ultimately to win games,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cBut we also have a responsibility to our viewers, because we wouldn\u2019t exist without them.\u201d There are still three YouTubers in the team: Charlie Morley, Theo Baker and Jemel Akeem, who boast millions of subscribers between them. They also have the former Swansea defender Tom Williams and Matt Carter, formerly a teammate of Declan Rice at West Ham, among their ranks. Hashtag take flak over their name but they have turned down approaches from retired Premier League players to join and that is a marker of how serious they are about building the club sustainably, determined to prove they are no flash in the pan. One day, Hashtag even hope to have a home stadium of their own. They do not pay their players but have three-year contracts with Adidas and Football Manager as kit suppliers and sponsors respectively; the latter has even released a free version of the game in which all teams in their league are playable. Hashtag do, however, pay their esports stars, players who play the video game Fifa professionally. Spencer said: \u201cOur football side are at the bottom of the ladder trying to get up and our esports guys are at the top, competing with Man City, PSG, and often winning those battles.\u201d For a team who attract modest crowds in the low hundreds to home games at Coles Park, Hashtag\u2019s global following is staggering. Hundreds of thousands watch every game online, react to every starting line-up. According to figures released by the sports management analyst Deportes &amp; Finanzas, Hashtag had 7.49 million YouTube views between July and September last year, the seventh-most of any football club in the United Kingdom \u2013 more than Celtic, Everton and Rangers. \u201cWe are usually just outside the Europa League spots,\u201d Spencer joked. Worldwide, their monthly numbers often translate to them being among the top 20, dwarfing the likes of Milan and Galatasaray. \u201cWe are, without doubt, the best supported non-league club in the world. There are people walking round in Hashtag United shirts in the Philippines, South America, Australia and Africa. I don\u2019t know of any other non-league club that can say that.\u201d Seb, who adds that only 60% of their fanbase are UK-based, said: \u201cWe were born on the internet. Our fans didn\u2019t grow up watching us play down the road, they grew up watching us on their phones, iPads, on their computer screens. Our audience is as a global as any of the bigger league clubs. We do not have a local fanbase, but we are growing it. For some clubs at our level, getting people through the gate is the be-all and end-all but for us it\u2019s almost an insignificant line on the balance sheet. Gate receipts are not important to us financially whatsoever. Putting down local roots is next for us.\u201d Pollock, meanwhile, was promoted to Northampton\u2019s Under-18s last summer. By making his debut against Cambridge United after being recalled from a work experience loan at St Neots Town last week, he became the first player to make a first-team appearance after graduating through Northampton\u2019s BTec football and education programme. Still a first-year scholar, it has been such a whirlwind journey that Pollock, who first joined the Cobblers as an under-14 and grew up admiring Akinfenwa, has been forced to give up his season ticket at Sixfields. \u201cWith the success of Scott, we think it\u2019s a no-brainer to try and do a second academy series,\u201d Seb said.",

Designed to address rapid changes in the workplace triggered by the rise of the robot economy and technological automation, the International Labour Organization said a package of measures was required to put the world economy on a sustainable footing for the future. Calling on world leaders to support the policies at the start of the annual gathering of heads of government and business tycoons in Davos this week, the UN agency, which marks its 100th anniversary this year, said failure would increase the risk of \u201csleepwalking into a world that widens existing inequalities\u201d. It comes as concerns grow over the impact of technology on workers\u2019 jobs, pay and rights around the world, with automation rendering more traditionally human roles obsolete. The Bank of England estimates that rapid technological change could put as many as 15m jobs in the UK at risk, while academics believe almost half of all workers in the US could be displaced by automation. Traditionally working-class jobs are among the worst affected, potentially raising inequality levels. Some studies have suggested advances in technology will create more jobs than will be destroyed, although they warn that governments must invest in the protection of displaced workers and retraining. Co-chaired by the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and the Swedish prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, the ILO report is the culmination of a 15-month review by a 27-member commission of senior figures from the world of business, academia, trade unions and charities. It calls for a universal labour guarantee that would enshrine the right to an adequate living wage, maximum limits on working hours, and health and safety protections. It would also enforce freedom of association in trade unions and the right to collective bargaining, freedom from forced labour, child labour and discrimination. Repeated attempts have been made to suppress trade union organisation in the UK under Conservative governments since the late 1970s, while economists believe the declining presence of unions in the workforce may have contributed to a reduction in wage growth. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, has said falling levels of unionisation have lowered wage growth by about 0.75 percentage points a year over the past 30 years, in a sign of the weaker bargaining power of workers. Figures from the ILO show Britain has had the weakest real wage growth among the most advanced nations in the G20 over the past decade. Another recommended measure from the ILO is to strengthen social protection systems around the world.

Royce said the prosecution case was \u201cso weak\u201d it should not be before a jury. Rogberg was not part of that retrial because he was recovering from a quadruple heart bypass.</p> <p>Despite Royce\u2019s withering assessment of the SFO case, the agency maintained that it was still considering pursuing a retrial of Rogberg. However on Wednesday it offered no evidence and Judge Deborah Taylor formally entered a verdict of not guilty.</p> <p>Sasha Wass QC, representing the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), said: \u201cThe SFO has considered the matter carefully and, given the acquittals of the other two defendants, [decided] it would not be fair to try Rogberg on his own and for that reason we offer no evidence against him.\u201d</p> <p>The collapse of the case raises questions about both the calibre of the SFO\u2019s investigation and Tesco\u2019s decision to strike a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/28/tesco-agrees-fine-serious-fraud-office-accounting-scandal\">\u00a3129m plea bargain</a>, known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), in 2017. The US-style transaction involves a deal brokered between the prosecutor and an accused business to avoid a full trial.</p> <p>The case stemmed from one of the most shocking episodes in recent corporate history, discovered weeks after Dave Lewis took over as chief executive, replacing Philip Clarke, who had had been axed after a big decline in Tesco\u2019s fortunes.</p> <p>On 22 September 2014, Lewis told the City that forensic accountants and lawyers had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/22/tesco-loses-2bn-value-250m-profit-overstatement-investigation\">called in to scrutinise its books</a> after a whistleblower claimed payments from suppliers were being manipulated to make the supermarket group\u2019s finances look healthier. At the time, Tesco said the rogue practice had inflated profits by \u00a3250m.</p> <p>The following day the three executives were suspended from their roles and never returned to work for the company.</p> <p>In the DPA, which has now been made public, Tesco accepts false accounting took place at its Tesco Stores Limited subsidiary between February and September 2014. It named the three executives and said they \u201cdishonestly perpetuated\u201d a profit misstatement and were involved in \u201cfalsifying or concurring in the falsification of accounts\u201d.</p> <p>The SFO defended its investigation, stating that in the six-month period it discovered a culture existed at Tesco that encouraged \u201cillegal practices to meet accounting targets\u201d. Lisa Osofsky, the crime agency\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe DPA clearly outlines the extent of this criminal conduct for which the company has accepted full responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>But Rogberg said there were \u201cserious questions\u201d for Tesco and the SFO to answer: \u201cAll three of us have been acquitted. It\u2019s not just an acquittal it\u2019s a super-acquittal. There\u2019s no guilt what so ever and the case has been stopped by a number of judges. Yet on the same day a DPA has been published with us named in it.\u201d</p> <p>Ross Dixon, a partner at the solicitors Hickman &amp; Rose, who represented Bush throughout his trial, called for the \u201curgent reform\u201d of the DPA process. He said: \u201cWe now have two contradictory outcomes: that of the criminal trial in which the allegations were dismissed for lack of evidence and the DPA based on the same allegations.\u201d</p> <p>Tesco, which handed over 1,600 bags of documents for the SFO to inspect, said it had signed the agreement after the profits overstatement was \u201cindependently investigated and verified by [the accountancy firm] Deloitte\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement the supermarket said it was now \u201ca very different company\u201d, adding: \u201cThis DPA was also separately approved by a senior high court judge, LJ Leveson, as being in the interests of justice.\u201d</p>",

Royce said the prosecution case was \u201cso weak\u201d it should not be before a jury. Rogberg was not part of that retrial because he was recovering from a quadruple heart bypass. Despite Royce\u2019s withering assessment of the SFO case, the agency maintained that it was still considering pursuing a retrial of Rogberg. However on Wednesday it offered no evidence and Judge Deborah Taylor formally entered a verdict of not guilty. Sasha Wass QC, representing the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), said: \u201cThe SFO has considered the matter carefully and, given the acquittals of the other two defendants, [decided] it would not be fair to try Rogberg on his own and for that reason we offer no evidence against him.\u201d The collapse of the case raises questions about both the calibre of the SFO\u2019s investigation and Tesco\u2019s decision to strike a \u00a3129m plea bargain, known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), in 2017. The US-style transaction involves a deal brokered between the prosecutor and an accused business to avoid a full trial. The case stemmed from one of the most shocking episodes in recent corporate history, discovered weeks after Dave Lewis took over as chief executive, replacing Philip Clarke, who had had been axed after a big decline in Tesco\u2019s fortunes. On 22 September 2014, Lewis told the City that forensic accountants and lawyers had been called in to scrutinise its books after a whistleblower claimed payments from suppliers were being manipulated to make the supermarket group\u2019s finances look healthier. At the time, Tesco said the rogue practice had inflated profits by \u00a3250m. The following day the three executives were suspended from their roles and never returned to work for the company. In the DPA, which has now been made public, Tesco accepts false accounting took place at its Tesco Stores Limited subsidiary between February and September 2014. It named the three executives and said they \u201cdishonestly perpetuated\u201d a profit misstatement and were involved in \u201cfalsifying or concurring in the falsification of accounts\u201d. The SFO defended its investigation, stating that in the six-month period it discovered a culture existed at Tesco that encouraged \u201cillegal practices to meet accounting targets\u201d. Lisa Osofsky, the crime agency\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe DPA clearly outlines the extent of this criminal conduct for which the company has accepted full responsibility.\u201d But Rogberg said there were \u201cserious questions\u201d for Tesco and the SFO to answer: \u201cAll three of us have been acquitted. It\u2019s not just an acquittal it\u2019s a super-acquittal. There\u2019s no guilt what so ever and the case has been stopped by a number of judges. Yet on the same day a DPA has been published with us named in it.\u201d Ross Dixon, a partner at the solicitors Hickman &amp; Rose, who represented Bush throughout his trial, called for the \u201curgent reform\u201d of the DPA process. He said: \u201cWe now have two contradictory outcomes: that of the criminal trial in which the allegations were dismissed for lack of evidence and the DPA based on the same allegations.\u201d Tesco, which handed over 1,600 bags of documents for the SFO to inspect, said it had signed the agreement after the profits overstatement was \u201cindependently investigated and verified by [the accountancy firm] Deloitte\u201d. In a statement the supermarket said it was now \u201ca very different company\u201d, adding: \u201cThis DPA was also separately approved by a senior high court judge, LJ Leveson, as being in the interests of justice.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from Melbourne. Thanks for reading. It\u2019s been ... quick! Bye. Novak Djokovic\u2019s next opponent will be Lucas Pouille, who will be making his first appearance in a grand slam semi-final. Djokovic has never played the Frenchman before. Again, it\u2019s hard to see him having too much trouble against the 28th seed. Pouille\u2019s had good wins over Borna Coric and Milos Raonic, but this will surely be too much for him. Novak Djokovic is asked about tomorrow\u2019s semi-final between Rafael Nadal and Stefanos Tsitsipas. \u201cAre you inviting me to come to the commentary box from you? I won\u2019t take the spot from Lleyton [Hewitt]. Lleyton is doing a much better job than I would. What did you ask me? Stefanos is one of the leaders of the next generation and has had some outstanding matches at this tournament, especially against Roger. Credit to him for playing so maturely and so well under pressure. It\u2019s never easy playing against the greatest player of all time. Considering how he\u2019s playing I\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s in the semis. Nadal... Good for him. A lot of spin. Great movement. Great backhand. A lot of volleys. He\u2019s very good.\u201d Novak Djokovic runs through a few Australian phrases to amuse the crowd. \u201cFair dinkum!\u201d Novak Djokovic speaks! \u201cI love to battle, especially against Kei. We have played here a couple of times. I hope he can recover. I hope it\u2019s not something very serious. I wish him a speedy recovery. I\u2019m sorry to everybody for not having a full match but thank you for showing up. This is what the doctor ordered for me after a match two nights ago, not to spend too much time on the court. I am in another semi-finals and I will do everything to get ready for that one.\u201d Kei Nishikori gets a sympathetic round of applause as he leaves the court. He can barely walk up the stairs as he makes his way down the tunnel. That\u2019s some seriously fatigued. It\u2019s all over. Kei Nishikori walks to the umpire and says he can\u2019t continue. He\u2019s decided to put himself out of his misery. The crowd aren\u2019t too happy. Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 4-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): This is no more than hitting practice for Djokovic at the moment, a rasping backhand return taking the game to deuce. Nishikori clips a backhand wide; break point. Djokovic takes it when Nishikori sends a backhand wide. Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 3-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Djokovic cruises into a 40-0 lead with a series of wonderful groundstrokes. He holds to love when he polishes off a forehand at the net. Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 2-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Nishikori slams a drive volley wide for 0-30. He hangs his head, and well he might, for that was crummy. Djokovic earns three set points when Nishikori sends a forehand long. Then Nishikori knocks a forehand into the net and walks gingerly back to his chair. Djokovic breaks. This is an appalling match. Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 1-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to love. No drama. Just relentless control. Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 0-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Now the physio\u2019s worked his magic - we hope - the match can resume with Nishikori serving. He\u2019s looking a little sprightlier when he rams a forehand down the line for 40-15, much to the crowd\u2019s approval. He holds to 15. Kei Nishikori is having a medical timeout. The physio is massaging his right thigh. Djokovic quickly earns three set points. This is grim. Nishikori nets a backhand. He looks like he wants a lie down. On comes the physio. First set: Djokovic 5-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): The game goes to deuce once more. Djokovic earns a set break point when Nishikori nets a tired backhand slice. He takes it when a Nishikori half-volley gives him room to send a backhand down the line. Nishikori has asked for the trainer. First set: Djokovic* 4-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Nishikori\u2019s low level so far has slightly disguised that Djokovic isn\u2019t actually playing that well. For instance, the game goes to deuce when Djokovic butchers an easy smash at the net, hammering it wide. But Nishikori can\u2019t take advantage. Djokovic is too solid and he makes no mistake with a smash when Nishikori gives him another chance to hit one. First set: Djokovic 3-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all. There\u2019s a subdued atmosphere in the stands. They can see Nishikori\u2019s struggling. The game goes to deuce after a vicious backhand return from Djokovic, though Nishikori clings on this time. First set: Djokovic 3-0 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to 15, consolidating the break easily. Not to sound too gloomy, but we can probably call this now. First set: Djokovic 2-0 Nishikori* (*denotes server): In need of a fast start, Nishikori lashes a forehand away for 15-0. Then he misses a couple of forehands, handing Djokovic a 15-30 lead. Djokovic nets a backhand down the line. The game goes to deuce. The intensity isn\u2019t high; both players are making a lot of errors. Then Djokovic turns up the heat, drilling a backhand down the line to earn the first break point. Nishikori, tight and edgy, nets a backhand. Oh dear. Nishikori looks knackered already. First set: Djokovic* 1-0 Nishikori (*denotes server): Djokovic opens the serving and opens with a crisp delivery down the middle for 15-0. Nishikori nets a couple of times; 40-0. Djokovic holds to love. The hitting part\u2019s almost over. It\u2019s almost time for tennis! Here come the players. Kei Nishikori emerges first, closely followed by the great Novak Djokovic, the champion here on six occasions. Kei Nishikori has been on court for almost 14 hours so far. It isn\u2019t really where you want to be before playing Novak Djokovic. In the women\u2019s draw, Serena Williams is out! The American lost in three sets to Karolina Pliskova earlier. Pliskova, who was 5-1 down in the third set before coming back to win three straight games after Williams rolled an ankle, will play Naomi Osaka after the Japanese star\u2019s 6-1, 6-4 win over Elina Svitolina. The winner of this match will play Lucas Pouille, who has beaten Milos Raonic 6-3, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4. That\u2019s a fine win for the 28th seed, who\u2019s into his first grand slam semi-final.

A lot of people will think once you\u2019re 9-0 down there\u2019s not much point, but we\u2019ve got to go out and be competitive \u2013 [against] the best players from around the world. It is fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>Clough has a neat way of placing the 9-0 trouncing in perspective. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of the referee: \u2018Blow the whistle for God\u2019s sake.\u2019 It\u2019s one of those where you crawl up into a ball and take your beating. But the next day I went for a nice walk in the park to clear my head with Bobbie \u2013 and she doesn\u2019t care. We\u2019re running round the park, but she\u2019s not thinking: \u2018You were shit last night.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At Tony\u2019s Butchers in town, lifelong fan Bradley Bennett sounds a similar note. \u201cIt\u2019s great for Burton.

We\u2019re all feeling really positive despite there not being much chance of a win. It\u2019s obviously good that we got this far and to have Man City coming to town.</p> <p>\u201cTo have Kevin De Bruyne, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and David Silva here shows the magic of football and that anything is possible \u2013 on paper we should never have got to this stage.

      "bodyText": "Burton Albion may face a 9-0 deficit to Manchester City but Nigel Clough is so upbeat he stops for an impromptu chat alongside Bobbie, his chocolate\u2011coloured Hungarian Vizsla dog who is riding shotgun in the manager\u2019s car. The Brewers may be into serious damage-limitation territory when the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg starts on Wednesday night, but Clough\u2019s mood remains as bright as the sun over the Pirelli Stadium and reflects a town relishing the prospect of seeing Kevin De Bruyne and company strut their stuff. Clough describes his League One side\u2019s dismantling by City in the opening leg at the Etihad Stadium as \u201cruthless\u201d but on winding down the window the 52-year-old is happy to talk. Just like Clough Jr, locals are aware of what an achievement reaching the semi-final stage of a major cup competition is, Burton having been a non\u2011league club 10 years ago, and the 6,912\u2011capacity Pirelli Stadium sold out the day tickets became available. Anton Williams has missed \u201caround 20 games\u201d since he first watched Burton as an eight\u2011year\u2011old. Now 31, the supporter liaison group chairman works down the road from the stadium at Tag Sportswear, the team\u2019s kit manufacturer. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s a free hit, a game we\u2019ve earned, it\u2019s good for the town, the chance to play maybe the best team in the world, at the Pirelli, a chance for the Burton public to come and see them. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive fixture. A lot of people will think once you\u2019re 9-0 down there\u2019s not much point, but we\u2019ve got to go out and be competitive \u2013 [against] the best players from around the world. It is fantastic.\u201d Clough has a neat way of placing the 9-0 trouncing in perspective. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of the referee: \u2018Blow the whistle for God\u2019s sake.\u2019 It\u2019s one of those where you crawl up into a ball and take your beating. But the next day I went for a nice walk in the park to clear my head with Bobbie \u2013 and she doesn\u2019t care. We\u2019re running round the park, but she\u2019s not thinking: \u2018You were shit last night.\u2019\u201d At Tony\u2019s Butchers in town, lifelong fan Bradley Bennett sounds a similar note. \u201cIt\u2019s great for Burton. The club has done a lot in the last 10 years to get where we are. My friends have a similar feeling \u2013 it\u2019s great to have a bit of attention. \u201cI\u2019m not going tomorrow \u2013 I couldn\u2019t get a ticket,\u201d he says, though the score has not put him off. \u201cI\u2019ll watch it on TV. The club does a lot for the community, as well \u2013 it helps schools and the town out a lot. I actually did some work experience there when I was at school.\u201d There may not be any visible signs in the town centre that City\u2019s \u00a3500m-plus squad are coming, but the club shop carries half-and-half scarves and mugs and the atmosphere is sure to build as kick-off nears. At John German, a local estate agent, James Cardon says: \u201cIt\u2019s a big game \u2013 we\u2019re just getting behind the club. We\u2019re all feeling really positive despite there not being much chance of a win. It\u2019s obviously good that we got this far and to have Man City coming to town. \u201cTo have Kevin De Bruyne, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and David Silva here shows the magic of football and that anything is possible \u2013 on paper we should never have got to this stage. It helps us as a town, helps raise the profile. And with us getting relegated last year this goes against the negative [local] press and lifts spirits.\u201d Williams says: \u201cWe were playing non\u2011league football. We\u2019ve gone up to play Championship football and we\u2019ve come down \u2013 but we\u2019ve made a semi\u2011final of a domestic competition, something not many clubs can say they\u2019ve done. For a club of our size, it\u2019s a phenomenal achievement. \u201cObviously you get the people who see it differently but the realistic people \u2013 and I count myself one of those \u2013 are like: \u2018At end of the day, we\u2019re Burton Albion.\u2019\u201d This appreciation was evident at the close of the first leg. If Clough found it torrid and the record signing, Liam Boyce, talked of \u201cpersonal pride getting hit\u201d, supporter reaction heartened. \u201cFans weren\u2019t booing at the end,\u201d the manager says. \u201cMost can\u2019t believe we\u2019re in the semi-final.

If it was 4-0 the tie would still be over \u2013 we\u2019d still enjoy it. This is probably never going to happen again.

      "body": "<p>A year since Rafael Nadal scrambled calculations for the Australian Open by quitting with a hip injury in the quarters, Kei Nishikori did likewise on day 10 when he handed Novak Djokovic a free pass into the last four.</p> \n<p>The world No 1 plays Lucas Pouille on Friday night after leading 6-1, 4-1, when Nishikori, one of the most physically fragile players on the Tour, found the pain of a quad strain too much to bear.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter third game or fourth game when I was serving, I felt pretty heavy to my right leg,\u201d Nishikori said. \u201cAfter that I couldn\u2019t really bend my knees and couldn\u2019t jump up. I decided to stop.\u201d</p> \n<p>The match itself revealed little, although Djokovic will be glad of the rest. The Serb, who has been growing in confidence, will shorten in favouritism to win a record seventh title, in the absence of Roger Federer, rudely bumped out by Stefanos Tsitsipas, who plays Nadal on Thursday night.</p> \n<p>If Nadal were to collapse again (he withdrew from the Brisbane Open to protect a knee injury), further chaos would disturb the final weekend.</p> \n<p>John McEnroe spread some of his anarchic charm earlier during his on-court interview with Pouille. \u201cI\u2019m getting the feeling that a lot of these guy players are going to be hiring female coaches now,\u201d he said to the Frenchman after he had beaten Milos Raonic in the earlier quarter-final. Pouille, who is coached by Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo was unimpressed, and replied: \u201cThey should, they should \u2026 It\u2019s not about being a woman or a man: it doesn\u2019t matter. You just have to know what you\u2019re doing and she does.\u201d It is a sentiment that would have resonated with Andy Murray, who was also coached by Mauresmo. Pouille added: \u201cMen are coaching women, so why not the contrary? I mean, they don\u2019t get it. She\u2019s a champion. She\u2019s a great coach.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jan/23/novak-djokovic-v-kei-nishikori-australian-open-quarter-final-live\">Novak Djokovic into Australian Open semi-finals as Kei Nishikori retires \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One of the least-mentioned plus points of this shredded Australian Open men\u2019s draw is the uncertainty injected into it by the random fall of favourites. The received wisdom was that the Canadian with the golden arm would bring too much power with ball in hand for the Frenchman with the cultured groundstrokes \u2013 nurtured in many practice sessions with Roger Federer \u2013 but it did not quite work out that way. Pouille prevailed 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-4 in just over three hours to earn his first slam semi-final place. </p> \n<p>Early intelligence on this quarter-final was mixed. While Pouille sat 14 points adrift of Raonic in the rankings at 31, there were doubts about the big man\u2019s fitness given the number of times he had had to quit the Tour in the past with a hospital log of injuries.</p> \n<p>Then he put 30 aces past Nick Kyrgios in the first round, but the Australian reckoned the super-server\u2019s chances of winning the title were not as strong as the numbers suggested. \u201cThere are players that are much better than I am, who can neutralise big servers so easily with the chip return, which I don\u2019t have. [Raonic\u2019s serving] would have beaten a lot of players, for sure. I probably would have beaten 75% of the draw today. But Milos played scary.\u201d</p> \n<p>Raonic continued to play scary all the way to the quarter-finals, leading the tournament\u2019s big hitters with 107 aces. The quickest of his new batch on Wednesday was 139 mph, as his pre-injury aura returned. The free points kept flowing, and Pouille soaked them up with the sort of defensive skills Kyrgios referred to.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"749fc27c-1aed-4502-9249-21e7353191be\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nX0AqpI3m9o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Once he had clawed back Raonic\u2019s 5-2 lead in the second set, he seemed to have the match under control after an hour and a half, but the contest see-sawed once more as Raonic forced the tie-break that kept him in the fight, closing the gap after wasting two of six set points to force a fourth set.</p> \n<p>Pouille, too, had been profligate. He had not been able to cash in on four break points in the ninth game of that third set and might have wondered if his window had been opened and closed. He was within touching distance of moving into the semi-finals, a victory in itself, whatever the result there.</p> \n<p>In three previous contests with the Canadian, Pouille could not win a set. In the space of two winning sets, he looked like sending him home in double-quick time. But, while he had only once in his career come from two sets down, Raonic is so often underestimated. Nobody expected him to beat Alexander Zverev, and he did so \u2013 comfortably.</p> \n<p>Yet Pouille did not represent as imposing a threat as others in the quarters, having struggled for more than 12 hours to reach the final 16 of a slam for the third time. He was a losing quarter-finalist at Wimbledon three years ago, and in New York later that year.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/23/australian-open-serena-williams-loses-to-karolina-pliskova\">Australian Open: Serena Williams loses to Karolina Pliskova in thriller</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The end was tight. Raonic was given the ball again at 4-5. Surely, went the theory, he would add to his aces tally, level it up and go on to victory in a fifth set. Pouille, though, chipped and teased his way to two match points, forcing Raonic to push a final backhand wide.</p> \n<p>Raonic ended up with 132 aces, way more than anyone left in the draw \u2013 but he is not alongside his peers still competing for a bigger prize. While Pouille\u2019s tally of free-serving points \u2013 84 \u2013 puts him a respectable fifth in the field, he will bring a bit more than raw intimidation to the semi-finals.</p> \n<p>Only six Frenchmen in the modern era have reached this stage. Pouille is the first since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in 2010. To get there that year, he beat Djokovic, then lost to Federer in the semi-final, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/31/andy-murray-roger-federer-australian-open\" title=\"\">Swiss going on to beat Murray in the final</a>.

The world No 1 plays Lucas Pouille on Friday night after leading 6-1, 4-1, when Nishikori, one of the most physically fragile players on the Tour, found the pain of a quad strain too much to bear. \u201cAfter third game or fourth game when I was serving, I felt pretty heavy to my right leg,\u201d Nishikori said. \u201cAfter that I couldn\u2019t really bend my knees and couldn\u2019t jump up. I decided to stop.\u201d The match itself revealed little, although Djokovic will be glad of the rest. The Serb, who has been growing in confidence, will shorten in favouritism to win a record seventh title, in the absence of Roger Federer, rudely bumped out by Stefanos Tsitsipas, who plays Nadal on Thursday night. If Nadal were to collapse again (he withdrew from the Brisbane Open to protect a knee injury), further chaos would disturb the final weekend. John McEnroe spread some of his anarchic charm earlier during his on-court interview with Pouille. \u201cI\u2019m getting the feeling that a lot of these guy players are going to be hiring female coaches now,\u201d he said to the Frenchman after he had beaten Milos Raonic in the earlier quarter-final. Pouille, who is coached by Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo was unimpressed, and replied: \u201cThey should, they should \u2026 It\u2019s not about being a woman or a man: it doesn\u2019t matter. You just have to know what you\u2019re doing and she does.\u201d It is a sentiment that would have resonated with Andy Murray, who was also coached by Mauresmo. Pouille added: \u201cMen are coaching women, so why not the contrary? I mean, they don\u2019t get it. She\u2019s a champion. She\u2019s a great coach.\u201d One of the least-mentioned plus points of this shredded Australian Open men\u2019s draw is the uncertainty injected into it by the random fall of favourites. The received wisdom was that the Canadian with the golden arm would bring too much power with ball in hand for the Frenchman with the cultured groundstrokes \u2013 nurtured in many practice sessions with Roger Federer \u2013 but it did not quite work out that way. Pouille prevailed 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-4 in just over three hours to earn his first slam semi-final place. Early intelligence on this quarter-final was mixed. While Pouille sat 14 points adrift of Raonic in the rankings at 31, there were doubts about the big man\u2019s fitness given the number of times he had had to quit the Tour in the past with a hospital log of injuries. Then he put 30 aces past Nick Kyrgios in the first round, but the Australian reckoned the super-server\u2019s chances of winning the title were not as strong as the numbers suggested. \u201cThere are players that are much better than I am, who can neutralise big servers so easily with the chip return, which I don\u2019t have. [Raonic\u2019s serving] would have beaten a lot of players, for sure. I probably would have beaten 75% of the draw today. But Milos played scary.\u201d Raonic continued to play scary all the way to the quarter-finals, leading the tournament\u2019s big hitters with 107 aces. The quickest of his new batch on Wednesday was 139 mph, as his pre-injury aura returned. The free points kept flowing, and Pouille soaked them up with the sort of defensive skills Kyrgios referred to. Once he had clawed back Raonic\u2019s 5-2 lead in the second set, he seemed to have the match under control after an hour and a half, but the contest see-sawed once more as Raonic forced the tie-break that kept him in the fight, closing the gap after wasting two of six set points to force a fourth set. Pouille, too, had been profligate. He had not been able to cash in on four break points in the ninth game of that third set and might have wondered if his window had been opened and closed. He was within touching distance of moving into the semi-finals, a victory in itself, whatever the result there. In three previous contests with the Canadian, Pouille could not win a set. In the space of two winning sets, he looked like sending him home in double-quick time. But, while he had only once in his career come from two sets down, Raonic is so often underestimated. Nobody expected him to beat Alexander Zverev, and he did so \u2013 comfortably. Yet Pouille did not represent as imposing a threat as others in the quarters, having struggled for more than 12 hours to reach the final 16 of a slam for the third time. He was a losing quarter-finalist at Wimbledon three years ago, and in New York later that year. The end was tight. Raonic was given the ball again at 4-5. Surely, went the theory, he would add to his aces tally, level it up and go on to victory in a fifth set. Pouille, though, chipped and teased his way to two match points, forcing Raonic to push a final backhand wide. Raonic ended up with 132 aces, way more than anyone left in the draw \u2013 but he is not alongside his peers still competing for a bigger prize. While Pouille\u2019s tally of free-serving points \u2013 84 \u2013 puts him a respectable fifth in the field, he will bring a bit more than raw intimidation to the semi-finals. Only six Frenchmen in the modern era have reached this stage. Pouille is the first since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in 2010. To get there that year, he beat Djokovic, then lost to Federer in the semi-final, the Swiss going on to beat Murray in the final. It all seems so long ago.",

That story will sadden the hearts of fun-lovers, who would much prefer Mourinho to be thrust into power at PSG *before *their next Champions League fixture, which, of course, is against Manchester United, whose fortunes have turned around in exactly the manner you\u2019d expect after replacing Mourinho with a bubbly work experience intern from Norway. As if to endear themselves further to Mourinho, PSG have made a bid for a new defensive midfielder, with Everton Idrissa Gueye their prime target. And they were very confident of pipping Manchester City to the signing of the dinky midfield schemer Frenkie De Jong until Barcelona made a last-minute swoop for the Ajax prodigy, who now seems headed for the Nou Camp. Oh well, Marouane Fellaini is still available. Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s attempt to convince Mauricio Pochettino that there is no need for him to consider a summer move to Manchester United has taken an turn, as the north London club have been linked with actual transfers. With the club running out of fit attacking players, Spurs are reportedly keen on signing Youcef Atal from Nice. A right-back, albeit a strong-running one. Serge Aurier, meanwhile, is welcome to embark on a long run to China. Spurs, in fairness, are also being linked with PSV\u2019s 21-year-old winger Steve Bergwijn, who\u2019s also on Manchester United\u2019s watch list. Spurs and Manchester United might well be among the clubs to receive a CV from Rafael Ben\u00edtez in the summer, with the Spaniard said to have resolved to leave Newcastle when upon the expiry of his contract unless he is given significant backing in the transfer market this month. Off he\u2019ll go, then. Real Madrid will give their manager significant backing, specifically \u00a390m to spring Paulo Dybala from Juventus. And Aaron Ramsey might be allowed go to Juve as early as next week if Arsenal complete deals for James Rodr\u00edguez and Denis Su\u00e1rez. Arsenal are also on the lookout for a new director of football, and Roma\u2019s Monchi is said to be their top target. Lastly, with Thierry Henry\u2019s management career getting off to a start every bit as impressive as his punditry career as Tuesday\u2019s elimination from the Coupe de France gives him a record of four wins from 20 matches at Monaco so far - there\u2019s talk that a change of direction might be in order at Monaco.",

The last few weeks have seen major unrest in Sudan, where citizens, angry at the removal of a bread subsidy (among many other things), have taken to the streets to protest against the regime of Omar al-Bashir. This week Peter Beaumont and Zeinab Mohammed Salih look at how Sudan got to this latest important crossroads, while on page 45 Nesrine Malik wonders where the celebrities who were so prominent in the campaign to save Darfur are now that ordinary people are rising up to try to topple Bashir. We also have a report from our Africa correspondent Jason Burke on an anti-fuel tax uprising in Zimbabwe. The state response to which has brought back some of the worst memories of the Mugabe regime.

Real revolution is unlikely to come through the courts of Eton College. But kids like Patel, who manage to circumvent cycles of privilege, have the resources and the impetus to bring about real change. \u2022 Biba Kang is a freelance journalist based in London",

On New Year\u2019s Day, Kanakadurga, 39, along with Bindu Ammini, became the first women to enter the inner sanctum of Kerala state\u2019s Sabarimala temple, one of the country\u2019s holiest Hindu sites. The supreme court had in September declared unconstitutional a customary ban on women aged between 10 and 50 from entering the temple, a hill shrine located at the end of a three-mile trek through dense mountainous forest. Kanakadurga, Ammini and hundreds of other women had attempted to reach Sabarimala once it reopened after September\u2019s verdict but were turned away by sometimes violent protesters, mostly men, who see the court\u2019s decision as inappropriate state intervention in a religious matter.

Dozens more, including some in men\u2019s clothing, have been turned back by demonstrators, backed by the temple\u2019s administrators.

      "bodyText": "More than a dozen celebrities, including Alexa Chung and Ellie Goulding, have pledged to change the way they label social media posts after Britain\u2019s competition watchdog clamped down on the practice of stars being paid for endorsing products without disclosing they were being rewarded by the company. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had secured formal commitments from 16 celebrities to state clearly if they have been paid or received any gifts or loans of products that they endorse. The celebrities, with millions of followers on social media, include the singers Goulding and Rita Ora, the models Chung and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the former Coronation Street and Our Girl actor Michelle Keegan, the former Towie actor Mario Falcone, the model James Chapman (known for his men\u2019s fashion YouTube channel), and the TV reality stars Millie Mackintosh and Megan McKenna. Online endorsements from celebrities or bloggers can help brands boost sales as fans follow their social media channels to see where they go on holiday, what they wear or eat and which products they use. Social media influencers can earn tens of thousands of pounds from companies for a single post. However, where they are paid or rewarded to promote a product in their social media feeds, consumer protection law requires them to disclose this. If they don\u2019t, they can be prosecuted by the CMA and fines could then be imposed. Breaking a court order could lead to two years in prison. The watchdog has published a guide for influencers. The CMA\u2019s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: \u201cInfluencers can have a huge impact on what their fans decide to buy. People could, quite rightly, feel misled if what they thought was a recommendation from someone they admired turns out to be a marketing ploy. \u201cYou should be able to tell as soon as you look at a post if there is some form of payment or reward involved, so you can decide whether something is really worth spending your hard-earned money on.\u201d Warning letters have been sent to a number of other celebrities and influencers, as well as 70 advertising and PR agencies, since the CMA began its investigation in August. It hopes the 16 celebrities who have given formal commitments will lead by example and that others will follow suit. All of them co-operated with the CMA and volunteered to make changes to their practices. Some high-profile influencers use the hashtag #ad on social media to disclose when they have been paid to post about a product. But the CMA concluded that was not enough as it could be buried among other hashtags and said a commercial relationship must be clearly declared in the post. The watchdog said three out of five people it had interviewed said they had been influenced by celebrities. The London-based fashion label Kitri sold out of its \u00a3145 Gabriella dress in less than an hour after a fashion blogger posted a picture of it on Instagram. The CMA said it would investigate further to look at the role and responsibilities of social media platforms. The Advertising Standards Authority is also investigating after a surge in the number of complaints.",

But critical support could only do so much and despite a Golden Globe nomination, Pike couldn\u2019t break into the Oscar conversation.",

      "body": "<p>The novelist Gerald Murnane is something of a writer\u2019s writer\u2019s writer. He is celebrated but not much read in his native Australia, or in Britain (the last of his novels to be published here, so far as I can tell, was <em>Inland</em>, in 1988). But elsewhere his reputation as an author of strange and luminous books is well established: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/03/ben-lerner-1004-novel-books-interview\" title=\"\">Ben Lerner</a>, JM Coetzee and Teju Cole are all fans, and a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/magazine/gerald-murnane-next-nobel-laureate-literature-australia.html\" title=\"\">profile in the New York Times last year</a> tipped him for the Nobel prize.</p> <p>Now Sheffield-based small press And Other Stories is publishing five of his novels in the UK, starting with his most recent, <em>Border Districts</em> (which Murnane has said will be his last, though he has given up writing fiction before: he turns 80 this year), and his first, <em>Tamarisk Row</em>. Reading these books alongside each other shows that, while his style has developed over the years, many of his interests have remained the same. His central themes \u2013 parochialism, the workings of memory, the Australian landscape, Catholicism, horse racing \u2013 have been there from the beginning. So too have many of what he calls the individual \u201cmental images\u201d (instances in which characters keep records, or perceive things through coloured glass, or half-closed eyes) from which he assembles his novels. Though his books are deftly crafted, he\u2019s not very interested in plot. Instead he wants to show the world as it seems (\u201cseems\u201d is a very Murnane word); how our minds and memories mediate it.</p> <p><em>Tamarisk Row</em> is written in the present tense in close third-person narration, as a series of short chapters with descriptive, perfunctory titles such as \u201cMr Glasscock ill-treats his family\u201d and \u201cAugustine tells Clement how to avoid temptation\u201d. The sentences are long, sweeping and rhythmically complex, taking convoluted digressions before returning, eventually, to their beginnings in order to end.</p> <p>The novel focuses on a boy named Clement Killeaton growing up in the town of Bassett just after the second world war.

      "bodyText": "The novelist Gerald Murnane is something of a writer\u2019s writer\u2019s writer. He is celebrated but not much read in his native Australia, or in Britain (the last of his novels to be published here, so far as I can tell, was Inland, in 1988). But elsewhere his reputation as an author of strange and luminous books is well established: Ben Lerner, JM Coetzee and Teju Cole are all fans, and a profile in the New York Times last year tipped him for the Nobel prize. Now Sheffield-based small press And Other Stories is publishing five of his novels in the UK, starting with his most recent, Border Districts (which Murnane has said will be his last, though he has given up writing fiction before: he turns 80 this year), and his first, Tamarisk Row. Reading these books alongside each other shows that, while his style has developed over the years, many of his interests have remained the same. His central themes \u2013 parochialism, the workings of memory, the Australian landscape, Catholicism, horse racing \u2013 have been there from the beginning. So too have many of what he calls the individual \u201cmental images\u201d (instances in which characters keep records, or perceive things through coloured glass, or half-closed eyes) from which he assembles his novels. Though his books are deftly crafted, he\u2019s not very interested in plot. Instead he wants to show the world as it seems (\u201cseems\u201d is a very Murnane word); how our minds and memories mediate it. Tamarisk Row is written in the present tense in close third-person narration, as a series of short chapters with descriptive, perfunctory titles such as \u201cMr Glasscock ill-treats his family\u201d and \u201cAugustine tells Clement how to avoid temptation\u201d. The sentences are long, sweeping and rhythmically complex, taking convoluted digressions before returning, eventually, to their beginnings in order to end. The novel focuses on a boy named Clement Killeaton growing up in the town of Bassett just after the second world war. Clement\u2019s Catholic father, Augustine, is a gambler who spends his weekends at distant racecourses hoping for a big win. Early in his career he tasted success with a horse of his own, Clementia, which was then injured, and he has lived on the fumes of his dreams ever since. Clement, an only child, is a loner who spends much of his time in his garden, which he has turned in his imagination into a vast landscape populated by farms and racecourses. When he is not using marbles to recreate imaginary horse races he tries to find out about sex and has run-ins with a local gang. It is often difficult to know who the narrator of the novel is supposed to be, or to ascribe the frequent passages of free indirect discourse to individual characters within it. At one point Clement\u2019s friend Desmond tells him that as soon as school has broken up he is going on holiday to Melbourne where \u201cin a long street in a [\u2026] suburb named after a tree or a flower, in a house with lawn between the footpath and the gutter, his little sweetheart waits for him\u201d. This isn\u2019t quite Desmond\u2019s language, and nor is it Clement\u2019s, though the indeterminacy of \u201ca tree or a flower\u201d suggests the narrator is not omniscient, either. Rather, with that \u201clittle sweetheart\u201d \u2013 which is both indulgent and condescending \u2013 it reads as though an adult storyteller is trying to imagine the mind of a boy at one remove. Tamarisk Row is filled with such moments of fertile ambiguity or misreading. In another scene Augustine is talking to his horse racing friends outside church. Clement asks his father for money to buy a newspaper. \u201cAugustine makes a face,\u201d the narrator reports, \u201cthat is meant to show the men that he is exasperated with his son but not able to refuse him.\u201d After he has handed over the money, Clement \u201casks in a voice that is meant to sound innocent and girlish \u2013 can I buy myself a chocolate malted milk too please Dad?\u201d Here Augustine must perform his exasperation to his friends, just as his son performs for him, and the narrator\u2019s knowingness allows us to see through both performances.

It became a park in the 1990s and was last year transformed into a \u201csponge site\u201d, with permeable pavements, rain gardens, grass swales, artificial ponds and wetlands. The idea is that these features absorb excessive rainfall through soil infiltration and retain it in underground tunnels and storage tanks, only discharging it into the river once water levels there are low enough.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe air is always fresh here,\u201d says retired electrical engineer Liao Baozheng as he walks in the park. \u201cIn Wuhan\u2019s scorching summer, it\u2019s cooler here as the lush vegetation brings down the temperature by two or three degrees.\u201d</p> \n<p>Under the sponge city scheme, Wuhan and the other participating areas must ensure that 20% of their urban land includes sponge features by 2020, with a target of being able to retain 70% of storm water. For Wuhan that equates to just over 170 sq km of a total urban area of 860 sq km, and last year the sponge projects were rolled out to a further nine districts.</p> \n<p>The nationwide programme has been expanded to cover 30 cities. By 2030, participants must ensure that 80% of their urban land includes sponge features.</p> \n<p>Wen Mei Dubbelaar, director of water management at Arcadis China, which is working as a consultant to Wuhan\u2019s water department on sponge city projects, says the key is to \u201cgive space back to the river \u2026 [instead of] fighting the water\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2410ee75decf8e186b4be4a64fdd700209c45f63\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2410ee75decf8e186b4be4a64fdd700209c45f63/0_0_4242_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wuhan residents cross a flooded street on a row of tables in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wuhan residents cross a flooded street on a row of tables in 2012.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cRain gardens, grass swales and low elevation green belt are a low-impact way of creating more space to catch the rainfall,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re particularly suitable for Wuhan because the city has a relatively high level of groundwater and it is almost impossible to let the water seep underground.\u201d</p> \n<p>Retrofitting old residential communities is a particular challenge because there is little space left for construction and existing drainage systems are often outdated and worn out. Such projects can be eye-wateringly expensive. Transforming the 3.8 sq km Nanganqu site involved a total investment of 1.26bn yuan, through a public-private partnership where 20% of the funds came from city government and the rest from the private sector \u2013 in this case the iron and steel company that built the affected residential areas for workers in the 1970s and 80s.</p> \n<p>Central government subsidies for the sponge cities projects are only set to last until 2020, so scaling up the scheme to cover 80% of the city by 2030 will be a \u201chuge burden\u201d unless the local government finds ways to involve more private investors, says Dr Faith Chan, assistant professor in geographical sciences at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. \u201cOne possible way is to involve real estate developers, because such sponge sites do help increase the value of the land.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even if the sponge city projects are fully implemented, this emerging megacity faces severe challenges.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are no golden standards, but cities like Tokyo and Singapore could handle one-in-100-year storms,\u201d Chan says<strong>. </strong>\u201cIn China, most drainage systems are [currently] designed to deal with at most a one-in-10-year storm. Once the sponge city projects are complete, Wuhan should be able to handle a one-in-30-year storm.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">explore our archive here</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Take a stroll down the central Chinese city\u2019s Fan Lake Road or Fruit Lake Street and despite their names you won\u2019t see any large bodies of water \u2013 unless it has been raining very hard, that is. Wuhan was once known as \u201cthe city of a hundred lakes\u201d. It had 127 lakes in its central area alone in the 1980s, but decades of rapid urbanisation mean only around 30 survive. Located at the merging of the Yangtze and Han rivers, this low-lying city, the capital of Hubei province, has always been prone to floods, especially in the summer monsoon months. The street names are often the only reminder of the lakes and pools that been filled in and built over, but in 2016, after a week of torrential downpours, they filled with water again. As metro stations and roads flooded, 14 people died and some urban communities were temporarily cut off from the rest of the city. The economic cost was estimated at 2.3bn yuan (\u00a3263m). The authorities blamed poor drainage and said Wuhan\u2019s low-lying geography made it hard for storm water to be discharged into the Yangtze when water levels in the river were high. Many locals blamed the loss of the city\u2019s lakes. The 2016 floods were a wakeup call. With the latest UN figures projecting Wuhan\u2019s population will exceed 10 million by 2035, the situation remains critical. The year before the floods, Wuhan had been declared one of the country\u2019s first 16 \u201csponge cities\u201d \u2013 areas piloting ecologically friendly alternatives to traditional flood defences and drainage systems. The pace of that project has been accelerated, with a total of 228 projects in the two pilot districts of Qingshan and Sixin to retrofit public spaces, schools and residential areas with sponge features. More than 38.5 sq km of the city has been retrofitted so far, at a cost of 11bn yuan. Nanganqu Park, which lies in the east near a large iron and steel company, was a dirty drainage ditch in the 1980s. It became a park in the 1990s and was last year transformed into a \u201csponge site\u201d, with permeable pavements, rain gardens, grass swales, artificial ponds and wetlands. The idea is that these features absorb excessive rainfall through soil infiltration and retain it in underground tunnels and storage tanks, only discharging it into the river once water levels there are low enough. \u201cThe air is always fresh here,\u201d says retired electrical engineer Liao Baozheng as he walks in the park. \u201cIn Wuhan\u2019s scorching summer, it\u2019s cooler here as the lush vegetation brings down the temperature by two or three degrees.\u201d Under the sponge city scheme, Wuhan and the other participating areas must ensure that 20% of their urban land includes sponge features by 2020, with a target of being able to retain 70% of storm water. For Wuhan that equates to just over 170 sq km of a total urban area of 860 sq km, and last year the sponge projects were rolled out to a further nine districts. The nationwide programme has been expanded to cover 30 cities. By 2030, participants must ensure that 80% of their urban land includes sponge features. Wen Mei Dubbelaar, director of water management at Arcadis China, which is working as a consultant to Wuhan\u2019s water department on sponge city projects, says the key is to \u201cgive space back to the river \u2026 [instead of] fighting the water\u201d. \u201cRain gardens, grass swales and low elevation green belt are a low-impact way of creating more space to catch the rainfall,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re particularly suitable for Wuhan because the city has a relatively high level of groundwater and it is almost impossible to let the water seep underground.\u201d Retrofitting old residential communities is a particular challenge because there is little space left for construction and existing drainage systems are often outdated and worn out. Such projects can be eye-wateringly expensive. Transforming the 3.8 sq km Nanganqu site involved a total investment of 1.26bn yuan, through a public-private partnership where 20% of the funds came from city government and the rest from the private sector \u2013 in this case the iron and steel company that built the affected residential areas for workers in the 1970s and 80s. Central government subsidies for the sponge cities projects are only set to last until 2020, so scaling up the scheme to cover 80% of the city by 2030 will be a \u201chuge burden\u201d unless the local government finds ways to involve more private investors, says Dr Faith Chan, assistant professor in geographical sciences at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. \u201cOne possible way is to involve real estate developers, because such sponge sites do help increase the value of the land.\u201d Even if the sponge city projects are fully implemented, this emerging megacity faces severe challenges. \u201cThere are no golden standards, but cities like Tokyo and Singapore could handle one-in-100-year storms,\u201d Chan says. \u201cIn China, most drainage systems are [currently] designed to deal with at most a one-in-10-year storm. Once the sponge city projects are complete, Wuhan should be able to handle a one-in-30-year storm.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here",

      "body": "<p>By any measure our prisons are in a state of crisis. Last year, there were almost 50,000 incidents of self-harm among the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/safety-in-custody-quarterly-update-to-june-2018\" title=\"\">82,500 prisoners</a> in England and Wales. Drug-fuelled violence is at an all-time high, with more than 32,500 assaults, 10,000 of which were against staff. At least 87 prisoners took their own lives, five were murdered and more than 300 died of ill-health or natural causes. The scale of the problem is not lost on the prisons minister, Rory Stewart, who has vowed to resign if he doesn\u2019t achieve improvements.</p> <p>One of the major reasons that there is so much violence is that there are too many drugs, and one of the reasons for that is insufficient perimeter security, says Stewart. He intends to make it more difficult for criminals to get drugs into prisons. Stewart is focusing on 10 of the worst-performing prisons, including Wormwood Scrubs, Leeds and Nottingham, which he dubs his \u201c 10-prison project\u201d. They have been given an extra budget of \u00a310m to improve safety and tackle drug-taking on top of the \u00a360m the government has allocated to prisons since last July.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/12/jail-terms-of-six-months-or-less-could-be-scrapped-prisons-minister-suggests\">Jail terms of six months or less could be scrapped, prisons minister suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have to move to airport-style security, where every single prison officer, every member of staff goes through an airport-style security check every day. Anyone, in fact, who enters a prison, including me.\u201d Why? Stewart says this would ensure contraband is picked up, but more importantly, that staff who could come under pressure from a criminal, \u201csometimes it\u2019s not that they themselves are criminals, but they\u2019re being blackmailed, or their family is being threatened\u201d, can then say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do it because they are searching me every single day.\u201d He also wants staff lockers to be outside the prison gates. \u201cA single transparent bag, going through an x-ray scanner is all they should be able to take in. We should have a clear expectation that they put on their uniforms before going in \u2013 all of that needs to happen.\u201d</p> <p>But surely the obvious way to reduce violence would be to reduce prison numbers, particularly among those serving short sentences who make up the highest number of reoffenders? Stewart implies that he would like to scrap sentences of less than three months. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt that the wrong kind of short sentence can damage the individual and ultimately damage the public because it can lead to more reoffending,\u201d he says. It is \u201clong enough to damage the person and not long enough to change their life\u201d.</p> <p>He cites HMP Durham, where the average stay is 10 days. \u201cWhat is a prison supposed to do with someone in 10 days?\u201d Stewart wants to be clearer with the public, as well as magistrates, judges and MPs that \u201cthe wrong kind of short prison sentence leads to more reoffending and endangers the public \u2013 it\u2019s shortsighted. If you\u2019re going to lock somebody up, then you need to have the time to do a proper intervention.\u201d</p> <p>Scotland has legislated for a presumption against prison sentences of less than 12 months. Is the Scottish justice system showing us the way? \u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed by the early stuff we\u2019ve got from Scotland. I think we can learn a lot from Scotland, and we\u2019re looking very actively at that,\u201d he says. \u201cRemember our legal system is slightly different \u2013 the way in which we\u2019d have to do it would be slightly different. We\u2019d have to bring magistrates, judges, the media and parliament with us \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be tricky. But the fundamental point we have to keep returning to is that although somebody might think that giving someone a short prison sentence is good because it protects the public, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e438803193a9d3c115144e032e61a36563fb499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e438803193a9d3c115144e032e61a36563fb499/0_96_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man sticking feet onto bars of prison window\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bars on prison windows will be outlawed in new prisons</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stewart, like the justice secretary, David Gauke, still thinks prison can rehabilitate offenders, but recognises that too many prisoners spend most of the day locked in their cells. On the day we meet, an inspection report released on Swinfen Hall Young Offender Institution said that half of the young male prisoners were locked in their cells for 22 hours a day, which is <a href=\"https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprisons/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/07/6.5053_HMI-Prisons_AR-2017-18_revised_web.pdf\" title=\"\">par for the course</a>. Stewart wants to bring back more vocational courses. \u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019ve set up a whole new procurement system and signed up new providers is to give governors the freedom to say, yes there\u2019s a demand in my prison for plastering, there\u2019s a demand outside the wall for plastering \u2013 we\u2019re going to deliver that. You can see it beginning to happen. In [Swinfen Hall] they\u2019re learning industrial window cleaning. You can see in HMP Lindholm very interesting stuff going on with people studying architectural skills. In HMP Stamford Hill there\u2019s construction courses, in HMP Humber there are people studying design, studying textiles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/11/sport-prevent-reoffending-prisons-justice-system\">How sport in prison could stop reoffending | Rosie Meek</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut there are other things we need to do as well. We need to make sure there are enough prison officers to safely unlock people and move them from A to B. Getting more staff in is going to be key to that. We currently have 3,500 more prison officers than we did four years ago. So that\u2019s a big improvement.\u201d</p> <p>Stewart likes detail. So as part of his mantra of \u201cgetting the basics right\u201d he has overseen the creation of a prison officers\u2019 handbook<strong> </strong>at the 10 jails, which he plans to roll out across the prison estate. The aim is to set standards for how to conduct cell inspections, deal with a prisoner and ensure everyone has a decent living environment. A \u201cstandards team\u201d will then work with inexperienced officers to explain how to do it. What does he plan to do about the scourge of drugs in jails? In 2017, almost <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Bromley%20Briefings/Autumn%202018%20Factfile.pdf\" title=\"\">a fifth of a tonne of drugs, 189kgs</a>, were seized in prisons. Last year, one in five prisoners gave positive drug tests \u2013 the highest rate since 2006. That level of drug supply implies some level of collusion among some officers, surely? \u201cBy and large our prison officers are fantastic, the vast majority are doing a terrific job, but we do have some corrupt prison officers. One way of addressing it is to look at the internal culture, management training and leadership \u2013 the way you run prisons \u2013 and we are doing that. The second way is that we just have to make it much, much more difficult for people to get drugs into prison.\u201d</p> <p>The recent introduction of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAVA_spray\" title=\"\">Pava</a> spray has got the backs of prison reformers up. Was it really necessary to further weaponise prison officers? \u201cIt\u2019s not about weapons, it\u2019s about relationships,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a prisoner is kicking the head of another prisoner, you need to do something.\u201d At the moment there are only two choices available to a prison officer \u2013 they can wade in with their body, or they can pull a baton. \u201cMy view is that the spray is safer. Safer for the prisoner, safer for the prison officer. Because Pava spray is newer than a baton, people somehow believe that it\u2019s worse than a baton. The reality is it\u2019s much safer. You can kill someone with a baton. The laws of governance on these two things are identical. We\u2019re not expecting people to use Pava spray in a way that they wouldn\u2019t have previously used a baton.\u201d A report on the pilot use of Pava though indicates that officers often drew the spray in order to enforce prison rules rather than as a last resort. \u201cCertainly it shouldn\u2019t be used to ask a prisoner to get behind the door. But when there is a threat of serious danger, having the Pava spray in certain situations can save lives. So I\u2019m not apologetic about that.\u201d</p> <p>Is it true that new prisons will not have bars on the windows? \u201cIf we can design windows that you can\u2019t get out of, that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d he says. \u201cThe advantage of not having bars is that you can have more natural light, which makes a huge difference. Very, very sadly we have far too much suicide and self-harm in prison, so we need to create more pleasant environments for people. I think it\u2019s an opportunity to show the world what a really intelligent, smart, modern building can look like. That is good for prison officers, good for prisoners, good for families and good for the public. Treating prisoners well, turning their lives around, protects the public, saves the public from the misery of crime.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27d59f2d84d81015f4236654d8b1baedd0d56c25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27d59f2d84d81015f4236654d8b1baedd0d56c25/0_174_4713_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prisoner with a phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m a big supporter of in-cell telephone, a big supporter of goats and dogs\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But how do you get that message out to the public and get them on side?

I visited Rikers Island in the States and one of the best programmes there is dog training. Rescue dogs are taken in with a handler, and some enhanced prisoners can keep the dog on their cell overnight.\u201d</p> <p>But the biggest challenge is getting the public to respect the dignity of the humanity of prisoners. Is that too much to hope for?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/08/prison-praised-for-installing-photobooth-for-inmates-and-visitors\">Prison praised for installing photobooth for inmates and visitors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re getting there,\u201d he says. \u201cI think society and culture is changing. Increasingly when someone goes to prison now we\u2019re acknowledging publicly that 30% have been in care, half of them have a reading age under 11 \u2013 when you begin to understand that a lot of people we\u2019re dealing with in prison have mental health issues, a lot of them have had terrible childhoods \u2013 and they\u2019ve done terrible things \u2013you have to weigh these two things up. You\u2019ve got to think about the victims, you\u2019ve got to think about the public. But to prevent prisoners committing more crimes we have to understand them as humans, we need to understand their pasts, their mental state, we need to think about what therapy they could receive. We need to understand that prisoners, particularly a violent criminal who might see themselves as a heroic gangster, is often actually somebody who is in many ways suffering from very, very sad things in their lives which we can work with them on in order to change their lives. By helping people who have hurt us, you stop them hurting other people in the future.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a refreshing departure from Chris Grayling, who announced on his appointment as justice secretary in 2012 that jails would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2205824/Ill-stop-jails-like-holiday-camps-says-new-minister-justice.html\" title=\"\">no longer be holiday camps</a>\u201d. As we end our conversation, I ask Stewart quickly how significant the reduction in prison violence has to be to save him from resigning? He smiles, and answers quickly, \u201cI\u2019ve got to begin bringing it down.

On the day we meet, an inspection report released on Swinfen Hall Young Offender Institution said that half of the young male prisoners were locked in their cells for 22 hours a day, which is par for the course. Stewart wants to bring back more vocational courses. \u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019ve set up a whole new procurement system and signed up new providers is to give governors the freedom to say, yes there\u2019s a demand in my prison for plastering, there\u2019s a demand outside the wall for plastering \u2013 we\u2019re going to deliver that. You can see it beginning to happen. In [Swinfen Hall] they\u2019re learning industrial window cleaning. You can see in HMP Lindholm very interesting stuff going on with people studying architectural skills. In HMP Stamford Hill there\u2019s construction courses, in HMP Humber there are people studying design, studying textiles. \u201cBut there are other things we need to do as well. We need to make sure there are enough prison officers to safely unlock people and move them from A to B. Getting more staff in is going to be key to that. We currently have 3,500 more prison officers than we did four years ago. So that\u2019s a big improvement.\u201d Stewart likes detail. So as part of his mantra of \u201cgetting the basics right\u201d he has overseen the creation of a prison officers\u2019 handbook at the 10 jails, which he plans to roll out across the prison estate. The aim is to set standards for how to conduct cell inspections, deal with a prisoner and ensure everyone has a decent living environment. A \u201cstandards team\u201d will then work with inexperienced officers to explain how to do it. What does he plan to do about the scourge of drugs in jails? In 2017, almost a fifth of a tonne of drugs, 189kgs, were seized in prisons. Last year, one in five prisoners gave positive drug tests \u2013 the highest rate since 2006. That level of drug supply implies some level of collusion among some officers, surely? \u201cBy and large our prison officers are fantastic, the vast majority are doing a terrific job, but we do have some corrupt prison officers. One way of addressing it is to look at the internal culture, management training and leadership \u2013 the way you run prisons \u2013 and we are doing that. The second way is that we just have to make it much, much more difficult for people to get drugs into prison.\u201d The recent introduction of Pava spray has got the backs of prison reformers up. Was it really necessary to further weaponise prison officers? \u201cIt\u2019s not about weapons, it\u2019s about relationships,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a prisoner is kicking the head of another prisoner, you need to do something.\u201d At the moment there are only two choices available to a prison officer \u2013 they can wade in with their body, or they can pull a baton. \u201cMy view is that the spray is safer. Safer for the prisoner, safer for the prison officer. Because Pava spray is newer than a baton, people somehow believe that it\u2019s worse than a baton. The reality is it\u2019s much safer. You can kill someone with a baton. The laws of governance on these two things are identical. We\u2019re not expecting people to use Pava spray in a way that they wouldn\u2019t have previously used a baton.\u201d A report on the pilot use of Pava though indicates that officers often drew the spray in order to enforce prison rules rather than as a last resort. \u201cCertainly it shouldn\u2019t be used to ask a prisoner to get behind the door. But when there is a threat of serious danger, having the Pava spray in certain situations can save lives. So I\u2019m not apologetic about that.\u201d Is it true that new prisons will not have bars on the windows? \u201cIf we can design windows that you can\u2019t get out of, that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d he says. \u201cThe advantage of not having bars is that you can have more natural light, which makes a huge difference. Very, very sadly we have far too much suicide and self-harm in prison, so we need to create more pleasant environments for people. I think it\u2019s an opportunity to show the world what a really intelligent, smart, modern building can look like. That is good for prison officers, good for prisoners, good for families and good for the public. Treating prisoners well, turning their lives around, protects the public, saves the public from the misery of crime.\u201d But how do you get that message out to the public and get them on side? Recent reports of in-cell telephones and prisoners rearing goats and training dogs upset some sections of the popular press. \u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of in-cell telephones, a big supporter of goats and dogs,\u201d he says. \u201cI like all this stuff. I visited Rikers Island in the States and one of the best programmes there is dog training. Rescue dogs are taken in with a handler, and some enhanced prisoners can keep the dog on their cell overnight.\u201d But the biggest challenge is getting the public to respect the dignity of the humanity of prisoners. Is that too much to hope for? \u201cI think we\u2019re getting there,\u201d he says. \u201cI think society and culture is changing. Increasingly when someone goes to prison now we\u2019re acknowledging publicly that 30% have been in care, half of them have a reading age under 11 \u2013 when you begin to understand that a lot of people we\u2019re dealing with in prison have mental health issues, a lot of them have had terrible childhoods \u2013 and they\u2019ve done terrible things \u2013you have to weigh these two things up. You\u2019ve got to think about the victims, you\u2019ve got to think about the public. But to prevent prisoners committing more crimes we have to understand them as humans, we need to understand their pasts, their mental state, we need to think about what therapy they could receive. We need to understand that prisoners, particularly a violent criminal who might see themselves as a heroic gangster, is often actually somebody who is in many ways suffering from very, very sad things in their lives which we can work with them on in order to change their lives. By helping people who have hurt us, you stop them hurting other people in the future.\u201d It\u2019s a refreshing departure from Chris Grayling, who announced on his appointment as justice secretary in 2012 that jails would \u201cno longer be holiday camps\u201d. As we end our conversation, I ask Stewart quickly how significant the reduction in prison violence has to be to save him from resigning? He smiles, and answers quickly, \u201cI\u2019ve got to begin bringing it down. If it\u2019s still going up in August \u2013 I\u2019m gone.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 46. Family: Married, two sons.

That\u2019s happened in Germany, where republication has gone down very well \u2026 I hope he can find an audience here too.\u201d",

The numbers may not be enough for May to win support for her deal, given continued opposition from a hardcore of Brexiters who also object to the \u00a339bn financial settlement, those with personal grudges against the prime minister and Tory remainers hoping for a second referendum. However, some Brexiter MPs or those in seats which voted leave have suggested in recent days that there is a path to win their support. \u201cThere are clearly forces at work to block and frustrate Brexit and the most important thing, whether it\u2019s good deal, no deal or whatever, is that we leave,\u201d said Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield. \u201cThe public and leave voters will accept nothing less and that means that, yes, I will vote for a revised deal that doesn\u2019t include a permanent backstop because, whilst I still have issues with it, those issues are then temporary and our leaving on 29 March is absolutely secured.\u201d It came as George Osborne, the former chancellor, told the BBC in Davos that delaying the UK\u2019s exit from the EU was now the \u201cmost likely\u201d option.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Rebel MPs hint they could vote for revised agreement</h2> <p>Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today.</p> <p>Some of Britain\u2019s biggest corporate names have dealt a blow to Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/22/no-deal-brexit-panic-grips-major-uk-firms\">by pressing the panic button</a> and reorganising their business operations in case of a no-deal Brexit. Sir James Dyson, the Brexit-backing billionaire, inflicted the biggest embarrassment for the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/22/dyson-to-move-company-hq-to-singapore\">when his company announced plans to \u201cfuture-proof\u2019\u201d itself</a> by moving its headquarters to Singapore. Our business columnist, Nils Pratley, says Sir James has chosen the moment of maximum Brexit pain for the PM to make the decision and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jan/22/come-on-mr-dyson-future-proof-your-company-against-what\">must explain himself </a>or people will think he is guilty of hypocrisy. Dyson was followed by historic cross-Channel ferry company P&amp;O, which said its fleet would be re-registered under the Cypriot flag, and Sony said it was moving its European base from London to Amsterdam. The CBI said the corporate alarm bells showed that a no-deal Brexit \u201cmust be ruled out immediately\u201d.</p> <p>Back in Westminster, there was some hope that the government could avert the dreaded no deal after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/22/tory-hardliners-reconsider-may-deal-amid-fears-that-brexit-could-be-blocked\">some rebel MPs hinted they would back No 10\u2019s Brexit agreement</a> in order to make sure Britain left the EU. The snag is that ministers will still have to find some way around the equally vexed Irish backstop problem. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said for the first time that the UK and Ireland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/22/irish-pm-tells-uk-only-bilateral-deal-would-prevent-post-brexit-hard-border\">would have to negotiate a bilateral agreement on \u201cfull alignment\u201d of customs</a> if a no-deal Brexit went ahead. In Davos, former chancellor George Osborne has said he thinks a delay to Brexit is now the most likely outcome. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>US shutdown hope \u2013 </strong>An end to the month-long partial shutdown of the US government could be in sight after Senate leaders said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/22/senate-republicans-shutdown-bill-trump-plan\">they would vote on two new funding measures tomorrow</a>. A Republican-backed bill would meet Donald Trump\u2019s demand for a $5.7bn wall along the Mexican border in exchange for temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants. The second would extend funding for the agencies that are currently closed through to 8 February. Minority leader Chuck Schumer hailed the second bill as a compromise that would allow 800,000 workers to be paid while talks continued on the wall.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Court crash \u2013 </strong>A failure of the court service\u2019s IT system has caused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/23/law-courts-in-chaos-as-it-meltdown-disrupts-thousands-of-cases\">thousands of cases to be been disrupted or delayed across England and Wales</a>. The repeated crashes, which started last week, come as the ministry of justice is spending millions to promote online hearings to replace the legal profession\u2019s traditional reliance on paperwork. Staff at the ministry were unable to send emails, jurors could not be enrolled and courts were left unsure of when some defendants were due to appear, leading to prosecutions being adjourned. The ministry said staff were \u201cworking hard\u201d to restore access to the system.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Fuelling controversy \u2013 </strong>The UK gives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/23/uk-has-biggest-fossil-fuel-subsidies-in-the-eu-finds-commission\">more subsidies to fossil fuels than any other European Union country</a>, according to a report that also shows that handouts for coal, oil and gas still far outstrip money for renewable energy. The study by the European Commission said the government gave \u20ac12bn (\u00a310.5bn) a year to support fossil fuels in the UK, significantly more than the \u20ac8.3bn spent on renewable energy. By contrast, Germany provided \u20ac27bn for renewable energy, almost three times the \u20ac9.5bn given to fossil fuels. However, a significant part of the UK fossil fuel subsidies identified by the commission was in the form of the reduced 5% rate of VAT on domestic power bills, cut from 20%.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Hacked off \u2013 </strong>Elton John and his husband, David Furnish, are close to settling a phone-hacking claim with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/22/phone-hacking-was-widespread-at-the-sun-high-court-told\">just weeks before the case was due to go to trial</a>. An agreement with News UK could avoid a high-profile trial over claims journalists at the Sun were involved in illegally obtaining voicemails. The newspaper denies the allegations. The media group has settled dozens of claims with celebrities over phone hacking by journalists in a scandal that led to the closure of the Sun\u2019s sister paper, the News of the World, in 2011. Two \u201cbig ticket\u201d claims by Liz Hurley and Heather Mills are due to go to trial on 4 February.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09a2111a39caa9434009db88b3da0af25b894806\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09a2111a39caa9434009db88b3da0af25b894806/334_276_4985_2991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy and Julian Banner-Price.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy and Julian Banner-Price</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Far from Fawlty \u2013 </strong>For a town that inspired Fawlty Towers with a legendarily rude hotel owner, Torquay has come a long way.

Guillaume Liegey worries that Macron\u2019s suggestion that he will consider immigration quotas as part of his attempt to defuse the <em>gilets jaunes</em> movement risks misunderstanding voters\u2019 main gripes. Rather, he reckons, these are job insecurity, worries about money and poor public services. Overall a sense of being left behind.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Rebel MPs hint they could vote for revised agreement Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. Some of Britain\u2019s biggest corporate names have dealt a blow to Theresa May by pressing the panic button and reorganising their business operations in case of a no-deal Brexit. Sir James Dyson, the Brexit-backing billionaire, inflicted the biggest embarrassment for the prime minister when his company announced plans to \u201cfuture-proof\u2019\u201d itself by moving its headquarters to Singapore. Our business columnist, Nils Pratley, says Sir James has chosen the moment of maximum Brexit pain for the PM to make the decision and must explain himself or people will think he is guilty of hypocrisy. Dyson was followed by historic cross-Channel ferry company P&amp;O, which said its fleet would be re-registered under the Cypriot flag, and Sony said it was moving its European base from London to Amsterdam. The CBI said the corporate alarm bells showed that a no-deal Brexit \u201cmust be ruled out immediately\u201d. Back in Westminster, there was some hope that the government could avert the dreaded no deal after some rebel MPs hinted they would back No 10\u2019s Brexit agreement in order to make sure Britain left the EU. The snag is that ministers will still have to find some way around the equally vexed Irish backstop problem. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said for the first time that the UK and Ireland would have to negotiate a bilateral agreement on \u201cfull alignment\u201d of customs if a no-deal Brexit went ahead. In Davos, former chancellor George Osborne has said he thinks a delay to Brexit is now the most likely outcome. * * * US shutdown hope \u2013 An end to the month-long partial shutdown of the US government could be in sight after Senate leaders said they would vote on two new funding measures tomorrow. A Republican-backed bill would meet Donald Trump\u2019s demand for a $5.7bn wall along the Mexican border in exchange for temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants. The second would extend funding for the agencies that are currently closed through to 8 February. Minority leader Chuck Schumer hailed the second bill as a compromise that would allow 800,000 workers to be paid while talks continued on the wall. * * * Court crash \u2013 A failure of the court service\u2019s IT system has caused thousands of cases to be been disrupted or delayed across England and Wales. The repeated crashes, which started last week, come as the ministry of justice is spending millions to promote online hearings to replace the legal profession\u2019s traditional reliance on paperwork. Staff at the ministry were unable to send emails, jurors could not be enrolled and courts were left unsure of when some defendants were due to appear, leading to prosecutions being adjourned. The ministry said staff were \u201cworking hard\u201d to restore access to the system. * * * Fuelling controversy \u2013 The UK gives more subsidies to fossil fuels than any other European Union country, according to a report that also shows that handouts for coal, oil and gas still far outstrip money for renewable energy. The study by the European Commission said the government gave \u20ac12bn (\u00a310.5bn) a year to support fossil fuels in the UK, significantly more than the \u20ac8.3bn spent on renewable energy. By contrast, Germany provided \u20ac27bn for renewable energy, almost three times the \u20ac9.5bn given to fossil fuels. However, a significant part of the UK fossil fuel subsidies identified by the commission was in the form of the reduced 5% rate of VAT on domestic power bills, cut from 20%. * * * Hacked off \u2013 Elton John and his husband, David Furnish, are close to settling a phone-hacking claim with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper group just weeks before the case was due to go to trial. An agreement with News UK could avoid a high-profile trial over claims journalists at the Sun were involved in illegally obtaining voicemails. The newspaper denies the allegations. The media group has settled dozens of claims with celebrities over phone hacking by journalists in a scandal that led to the closure of the Sun\u2019s sister paper, the News of the World, in 2011. Two \u201cbig ticket\u201d claims by Liz Hurley and Heather Mills are due to go to trial on 4 February. * * * Far from Fawlty \u2013 For a town that inspired Fawlty Towers with a legendarily rude hotel owner, Torquay has come a long way. The 25, a six-bedroom B&amp;B in the Devon town, has been voted the world\u2019s best based on TripAdvisor ratings. Andy and Julian Banner-Price, who run the 25, said they were \u201cabsolutely thrilled\u201d to win but it comes as no surprise to guests who helped it to the top with an array of glowing reviews. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t do more for you. The attention to detail is just amazing,\u201d said one. Today in Focus podcast: Deadly air choking Delhi\u2019s rickshaw drivers Delhi\u2019s rickshaw drivers are on the frontline of the city\u2019s most notorious problem: horrendous air pollution. The Guardian\u2019s south Asia correspondent, Michael Safi, travels the city with Pandit, a driver whose exposure to the worsening air quality is affecting his health and his livelihood. Plus: Ana Adlerstein looks at the reality of life on the US-Mexico border in Arizona Lunchtime read: Understanding populism (it\u2019s not about migrants) With the rise of populism here and in Europe, we have an interesting piece from a French political analyst who says that his detailed study of public opinion for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s En Marche! movement shows that immigration is not a major concern for disaffected voters. Guillaume Liegey worries that Macron\u2019s suggestion that he will consider immigration quotas as part of his attempt to defuse the gilets jaunes movement risks misunderstanding voters\u2019 main gripes. Rather, he reckons, these are job insecurity, worries about money and poor public services. Overall a sense of being left behind. It\u2019s a strong read-across to our own troubles over Brexit, with Liegey warning that this year\u2019s European elections will be a crucial test of whether the political classes have learned anything. Sport Serena Williams, her movement cramped late in the match by a rolled ankle, blew a 5-1 lead in the third set and a chance to equal the 24 slam titles of Margaret Court in a dramatic Australian Open quarter-final loss to Karolina Pliskova in Melbourne. Emiliano Sala, the Argentine footballer whose plane disappeared over the Channel as he was flying to Wales after signing for Cardiff, is being remembered as a humble man who enriched everyone\u2019s lives. Usain Bolt will long be remembered as one of the greatest runners the world has ever seen, but he has finally given up on his dream of playing professional football, saying his \u201csports life is over\u201d. In cricket, a grassy pitch with bare patches means England have some difficult choices to make for the first Test against West Indies starting later today in Bridgetown. Jonathan Joseph has been added to England\u2019s Six Nations squad despite making only one appearance in the past nine months.

In its report, the administrators detail issues with Bestjet\u2019s affairs, stating that it \u201cmay have been trading whilst insolvent from early December 2018\u201d and that financial records were \u201clargely incomplete\u201d with \u201csignificant doubt\u201d about their reliability. Published by Asic on Wednesday, the report also states that computers and security equipment were removed from the company\u2019s Brisbane office before administrators were able to review their contents. The company\u2019s joint administrator, Nigel Markey, said Queensland police had been notified of the removal of security equipment from the company\u2019s Brisbane headquarters. \u201cIt is currently unclear who removed this equipment from the company\u2019s premises,\u201d Markey wrote. The report states investigations into Bestjet\u2019s finances had proved \u201cunnecessarily difficult\u201d. It states that both Rachel and Michael James had \u201cfailed to respond to our various enquires regarding the company\u2019s affairs\u201d and that the administrators had been unable to access many of the company\u2019s records. Bestjet\u2019s collapse just days before Christmas had left travellers who booked flights through the company thousands of dollars out of pocket and desperate for answers. Company records indicate there are 4,684 ordinary unsecured creditors lining up with claims estimated to be worth almost $10.8m. The company was founded by Rachel James, the wife of former Air Australia owner Michael James, just weeks after the budget airline\u2019s high-profile collapse in 2012. Air Australia was almost $100m in debt when it went under, leaving thousands of travellers stranded overseas. Its collapse led to Michael James being disqualified from managing corporations for three years by Asic. Guardian Australia has previously reported that Michael James was closely involved in the company\u2019s day to day operations and, in its report, Pilot Partners state he may have been acting as a \u201cshadow director\u201d of the company. It also reveals the administers have reported a number of potential breaches of the Corporations Act to Asic. \u201cOur investigations have revealed that the director, former director and de facto/shadow director may have breached their obligations to act in good faith and in the best interests of the company pursuant to section 180 and 181 of the act,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe administrators have completed and lodged with the Asic a report which outlines the offences that may have been committed.

It is normally prohibited to prevent trade and competition between firms from being distorted, discouraging investment and increasing costs to consumers.</p> <p>However, the EU has allowed hundreds of public investment programmes to go ahead that support businesses under a regime that the IPPR said was more flexible than it might appear.</p> <p>The report found that the EU\u2019s rules \u201care designed not to prevent its use, but to ensure it is used \u2018for sensible purposes\u2019 including aid to struggling regions, support for research and development, environmental aid and help to small and medium-sized enterprises that face challenges to expand\u201d.</p> <p>The report said: \u201cIt restricts state aid where it wastes public money and exacerbates pan-European inequalities. Moreover, EU rules do not prevent nationalisation and explicitly allow for public ownership in the rail industry and other areas of the economy.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, France spent \u00a312.7bn on state aid while Germany set aside \u00a336bn, compared with the UK\u2019s \u00a37bn.</p> <p>Subsidies to the rail sector are treated separately and show the UK could substantially increase the cash it spends each year. Britain only invests \u00a3825m a year in its rail system, according to EU, compared with Germany\u2019s \u00a310.3bn and France\u2019s \u00a310.7bn.</p> <p>Analysis of the withdrawal agreement between No 10 and Brussels indicated that the UK would be expected to follow the same state aid rules under any future relationship with the EU. The IPPR said this meant that leaving the EU would not provide any additional freedom.</p> <p>Marley Morris, an IPPR senior research fellow and lead author of the report, said: \u201cSuccessive UK governments have said their hands are tied in developing more proactive industrial policy by European Union rules.

Like the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, many of them believed that rules imposed by Brussels would constrain a leftwing government from nationalising parts of the economy and from supporting cooperatives or providing funds through state-backed local banks. State aid can range from a government tax relief scheme for investors to a local authority giving a subsidy to a property developer. It is normally prohibited to prevent trade and competition between firms from being distorted, discouraging investment and increasing costs to consumers. However, the EU has allowed hundreds of public investment programmes to go ahead that support businesses under a regime that the IPPR said was more flexible than it might appear. The report found that the EU\u2019s rules \u201care designed not to prevent its use, but to ensure it is used \u2018for sensible purposes\u2019 including aid to struggling regions, support for research and development, environmental aid and help to small and medium-sized enterprises that face challenges to expand\u201d. The report said: \u201cIt restricts state aid where it wastes public money and exacerbates pan-European inequalities. Moreover, EU rules do not prevent nationalisation and explicitly allow for public ownership in the rail industry and other areas of the economy.\u201d In 2016, France spent \u00a312.7bn on state aid while Germany set aside \u00a336bn, compared with the UK\u2019s \u00a37bn. Subsidies to the rail sector are treated separately and show the UK could substantially increase the cash it spends each year. Britain only invests \u00a3825m a year in its rail system, according to EU, compared with Germany\u2019s \u00a310.3bn and France\u2019s \u00a310.7bn. Analysis of the withdrawal agreement between No 10 and Brussels indicated that the UK would be expected to follow the same state aid rules under any future relationship with the EU. The IPPR said this meant that leaving the EU would not provide any additional freedom. Marley Morris, an IPPR senior research fellow and lead author of the report, said: \u201cSuccessive UK governments have said their hands are tied in developing more proactive industrial policy by European Union rules. But it appears that this is not, in fact, true.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK leads the European Union in giving subsidies to fossil fuels, according to a report from the European commission. It found \u20ac12bn (\u00a310.5bn) a year in support for fossil fuels in the UK, significantly more than the \u20ac8.3bn spent on renewable energy. The commission report warned that the total subsidies for coal, oil and gas across the EU remained at the same level as 2008. This is despite both the EU and G20 having long pledged to phase out the subsidies, which hamper the rapid transition to clean energy needed to fight climate change. Germany provided the biggest energy subsidies, with \u20ac27bn for renewable energy, almost three times the \u20ac9.5bn given to fossil fuels. Spain and Italy also gave more subsidies to renewable energy than fossil fuels. But along with the UK, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Ireland all gave more to fossil fuels. The report is based on 2016 Eurostat data, the latest available, and found that across the EU renewable energy received 45% of subsidies and fossil fuels 33%. The commission report said policies were being pursued to cut carbon emissions and meet the Paris climate agreement goals of limiting global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. \u201cHowever, despite this and the international commitments made in the context of G20 and G7, fossil fuel subsidies in the EU have not decreased,\u201d it said. \u201cEU and national policies might need to be reinforced to phase out such subsidies.\u201d The total fossil fuel subsidies in the EU were \u20ac55bn in 2016, the report concluded. \u201cThis is a very high number, given we are reaching the deadline for some of their [phase out] promises,\u201d said Ipek Gencsu, subsidies expert at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). A significant part of the UK fossil fuel subsidies identified by the commission is the 5% rate of VAT on domestic gas and electricity, cut from the standard 20%. The UK government did not dispute the data but denied that it provided any subsidies for fossil fuels under its own definition and that of the International Energy Agency. \u201cWe do not subsidise fossil fuels,\u201d a government spokeswoman said. \u201cWe\u2019re firmly committed to tackling climate change by using renewables, storage, interconnectors, new nuclear and more to deliver a secure and dynamic energy market at the least possible cost for consumers.\u201d Shelagh Whitley, also at ODI, was dismissive of the UK government\u2019s claim to provide no fossil fuel subsidies. \u201cThey are lying,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd.

      "body": "<p>I was born in Turkey and am now based in Lund, on the southern tip of Sweden. Most of my life I\u2019ve probably been the quintessential cosmopolitan, and proudly so. But I\u2019ve also spent too many hours in the consulates and airports of various EU countries coveting a multiple-entry Schengen visa, or enduring the suspicious looks of customs officers, to believe that I could be a \u201ccitizen of nowhere\u201d with a Turkish passport.</p> <p>My cosmopolitanism was more a moral ideal based on compassion, and did not preclude a yearning for belonging or roots. It simply defined them in a different way. I could have roots in many places, and I could nourish my need for belonging from a variety of sources.</p> <p>With this background, it is not very surprising that I took up a job offer in Sweden in 2011. To be sure, it was not easy to adapt to the notorious Nordic winter and the idiosyncrasies of the Swedish way of life, not least the obsession with moderation (\u201c<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/lagom-sweden-hygge-lifestyle-trends\" title=\"\">lagom</a></em>\u201d) and modesty (\u201c<em>jantelagen</em>\u201d), which manifests itself as an unwavering commitment to consensus and the need to avoid confrontation at all costs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The yearning for home, or to protect one\u2019s home, does not entail isolation, for there are many definitions of homes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sweden has become one of my many homes, and with the birth of my son in 2013, it became the first among equals. Having a family and living in a small university town was perfectly compatible with my understanding of cosmopolitanism, which, drawing on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/11/my-week-living-as-a-stoic-like-a-buddhist-with-attitude-but-hard-to-do-hungover\" title=\"\">Stoics</a>, regarded these affiliations as a series of concentric circles, starting with the local and extending into the societal and global. I could not imagine at that point that my cosmopolitanism would begin to crack under the pressure of several developments.</p> <p>First, I started to appreciate the value of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/aug/29/how-spanish-influenza-helped-create-sweden-modern-welfare-state-ostersund\" title=\"\">Sweden\u2019s welfare state</a>, which for four and a half years took great care of my son after he fell seriously ill and until he passed away in July 2018. I developed a sense of loyalty to the social contract that underpinned the Swedish state \u2013 a feeling I\u2019d never felt before, either in the country where I was born and raised, or in others where I\u2019d spent a good chunk of my life. I wasn\u2019t even a citizen of Sweden (though my son was), but that did not matter when it came to a child\u2019s life, nor did the amount of taxes I paid or the type of permit I held.</p> <p>But I was also exposed to the more unpleasant aspects of the Swedish social contract: a token egalitarianism that trumps all notions of meritocracy, an extreme understanding of political correctness, and a corporatist alliance between employers and labour unions. These aspects are little known to outsiders, who often tend to glorify the \u201cSwedish model\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6d7a9cb86f59e714aa265b390bfdc77fcf059bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6d7a9cb86f59e714aa265b390bfdc77fcf059bd/0_30_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson giving a speech in Landskrona, southern Sweden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson giving a speech in Landskrona, southern Sweden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Nilsson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After my son\u2019s funeral, I travelled outside Sweden to resume a nomadic lifestyle. I was torn. I now had a better understanding of the tensions between citizenship and a borderless universalism, or the type of cosmopolitanism the likes of Theresa May or Nigel Farage have attacked. I\u2019d witnessed the immense pressure that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/sweden-asylum-seekers-refugees-policy-reversal\" title=\"\">refugee crisis of 2015-16</a> placed on the Swedish government. Then came the unstoppable rise of the anti-immigration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/26/weden-democrats-far-right-flourished-elite-lost-touch\" title=\"\">Sweden Democrats</a> party, which would soon become the third largest in parliament.</p> <p>I also found myself to a certain extent sympathising with the opprobrium that populist demagogues and rightwing commentators heaped on prevailing forms of political correctness. I\u2019d become the victim of such vigilantism myself, one that pays little heed to due process or other fundamental values such as empathy.</p> <p>On top of that, the Europe I\u2019d sought refuge in was not the Europe I once thought it was. Sweden was simply following in the footsteps of a host of other countries that were mutilated by the far-right juggernaut. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/03/europe-xenophobes-continent-poland-hungary-austria-nationalism-migrants\" title=\"\">Nationalism</a> was \u2013 once again \u2013 the order of the day, with a slightly different script in which the lead role was given to \u201cthreatened white majorities\u201d or \u201cmajority ethnic anxieties\u201d. All this happened under the watchful eyes of academic snipers who did not hesitate to target any remaining sign of more universalist visions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/09/italians-pro-eu-italy-european-project\">Italians used to be fervently pro-EU. What went wrong? | Stefano Montefiori</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Basically, I had two options. The easy one was to jump on the bandwagon, recant my earlier cosmopolitan convictions and start penning pieces about the virtues of the rightwing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/03/what-is-populism-trump-farage-orban-bolsonaro\" title=\"\">populist</a> backlash. This would require adopting a politics of euphemism where good old nationalism is sugar-coated as \u201cnational citizen favouritism\u201d and where racism is confined to the marginal domain of white supremacists, or the \u201calt-right\u201d. This goes hand in hand with a politics of whitewashing, whereby far-right ideas and discourses are made mainstream, all with the pretext of understanding the genuine and legitimate concerns of the downtrodden.</p> <p>The second option was more difficult as it entailed serious, introspective reckoning. If I were to reclaim my cosmopolitan moral agenda, I would have to acknowledge the centrality of shared values to solidarity and trust.</p> <p>I had to understand that the central question is, as the Swedish historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lars-tragardh\" title=\"\">Lars Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh</a> puts it, whether it is possible to resolve the fundamental tension between, on the one side, \u201cuniversal moral rules founded in notions of human rights\u201d, and on the other, \u201cnationally bounded claims derived from the idea of citizenship in particular nation states\u201d.</p> <p>My answer is yes, and the formula is simple: emphasise the connection between rights and duties; speed up the process of integration of newcomers (refugees or migrants) without demanding that they fully assimilate into the dominant culture, but asking them to respect the existing social contract; foster a sense of common destiny that does not necessarily require myths of common ancestry; and engage with the demand for recognition in a fair and equal way, without privileging either minorities or majorities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/this-is-europe-sign-up-guardian-email-updates\">This is Europe: stay close with the Guardian\u2019s email updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The point here is that a sense of civic duty does not entail expecting citizens to turn into cosmopolitans. And a moral concern for the refugees and migrants who risk their lives to provide their children with a better future does not require us to care less about our own children. The yearning for home, or to protect one\u2019s home, does not entail isolation, for there are many homes and many definitions of home.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition,\u201d the novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/22/james-baldwin-interview-1962\" title=\"\">James Baldwin</a> said.

      "bodyText": "I was born in Turkey and am now based in Lund, on the southern tip of Sweden. Most of my life I\u2019ve probably been the quintessential cosmopolitan, and proudly so. But I\u2019ve also spent too many hours in the consulates and airports of various EU countries coveting a multiple-entry Schengen visa, or enduring the suspicious looks of customs officers, to believe that I could be a \u201ccitizen of nowhere\u201d with a Turkish passport. My cosmopolitanism was more a moral ideal based on compassion, and did not preclude a yearning for belonging or roots. It simply defined them in a different way. I could have roots in many places, and I could nourish my need for belonging from a variety of sources. With this background, it is not very surprising that I took up a job offer in Sweden in 2011. To be sure, it was not easy to adapt to the notorious Nordic winter and the idiosyncrasies of the Swedish way of life, not least the obsession with moderation (\u201clagom\u201d) and modesty (\u201cjantelagen\u201d), which manifests itself as an unwavering commitment to consensus and the need to avoid confrontation at all costs. Sweden has become one of my many homes, and with the birth of my son in 2013, it became the first among equals. Having a family and living in a small university town was perfectly compatible with my understanding of cosmopolitanism, which, drawing on the Stoics, regarded these affiliations as a series of concentric circles, starting with the local and extending into the societal and global. I could not imagine at that point that my cosmopolitanism would begin to crack under the pressure of several developments. First, I started to appreciate the value of Sweden\u2019s welfare state, which for four and a half years took great care of my son after he fell seriously ill and until he passed away in July 2018. I developed a sense of loyalty to the social contract that underpinned the Swedish state \u2013 a feeling I\u2019d never felt before, either in the country where I was born and raised, or in others where I\u2019d spent a good chunk of my life. I wasn\u2019t even a citizen of Sweden (though my son was), but that did not matter when it came to a child\u2019s life, nor did the amount of taxes I paid or the type of permit I held. But I was also exposed to the more unpleasant aspects of the Swedish social contract: a token egalitarianism that trumps all notions of meritocracy, an extreme understanding of political correctness, and a corporatist alliance between employers and labour unions. These aspects are little known to outsiders, who often tend to glorify the \u201cSwedish model\u201d. After my son\u2019s funeral, I travelled outside Sweden to resume a nomadic lifestyle. I was torn. I now had a better understanding of the tensions between citizenship and a borderless universalism, or the type of cosmopolitanism the likes of Theresa May or Nigel Farage have attacked. I\u2019d witnessed the immense pressure that the refugee crisis of 2015-16 placed on the Swedish government. Then came the unstoppable rise of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats party, which would soon become the third largest in parliament. I also found myself to a certain extent sympathising with the opprobrium that populist demagogues and rightwing commentators heaped on prevailing forms of political correctness. I\u2019d become the victim of such vigilantism myself, one that pays little heed to due process or other fundamental values such as empathy. On top of that, the Europe I\u2019d sought refuge in was not the Europe I once thought it was. Sweden was simply following in the footsteps of a host of other countries that were mutilated by the far-right juggernaut. Nationalism was \u2013 once again \u2013 the order of the day, with a slightly different script in which the lead role was given to \u201cthreatened white majorities\u201d or \u201cmajority ethnic anxieties\u201d. All this happened under the watchful eyes of academic snipers who did not hesitate to target any remaining sign of more universalist visions. Basically, I had two options. The easy one was to jump on the bandwagon, recant my earlier cosmopolitan convictions and start penning pieces about the virtues of the rightwing populist backlash. This would require adopting a politics of euphemism where good old nationalism is sugar-coated as \u201cnational citizen favouritism\u201d and where racism is confined to the marginal domain of white supremacists, or the \u201calt-right\u201d. This goes hand in hand with a politics of whitewashing, whereby far-right ideas and discourses are made mainstream, all with the pretext of understanding the genuine and legitimate concerns of the downtrodden. The second option was more difficult as it entailed serious, introspective reckoning. If I were to reclaim my cosmopolitan moral agenda, I would have to acknowledge the centrality of shared values to solidarity and trust. I had to understand that the central question is, as the Swedish historian Lars Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh puts it, whether it is possible to resolve the fundamental tension between, on the one side, \u201cuniversal moral rules founded in notions of human rights\u201d, and on the other, \u201cnationally bounded claims derived from the idea of citizenship in particular nation states\u201d. My answer is yes, and the formula is simple: emphasise the connection between rights and duties; speed up the process of integration of newcomers (refugees or migrants) without demanding that they fully assimilate into the dominant culture, but asking them to respect the existing social contract; foster a sense of common destiny that does not necessarily require myths of common ancestry; and engage with the demand for recognition in a fair and equal way, without privileging either minorities or majorities. The point here is that a sense of civic duty does not entail expecting citizens to turn into cosmopolitans. And a moral concern for the refugees and migrants who risk their lives to provide their children with a better future does not require us to care less about our own children. The yearning for home, or to protect one\u2019s home, does not entail isolation, for there are many homes and many definitions of home. \u201cPerhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition,\u201d the novelist James Baldwin said. Perhaps that\u2019s the answer: to think of cosmopolitanism as an irrevocable condition, much like love. \u2022 Umut \u00d6zk\u0131r\u0131ml\u0131 is a political scientist and professor at Lund University, Sweden, and the author of Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction",

      "body": "<p>People used to call Anika the Snap Queen. Between the ages of 19 and 21, she was \u201cobsessed with Snapchat, to the point where I had 4,000 followers\u201d. At the peak of her \u201ctragic\u201d behaviour, she reckons now \u2013 a year after quitting the image-sharing app \u2013 she was taking 25 selfies a day.</p> <p>She liked the sense of having a platform, she says, with the average selfie getting 300 replies. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m so popular \u2013 I\u2019ve gotta show my face.\u2019\u201d But the filters were also part of the appeal. The Londoner had long been insecure about the slight bump in her nose. Snapchat\u2019s fun effects, which let you embellish your selfies with dog ears, flower crowns and the like, would also erase the bump entirely. \u201cI\u2019d think, \u2018I\u2019d like to look how I look with this filter that makes my nose look slimmer.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Socialising in the real world, she would choose her seat to avoid being seen in profile. She recognises that this was irrational \u2013 \u201cbut it happens. I feel like we\u2019re in a world where a lot of people are seen to be perfect, and so we try and reach that peak.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes her followers would suggest meeting in person. \u201cThen it would be like, \u2018I have to look like my selfie.\u2019\u201d It was around this time, the height of her Snapchat obsession, that Anika started contacting cosmetic doctors on Instagram.</p> <p>The phenomenon of people requesting procedures to resemble their digital image has been referred to \u2013 sometimes flippantly, sometimes as a harbinger of end times \u2013 as \u201cSnapchat dysmorphia\u201d. The term was coined by the cosmetic doctor Tijion Esho, <a href=\"http://www.eshoclinic.co.uk/\" title=\"\">founder of the Esho clinics</a> in London and Newcastle. He had noticed that where patients had once brought in pictures of celebrities with their ideal nose or jaw, they were now pointing to photos of themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d27296f940c59a0204469ccddd4f9cfe739fe574\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d27296f940c59a0204469ccddd4f9cfe739fe574/107_0_2151_2151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tijion Esho: \u2018It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tijion Esho: \u2018It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some used their selfies \u2013 typically edited with Snapchat or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate\" title=\"\">the airbrushing app Facetune</a> \u2013 as a guide, others would say, \u201c\u2018I want to actually look like this\u2019, with the large eyes and the pixel-perfect skin,\u201d says Esho. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an unrealistic, unattainable thing.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamafacialplasticsurgery/article-abstract/2688763\" title=\"\">A recent report</a> in the US medical journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery suggested that filtered images\u2019 \u201cblurring the line of reality and fantasy\u201d could be triggering body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental health condition where people become fixated on imagined defects in their appearance. </p> <p>Like Esho, Dr Wassim Taktouk uses non-surgical, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/03/non-surgical-cosmetic-procedures-botox-lip-filler-beauty\" title=\"\">non-permanent \u201cinjectables\u201d</a> such as Botox and dermal fillers to enlarge lips or smooth a bumpy nose. He recalls a client coming to see him in his cream-carpeted Kensington clinic, upset after a date made through an app had gone south. \u201cWhen she\u2019d met the man, he had been quite disparaging: \u2018You don\u2019t look anything like your picture.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The woman showed Taktouk the heavily filtered image on her profile and said: \u201cI want to look like that.\u201d It was flawless, he says \u2013 \u201cwithout a single marking of a normal human face\u201d. He told her he couldn\u2019t help. \u201cIf that\u2019s the picture you\u2019re going to put out of yourself, you\u2019re setting yourself up for disappointment.\u201d</p> <p>Why do we take so many photos of ourselves? A <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-017-9844-x\" title=\"\">2017 study into \u201cselfitis\u201d</a>, as the obsessive taking of selfies has been called, found a range of motivations, from seeking social status to shaking off depressive thoughts and \u2013 of course \u2013 capturing a memorable moment. <a href=\"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/6390/5620\" title=\"\">Another study</a> suggested that selfies served \u201ca private and internal purpose\u201d, with the majority never shared with anyone or posted anywhere \u2013 terabytes, even petabytes of photographs never to be seen by anyone other than their subject.</p> <p>With so much of life now lived online, from dating to job-hunting, recent, quality images of yourself are also a necessity \u2013 it is no wonder that Facetune (Apple\u2019s most popular paid-for app of 2017) and the free follow-up Facetune2 have more than 55m users between them. Stav Tishler of Lightricks, the company behind them, says making airbrushing accessible has challenged \u201cthat illusion that \u2018a perfect body\u2019 exists \u2026 and levelled out the playing field\u201d: \u201cEveryone knows everyone is using it, supermodels and \u2018everyday\u2019 people alike.\u201d</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-017-0067-2\" title=\"\">a 2017 study</a> in the journal Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications found that people only recognised manipulated images 60%-65% of the time. Esho says the pervasiveness of airbrushing on social media means it can create \u201cunrealistic expectations of what is normal\u201d and lower the self-esteem of those who don\u2019t use it: \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle.\u201d</p> <p>When the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery <a href=\"https://www.aafprs.org/media/stats_polls/m_stats.html\" title=\"\">surveyed its members in 2017</a>, 55% of surgeons said patients\u2019 motivation was to look better in selfies, up from just 13% in 2016.</p> <p>Even novelty filters such as Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s, as well as adding bunny ears or specs to your selfie, plump your lips, erase your pores and lift your jowls while they are at it. (Snapchat declined to respond on the record.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98054a4d88c0da5edfc5a2a3d8908edd547daba5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98054a4d88c0da5edfc5a2a3d8908edd547daba5/0_0_3200_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from the Facetune app, showing how it can change someone\u2019s appearance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Images from the Facetune2 app, showing how it can change someone\u2019s appearance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facetune</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe first thing that any of these filters do is give you a beautiful complexion,\u201d says Taktouk. \u201cYour naso-labial [laugh] lines, from the nose to mouth, aren\u2019t existent \u2013 but that\u2019s not a human face. No one doesn\u2019t have those. You can see them in children.\u201d Clients still request their removal, and of \u201cthe tear trough\u201d \u2013 the groove down from the inner corners of the eyes. \u201cPeople wanting bigger eyes is another one \u2013 it\u2019s just not possible.\u201d</p> <p>The filtered-selfie look is also reflected in demand for bigger lips and taut jawlines. Such so-called \u201ctweakments\u201d have exploded in recent years, thanks to their relative affordability and convenience. A \u201cliquid nose job\u201d using fillers might cost a few hundred pounds and takes instant effect, compared with the slow, painful recovery from a surgical rhinoplasty. Marla, 29, from New York, got her \u201cperfect nose\u201d last year while on her lunch break. \u201cI went back to work feeling just so much more polished and confident \u2013 like I was even writing my emails better.\u201d</p> <p>Like Anika, she had always been bothered by the bump in her nose, religiously removing it from selfies; but she began exploring real-world options after a painful breakup. A list of pros and cons revealed that the potential risks \u2013 of her parents\u2019 disapproval and \u201cnecrosis of the face\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s very rare, but it\u2019s definitely a thing\u201d) \u2013 did not outweigh the benefits of having \u201cthe nose I create for myself on Facetune\u201d.</p> <p>The rise of fillers \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-treatments/dermal-fillers/\" title=\"\">anything from collagen and hyaluronic acid, which break down in a matter of months, to the permanent but riskier polymethyl methacrylate beads</a> \u2013 has been accelerated by celebrity endorsements from the likes of the Kardashian clan. The removal and <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-6258563/Kylie-Jenner-confirms-shes-getting-lips-filled-21-year-old-shows-pout.html\" title=\"\">subsequent return</a> of Kylie Jenner\u2019s lip fillers have been followed with particular interest. Some doctors try to capitalise on this with \u201cthe Kylie package\u201d for nose, jaw and lips, says Taktouk, disapprovingly. Ten years ago, his clients were deeply concerned with patient confidentiality; \u201cNow, it\u2019s \u2018Do you mind if I Insta-story this?\u2019 It\u2019s not taboo any more.\u201d He has seen lips advertised for \u00a3150 and noses for \u00a3200-\u00a3300. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the trickiest procedures of the lot.\u201d</p> <p>Fillers may be less invasive than surgery, but they are not without their risks, which range from uneven results and infection to vascular blockages and even blindness. Save Face, the UK\u2019s largest register of accredited practitioners of non-surgical treatments, says almost 1,000 complaints <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/complaints-about-botched-botox-and-filler-reach-almost-1000_uk_5bd22f7ae4b0d38b588194ad\" title=\"\">were made in the year</a> to October. Yet there is little regulation and no minimum age. \u201cWe have more protections for houses than we do children\u2019s faces,\u201d says Esho, who has <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/skin/doctor-calling-jeremy-hunt-change-cosmetic-procedure-regulations/\" title=\"\">campaigned for crackdowns</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Even Marla \u2013 who documented her follow-up nose job in <a href=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/plastic-planet-i-got-surgery-to-look-like-my-snapchat-and-facetune-selfies/5bedcd66be40775d88072966?&amp;ref=broadly\" title=\"\">a short film for Vice</a>, and does paid promotional work for cosmetic surgeons \u2013 says she would not encourage a young girl to do as she did. \u201cI know that I love myself \u2013 that\u2019s why I let myself get little tweaks \u2013 but it would really bother me if a young girl told me that she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"977b94d7c4c32f40fc86fb5c4445c47f26c2bbd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/977b94d7c4c32f40fc86fb5c4445c47f26c2bbd2/0_79_750_749/500.jpg\" alt=\"Snapchat\u2019s novelty \u2018augmented reality\u2019 lenses enlarge the eyes and smooth the skin.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snapchat\u2019s novelty \u2018augmented reality\u2019 filters enlarge the eyes and smooth the skin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elle Hunt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Taktouk refuses to treat anyone younger than early 20s, but he says he has been contacted by 16- and 17-year-olds, sometimes for \u201cpreventative Botox\u201d (\u201cThey haven\u2019t even done A-levels yet\u201d). Invariably it is via Instagram, where a reported <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/248769/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users/\" title=\"\">60% of users are aged between 18 and 24</a>. The platform has become a marketplace for cosmetic procedures, with doctors showcasing their before-and-afters.</p> <p>The process is as easy as \u201cclick-click-click, look at 10 bits of his work in the space of a minute, wow, let\u2019s contact him\u201d, says Anika. At the age of 20, she turned up at Taktouk\u2019s clinic with photos of noses he had done and a video of herself with a Snapchat filter. \u201cYou know the one that kind of makes your face look like an alien\u2019s? I was like, \u2018This looks great \u2013 my nose looks so much smaller.\u2019 Dr Taktouk was like: \u2018This is not what is going to happen with filler.\u2019\u201d She laughs. \u201cHe told me to come back with my mum.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Anika took a year out to consider her decision, weighing up fillers\u2019 merits against surgical rhinoplasty. \u201cActually, I went through a phase of thinking, \u2018No, I should try and love myself.\u2019\u201d How did that go? \u201cI didn\u2019t do rhinoplasty,\u201d she says drily. \u201cI guess that\u2019s as far as I got.\u201d By the time she returned to Taktouk\u2019s clinic, aged 21, she had been brought \u201cback down to earth\u201d. He injected filler into the tip of her nose, evening out its line. She loved it instantly. \u201cI feel like I just needed that to change me inside, so I could stop looking for perfection.\u201d</p> <p>When the filler eventually breaks down after about a year, she will repeat the procedure. \u201cThe most beautiful thing is when someone is happy from within,\u201d she says; \u201cas ironic as it sounds\u201d, her new nose helped her to attain it. \u201cI\u2019m not itching to get anything else.\u201d</p> <p>There was a moment just after the procedure, though, as she was admiring her new profile, when she wondered aloud if her lips needed filling, too. They were one of her most prominent features; she had been called Fish Lips at school. Taktouk told her to stop being silly. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that seat, it\u2019s quite tempting,\u201d she says. \u201cLike, \u2018What else can I do?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There is an obvious danger in trying to measure up to images when they are so far from reality \u2013 or even consistency. Non-filtered selfies are flipped, front cameras produce different results from back cameras, and there <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18011306/apple-iphone-xr-review-camera-screen-battery-price\" title=\"\">are even marked differences</a> between models of phone. Just the distance from which we typically take selfies has a huge effect.

      "bodyText": "People used to call Anika the Snap Queen. Between the ages of 19 and 21, she was \u201cobsessed with Snapchat, to the point where I had 4,000 followers\u201d. At the peak of her \u201ctragic\u201d behaviour, she reckons now \u2013 a year after quitting the image-sharing app \u2013 she was taking 25 selfies a day. She liked the sense of having a platform, she says, with the average selfie getting 300 replies. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m so popular \u2013 I\u2019ve gotta show my face.\u2019\u201d But the filters were also part of the appeal. The Londoner had long been insecure about the slight bump in her nose. Snapchat\u2019s fun effects, which let you embellish your selfies with dog ears, flower crowns and the like, would also erase the bump entirely. \u201cI\u2019d think, \u2018I\u2019d like to look how I look with this filter that makes my nose look slimmer.\u2019\u201d Socialising in the real world, she would choose her seat to avoid being seen in profile. She recognises that this was irrational \u2013 \u201cbut it happens. I feel like we\u2019re in a world where a lot of people are seen to be perfect, and so we try and reach that peak.\u201d Sometimes her followers would suggest meeting in person. \u201cThen it would be like, \u2018I have to look like my selfie.\u2019\u201d It was around this time, the height of her Snapchat obsession, that Anika started contacting cosmetic doctors on Instagram. The phenomenon of people requesting procedures to resemble their digital image has been referred to \u2013 sometimes flippantly, sometimes as a harbinger of end times \u2013 as \u201cSnapchat dysmorphia\u201d. The term was coined by the cosmetic doctor Tijion Esho, founder of the Esho clinics in London and Newcastle. He had noticed that where patients had once brought in pictures of celebrities with their ideal nose or jaw, they were now pointing to photos of themselves. While some used their selfies \u2013 typically edited with Snapchat or the airbrushing app Facetune \u2013 as a guide, others would say, \u201c\u2018I want to actually look like this\u2019, with the large eyes and the pixel-perfect skin,\u201d says Esho. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an unrealistic, unattainable thing.\u201d A recent report in the US medical journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery suggested that filtered images\u2019 \u201cblurring the line of reality and fantasy\u201d could be triggering body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental health condition where people become fixated on imagined defects in their appearance. Like Esho, Dr Wassim Taktouk uses non-surgical, non-permanent \u201cinjectables\u201d such as Botox and dermal fillers to enlarge lips or smooth a bumpy nose. He recalls a client coming to see him in his cream-carpeted Kensington clinic, upset after a date made through an app had gone south. \u201cWhen she\u2019d met the man, he had been quite disparaging: \u2018You don\u2019t look anything like your picture.\u2019\u201d The woman showed Taktouk the heavily filtered image on her profile and said: \u201cI want to look like that.\u201d It was flawless, he says \u2013 \u201cwithout a single marking of a normal human face\u201d. He told her he couldn\u2019t help. \u201cIf that\u2019s the picture you\u2019re going to put out of yourself, you\u2019re setting yourself up for disappointment.\u201d Why do we take so many photos of ourselves? A 2017 study into \u201cselfitis\u201d, as the obsessive taking of selfies has been called, found a range of motivations, from seeking social status to shaking off depressive thoughts and \u2013 of course \u2013 capturing a memorable moment. Another study suggested that selfies served \u201ca private and internal purpose\u201d, with the majority never shared with anyone or posted anywhere \u2013 terabytes, even petabytes of photographs never to be seen by anyone other than their subject. With so much of life now lived online, from dating to job-hunting, recent, quality images of yourself are also a necessity \u2013 it is no wonder that Facetune (Apple\u2019s most popular paid-for app of 2017) and the free follow-up Facetune2 have more than 55m users between them. Stav Tishler of Lightricks, the company behind them, says making airbrushing accessible has challenged \u201cthat illusion that \u2018a perfect body\u2019 exists \u2026 and levelled out the playing field\u201d: \u201cEveryone knows everyone is using it, supermodels and \u2018everyday\u2019 people alike.\u201d However, a 2017 study in the journal Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications found that people only recognised manipulated images 60%-65% of the time. Esho says the pervasiveness of airbrushing on social media means it can create \u201cunrealistic expectations of what is normal\u201d and lower the self-esteem of those who don\u2019t use it: \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle.\u201d When the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery surveyed its members in 2017, 55% of surgeons said patients\u2019 motivation was to look better in selfies, up from just 13% in 2016. Even novelty filters such as Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s, as well as adding bunny ears or specs to your selfie, plump your lips, erase your pores and lift your jowls while they are at it. (Snapchat declined to respond on the record.) \u201cThe first thing that any of these filters do is give you a beautiful complexion,\u201d says Taktouk. \u201cYour naso-labial [laugh] lines, from the nose to mouth, aren\u2019t existent \u2013 but that\u2019s not a human face. No one doesn\u2019t have those. You can see them in children.\u201d Clients still request their removal, and of \u201cthe tear trough\u201d \u2013 the groove down from the inner corners of the eyes. \u201cPeople wanting bigger eyes is another one \u2013 it\u2019s just not possible.\u201d The filtered-selfie look is also reflected in demand for bigger lips and taut jawlines. Such so-called \u201ctweakments\u201d have exploded in recent years, thanks to their relative affordability and convenience. A \u201cliquid nose job\u201d using fillers might cost a few hundred pounds and takes instant effect, compared with the slow, painful recovery from a surgical rhinoplasty. Marla, 29, from New York, got her \u201cperfect nose\u201d last year while on her lunch break. \u201cI went back to work feeling just so much more polished and confident \u2013 like I was even writing my emails better.\u201d Like Anika, she had always been bothered by the bump in her nose, religiously removing it from selfies; but she began exploring real-world options after a painful breakup. A list of pros and cons revealed that the potential risks \u2013 of her parents\u2019 disapproval and \u201cnecrosis of the face\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s very rare, but it\u2019s definitely a thing\u201d) \u2013 did not outweigh the benefits of having \u201cthe nose I create for myself on Facetune\u201d. The rise of fillers \u2013 anything from collagen and hyaluronic acid, which break down in a matter of months, to the permanent but riskier polymethyl methacrylate beads \u2013 has been accelerated by celebrity endorsements from the likes of the Kardashian clan. The removal and subsequent return of Kylie Jenner\u2019s lip fillers have been followed with particular interest. Some doctors try to capitalise on this with \u201cthe Kylie package\u201d for nose, jaw and lips, says Taktouk, disapprovingly. Ten years ago, his clients were deeply concerned with patient confidentiality; \u201cNow, it\u2019s \u2018Do you mind if I Insta-story this?\u2019 It\u2019s not taboo any more.\u201d He has seen lips advertised for \u00a3150 and noses for \u00a3200-\u00a3300. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the trickiest procedures of the lot.\u201d Fillers may be less invasive than surgery, but they are not without their risks, which range from uneven results and infection to vascular blockages and even blindness. Save Face, the UK\u2019s largest register of accredited practitioners of non-surgical treatments, says almost 1,000 complaints were made in the year to October. Yet there is little regulation and no minimum age. \u201cWe have more protections for houses than we do children\u2019s faces,\u201d says Esho, who has campaigned for crackdowns. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d Even Marla \u2013 who documented her follow-up nose job in a short film for Vice, and does paid promotional work for cosmetic surgeons \u2013 says she would not encourage a young girl to do as she did. \u201cI know that I love myself \u2013 that\u2019s why I let myself get little tweaks \u2013 but it would really bother me if a young girl told me that she didn\u2019t.\u201d Taktouk refuses to treat anyone younger than early 20s, but he says he has been contacted by 16- and 17-year-olds, sometimes for \u201cpreventative Botox\u201d (\u201cThey haven\u2019t even done A-levels yet\u201d). Invariably it is via Instagram, where a reported 60% of users are aged between 18 and 24. The platform has become a marketplace for cosmetic procedures, with doctors showcasing their before-and-afters. The process is as easy as \u201cclick-click-click, look at 10 bits of his work in the space of a minute, wow, let\u2019s contact him\u201d, says Anika. At the age of 20, she turned up at Taktouk\u2019s clinic with photos of noses he had done and a video of herself with a Snapchat filter. \u201cYou know the one that kind of makes your face look like an alien\u2019s? I was like, \u2018This looks great \u2013 my nose looks so much smaller.\u2019 Dr Taktouk was like: \u2018This is not what is going to happen with filler.\u2019\u201d She laughs. \u201cHe told me to come back with my mum.\u201d Instead, Anika took a year out to consider her decision, weighing up fillers\u2019 merits against surgical rhinoplasty. \u201cActually, I went through a phase of thinking, \u2018No, I should try and love myself.\u2019\u201d How did that go? \u201cI didn\u2019t do rhinoplasty,\u201d she says drily. \u201cI guess that\u2019s as far as I got.\u201d By the time she returned to Taktouk\u2019s clinic, aged 21, she had been brought \u201cback down to earth\u201d. He injected filler into the tip of her nose, evening out its line. She loved it instantly. \u201cI feel like I just needed that to change me inside, so I could stop looking for perfection.\u201d When the filler eventually breaks down after about a year, she will repeat the procedure. \u201cThe most beautiful thing is when someone is happy from within,\u201d she says; \u201cas ironic as it sounds\u201d, her new nose helped her to attain it. \u201cI\u2019m not itching to get anything else.\u201d There was a moment just after the procedure, though, as she was admiring her new profile, when she wondered aloud if her lips needed filling, too. They were one of her most prominent features; she had been called Fish Lips at school. Taktouk told her to stop being silly. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that seat, it\u2019s quite tempting,\u201d she says. \u201cLike, \u2018What else can I do?\u2019\u201d There is an obvious danger in trying to measure up to images when they are so far from reality \u2013 or even consistency. Non-filtered selfies are flipped, front cameras produce different results from back cameras, and there are even marked differences between models of phone. Just the distance from which we typically take selfies has a huge effect. A 2018 study found that a portrait taken from 30cm (12in) away rather than 1.5m (5ft) increases perceived nose size by about 30%. And that\u2019s without the distorting effects of lighting and even makeup. It prompts the question: which are you trying to correct, the image or the reality? Anna, 40, from Malvern \u2013 another patient of Taktouk\u2019s \u2013 admits to having once been \u201cfixated\u201d on her laugh lines. \u201cThe photos exacerbate it, making it look worse, then a filter can make it look amazing. You\u2019re unsure of what you look like.\u201d Ever since she was young, she has struggled with the discrepancy between how she sees herself in the mirror, and how others see her. Once, she downloaded an app that claimed \u201cto show you how you really look\u201d. \u201cIt used to horrify me, and make me feel terrible about myself. But these are conversations you can\u2019t really have, because you do sound self-absorbed and you\u2019re leaving yourself vulnerable.\u201d She is more self-confident now, which she attributes both to age and the occasional self-esteem boost of Botox or filler. \u201cI\u2019m quite realistic now, whereas in the past I\u2019ve driven myself crazy.\u201d For Taktouk, referrals from social media make it harder to safeguard patients\u2019 mental health. His background as a GP has helped him to spot red flags, such as badmouthing other doctors, insisting on flaws that aren\u2019t there, and in-depth knowledge of treatments: \u201cI\u2019ve had someone come in here and draw the lines on their face themselves.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cI\u2019m sure some will have slipped past without me realising\u201d \u2013 and even if Taktouk refuses to treat them, someone else will. Over the weekend it was reported that Superdrug (which began offering Botox late last year) has agreed to introduce mental health screening for people seeking Botox, following criticism from the NHS for not conducting \u201cmedically responsible\u201d checks. Taktouk says far more industry-wide regulation is needed, before there is a headline-grabbing tragedy and apps become even more transformative. He points to one called Retouch Me, which superimposes six-packs on to swimsuit pictures. \u201cI saw it and thought, this is the new wave of what we\u2019re going to get in: \u2018Make me look like this.\u2019\u201d Seeking unnecessary and unrealistic cosmetic procedures in fact supports a diagnosis of BDD, present in 2% of the population (and equally common in men and women). Dr Neelam Vashi, co-author of the American article that linked BDD to selfie dysmorphia, says further study is needed to establish whether intensive selfie-taking could trigger BDD \u2013 but it does resemble one of the main four diagnostic criteria: compulsive mirror-checking and other repetitive behaviours and thoughts. The onset tends to occur in adolescence, though people with the condition may not seek help until 10 years later. The general rule, says Professor David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley hospital in south London, is that you can \u201cthink about your appearance for an hour a day before it becomes a disorder\u201d \u2013 but for a diagnosis, it must be accompanied by significant distress or inability to function normally.

Hamilton and seven other women joined to form Angry T\u00edas and Abuelas of the Rio Grande Valley, an informal group of mostly aunts and grandmothers assisting migrants with food, shelter and support. The informal network of eight core members has since expanded to a community. \u201cAt various points all of us has threatened to drop out of exhaustion and then realized we can\u2019t, because once we get involved in this, you can\u2019t just leave,\u201d Hamilton said.",

In its place, he frets, will come chaos.

Just look at the new report from the summit organisers that begins by asking plaintively, \u201cIs the world sleepwalking into a crisis?\u201d In the accompanying survey of a thousand bosses, money men (because finance, like wealth, is still mainly a male thing) and other \u201cDavos decision-makers\u201d, nine out of 10 say they fear a trade war or other \u201ceconomic confrontation between major powers\u201d. Most confess to mounting anxieties about \u201cpopulist and nativist agendas\u201d and \u201cpublic anger against elites\u201d. As the cause of this political earthquake, they identify two shifting tectonic plates: climate change and \u201cincreasing polarisation of societies\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report\">World's 26 richest people own as much as poorest 50%, says Oxfam</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In its pretend innocence, its barefaced blame-shifting, its sheer ruddy sauce, this is akin to arsonists wailing about the flames from their own bonfire. Populism of all stripes may be anathema to the billionaire class, but they helped create it. For decades, they inflicted insecurity on the rest of us and told us it was for our own good. They have rigged an economic system so that it paid them bonanzas and stiffed others. They have lobbied and funded politicians to give them the easiest of rides. Topped with red Maga caps and yellow vests, this backlash is uglier and more uncouth than anything you\u2019ll see in the snow-capped Alps, but the high rollers meeting there can claim exec producer credits for the whole rotten lot. Shame it\u2019s such a downer for dividends.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report\" title=\"\">This week\u2019s report from Oxfam</a> is just the latest to put numbers to this hoarding of wealth and power. One single minibus-load of fatcats \u2013 just 26 people \u2013 now own as much as half the planet\u2019s population, and the collective wealth of the billionaire class swells by $2.5bn every day. This economic polarisation is far more obscene than anything detested by Davos man, and it is the root cause of the social and political divide that now makes his world so unstable.</p> \n<p>No natural force created this intense unfairness. The gulf between the super-rich and the rest of us did not gape wide open overnight. Rather, it has been decades in the widening and it was done deliberately. The UK was the frontline of the war to create greater inequality: in her first two terms as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher more than halved the top rate of income tax paid by high earners. She broke the back of the trade unions. Over their 16 years in office, Thatcher and John Major flogged off <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/symp_mar02_uk_treasury_priv_guide_e.pdf\" title=\"\">more public assets</a> than France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Australia and Canada put together.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a96559bb-1c7a-4fda-af9d-803846991af4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xuudPum21nE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Oh, shrug the Davos set, that\u2019s ancient history. It is no such thing. Thatcher may be gone but her ideology keeps on taking cash out of your pay packets.

      "bodyText": "Pity the poor billionaire, for today he feels a new and unsettling emotion: fear. The world order he once clung to is crumbling faster than the value of the pound. In its place, he frets, will come chaos. Remember this, as the plutocrats gather this week high above us in the ski resort of Davos: they are terrified. Whatever dog-eared platitudes they may recycle for the TV cameras, what grips them is the havoc far below. Just look at the new report from the summit organisers that begins by asking plaintively, \u201cIs the world sleepwalking into a crisis?\u201d In the accompanying survey of a thousand bosses, money men (because finance, like wealth, is still mainly a male thing) and other \u201cDavos decision-makers\u201d, nine out of 10 say they fear a trade war or other \u201ceconomic confrontation between major powers\u201d. Most confess to mounting anxieties about \u201cpopulist and nativist agendas\u201d and \u201cpublic anger against elites\u201d. As the cause of this political earthquake, they identify two shifting tectonic plates: climate change and \u201cincreasing polarisation of societies\u201d. In its pretend innocence, its barefaced blame-shifting, its sheer ruddy sauce, this is akin to arsonists wailing about the flames from their own bonfire. Populism of all stripes may be anathema to the billionaire class, but they helped create it. For decades, they inflicted insecurity on the rest of us and told us it was for our own good. They have rigged an economic system so that it paid them bonanzas and stiffed others. They have lobbied and funded politicians to give them the easiest of rides. Topped with red Maga caps and yellow vests, this backlash is uglier and more uncouth than anything you\u2019ll see in the snow-capped Alps, but the high rollers meeting there can claim exec producer credits for the whole rotten lot. Shame it\u2019s such a downer for dividends. This week\u2019s report from Oxfam is just the latest to put numbers to this hoarding of wealth and power. One single minibus-load of fatcats \u2013 just 26 people \u2013 now own as much as half the planet\u2019s population, and the collective wealth of the billionaire class swells by $2.5bn every day. This economic polarisation is far more obscene than anything detested by Davos man, and it is the root cause of the social and political divide that now makes his world so unstable. No natural force created this intense unfairness. The gulf between the super-rich and the rest of us did not gape wide open overnight. Rather, it has been decades in the widening and it was done deliberately. The UK was the frontline of the war to create greater inequality: in her first two terms as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher more than halved the top rate of income tax paid by high earners. She broke the back of the trade unions. Over their 16 years in office, Thatcher and John Major flogged off more public assets than France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Australia and Canada put together. Oh, shrug the Davos set, that\u2019s ancient history. It is no such thing. Thatcher may be gone but her ideology keeps on taking cash out of your pay packets. If workers today got the same share of national income as in the 70s, we would be far better off. According to calculations from the Foundational Economy collective of researchers, a full-time employee now on the median salary of \u00a329,574 would get a pay rise of \u00a35,471. Meanwhile, FTSE bosses enjoy skyrocketing pay, precisely because bonus schemes give them part-ownership of the big companies they run. So Jeff Fairburn of the housebuilder Persimmon took \u00a347m in 2018 before getting the boot, which works out at \u00a3882 for each \u00a31 earned by an average worker at the firm. Where Thatcher\u2019s shock troops led, the rest of the west more or less followed. Political leaders across the spectrum gave the rich what they wanted. It didn\u2019t matter whether you voted for Tony Blair or David Cameron, Bill Clinton or George W Bush, either way you got Davos man.

Visitors to Mail Online who use Microsoft Edge can now see a statement asserting that \u201cthis website generally fails to maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability\u201d and \u201chas been forced to pay damages in numerous high-profile cases\u201d. The message, which is produced by a third-party startup called NewsGuard, tells readers to proceed carefully given that \u201cthe site regularly publishes content that has damaged reputations, caused widespread alarm, or constituted harassment or invasion of privacy\u201d. It gives Mail Online, one of the world\u2019s biggest news websites, one out of five on credibility \u2013 the same level as the Kremlin-backed RT news service. NewsGuard is run by news industry veterans and says it is trying to establish industry-standard benchmarks for which news websites should be trusted. It employs analysts to manually check whether sites meet a series of journalistic standards, making all its judgments public and inviting outlets to respond to criticism and improve their standards to gain a higher rating. Until now, the service has only been available as a downloadable plug-in but this week Microsoft began installing it automatically on all mobile editions of its Edge browser, the successor to Internet Explorer, in the first stage of what its creators hope will be a widespread roll-out across multiple platforms. Edge has a tiny proportion of the global internet browser market and the NewsGuard plug-in is only included on the version for mobile users, not desktop users. The partnership was signed as part of Microsoft\u2019s Defending Democracy programme; the tech company has no oversight over NewsGuard\u2019s editorial verdicts. Steve Brill, a NewsGuard co-founder, said the Mail Online verdict had been reached in a transparent manner. \u201cWe spell out fairly clearly in the label exactly how many times we have attempted to contact them. The analyst that wrote this writeup got someone on the phone who, as soon he heard who she was and where she was calling from, hung up. We would love to hear if they have a complaint or if they change anything.\u201d He said NewsGuard took complete responsibility for the verdicts and all complaints should be directed at his company rather than Microsoft. \u201cThey can blame us. And we\u2019re happy to be blamed. Unlike the platforms we\u2019re happy to be accountable. \u201cWe want people to game our system. We are totally transparent. We are not an algorithm.\u201d NewsGuard\u2019s business model relies on licensing its product to tech companies which want to fight online disinformation but do not want to take responsibility for making editorial judgments. Brill said his company, which has received investment from the advertising group Publicis, has completed human-generated verdicts on the top 2,000 news outlets in the US and was hiring staff to produce similar verdicts on the top 150 news sites in the UK, with the aim of publishing results in April. A spokesperson for MailOnline said: \u201cWe have only very recently become aware of the NewsGuard startup and are in discussions with them to have this egregiously erroneous classification resolved as soon as possible.\u201d",

By 2040, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/jan/16/the-new-retirement-how-an-ageing-population-is-transforming-britain\" title=\"\">nearly one in seven</a> people living in Britain will be over 75. The Office for National Statistics figures show the number of people living to 90 and beyond has <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/ageing/bulletins/estimatesoftheveryoldincludingcentenarians/2002to2016\" title=\"\">almost trebled</a> in the past 30 years. But once you reach your 70s, you suddenly realise that life is full of anomalies, inconsistencies, prejudices and mixed messages. Isn\u2019t it about time we examined these and worked to construct a more rational approach to later life?</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with driving. At the age of 70 everybody has to reapply for a driving licence, but it simply involves completing a self-assessment form about your health, nothing else. Then you can go on driving for ever. The evidence suggests that drivers over 70 are involved in three to four times fewer accidents, proportionately, than men under 21. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/17/prince-philip-involved-in-car-accident-near-sandringham\" title=\"\">road accident involving Prince Philip</a>, 97 \u2013 in which everybody involved luckily escaped serious injury \u2013 is a vivid reminder of the absurdity of these lax rules. People should be properly checked for their continuing fitness to drive.</p> <p>And while we impose no limits on driving, if you want to go on holiday and are over 70, travel insurance becomes a major headache. Aviva will not give you annual insurance cover if you\u2019re over 75, and John Lewis stops offering annual cover at 73. Most insurance companies raise the costs for older people, despite evidence that people in their 70s are less likely to make a claim. You are considered a safe pair of hands in a car, but it is more expensive to be an active traveller, just at that stage in your life when you actually have more freedom to explore the world.</p> <p>In the same vein, the decisions taken by health professionals need to be transparent so that we can publicly debate whether they are right. It may be a good thing that the NHS generally only supports IVF treatment for <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ivf/\" title=\"\">women up to 42</a>. But a <a href=\"https://www.macmillan.org.uk/documents/getinvolved/campaigns/ageoldexcuse/ageoldexcusereport-macmillancancersupport.pdf\" title=\"\">recent study by Macmillan</a> Cancer Support found that while 81% of oncologists would prescribe chemotherapy for a high-risk breast cancer patient aged 68, only 47% would recommend the same treatment for an otherwise identical patient aged 73. Does society endorse that clinical judgment based on age? I\u2019m not convinced.</p> <p>In 2016 the age limit for serving on a jury in England and Wales was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/12/juror-age-limit-rise-75\" title=\"\">raised from 70 to 75</a>. The majority of judges still have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/mar/29/allow-judiciary-to-work-until-75-says-britains-most-senior-judge\" title=\"\">retire at 70</a>. So your age is seen as defining your capacity to make judgments about the law. But politicians \u2013 who are also charged with making crucial judgments \u2013 can go on and on. I am reaching my mid-70s, Dennis Skinner continues to make his strident comments at the age of 86, and Jeremy Corbyn will be well into his 70s at the next general election. I\u2019m all for people continuing to contribute, and I certainly view life as a marathon, not a sprint. But should lawmakers keep plodding on while judges and juries face a cut-off date?</p> <p>Other jobs throw up fresh sets of contradictions. You can\u2019t join the army as an officer once you are over 29, but you can become a crime-fighting police officer until the ripe age of 57. Surprisingly, there is no upper age limit on learning to fly an aircraft. Similarly, 100-year-old Fauja Singh from Ilford in London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/19/secret-worlds-oldest-marathon-runner-100\" title=\"\">ran the Toronto marathon in 2011</a> (and didn\u2019t finish last).</p> <p>The church in Wales makes vicars retire at the age of 70. But in the Catholic church, while there is theoretically a retirement age of 70, in practice it\u2019s at the discretion of bishops.</p> <p>And when we start to examine the world of tax and benefits, questions about consistency and fairness immediately arise. Does it make sense that people in work stop paying national insurance contributions when they reach state pension age even if they continue to earn? ONS figures suggest that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/mar/22/number-of-women-working-past-70-in-uk-doubles-in-four-years-retirement\" title=\"\">16% of men and 11% of women</a> are still in work at the age of 70, well beyond the current state pension age.</p> <p>The national insurance rule is based on the fable that national insurance contributions pay directly for our pensions. That is no longer true. So there is no logical justification for older people paying less tax based on their earned income.

      "bodyText": "I still remember the frustration I felt as a teenager at the plethora of inconsistent rules that governed what I could and could not do, on the basis solely of my age: when I could vote, marry, drive a car or buy drinks. I am now reaching the stage in life when a whole new set of age-based cans and can\u2019ts are starting to determine what I\u2019m allowed to do. We are living longer, working longer and remaining active for longer. By 2040, nearly one in seven people living in Britain will be over 75. The Office for National Statistics figures show the number of people living to 90 and beyond has almost trebled in the past 30 years. But once you reach your 70s, you suddenly realise that life is full of anomalies, inconsistencies, prejudices and mixed messages. Isn\u2019t it about time we examined these and worked to construct a more rational approach to later life? Let\u2019s start with driving. At the age of 70 everybody has to reapply for a driving licence, but it simply involves completing a self-assessment form about your health, nothing else. Then you can go on driving for ever. The evidence suggests that drivers over 70 are involved in three to four times fewer accidents, proportionately, than men under 21. But the road accident involving Prince Philip, 97 \u2013 in which everybody involved luckily escaped serious injury \u2013 is a vivid reminder of the absurdity of these lax rules. People should be properly checked for their continuing fitness to drive. And while we impose no limits on driving, if you want to go on holiday and are over 70, travel insurance becomes a major headache. Aviva will not give you annual insurance cover if you\u2019re over 75, and John Lewis stops offering annual cover at 73. Most insurance companies raise the costs for older people, despite evidence that people in their 70s are less likely to make a claim. You are considered a safe pair of hands in a car, but it is more expensive to be an active traveller, just at that stage in your life when you actually have more freedom to explore the world. In the same vein, the decisions taken by health professionals need to be transparent so that we can publicly debate whether they are right. It may be a good thing that the NHS generally only supports IVF treatment for women up to 42. But a recent study by Macmillan Cancer Support found that while 81% of oncologists would prescribe chemotherapy for a high-risk breast cancer patient aged 68, only 47% would recommend the same treatment for an otherwise identical patient aged 73. Does society endorse that clinical judgment based on age? I\u2019m not convinced. In 2016 the age limit for serving on a jury in England and Wales was raised from 70 to 75. The majority of judges still have to retire at 70. So your age is seen as defining your capacity to make judgments about the law. But politicians \u2013 who are also charged with making crucial judgments \u2013 can go on and on. I am reaching my mid-70s, Dennis Skinner continues to make his strident comments at the age of 86, and Jeremy Corbyn will be well into his 70s at the next general election. I\u2019m all for people continuing to contribute, and I certainly view life as a marathon, not a sprint. But should lawmakers keep plodding on while judges and juries face a cut-off date? Other jobs throw up fresh sets of contradictions. You can\u2019t join the army as an officer once you are over 29, but you can become a crime-fighting police officer until the ripe age of 57. Surprisingly, there is no upper age limit on learning to fly an aircraft. Similarly, 100-year-old Fauja Singh from Ilford in London ran the Toronto marathon in 2011 (and didn\u2019t finish last). The church in Wales makes vicars retire at the age of 70. But in the Catholic church, while there is theoretically a retirement age of 70, in practice it\u2019s at the discretion of bishops. And when we start to examine the world of tax and benefits, questions about consistency and fairness immediately arise. Does it make sense that people in work stop paying national insurance contributions when they reach state pension age even if they continue to earn? ONS figures suggest that 16% of men and 11% of women are still in work at the age of 70, well beyond the current state pension age. The national insurance rule is based on the fable that national insurance contributions pay directly for our pensions. That is no longer true. So there is no logical justification for older people paying less tax based on their earned income. But equally, if people continue to work beyond 75, they should surely retain the entitlement to tax relief on their pension contributions, unlike at present. The benefits for older people are also a complete muddle. In England, you receive a free bus pass at retirement age, but eligibility for a free television licence comes at 75. Whether you receive winter fuel payments depends on when you were born rather than how cold or poor you are. English Heritage gives you a \u00a37 annual discount on membership at 65, but the National Trust offers a reduction to senior citizens only if they are longstanding members. If I go to watch Mary Poppins Returns, I will save \u00a31 at the Vue cinema, \u00a32.60 at the Showcase and \u00a32 at Cineworld.

      "bodyText": "Industry groups including the representative of tech giants Facebook, Google, Twitter and Amazon, have backed several Labor amendments to the government\u2019s encryption bill. Under Labor\u2019s plan, law enforcement agencies would require a fresh warrant before ordering tech companies to assist or build a new capability to access electronic communications and the bill\u2019s prohibition against creating a \u201csystemic weakness\u201d would be strengthened. Those amendments were backed in a submission signed by the Communications Alliance, Australian Industry Group, Australian Information Industry Association and Digital Industry Group Inc, which represents the international tech giants in Australia. The industry groups also warned that new spying powers could be accessed to investigate \u201crelatively minor offences\u201d, and called for the threshold to be raised from offences punishable by three years in prison to those with a maximum of at least seven years. Although the Telecommunications (Assistance and Access) Act passed parliament in the final sitting week in 2018, the joint standing committee on intelligence and security will continue its scrutiny of the law. Labor passed the bill with government amendments in the Senate, putting its own improvements on the back burner after the Coalition won a high-stakes game to force the bill through before summer. The industry groups said it was clear government amendments were \u201cdrafted in haste\u201d and were distributed only in the early hours of 6 December, the day the bill passed. \u201cAlmost inevitably, there remain, in our view, significant problems with the amendments and other elements of the legislation,\u201d they said. The industry groups warned that Australian companies might now have difficulty exporting their products, and international companies would be wary about entering the Australian market, \u201cmaking both Australian businesses and government agencies vulnerable to cyberattack and data breaches\u201d. Under the current law, agencies require a warrant or other authorisation to intercept electronic communications but do not require an additional court order to issue notices that can force tech companies to spy on their own users or build capabilities to crack encryption. The industry groups argued this level of oversight was insufficient and it was \u201conly appropriate that the far-reaching powers granted by the legislation are supervised by an eligible judge\u201d. Government amendments have clarified that a systemic weakness \u2013 which companies cannot be asked to build \u2013 is one that \u201caffects a whole class of technology, but does not include a weakness that is selectively introduced to one or more target technologies that are connected with a particular person\u201d. The industry groups labelled this definition \u201cdifficult to understand, ambiguous and \u2026 significantly too narrow\u201d. They backed Labor amendments, which prohibit actions which \u201cwould or may create a material risk that otherwise secure information would or may in the future be accessed, used, manipulated, disclosed or otherwise compromised by an unauthorised third party\u201d. The industry groups argued that many safeguards can be sidestepped by law enforcement agencies labelling a request \u201curgent\u201d, warning that is \u201csomething that it is easy to imagine agencies would almost invariably do\u201d. They also cited concerns the law creates loopholes that allow agencies to mandate metadata retention, warning that if the new encryption bill powers are used law enforcement agencies may not need a special warrant to access journalists\u2019 metadata. They concluded that the law needed further amendment to \u201censure that the legislation does not weaken existing cybersecurity structures, that it balances security and privacy considerations and minimises unintended consequences\u201d.

Instead the day is bright and smack-in-the-face cold. Yesterday it rained and smelled of damp sheep; tomorrow will be different. There are emergency sirens on the main road, several: something bad has happened. There is the wave-rumble of a passing aeroplane, going somewhere under a waxing, gibbous moon. There is the clacking of jackdaws in tall trees, agitated by something they take as a warning. All this is swallowed by a north-westerly breeze.</p> <p>A stream passes through culverts underground and can be heard flowing beneath iron inspection hatches in the road. Yesterday\u2019s rain, the flush from fields, ditch trickles, spliced into a watery hawser dragged through clay and limestone down to the brook, through red roots of alder to the Severn, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bartleby.com/357/20.html\">a stone fountain weeping out my year</a>\u201d, as John Donne wrote in his poem Twickenham Garden.</p> <p>January is cautious about the passing of time and at this end of the year has more to lose. The robins, great tits, song thrushes \u2013 they ease themselves from sub-songs into the shine of day on the shoulder of wind but are still circumspect. There is something lodged in the birds\u2019 syrinx, close to the heart, hungry and stern, that holds them back; their evening half-song is now half familiar. Catkins hang stiffly, anticipating bad weather, reluctant to let loose their golden clouds of pollen yet; light catches in the hazel\u2019s metallic sheen. In the black buds of ash, purple of birch, bronze of oak and red of hawthorn, the leaves are wrapped tight around a punctuation mark in a story yet to yield.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a caution!\u201d once meant you were astonishing or amusing; January\u2019s character is that: fugitive and odd. I dreamed last night that I was given a handful of white pills and swallowed them without thinking, without asking why. The pills were like snowdrops in the lee of the wall, returning as they always do in the comedy of weathers. As it darkens now at five and the forecast is uncertain, owls call the January cautions.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "January\u2019s cautionary snowdrops open in the lee of a stone wall; they are as white as splashes of wood pigeon droppings under their roost tree, as white as snow that has not yet come. Instead the day is bright and smack-in-the-face cold. Yesterday it rained and smelled of damp sheep; tomorrow will be different. There are emergency sirens on the main road, several: something bad has happened. There is the wave-rumble of a passing aeroplane, going somewhere under a waxing, gibbous moon. There is the clacking of jackdaws in tall trees, agitated by something they take as a warning. All this is swallowed by a north-westerly breeze. A stream passes through culverts underground and can be heard flowing beneath iron inspection hatches in the road. Yesterday\u2019s rain, the flush from fields, ditch trickles, spliced into a watery hawser dragged through clay and limestone down to the brook, through red roots of alder to the Severn, \u201ca stone fountain weeping out my year\u201d, as John Donne wrote in his poem Twickenham Garden. January is cautious about the passing of time and at this end of the year has more to lose. The robins, great tits, song thrushes \u2013 they ease themselves from sub-songs into the shine of day on the shoulder of wind but are still circumspect. There is something lodged in the birds\u2019 syrinx, close to the heart, hungry and stern, that holds them back; their evening half-song is now half familiar. Catkins hang stiffly, anticipating bad weather, reluctant to let loose their golden clouds of pollen yet; light catches in the hazel\u2019s metallic sheen. In the black buds of ash, purple of birch, bronze of oak and red of hawthorn, the leaves are wrapped tight around a punctuation mark in a story yet to yield. \u201cYou\u2019re a caution!\u201d once meant you were astonishing or amusing; January\u2019s character is that: fugitive and odd. I dreamed last night that I was given a handful of white pills and swallowed them without thinking, without asking why. The pills were like snowdrops in the lee of the wall, returning as they always do in the comedy of weathers. As it darkens now at five and the forecast is uncertain, owls call the January cautions.",

The NSW education minister, Rob Stokes, expressed disappointment with the authority over the error and said new certificates would be printed and distributed. \u201cI am furious that the independent authority charged with running the HSC failed to give NSW students the respect their hard work and dedication deserves by getting something as simple as the date right on their certificate,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve made it clear to NESA that this needs to be corrected immediately and I understand reprinting is already under way.\u201d Labor\u2019s education spokesman, Jihad Dib, said students had a right to feel let down. \u201cWe asked 70 000 HSC students to give their best last year,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhat do what they get in return?

But four months later the News Corp co-chairman has spoken out to deny the incendiary charge. In an upcoming edition of the Monthly magazine, journalist Pamela Williams quotes Lachlan directly contradicting the version of events which Turnbull says took place at News Corp\u2019s Surry Hills headquarters on 16 August at a meeting between Rupert, Lachlan and Stokes. \u201cI was the only other person in the meeting and KRM [Rupert] definitely never said \u2018Malcolm\u2019s got to go\u2019 or mused on how business would be better under a Labor government,\u201d he told the Schwarz Media publication. \u201cHis mind doesn\u2019t work like that and I have never heard him say anything like it.\u201d The former prime minister, who was removed a week after the meeting between media moguls took place, was warned in a phone call from Stokes that the executive chairman of News Corp was intent on removing him from power, Guardian Australia reported in September. According to sources close to Turnbull, the former prime minister said Stokes relayed in a conversation in mid August that he had been in contact with Murdoch and had discussed a News Corp push for a leadership change. Stokes is said to have replied that the likely result of such a campaign would be to deliver government to Labor and Bill Shorten. Murdoch, according to both reports, brushed aside Stokes\u2019s concerns, saying Labor would only be in office for three years. \u201cThey\u2019ll only be in for three years \u2013 it won\u2019t be so bad,\u201d the AFR reported Murdoch as saying. \u201cI did alright under Labor and the Painters and Dockers; I can make money under Shorten and the CFMEU.\u201d",

The Nordic countries have some of the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/11/29/the-countries-most-reliant-on-tax-revenue-infographic/#78bc8e433180\">highest tax/GDP ratios in the world</a> and also have some of the most prosperous and cohesive societies. Many developing countries in Africa and Asia have very low levels of tax collection and some of the <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS\">weakest economies in the world</a>. If investment simply flowed to the countries with the lowest tax rates then all of the world\u2019s cars, computers and clothes would be manufactured in tax havens like the Cayman Islands. But of course, despite their low taxes, almost nothing is produced in tax havens \u2013 beyond accounting services.</p> <p>There is also clear evidence that there is no \u201cright\u201d way to collect the amount of tax preferred by a country\u2019s citizens. The \u201clefties\u201d in the US have a strong preference for the kind of property taxes and wealth taxes that give Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg conniptions. The Tories in the UK oversee <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/inheritance-tax\">a 40% inheritance tax</a>, which in Australia would obviously be called a \u201cdeath duty\u201d and deemed as \u201cclass warfare\u201d.

After decades of the ALP and Coalition agreeing that lower taxes would deliver benefits that would \u201ctrickle down\u201d to the broader community, we are about to have the first election in a generation where the government are keen to place competing ideas about revenue collection at the centre of their election campaigns. Get your popcorn!</p> <p>Conservative commentators seem convinced that Shorten\u2019s plans to close tax loopholes like the capital gains tax concession, negative gearing for investment properties and franking credit refunds <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/accountants-vow-to-campaign-against-3000-cap-on-managing-tax-affairs-20190113-h1a0d4\">will cost him enormously at this year\u2019s election</a>. At the same time the ALP\u2019s strategists seem convinced that talking about spending more on schools, roads and hospitals that are funded by making the tax system fairer is a political winner for the opposition. If one thing is for sure, by May this year we will know who was completely wrong.</p> <p>For decades political commentators, and many voters, have complained that the two major parties had become virtually indistinguishable. You don\u2019t hear many people say that anymore. But regardless of what you think of either major party\u2019s policies, the fact that they are offering us, the voters, a clear alternative is to be applauded.</p> <p>While we will need to wait a while for the Australian Electoral Commission to tell us which vision for Australia is the most popular, early signs are ominous for the Morrison government. Shorten spelled out his proposed changes to negative gearing before the last federal election and his clamp-down on franking credit refunds before the Batman byelection, and he did much better in both contests than was expected. The Coalition have been attacking the proposed changes for years in some cases, yet they still lag behind Labor by as much as 10 points in some polls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/30/can-australia-learn-from-its-tax-mistakes-of-the-past\">Can Australia learn from its tax past? | Ben Oquist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Victorian state election provided another rebuke to Coalition strategists who believe that scare campaigns about Labor\u2019s economic management are a substitute for a positive vision for the country. Daniel Andrews trounced his Victorian Liberal opponents at last year\u2019s state election on the back of promises to spend more money on essential services and infrastructure.</p> <p>Australia is one of the richest countries in the world yet as anyone who has travelled to Europe knows, our cities and our essential services are far from world\u2019s best practice. For 30 years Australian voters have been told, by both major political parties, that if we cut taxes and public spending sufficiently, we would become rich enough to have world class services one day. Strangely it didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>Democracy isn\u2019t perfect and it\u2019s not quick, but it was set up to answer big questions about what we want more of and what we want less of. The ALP is doubling down on its strategy of closing tax loopholes and spending more on services. The Liberals are sticking with the importance of cutting taxes and cutting public spending.

The Nordic countries have some of the highest tax/GDP ratios in the world and also have some of the most prosperous and cohesive societies. Many developing countries in Africa and Asia have very low levels of tax collection and some of the weakest economies in the world. If investment simply flowed to the countries with the lowest tax rates then all of the world\u2019s cars, computers and clothes would be manufactured in tax havens like the Cayman Islands. But of course, despite their low taxes, almost nothing is produced in tax havens \u2013 beyond accounting services. There is also clear evidence that there is no \u201cright\u201d way to collect the amount of tax preferred by a country\u2019s citizens. The \u201clefties\u201d in the US have a strong preference for the kind of property taxes and wealth taxes that give Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg conniptions. The Tories in the UK oversee a 40% inheritance tax, which in Australia would obviously be called a \u201cdeath duty\u201d and deemed as \u201cclass warfare\u201d. Countries as diverse as Sweden and South Korea raise revenue through carbon pricing. Norway has become rich by taxing its oil reserves while Australia has literally chosen to give much of its gas away for free, mostly to multinational companies which pay little or no company tax here in Australia. And while there is no clear evidence about the right amount of tax to collect and the way to collect it, luckily the Australian constitution allows us to have elections to make such important decisions. After decades of the ALP and Coalition agreeing that lower taxes would deliver benefits that would \u201ctrickle down\u201d to the broader community, we are about to have the first election in a generation where the government are keen to place competing ideas about revenue collection at the centre of their election campaigns. Get your popcorn! Conservative commentators seem convinced that Shorten\u2019s plans to close tax loopholes like the capital gains tax concession, negative gearing for investment properties and franking credit refunds will cost him enormously at this year\u2019s election. At the same time the ALP\u2019s strategists seem convinced that talking about spending more on schools, roads and hospitals that are funded by making the tax system fairer is a political winner for the opposition. If one thing is for sure, by May this year we will know who was completely wrong. For decades political commentators, and many voters, have complained that the two major parties had become virtually indistinguishable. You don\u2019t hear many people say that anymore. But regardless of what you think of either major party\u2019s policies, the fact that they are offering us, the voters, a clear alternative is to be applauded. While we will need to wait a while for the Australian Electoral Commission to tell us which vision for Australia is the most popular, early signs are ominous for the Morrison government. Shorten spelled out his proposed changes to negative gearing before the last federal election and his clamp-down on franking credit refunds before the Batman byelection, and he did much better in both contests than was expected. The Coalition have been attacking the proposed changes for years in some cases, yet they still lag behind Labor by as much as 10 points in some polls. The Victorian state election provided another rebuke to Coalition strategists who believe that scare campaigns about Labor\u2019s economic management are a substitute for a positive vision for the country. Daniel Andrews trounced his Victorian Liberal opponents at last year\u2019s state election on the back of promises to spend more money on essential services and infrastructure. Australia is one of the richest countries in the world yet as anyone who has travelled to Europe knows, our cities and our essential services are far from world\u2019s best practice. For 30 years Australian voters have been told, by both major political parties, that if we cut taxes and public spending sufficiently, we would become rich enough to have world class services one day. Strangely it didn\u2019t work. Democracy isn\u2019t perfect and it\u2019s not quick, but it was set up to answer big questions about what we want more of and what we want less of. The ALP is doubling down on its strategy of closing tax loopholes and spending more on services. The Liberals are sticking with the importance of cutting taxes and cutting public spending. I can\u2019t wait. \u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist for the Australia Institute",

      "bodyText": "We are closing down for the night \u2013 thanks for following along. Here are today\u2019s key political developments: The government has been shut down for a record 32 days and federal employees are about to miss their second paycheck of the year. Dueling bills to reopen the government will be brought to the Senate Thursday but so far leaders remain divided. Meanwhile, the FBI and TSA are both struggling to sustain security operations. It\u2019s been a while since an official White House press conference \u2013 a whopping 35 days, in fact. Amid calls for more transparency, Trump responded on Twitter, blaming the press. It was a big day for the supreme court, which allowed a Trump administration policy that bars most transgender people from the military to stand as lower courts debate it. Documents published by BuzzFeed show Trump\u2019s pre-presidency plans for tower in Moscow included a $50m suite for Putin and a spa branded for his daughter Ivanka. The State department\u2019s top diplomat for European affairs resigned. The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger has more on that here: See you tomorrow! Speaking on a panel about the future of the oceans at the World Economic Forum today, former secretary of state John Kerry said his advice to President Trump is to resign. The comment, made as a response to a question, was met with laughs, followed by applause and cheers from the crowd. Kerry also issued a scathing criticism of the US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, saying \u201cpeople will die because of the president\u2019s decision\u201d there damage from climate change will cost billions. Trump has not commented on Kerry\u2019s remark and did not attend the conference due to the ongoing government shutdown, but he did respond to criticism over his absence today on Twitter, with a jab at the news media. Guardian political correspondent Lauren Gambino reports that The House Oversight Committee has just welcomed several high-profile progressives to the panel, which has jurisdiction over interrogating the Trump administration: Freshman congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and second-term congressman Ro Khanna will sit on the committee, Democratic sources familiar with the appointments confirmed to the Guardian. For the next two years, the Democratic-controlled panel will have a wide mandate to investigate Trump\u2019s business conflicts of interest, personnel decisions and other actions by the Trump administration officials. \u201cThey\u2019ve certainly stacked the committee\u201d with progressives, one source said. Michael Cohen, the presidents long-time lawyer, is set to testify before the committee on 7 February. He may not know what he\u2019s in for. Following a New York Times report that Trump repeatedly told aides of his desire to pull the US out of Nato, the House resoundingly passed legislation reinforcing the military alliance and barring any use of funds for withdrawal. The legislation also calls for allies to fulfill their financial commitments to Nato, an issue the president has cited repeatedly when criticizing the organization. Emphasizing the role the alliance played to end the Cold War and contain Russian power, Democratic House leader Steny Hoyer told reporters that the bill sent a strong message. \u201cThis bill makes it clear the United States Congress still believes in the NATO mission and will prevent any short-sighted efforts to undermine the NATO or unilaterally withdrawal our country\u201d he said. On Thursday, the Senate will have the chance to vote on two competing bills to open the government \u2014 one backed by Republican Senate Majority leader, Mitch McConnell, which funds the President\u2019s border wall and expands some protections for \u201cdreamers\u201d and a House package that provides funding through Feb 8 while negotiations continue. Both require 60 votes to move forward. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has issued an official statement calling for support for her solution, and indicating Democratic disapproval for McConnell\u2019s proposal. Here is her statement in full: On Thursday, the Senate will have the opportunity to put a bipartisan bill on the President\u2019s desk to re-open government and end this senseless shutdown. \u2018Families across the nation have been suffering under the shutdown for more than a month. There is no excuse for Senate Republicans not to pass this legislation, which contains the funding proposal that they have already supported. \u2018Senate Republicans need to re-open government, not continue their complicity in the Trump Shutdown with a vote for the President\u2019s unacceptable border and immigration schemes that only increase the chaos and suffering at the border. \u2018The Senate GOP and President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, and re-open government immediately\u201d. Closing out a month without pay, TSA agents are calling out from work at increasing rates, hampering security efforts at America\u2019s busiest airports. Unexcused absences are more than double the norm, with more than 10% not showing up for work. The agency is now requesting backup, CNN reports, hoping 250 volunteer agents will be willing to fill in and head out to understaffed areas. In an email obtained by the news network, officials asked the unpaid workers to travel to some of its busiest cities, including New York, Chicago, and Atlanta \u2014 where the Super Bowl is scheduled for the first weekend in February, offering to cover travel costs. This is the second request of this kind made by the agency during the shutdown, and roughly 160 volunteered last time. Spokesperson Jim Gregory told CNN that the TSA is doing what it can to ensure security lanes aren\u2019t closed: \u201cIn coordination with the airlines and airport authorities, our federal security directors will implement contingency plans as necessary, which could mean lane closures\u201d he told CNN, adding, \u201cwe have seen very few lane closures across the nation so far\u201d. Trump may have grounded his delegation\u2019s trip to Davos for this year\u2019s World Economic Forum, but he hasn\u2019t escaped being one of the focal points in criticism and concern at the annual gathering of global elites. Feelings toward Trump have chilled since last year\u2019s conference, when business leaders were delighted by global growth trends and the promise of big corporate tax cuts in the US. Now, they are growingly uneasy as the government shutdown looms onward and the President continues a seemingly endless trade war with China. Citing ongoing trade disputes as a big risk to the global economy, the . International Monetary Fund released a report reducing its growth estimates for the year ahead. \u201cAfter two years of solid expansion, the world economy is growing more slowly than expected, and risks are rising\u201d IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters in at the conference. According to the Washington Post, executives are becoming increasingly fearful of worldwide recision, despite Trump\u2019s assertions that his policies will fill everyone\u2019s pockets. Chief executives ranked a global recession as their number one concern for 2019, according to a survey of nearly 800 top business leaders around the world released Thursday by The Conference Board. Global trade threats came in second. Even consumers, who power the U.S. economy, are on edge. Consumer confidence has fallen to the lowest level of Trump\u2019s presidency, according to the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey out Friday.\u201d Gabrielle Canon here, taking over for Amanda Holpuch. BuzzFeed News has released documents showing that Trump\u2019s Russian real estate plans were much more developed than the president has let on, contradicting his previous claims that the project was just an idea that had barely gotten off the ground. Trump Tower Moscow, a skyscraper on the Moscow river providing roughly 250 luxury condos to Russian elites \u2014 including a $50 million suite at the top offered for free to Putin \u2014 and a spa by Ivanka, branded by Trump\u2019s daughter, and was expected to turn over $300 million in profits: By the time Donald Trump signed the project\u2019s letter of intent, he was four months into his presidential campaign \u2014 running for the highest office in America while conducting private business negotiations with a hostile nation. Today that choice has produced controversy and possible legal risk. But back then, it seemed to be pure upside. \u2018Let\u2019s make this happen and build a Trump Moscow\u2019 Sater wrote to Cohen shortly beforehand. \u2018And possibly fix relations between the countries by showing everyone that commerce &amp; business are much better and more practical than politics. \u2026 Help world peace and make a lot of money, I would say that\u2019s a great lifetime goal for us to go after\u2019\u201d. Representatives for some of the country\u2019s largest immigrant rights groups aren\u2019t mincing words \u2013 they say the latest Republican border proposal is \u201ca trojan horse of poison pills.\u201d A coalition of advocates sent out their summary of the impact such a bill would have on immigrants. Greg Chen, director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA): The President feigned concern for children and families seeking asylum from Central America, but this bill will bring to an end asylum for all minors from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala arriving at the US border. This historic change in asylum law would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum. The only path the bill provides for these Central American children is a sham program limited to 15,000 children each year\u2014a fraction of those in need. Royce Murray, managing director of programs at the American Immigration Council: For TPS holders, the proposal offers little relief to too few and makes it unreasonably hard to access. It would create a labyrinth of legal hurdles to seek \u201cprovisional presence\u201d and charge exorbitant new fees to apply. It also makes dramatic changes to the future of the TPS program, risking deportation to disaster for anyone who is undocumented when their home country undergoes a crisis. Patrice Lawrence, national policy and advocacy director at the UndocuBlack Network said: This deal is not a deal. It is an extortion agreement or ransom note. TPS communities have continued to emphasize the importance of not harming themselves, their families or members of their extended community with any kind of immigration package. We cannot accept anything less than a deal that leads to a permanent path to citizenship for TPS holders. This deal leaves out all the African countries, all the black constituents who have TPS. This is not a deal, this is a sham. Guardian political reporter, Lauren Gambino, notes that while the two bills are being voted on on Thursday, there is little evidence to suggest either can get enough support to make it through the Senate. It\u2019s far from certain whether either bill can garner enough support to pass the chamber. Democrats, who are opposed to a wall, likely have the votes to block Trump\u2019s proposal. The Democratic proposal would have to win the support of at least 13 Republicans to reach the 60-vote threshold. The Senate approved a short-term funding bill in December that would have averted a shutdown and kept the agencies running until 8 February. That measure passed the Senate without any opposition but Trump later said he would not support it because the plan did not include funding for his wall. The Republican-controlled House declined to vote on the measure. Since re-taking the majority in the House, Democrats have passed a number of bills that would re-open the shuttered agencies, but the Senate has refused to vote on them, arguing that they won\u2019t take up legislation the president won\u2019t sign. The Senate will vote on Thursday on a pair of bills that would end the partial shutdown of the federal government now in its fifth week. The first bill, a Republican-backed measure, would meet the president\u2019s demand for a $5.7bn wall along the southern border in exchange for temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants and the second would extend funding for the agencies that are currently closed through 8 February. The compromise, reached by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority leader Chuck Schumer, is the first sign of progress after a 32-day stalemate over the partial shutdown, which has left as many as 800,000 government workers without pay. They announced the compromise on the Senate floor on Tuesday, with Schumer predicting that the short-term funding proposal \u201ccould break us out of the morass we are in\u201d. \u201cPeople are saying: Isn\u2019t there a way out of this mess? Isn\u2019t there a way to relieve the burden on the 800,000 federal workers not getting paid? Isn\u2019t there a way to get government services open first and debate what we should do for border security later?\u201d he said. \u201cWell, now there is a way.\u201d It is 46 years since the supreme court voted in favor of a women\u2019s right to access an abortion in the Roe v Wade case. The majority of Americans want to see Roe remain in place, but Trump\u2019s conservative government has had many worried they would seek to overturn it. But Anna North at Vox writes that the abortion rights movement is \u201coptimistic\u201d heading into 2019: Planned Parenthood is seeing an awareness \u201cthat as we approach the 46th anniversary of Roe v Wade passing, we are once again in the fight of our lives,\u201d said Dr Leana Wen, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In the midterm elections, she added, the group saw voters energized to support candidates who back abortion rights. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen women, particularly women of color, rise up in record numbers,\u201d she said. One result was a House of Representatives with \u201cmore pro-choice members than ever before.\u201d Meanwhile, for some voters, the Kavanaugh battle raised awareness of an issue they may not have fully understood. \u201cMost people just don\u2019t know what the status is where they live of their ability to access abortion for themselves or a loved one,\u201d Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, explained. The urgency around the Kavanaugh confirmation has \u201ccreated a focus of attention that creates a phenomenal opportunity to close that knowledge gap,\u201d she said. The Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, has more on the resignation of the State department\u2019s top diplomat for European affairs: Mitchell calls himself a devoted Atlanticist and insisted that \u201cnothing could be further from the truth\u201d that US membership of Nato was in question. Mitchell was instrumental in promoting a friendlier US policy towards Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s right-wing prime minister, and also helped broker a settlement with Greece over Macedonia\u2019s name. \u201cWess has been one of the pillars of this administration\u2019s most constructive foreign policy ideas,\u201d said Daniel Fried who did the same Europe assistant secretary job at state department in the George W Bush administration. \u201cHe has generated wide respect in Europe and his loss will be felt.\u201d \u201cMitchell was a strong supporter of Nato, particularly in Eastern Europe where he will be sorely missed,\u201d said Thomas Wright, the director of the Centre on the US and Europe at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHis departure comes follows the resignation of senior Pentagon officials \u2013 Robert Karem and Tom Goffus \u2013 working on NATO along with Secretary Mattis. Without this pro-alliance caucus, Nato is now more vulnerable than at any time since the beginning of the Trump administration.\u201d The US military said an American service member was killed by enemy fire in Afghanistan. No other details, including the service member\u2019s name or branch, were released pending the notification of the family. The incident is being investigated, the military said. The shutdown and border vote is officially on the schedule \u2013 and the odds are low either can drum up the support needed to pass. The White House Correspondents Association president, Olivier Knox, issued a statement about the record absence of on-screen press briefings at the White House. It\u2019s been 35 days since White House press secretary Sarah Sanders took questions from reporters, on-screen. \u201cThis retreat from transparency and accountability sets a terrible precedent, \u201c Knox said. \u201cBeing able to question the press secretary or other government officials publicly helps the news media tell Americans what their most powerful representatives are doing in their name. \u201cWhile other avenues exist to obtain information, the robust, public back-and-forth we\u2019ve come to expect in the James A Brady briefing room helps highlight that no one in a healthy republic is above being questioned.\u201d Senate Majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said Democrats should support his bill to reopen the government and provide funding for a border wall. \u201cThe opportunity to end all this is staring us right in the face,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ll vote on this legislation on the Senate floor this week. All that needs to happen is for our Democratic colleagues to agree that it\u2019s time to put the country ahead of politics, take yes for an answer and vote to put this standoff behind us.\u201d McConnell said the bill should appeal to Democrats hoping to extend protections to so-called \u201cDreamer\u201d immigrants, though immigration lawyers have raised concerns that the bill barely offers protections while also introducing several harsh immigration restrictions. McConnell emphasized this bill was the only legislation before Congress that would reopen the government and which Trump will sign. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the proposal was a \u201cnonstarter\u201d and told reporters the president must re-open the government before they can negotiate a border security bill. Pelosi said Congress can\u2019t fulfill Trump\u2019s demands \u201cevery time he has an objection\u201d and threatens to \u201chold the employees hostage\u201d in case it sets a precedent. The US health department secretary, Alez Azar, has declined to testify before Congress about the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy. While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) separated families, it was the health department that was responsible for separated children, who were moved to its custody while their parents were put in immigration detention, released in the US or deported. House Energy and Commerce chairman, Frank Pallone, said in a statement that Azar declined to appear before the committee in a scheduled hearing about the policy. Pallone said: Azar has yet to testify before Congress at a hearing specifically on this cruel policy. The stonewalling must end, and Secretary Azar must agree to appear before the Committee to answer questions and take accountability for his agency\u2019s actions. Azar\u2019s denial to appear before the Committee in the coming weeks on the Family Separation Policy is unacceptable, and we are going to get him here at some point one way or another. Last week, the health department\u2019s internal watchdog reported that the Trump administration may have separated thousands of migrant children from their parents at the border for up to a year before family separation was a publicly known practice: And here\u2019s some scenes from the Senate, where lawmakers are debating how to bring an end to the shutdown. Guardian political correspondent, Lauren Gambino, writes that FBI agents have warned the partial federal government shutdown has \u201chindered\u201d the bureau\u2019s ability to conduct operations and pursue investigations. Her report from today\u2019s press conference on this new report: Thousands of union members are among hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors now without pay for a fifth week. As the FBI Agents Association released a report containing firsthand accounts of how the 32-day shutdown has affected operations, its president, Tom O\u2019Connor, demanded Congress and Donald Trump fully fund the FBI. \u201cThe failure to fund the FBI undermines essential FBI operations, such as those designated to combat crimes against children, drug and gang crime and terrorism,\u201d O\u2019Connor told reporters. He declined to say whether Americans were less safe as a result of the shutdown. \u201cI will leave that question up to you to answer,\u201d he said. Update 2:16pm ET: White House sources told the Guardian Ingraham\u2019s statement was inaccurate. Conservative commentator Laura Ingraham said some of the the high school students who were filmed apparently confronting a Native American activist and military veteran in a video that went viral this weekend will be meeting with Donald Trump at the White House \u201cas early as tomorrow.\u201d The students from the Covington Catholic high school, in northern Kentucky, were filmed appearing to mock a group of Native Americans taking part in the Indigenous Peoples March in Washington DC last Friday. The student at the centre of the footage, Nick Sandmann, later said he was confronted by one Native American activist. Donald Trump defended the students, who were in DC to attend the anti-abortion rally, March for Life. \u201cNick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey have captivated the attention of the world, and I know they will use it for the good \u2013 maybe even to bring people together. \u201cIt started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream!\u201d It\u2019s nearly 2pm on the east coast, where senators have just met in Washington DC to discuss a potential end to the shutdown. The government has now been partially closed for a record-breaking 32 days. Today also marks 35 days since White House press secretary Sarah Sanders gave an on-camera press briefing. This, too, is a record. It was a big day for the supreme court, which allowed a Trump administration policy that bars most transgender people from the military to continue as lower courts debate the policy\u2019s merits. The supreme court also agreed to hear oral arguments in the first case that involves the Second Amendment gun protections since 2010. Vice president Mike Pence issued support for Venezuelans who oppose the presidency of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a video message. Marches are planned in Venezuela tomorrow to express opposition to Maduro\u2019s regime. The FBI Agents Association, a non-governmental advocacy group for agents, reported today that the agency is facing operational challenges because of the shutdown - which has left agents working in counterterrorism and drug enforcement without adequate funds to pay informants. And California senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat, raised $1.5m in the first 24 hours after officially announcing her run for president. In the first 24 hours after announcing she would run for president, Kamala Harris had raised $1.5m from 38,000 people, according to the Wall Street Journal: The California Democrat saw a burst of $1 million in contributions in the first 12 hours after her appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and the simultaneous release of an online video, her campaign said, adding that the average donation was about $37. Those initial donation numbers are competitive with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign kickoff. His team said at the time that he raised $1.5 million from 35,000 donors in the first 24 hours after his April 30, 2015, announcement. Mr. Sanders, who ultimately raised 85% of his $238 million in increments of $200 or less, is weighing another presidential run. Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, launched her campaign on Monday \u2013 America\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr Day holiday \u2013 in an appearance on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. \u201cLet\u2019s do this, together. Let\u2019s claim our future. For ourselves, for our children, and for our country,\u201d Harris , 54, said in a campaign video that was released to coincide with her appearance on the morning television show. The Senate is currently meeting and is expected to discuss re-opening the government, 32 days into the partial shutdown. It\u2019s not a straightforward path as the president has declared he is comfortable keeping the government shutdown for \u201cmonths and even years\u201d and Democrats have taken a hardline against Trump\u2019s funding proposals so far. Here\u2019s the latest on the Republican measure designed around Trump\u2019s proposal for the border wall funding: Immigration advocates are warning the president\u2019s offer to re-open the government by including protections for certain immigrant groups in his latest border wall proposal masks much more dramatic changes to immigration policy. This includes significant restrictions for asylum seekers and a 20% expansion in immigrant jail beds. Expanding jail beds would make it easier for the Trump administration to detain families, explained the president of immigrant advocacy group FWD.us, Todd Schulte. One concession the GOP claims to make, extending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for people who fled certain countries during natural disasters and humanitarian crisis, is not as broad as Trump claims it is. Schulte said the expansion would only cover four countries: Haiti, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The bill would limit how many Central American minors could apply for asylum each year to 50,000 and only grant 15,000 of those applications, explained Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a policy analyst at the American Immigration Council. (His entire thread is worth reading). The White House has set a new record for days without an on-camera press briefing by press secretary Sarah Sanders - 35 days. Her last briefing was 18 December. Trump responded to this milestone on Twitter: A new survey of 760 registered voters from Democratic polling firm, Public Policy Polling, shows voters prefer any of seven likely Democratic candidates for president in the 2020 election over Donald Trump. In the poll, Trump trails Joe Biden 53-41, Bernie Sanders 51-41, Kamala Harris 48-41, Beto O\u2019Rourke 47-41, Elizabeth Warren 48-42, and Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand each 47-42. Donald Trump is preparing two State of the Union speeches, each for a different audience, according to ABC News: Sources told ABC News that the president was previously planning two separate versions of the State of the Union \u2013 one version if the government was still shut down and another if the government was open. However, now the planning has evolved, assuming the government shutdown could drag on past next Tuesday \u2013 the expected delivery date of the address. If the president decides to deliver a speech in rally form, it would mark the first rally style event the president has attended since the partial shutdown began. As part of the ongoing political tit-for-tat between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Republicans are encouraging Trump to force Pelosi to officially disinvite him, by suggesting the president announce he still intends to deliver the State of the Union from the House chamber, according to Republican sources involved in the discussions The Guardian has not independently confirmed this report. The top US diplomat for Europe is resigning after only 16 months on the job. Wess Mitchell, assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasian affairs, will step down next month said the state department. This will be a blow to Trump administration efforts to maintain trans-Atlantic unity, according to the Associated Press: Mitchell\u2019s departure comes at a time of fractious relations between Washington and European capitals amid disagreements over trade, defense spending and the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Mitchell took up the job in October 2017 under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson after 12 years at a think tank focused on Central European issues. The FBI Agents Association, a non-governmental advocacy group for agents, just released a 72-page report about the impact of the shutdown on special agents. The report features anonymized testimonies from agents across the country. \u201cIn my area of work, a lot of valuable information is gathered from informants,\u201d wrote one agent in the Northeast region. He continued: With the government shutdown, we cannot secure safe places to meet with our informants and we cannot pay them for their information. In most cases, this means to being able to make regular meetings and missing out on information altogether, leaving a concerning gap in intel relating to national security. Another agent who said they were working on an investigation targeting \u201ckilo-quantity trafficking of methamphetamine and heroin by street gang members\u201d warned that funding for his task force has been exhausted. The agent said: Without money to pay sources and conduct controlled narcotics purchases, our task force is unable to continue these critical investigations. This task force is the only task force in this region specifically targeting interstate street gang criminal activities. Agents said the general challenges they face because of the shutdown include delays in processing security clearances, limited operational funding and uncertainty about pay that could drive agents to find jobs elsewhere, according to the report. Vice president Mike Pence has released to Venzuelans ahead of a protest scheduled for Wednesday led by the opposition to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s presidency. Pence issued support for the opposition, the National Assembly, in the video released Tuesday. The vice president said the people of Venezuela had the \u201cunwavering support of the United States.\u201d Pence continued: Nicolas Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power. He has never won the presidency in a free and fair election, and has maintained his grip of power by imprisoning anyone who dares to oppose him. The United States joins with all freedom-loving nations in recognizing your National Assembly as the last vestige of democracy in your country, for it is the only body elected by you, the people. As such, the United States supports the courageous decision by Juan Guaid\u00f3, the President of the National Assembly, to assert that body\u2019s constitutional powers, declare Maduro a usurper, and call for the establishment of a transitional government. Pence concluded the address with a rallying cry in support of the demonstrators: As you make your voices heard tomorrow, on behalf of the American people, we say to all the good people of Venezuela: estamos con ustedes. We are with you, we stand with you, and we will stay with you until democracy is restored and you reclaim your birthright of libertad. Muchas gracias y vayan con Dios. US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, is set to testify before a Congressional committee in March about his decision to include a question about citizenship in the 2020 census. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform announced today that Ross, who oversees the Census, was scheduled to testify on 14 March. A federal judge in New York ruled earlier this month that Ross \u201cviolated the public trust\u201d by adding the question to the Census with a \u201csham justification.\u201d The Trump administration is appealing the ruling. Two members of the band Kiss are offering free meals to workers affected by the partial government shutdown at the chain of airport restaurants they apparently own. Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, who are in Kiss and own Rock &amp; Brews restaurants, said their airport chain will provide free meals to furloughed Transportation Security Administration (TSA) workers. \u201cWhile the TSA continues to work on our behalf without pay, we want to make sure we can at least provide them with a delicious meal to show our support,\u201d Stanley said in a Facebook video. Here\u2019s a nice Guardian interview with Simmons from 2017 in which he does not mention his chain of airport restaurants: The supreme court\u2019s decision to allow the Trump adminstration to continue to restrict transgender\u2019s people military service is not the end of this saga. The policy will be in effect as lower court challenges to the plan play out. A summary of how the supreme court got here from the Associated Press: Until a few years ago service members could be discharged from the military for being transgender. That changed under President Barack Obama. The military announced in 2016 that transgender individuals already serving in the military would be allowed to serve openly. And the military set July 1, 2017 as the date when transgender individuals would be allowed to enlist. But after President Donald Trump took office, the administration delayed the enlistment date, saying the issue needed further study. While that study was ongoing, the president tweeted in late July 2017 that the government would not allow \u201cTransgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\u201d He later directed the military to return to its policy before the Obama administration changes. Groups representing transgender individuals sued, and the Trump administration lost early rounds in those cases, with courts issuing nationwide injunctions barring the administration from altering course. The Supreme Court on Tuesday lifted those preliminary injunctions. One more, but not final, bit of supreme court news: the justices did not take action on a case about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program ended by the Trump administration that allows hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children to temporarily work and live in the US. By not taking up the case, the justices can only hear arguments in their next supreme court term. So, about 700,000 people protected by Daca will be able to keep these protections for the next few months. Trump has raised Daca as a bargaining chip in his negotiations for a border wall, but it remains unclear how the ongoing court cases about the program would impact Daca\u2019s inclusion in his proposed border wall funding plan. The supreme court has allowed a policy that bans most transgender people from serving the military to continue. Under the policy, hundreds of transgender people already in the military can continue their service, but transgender people could not join the military. The policy also allows people who serve \u201cin their biological sex\u201d to join the military. The LGBTQ civil rights group, Lambda Legal, said the supreme court\u2019s decision was \u201cperplexing to say the least.\u201d The group is involved with one of the court challenges to the transgender military restrictions. Lambda Legal counsel, Peter Renn, said in a statement: For more than 30 months, transgender troops have been serving our country openly with valor and distinction, but now the rug has been ripped out from under them, once again. We will redouble our efforts to send this discriminatory ban to the trash heap of history where it belongs. The Supreme Court has also announced it will hear its first case about the Second Amendment since 2010 this term. The case is a challenge to a New York City law that prohibits people licensed to have guns in their homes from transporting the weapons outside the city. The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to limit transgender people from serving in the military while the legality of such a plan continues to be debated in lower courts. The court voted 5-4 in favor of issuing a stay on efforts to block a plan to restrict transgender people\u2019s ability to serve in the military, meaning the plan can be implemented. The dissenting justices were Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. An original Trump adminstration plan to completely block transgender people from serving from the military was blocked by a federal judge. Good morning Today, Congress is back in session after a holiday weekend. Lawmakers must first confront a government shutdown that has surpassed the one month mark. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers and their families have now gone without paychecks or work for 32 days \u2013 and there is no clear resolution in sight. On Saturday, the president offered a new border wall proposal but it is strongly opposed by Democrats who argue Donald Trump must open the government before they can negotiate border wall funding. Outside of negotiations between the White House and Congress, there are 651 days to go until the 2020 election and the Democratic party is already crowded with potential candidates. The group was joined by California senator Kamala Harris, who this weekend officially launched her presidential campaign. After Monday\u2019s federal holiday, this short working week will be packed with shutdown negotiations, further deliberations on the 2020 race and more on US relations with Moscow as the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, provides changing statements about Trump\u2019s dealings with Russian officials.",

      "bodyText": "The organisation behind a funding campaign that has raised almost $300,000 to pay off the unpaid court fines of Aboriginal women in Western Australia has criticised the McGowan government for not working with them to clear the debt. In a letter to the attorney general, John Quigley, the Sisters Inside chief executive, Debbie Kilroy, said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by his response to the campaign, saying that \u201cinstead of working alongside [us], your government has chosen to discredit Sisters Inside and has avoided addressing the ongoing, systemic issues raised directly by the campaign\u201d. The fundraising campaign has raised more than $17,000 a day since it was established on 5 January in response to the arrest of the Perth actor Reuben Yorkshire, a Noongar man, who spent five days in jail for a $1,700 debt before an anonymous benefactor paid off the rest of his fines and secured his release. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Kilroy said attempts by the campaign to receive a list of all the Aboriginal women with active arrest warrants due to unpaid fines had not been successful. Quigley\u2019s office said he \u201cshares the aim of Sisters Inside to keep people out of prison for fine default alone\u201d and aimed to introduce legislation to parliament in the first half of the year to end the practice. A spokeswoman for Quigley, who is on annual leave, said the government had not tried to discredit the campaign but to provide accurate information about the number of people jailed for fine default alone, which has fallen sharply in the past 12 months. The reforms have been promised by Labor since the 2014 death in custody of Aboriginal woman Ms Dhu, who was held at a police lock-up for unpaid fines, and passed cabinet in November. As of this week Sisters Inside, which is administering the campaign, has paid $23,658.56 in unpaid court fines and costs for 13 women. Kilroy told Guardian Australia they were prepared to pay the fines of an additional 55 women but were waiting for the fundraising site GoFundMe to release the money. The organisation dipped into other funding to clear the fines paid so far. Invoices seen by Guardian Australia, which nominate the sheriff\u2019s office in Perth as the payee, show debts ranging from $132 to $4,559. The average amount per person was $1,800. The total owed is split between court-ordered fines for things like traffic offences or breaching an order; court costs; and other administrative costs. Kilroy said that one young mother, who is one of the 55 women whose debts are waiting to be paid, owed more than $9,000 in costs for $8,000 in fines. \u201cThey just can\u2019t ever get their head above water, which is why they can\u2019t pay it,\u201d she said. In another case, an Aboriginal grandmother contacted the campaign after she was told she could lose her house in an attempt to recoup the debt. Under current WA law, the Fines Enforcement Registry can issue a warrant of commitment ordering the arrest of a person who has unpaid court fines. The debt is reduced by $250 for every day a person spends in custody and the fines are cleared concurrently, based on the largest single fine. If debts are paid in cash, however, the total amount must be paid. Kilroy said one of the debts paid belonged to a woman who had been remanded in Melaleuca Remand and Reintegration Facility for unpaid fines but was released after her fines were paid on 8 January. Figures provided by the WA department of corrective services showed that there were no Aboriginal women in jail for fine default alone on Tuesday 8 January, but one Aboriginal woman was held for fine default on the Sunday and Monday prior. During the first few days of the campaign, the department said, there were an average of two women and five men in jail each day for fine defaulting, most of whom were not Aboriginal.",

Five official complaints of sexual assault were lodged with police between 2011 and 2013, but the teenagers were never charged due to a lack of evidence. The Independent Police Conduct Authority found a year-long investigation <a href=\"https://www.ipca.govt.nz/Site/publications-and-media/2015-Media-Releases/2015-Mar-19-Roastbusters-.aspx\">made significant policing errors</a>, failed to follow up leads and did not adhere to best practice for investigating alleged sexual assault.</p> <p>At the time thousands of people staged mass protests in New Zealand, calling for an end to rape culture and justice for the victims, and then prime minister John Key called the group \u201cextremely disturbing and disgusting\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t choose the roast, the roast chooses us ... They know what we\u2019re like; they know what they\u2019re in for,\u201d Parker said in one of the videos, which also \u201cslut-shamed\u201d the girls by naming and picturing them in videos online.</p> <p>\u201cI just kept blacking out \u2018cause I had drunken too much,\u201d one underage girl told national television station Newshub in 2013.</p> <p>Now aged 23, Parker has given <a href=\"https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/01/i-m-trying-to-make-amends-roast-busters-ringleader-joseph-parker-breaks-five-year-silence.html\">his first interview</a>, telling Newshub he is sorry for his actions and wants to \u201cmake amends\u201d for the harm he caused. He also said he had contacted women who were targeted by the group via social media to apologise \u2013 a move sexual assault experts say could be re-traumatising.</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t the monsters everyone thought we were,\u201d Parker told Newshub, who said he considered the experience a blessing which helped him mentally and spiritually grow as a person.</p> <p>\u201cI understand I put them through a lot of hurt and pain; I can only try to understand the hurt they have been put through but I don\u2019t think I will fully understand because I am not them.\u201d</p> <p>The interview was criticised as disturbing and cynical by women\u2019s advocacy groups. It comes at the same time Parker has <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12193969\">launched a crowd-funding campaign to raise money for his music career</a> \u2013 in which he sings songs about the saga.</p> <p>In one song, Parker raps: \u201cJust knowin\u2019 I\u2019m entertaining so many people, the praises had me in a frenzy to maintain it so I\u2019m humiliating females just for the fame, flying the Roast Busters flag higher than a plane.\u201d</p> <p>Two of the women targeted by the Roast Busters reportedly later considered suicide. The youngest alleged victim was 13. The age of consent in New Zealand is 16, and sex with an under-age, intoxicated person is frequently regarded as non-consensual and therefore illegal. </p> <p>Amid the furore on Tuesday, \u201cRoast Busters\u201d became New Zealand\u2019s top Twitter trend.</p> <p>Lizzie Marvelly, the author of The F Word: Growing up Feminist in Aotearoa, tweeted that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d about the Parker interview, and the Roast Busters case was a \u201cnational shame\u201d.</p> <p>Fiona McNamara, general manager of the Sexual Abuse Prevention Network, said the interview could re-traumatise victims and other survivors of sexual violence, and perpetuated rape culture.</p> <p>\u201cIt did not appear to be motivated by genuine empathy for the people that experienced harm \u2026 there were no charges laid and now this person is trying to promote a career and leverage off his notoriety to gain fame and success, is really giving a message that he can get away with anything.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Mediaworks, the company which owns Newshub, said it had received \u201clots of feedback\u201d following the interview, but no official complaints.</p> <p>\u201cReporting does not mean condoning \u2013 a key attribute to successful journalism requires interviewing many sources, including those we regard as wrongdoers, and it is newsworthy when one of the central figures of a story breaks their silence for the first time.\u201d</p>",

Five official complaints of sexual assault were lodged with police between 2011 and 2013, but the teenagers were never charged due to a lack of evidence. The Independent Police Conduct Authority found a year-long investigation made significant policing errors, failed to follow up leads and did not adhere to best practice for investigating alleged sexual assault. At the time thousands of people staged mass protests in New Zealand, calling for an end to rape culture and justice for the victims, and then prime minister John Key called the group \u201cextremely disturbing and disgusting\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t choose the roast, the roast chooses us ... They know what we\u2019re like; they know what they\u2019re in for,\u201d Parker said in one of the videos, which also \u201cslut-shamed\u201d the girls by naming and picturing them in videos online. \u201cI just kept blacking out \u2018cause I had drunken too much,\u201d one underage girl told national television station Newshub in 2013. Now aged 23, Parker has given his first interview, telling Newshub he is sorry for his actions and wants to \u201cmake amends\u201d for the harm he caused. He also said he had contacted women who were targeted by the group via social media to apologise \u2013 a move sexual assault experts say could be re-traumatising. \u201cWe weren\u2019t the monsters everyone thought we were,\u201d Parker told Newshub, who said he considered the experience a blessing which helped him mentally and spiritually grow as a person. \u201cI understand I put them through a lot of hurt and pain; I can only try to understand the hurt they have been put through but I don\u2019t think I will fully understand because I am not them.\u201d The interview was criticised as disturbing and cynical by women\u2019s advocacy groups. It comes at the same time Parker has launched a crowd-funding campaign to raise money for his music career \u2013 in which he sings songs about the saga. In one song, Parker raps: \u201cJust knowin\u2019 I\u2019m entertaining so many people, the praises had me in a frenzy to maintain it so I\u2019m humiliating females just for the fame, flying the Roast Busters flag higher than a plane.\u201d Two of the women targeted by the Roast Busters reportedly later considered suicide. The youngest alleged victim was 13. The age of consent in New Zealand is 16, and sex with an under-age, intoxicated person is frequently regarded as non-consensual and therefore illegal. Amid the furore on Tuesday, \u201cRoast Busters\u201d became New Zealand\u2019s top Twitter trend. Lizzie Marvelly, the author of The F Word: Growing up Feminist in Aotearoa, tweeted that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d about the Parker interview, and the Roast Busters case was a \u201cnational shame\u201d. Fiona McNamara, general manager of the Sexual Abuse Prevention Network, said the interview could re-traumatise victims and other survivors of sexual violence, and perpetuated rape culture. \u201cIt did not appear to be motivated by genuine empathy for the people that experienced harm \u2026 there were no charges laid and now this person is trying to promote a career and leverage off his notoriety to gain fame and success, is really giving a message that he can get away with anything.\u201d A spokesperson for Mediaworks, the company which owns Newshub, said it had received \u201clots of feedback\u201d following the interview, but no official complaints. \u201cReporting does not mean condoning \u2013 a key attribute to successful journalism requires interviewing many sources, including those we regard as wrongdoers, and it is newsworthy when one of the central figures of a story breaks their silence for the first time.\u201d",

Under the changes, operators will receive increased payments of up to \u00a32.75 each time someone withdraws cash from an eligible machine. The extra financial support, paid for by Britain\u2019s banks, is being introduced by Link, the UK\u2019s largest cash machine network, following warnings ATM \u201cdeserts\u201d could be created across the UK as providers shut unprofitable machines in less well-off and rural areas. In June 2018, the consumer group Which? revealed cash machines around the UK were closing at a rate of 300 a month, with rural communities worst affected. About 1,000 ATMs will initially be eligible for the enhanced payments, with this number likely to increase, said Link. Another benefit for consumers is that some cash machines that currently charge users to withdraw money are expected to be converted into free-to-use ones so operators can take the payments. The move follows a row over a phased reduction in \u201cinterchange rates\u201d, the fees card issuers, mainly banks, pay to ATM operators. In January 2018, Link announced a phased 20% cut in interchange rates over four years, from about 25p to 20p. The cuts would have saved banks millions of pounds in charges, but after an outcry from campaigners and concerns from regulators, they were scaled back last summer. The first and second reductions took effect on 1 July 2018 and 1 January 2019, but a third cut in fees, due in January 2020, was cancelled, while the fourth, scheduled for January 2021, was put on hold pending a review. The dramatic increase in contactless payments for small transactions is arguably making cash less necessary, but Which? had said the planned fee cut was making it more difficult for independent operators to survive. The new payments, known as \u201csuper premiums\u201d, will take effect from 1 April. Currently, operators of eligible ATMs receive a top-up subsidy of up to 30p through Link\u2019s financial inclusion programme. The payment is in addition to the interchange rate. There are more than 50,000 free-to-use ATMs across the UK, but the vast majority will not be eligible for the super premiums. Currently, about 3,500 ATMs are protected because they are half a mile or more from the next nearest free cash machine, or are located in low-income parts of the country, as measured by official data, where access to cash is vital. These ATMs were ringfenced from the changes to interchange rates.

      "bodyText": "Amazon has slipped down a list of companies ranked by customer satisfaction after consumers were asked to consider ethics when rating brands. The online retailer, which became the world\u2019s most valuable listed company earlier this month, had taken the top spot in the last six published biannual UK Customer Satisfaction Indexes (UKSCI). But it slipped to fifth place, with a score of 85.4 out of 100, after the Institute of Customer Service (ICS) added new categories, including an ethical dimension to the poll of 10,000 consumers. Amazon has previously faced high-profile criticism over the working conditions experienced by its employees and its relatively meagre tax contribution in the UK. The bank First Direct moved to the top of the list, beating 246 other brands with a score of 86.7, with retailer John Lewis in second place and Marks &amp; Spencer coming fourth. The retail sector performed best with an average score of 81.6, while transport was the worst on 71.8 after a nightmare year for train passengers in particular. The survey asks consumers to rate brands out of 100 based on categories, including the professionalism of staff, quality and efficiency of service, trust and transparency, customer experience and handling of complaints. Amazon did not feature in the top 10 for ethics, which was added for the first time, although it did in two other areas. In a score out of 10 for doing the right thing, in terms of its business practices and impact on employees and society, it scored seven. The Guardian has approached the company for comment. John Lewis, which shares profits with staff, scored 8.6. Sports Direct, criticised for \u201cworkhouse\u201d conditions in its warehouse by MPs in the wake of a Guardian investigation, registered the lowest score among major retailers, with just 6.1. Amazon\u2019s fall to fifth place overall puts it just behind the high street fashion chain Next but ahead of Nationwide Building Society, Netflix and Argos. The ICS did not publish the full list of 247 brands included in the survey, meaning it is not possible to identify which brand was given the lowest score for overall customer satisfaction. Its chief executive, Jo Causon, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t publish all of them because it\u2019s about helping organisations to get better.

Among non-food retailers, Currys/PC World did the worst out of the top 25 with a score of 73.6 due to a particularly low score for its handling of complaints. RBS was the worst of 15 banks, scoring 73.5, putting it just below TSB, which plummeted to the second-lowest in the table after its IT meltdown last year. The lowest-performing food retailer was Morrisons on 79.",

      "bodyText": "The education of tens of thousands of children has been damaged by academy failures and the misuse of public funds, a parliamentary watchdog has concluded. In a report published on Wednesday, the public accounts committee (PAC) said governance of academy trusts must be strengthened, and that the Department for Education\u2019s (DfE) oversight must be more rigorous. MPs have also questioned the ability of the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) to control academies\u2019 executive pay awards following a series of high-profile scandals. The report said the DfE should ensure that academy trusts were sufficiently transparent and accountable to parents and communities. Its conclusions follow increasing concern over the academies programme, which began in 2000 under Labour but has been widened by the Conservatives. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said the education of many pupils had been badly affected. \u201cWe have seen the troubling consequences of poor governance and oversight of academy trusts,\u201d she said. \u201cParents and the wider community are entitled to proper access to transparent information about their local academy schools.\u201d The 7,500 academies in England educate nearly 4 million pupils. The report said some academy trusts had misused public money but not faced proper sanctions because of DfE failings. In particular, MPs have called for new sanctions to deter and punish malpractice after hearing that the former head of the controversial Durand Academy in south London was paid an \u00a3850,000 severance package. MPs examined the troubles at Bright Tribe, which ran 10 schools in the north and east of England that are now being found new sponsors. They concluded that parents at the trust did not know to whom they could turn when they wished to raise concerns about academy schools or trusts and called for a review of DfE complaints procedures. The committee also reported that almost a quarter of schools had still not come forward with the information the DfE needed on asbestos in school buildings. Last March, the DfE launched its asbestos management assurance process to collect information on how the issue in schools was being managed. Despite the initial deadline for responses being extended several times to take it from 31 May 2018 to 27 July last year, only 77% of schools responded and the deadline was extended again to 15 February this year. The committee recommended that in March the DfE should \u201cname and shame\u201d the schools that failed to meet the deadline. MPs said the DfE should write to the committee by March to set out what sanctions it had imposed to date and explain how it planned to strengthen the sanctions regime to deter, punish and prevent malpractice in relation to academy trusts. It also recommended that within two months of finishing the work, the ESFA should publish the results of its inquiries into concerns about the financial management and governance of academy trusts. Accounts released in November showed that 125 trusts paid a salary of \u00a3150,000 a year in 2016-17. The department refused to accept the \u201cnegative characterisation of academies\u201d in the committee\u2019s report. \u201cThe majority of academies are delivering a great education and \u2013 as recognised by the PAC \u2013 we are taking robust action in the small minority of cases where they are not meeting the high standards expected,\u201d a DfE spokesperson said.",
