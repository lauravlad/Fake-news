This is an understatement. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the climate and environmental crises of our time cannot be addressed solely, or even principally, through science and technology. The situation requires a much broader range of expertise. Arts and humanities graduates are essential to the necessary processes of thinking our way from our present system into sustainable ways of living for the future. This thinking cannot be achieved without a complex understanding of past societies, the stories that we tell about ourselves, and how we arrived in our present dangerous situation. It needs people who can engage critically and productively with the deeply embedded ideas that make change extremely difficult to envisage. It needs people who can communicate new ideas through a wide range of media, including visual arts, music and literature, and do so in engaging and expressive language. The arts and humanities have never been more fundamental to imagining and creating a liveable future for humanity. It is imperative that policymakers recognise this. Dr Amanda Power University of Oxford \u2022 Between 1965 and 1971 I attended two universities, one redbrick, one Oxbridge. Perhaps I had a sheltered student career but I cannot recall anyone at either institution mentioning a link between graduation and earning capacity. A generation later, I shocked a school meeting, designed to inform parents and students about the application process, by referring to universities as stretching young people\u2019s thinking processes to enable them to make a distinctive contribution to the common good. There was bafflement all round. Margaret Thatcher was coming towards the end of her time as prime minister. Whatever her governments did with the economy, the cultural damage should never be underestimated.

Val Prior Horndean, Hampshire \u2022 Paul Mason (Corbynism is in crisis. Labour will have to oppose Brexit, 28 May), gave plenty of attention to the name of Corbyn (and to his derelictions) but only once, and fleetingly, to Keir Starmer\u2019s. When is his name going to get the attention it deserves? No more letting the bow sleep in his hand! His virtues, of courage and intellect, are exactly those we need now. Jinty Nelson London \u2022 I see that MacKenzie Bezos is planning to give away around \u00a314.2bn (Report, 29 May). Before she starts the handouts, shouldn\u2019t she give at least \u00a32-3bn to our very own HMRC to cover all the taxes that Amazon has avoided paying in the UK since it has been operating over here? This money could then be used to revive our high street shops. Jonathan Cockburn Lydney, Gloucestershire \u2022 I\u2019ve been thinking about Lord Paul\u2019s justification for getting paid for \u201cthinking, etc, and giving my advice to colleagues\u201d (Report, 31 May).
