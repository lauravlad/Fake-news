      "body": "<p>Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, is right to say that austerity has sought to recreate the workhouse for the 21st century (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/un-report-compares-tory-welfare-reforms-to-creation-of-workhouses\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 22 May). The idea of \u201cless eligibility\u201d (that the experience of state support should always be felt as being economically and socially worse than earning a living) underpinned the 19th-century workhouse and frames contemporary austerity policies. But, in the weaponising of less eligibility for today\u2019s precarious labour markets, social security policy goes beyond the oppressiveness of the poor law. Though the experience of the poor law was designed to be deeply unpleasant and grudging, it was also designed to relieve destitution by focusing on the needs of all household members.</p> <p>In contrast, social security policy, particularly after George Osborne\u2019s 2015 budget, is designed to create destitution by, for example, only providing support for two children per household and limiting benefit payments in arbitrary ways via the benefit cap. The Department for Work and Pensions claims that Alston provides a \u201ccompletely inaccurate picture of our approach to tackling poverty\u201d. If anything, he under-emphasises the regressiveness of contemporary social security policies.<br><strong>Dr Chris Grover</strong><br><em>Lancaster University</em></p> <p>\u2022 Beveridge made it clear that the answer to the Giant of Want among his five giants, poverty, was not \u201cwelfare provision\u201d as Larry Elliott says (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/15/inequality-britain-social-injustice-beveridge-report\" title=\"\">Inequality is ripping Britain apart. Is it about to be addressed?</a>, 16 May) but social security. Welfare meant, and is still assumed to mean, provision for poor people. But what Beveridge recommended was the abolition of the \u201cwelfare\u201d poor law and instead a national insurance scheme designed for and acceptable to everyone, covering the whole working population, and contributory so that everyone felt it was their entitlement because they\u2019d paid for it. The distinction between today\u2019s universal credit for poor people and social security for everyone is often overlooked as an aspect of inequality. But the difference between seeing society as We the People and They the Poor (as Sargent Shriver put it in the 1960s), and the recognition that people currently in poverty are equally part of the We, is crucial to the fight against inequality as well as determinative in how to prevent poverty.<br><strong>Professor John Veit-Wilson</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 Why should anyone believe that any action will be taken after the review into inequality launched by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, headed by Sir Angus Deaton? Plenty of eminent people have produced similar reports since Beveridge. The Whitehall studies and later \u201cThe Black Report\u201d, chaired by Sir Douglas Black and delivered to the newly elected Thatcher government in 1980. Also, Sir Douglas Acheson reported in 1998 and Sir Michael Marmot in 2010. Although their focus was on health inequalities, all emphasised economic inequality. Perhaps being knighted is bad news for the future of such reports.</p> <p>In 2009 Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett\u2019s book The Spirit Level focused particularly on income inequalities. Has any action been taken? We don\u2019t need yet another report! We need a change in the neoliberal political ideology started by Margaret Thatcher and continued by all subsequent governments.

      "bodyText": "Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, is right to say that austerity has sought to recreate the workhouse for the 21st century (Report, 22 May). The idea of \u201cless eligibility\u201d (that the experience of state support should always be felt as being economically and socially worse than earning a living) underpinned the 19th-century workhouse and frames contemporary austerity policies. But, in the weaponising of less eligibility for today\u2019s precarious labour markets, social security policy goes beyond the oppressiveness of the poor law. Though the experience of the poor law was designed to be deeply unpleasant and grudging, it was also designed to relieve destitution by focusing on the needs of all household members. In contrast, social security policy, particularly after George Osborne\u2019s 2015 budget, is designed to create destitution by, for example, only providing support for two children per household and limiting benefit payments in arbitrary ways via the benefit cap. The Department for Work and Pensions claims that Alston provides a \u201ccompletely inaccurate picture of our approach to tackling poverty\u201d. If anything, he under-emphasises the regressiveness of contemporary social security policies. Dr Chris Grover Lancaster University \u2022 Beveridge made it clear that the answer to the Giant of Want among his five giants, poverty, was not \u201cwelfare provision\u201d as Larry Elliott says (Inequality is ripping Britain apart. Is it about to be addressed?, 16 May) but social security. Welfare meant, and is still assumed to mean, provision for poor people. But what Beveridge recommended was the abolition of the \u201cwelfare\u201d poor law and instead a national insurance scheme designed for and acceptable to everyone, covering the whole working population, and contributory so that everyone felt it was their entitlement because they\u2019d paid for it. The distinction between today\u2019s universal credit for poor people and social security for everyone is often overlooked as an aspect of inequality. But the difference between seeing society as We the People and They the Poor (as Sargent Shriver put it in the 1960s), and the recognition that people currently in poverty are equally part of the We, is crucial to the fight against inequality as well as determinative in how to prevent poverty. Professor John Veit-Wilson Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 Why should anyone believe that any action will be taken after the review into inequality launched by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, headed by Sir Angus Deaton? Plenty of eminent people have produced similar reports since Beveridge. The Whitehall studies and later \u201cThe Black Report\u201d, chaired by Sir Douglas Black and delivered to the newly elected Thatcher government in 1980. Also, Sir Douglas Acheson reported in 1998 and Sir Michael Marmot in 2010. Although their focus was on health inequalities, all emphasised economic inequality. Perhaps being knighted is bad news for the future of such reports. In 2009 Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett\u2019s book The Spirit Level focused particularly on income inequalities. Has any action been taken? We don\u2019t need yet another report! We need a change in the neoliberal political ideology started by Margaret Thatcher and continued by all subsequent governments. A Jeremy Corbyn-style Labour government is the only realistic chance we have. Jack Czauderna Sheffield \u2022 The UN recognises there is a manifest and intensifying human rights crisis in Britain, affecting hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. While partners in government, the Liberal Democrats supported the Cameron class war that produced this situation, and repeated the central lie that justified it: that it was Labour profligacy in public spending that created an unsustainable deficit. (In fact, it was Labour profligacy in bailing out the banks that did so.) Austerity was largely responsible for the protest vote that secured the leave result in the 2016 referendum. If there is no urgent reversal of the policies of the coalition government and their effects, Brexit will never be \u201cresolved\u201d (regardless of the formal outcome of the contest between leavers and remainers); indeed, without such a reversal, we may in future come to view Brexit as merely the prelude to even worse social division and conflict. And yet, it seems, remainers are now willing to give their support in droves to the party that bears such a heavy responsibility for the referendum outcome they deplore, and who, in their manifesto for the forthcoming elections, neither makes any mention of austerity nor proposes any convincing measures to end it. The imposition of austerity by the EU across Europe has galvanised the far right; its implementation in Britain by the coalition has done the same. I voted remain as the least worst option and do not doubt it was the right thing to do. But I will never vote for those who colluded with the systemic assault on the least privileged so clearly laid out by the UN\u2019s poverty expert, and who in doing so created the conditions for a populist revolt. So, bollocks to the Lib Dems: I shall be voting Labour because only Corbyn\u2019s party recognises the scale of the undertaking required to restore the conditions in which progressive democratic decision making becomes plausible. Dr David Alderson Manchester \u2022 We hope the IFS Deaton review will ensure its agenda includes consideration of the inequality between renters and landlords or landowners. Unlike other countries\u2019, our renters, of homes or small businesses, pay the landlords\u2019 property tax, which we call council tax or business rates. But renters get none of the vast increases in the value of land that have been given unearned and untaxed to landlords and landowners since the \u201cbig bang\u201d of the 1980s.

Instead, it\u2019s to send representatives to a parliament that most of us pay zero attention to most of the time. These are elections we weren\u2019t meant to hold, for positions that aren\u2019t meant to last five years. In normal times, <a href=\"http://www.ukpolitical.info/european-parliament-election-turnout.htm\" title=\"\">two out of three</a> British voters don\u2019t even bother to go to the polling station for this one.

First, I think the big aim in British politics today is to drive out the scourge of Faragism. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/change-uk-brexit-party-and-lib-dems-in-last-appeal-before-european-elections\" title=\"\">Brexit party</a> is the clear winner of this election, but the fewer votes Britain gives to Nigel Farage, the less airtime he gets to spread his race-baiting rubbish, the less persuaded backbench Tories will be to go even further to the right. Second, Labour is part of the European Socialists group and its platform is at least a start in reinvigorating a moribund EU. I understand why ardent remainers are eyeing up other options. All I\u2019d say to that is that it was only four years ago that the Lib Dems were in a coalition that produced the disastrous austerity that led us to Brexit, while whatever passes for the intellects of Change UK still seem to believe in it. Whatever the outcome of tomorrow\u2019s voting, it is a way station rather than a watershed. Europe is in deep trouble, economically, socially and politically, and so is Britain.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p> <h2><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sonia-sodha\" title=\"\">Sonia Sodha</a>: I\u2019m casting my first-ever vote for the Greens. We\u2019re facing a climate emergency</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4aa0a3d2d72c5e7d4b85be5efedfef1a65bcbfd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4aa0a3d2d72c5e7d4b85be5efedfef1a65bcbfd0/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Sonia Sodha\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s one question that matters going into these elections: Brexit. It may not be a proxy referendum, but it\u2019s an opportunity \u2013 at last \u2013 for voters to send a message on Brexit, unencumbered by the constraints of a Westminster election where it\u2019s essentially just a fight between the two main parties.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to relish taking it. As someone who believes any Brexit deal must be put to a referendum \u2013 both on democratic grounds, and because there simply isn\u2019t another route out of this gridlock \u2013 Labour won\u2019t be getting my vote after its months of prevaricating. It\u2019s become clear the only chance of getting the Labour leadership to throw its weight behind a referendum is to deny it my vote.</p> <p>One option would be to vote tactically. The Lib Dems are the remain party best poised to overtake Labour. I\u2019m tempted by the prospect of that symbolism. But I can\u2019t bring myself to forget the policy they pushed in coalition: of expensive tax cuts that disproportionately benefitted the better-off, that were effectively paid for by cuts to tax credits for low-income families with kids.</p> <p>So I\u2019m making a positive choice to cast my first-ever vote for the Greens. We\u2019re facing a climate emergency, and it\u2019s never been more important to have a strong Green contingent in the European parliament. And we won\u2019t crack climate crisis without strong international institutions like the EU. Which brings us full circle, back to Brexit.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer, and deputy opinion editor at the Guardian</p> <h2><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rafaelbehr\" title=\"\">Rafael Behr</a>: The Liberal Democrats have most conspicuously waved an anti-Brexit standard </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4facb002068ac334aca3986b610792054ab0ecfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4facb002068ac334aca3986b610792054ab0ecfc/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Rafael Behr\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For more than three years now British politics has been consumed by something called Brexit without coming any closer to a functional definition of that word. Terminating membership of the EU is a legal baseline but not sufficient. Arrangements that mirror Norway\u2019s relationship with Brussels would meet that test. But for Nigel Farage and most of the Conservative party, departure on those terms would be synthetic Brexit. For Farage\u2019s new party only the most severe rupture from all European institutions is acceptable and \u2013 with the help of Tory radicals \u2013 he is rebranding the whole project to that extreme specification. The option of softer, moderate Brexits has been delegitimised by the hardliners, which then makes it harder for anyone else to defend compromise positions. This is the contradiction at the heart of Labour\u2019s convoluted policy. The idea, not without merit, is that a national party should aspire to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/21/jeremy-corbyn-campaign-trail-labour-brexit-divide\" title=\"\">represent both sides</a> of the big European divide. The problem is that nothing Jeremy Corbyn says credibly describes legal, institutional arrangements to achieve that end. He supports leaving the single market (a hard Brexit to pro-European eyes) but also a permanent customs union (a capitulation to Brussels, in the minds of Eurosceptic hardliners). Insofar as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/20/brexit-britain-labour-remain-european-elections-leave-voters\" title=\"\">notional Labour deal</a> can be discerned, it is structurally not that different to the one Theresa May has failed to drive through parliament, and if Corbyn had the chance to enact Brexit, his withdrawal agreement would necessarily be the same as hers. Failure to say as much frankly is one of many dishonesties that have polluted the whole debate.</p> <p>The fundamental question that so few Brexiteers are prepared to address is what, from the menu of real, available options \u2013 what package of technical, institutional arrangements \u2013 is the best one for the UK national interest. The answer, without question, is the one that has been painstakingly negotiated and adapted for a generation (including a range of bespoke opt-outs and a budget rebate). It\u2019s called \u201cmembership of the EU\u201d. Anyone who recognises that as something worth fighting for should vote for a party that has the courage to say as much. That disqualifies Labour. Of the genuinely remain parties, preferences might vary, but it seems to me there is a benefit in boosting the overall vote share of the one that can light the highest national beacon for the pro-European cause; to line up behind the battalion that has most conspicuously waved an anti-Brexit standard. That role, judging by polls, local election results and the Euro campaign thus far, has been fulfilled by the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p> <h2><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dawn-foster\" title=\"\">Dawn Foster</a>: I\u2019m voting Labour with no qualms.

I don\u2019t see the European elections as a referendum on Brexit: doing so is both divisive and ill-advised. I can\u2019t see myself voting Liberal Democrat after they propped up the Tories in coalition and ushered in the austerity that has gutted our social safety net. Treating the vote as a second referendum also ignores the fact that the Brexit party will get far more votes than the so-called \u201cremain\u201d parties, arguing that a no-deal Brexit is favoured by the public. It\u2019s unlikely the elected MEPs will be in the European parliament for long, but they can attempt to make a difference in the short period they are. Some projections predict the left blocs in the European parliament will outnumber the right blocs, meaning the left will have a greater say. The two biggest threats we currently face are the environment and the rise of the far right: Labour is the only national party that can realistically battle them. The Tories ignore the rise of the far right, and are meek on the environment, while the Greens will never win enough seats to make a difference. We\u2019re stuck in too dangerous a situation to use protest votes, with openly racist candidates fighting for seats and polling well. I would much rather see the Conservative vote collapse, and Labour\u2019s grow as a result, so choosing who to vote for is easy.</p> <p>\u2022 Dawn Foster is a Guardian columnist</p>",

As someone who believes any Brexit deal must be put to a referendum \u2013 both on democratic grounds, and because there simply isn\u2019t another route out of this gridlock \u2013 Labour won\u2019t be getting my vote after its months of prevaricating. It\u2019s become clear the only chance of getting the Labour leadership to throw its weight behind a referendum is to deny it my vote. One option would be to vote tactically. The Lib Dems are the remain party best poised to overtake Labour. I\u2019m tempted by the prospect of that symbolism. But I can\u2019t bring myself to forget the policy they pushed in coalition: of expensive tax cuts that disproportionately benefitted the better-off, that were effectively paid for by cuts to tax credits for low-income families with kids. So I\u2019m making a positive choice to cast my first-ever vote for the Greens. We\u2019re facing a climate emergency, and it\u2019s never been more important to have a strong Green contingent in the European parliament. And we won\u2019t crack climate crisis without strong international institutions like the EU. Which brings us full circle, back to Brexit. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer, and deputy opinion editor at the Guardian Rafael Behr: The Liberal Democrats have most conspicuously waved an anti-Brexit standard For more than three years now British politics has been consumed by something called Brexit without coming any closer to a functional definition of that word. Terminating membership of the EU is a legal baseline but not sufficient. Arrangements that mirror Norway\u2019s relationship with Brussels would meet that test. But for Nigel Farage and most of the Conservative party, departure on those terms would be synthetic Brexit. For Farage\u2019s new party only the most severe rupture from all European institutions is acceptable and \u2013 with the help of Tory radicals \u2013 he is rebranding the whole project to that extreme specification. The option of softer, moderate Brexits has been delegitimised by the hardliners, which then makes it harder for anyone else to defend compromise positions. This is the contradiction at the heart of Labour\u2019s convoluted policy. The idea, not without merit, is that a national party should aspire to represent both sides of the big European divide. The problem is that nothing Jeremy Corbyn says credibly describes legal, institutional arrangements to achieve that end. He supports leaving the single market (a hard Brexit to pro-European eyes) but also a permanent customs union (a capitulation to Brussels, in the minds of Eurosceptic hardliners). Insofar as a notional Labour deal can be discerned, it is structurally not that different to the one Theresa May has failed to drive through parliament, and if Corbyn had the chance to enact Brexit, his withdrawal agreement would necessarily be the same as hers. Failure to say as much frankly is one of many dishonesties that have polluted the whole debate. The fundamental question that so few Brexiteers are prepared to address is what, from the menu of real, available options \u2013 what package of technical, institutional arrangements \u2013 is the best one for the UK national interest. The answer, without question, is the one that has been painstakingly negotiated and adapted for a generation (including a range of bespoke opt-outs and a budget rebate). It\u2019s called \u201cmembership of the EU\u201d. Anyone who recognises that as something worth fighting for should vote for a party that has the courage to say as much. That disqualifies Labour. Of the genuinely remain parties, preferences might vary, but it seems to me there is a benefit in boosting the overall vote share of the one that can light the highest national beacon for the pro-European cause; to line up behind the battalion that has most conspicuously waved an anti-Brexit standard. That role, judging by polls, local election results and the Euro campaign thus far, has been fulfilled by the Liberal Democrats. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist Dawn Foster: I\u2019m voting Labour with no qualms. I don\u2019t see this as a referendum on Brexit On Thursday I\u2019ll head to the polling station in my neighbouring primary school and vote Labour with no qualms. I don\u2019t see the European elections as a referendum on Brexit: doing so is both divisive and ill-advised. I can\u2019t see myself voting Liberal Democrat after they propped up the Tories in coalition and ushered in the austerity that has gutted our social safety net. Treating the vote as a second referendum also ignores the fact that the Brexit party will get far more votes than the so-called \u201cremain\u201d parties, arguing that a no-deal Brexit is favoured by the public. It\u2019s unlikely the elected MEPs will be in the European parliament for long, but they can attempt to make a difference in the short period they are. Some projections predict the left blocs in the European parliament will outnumber the right blocs, meaning the left will have a greater say. The two biggest threats we currently face are the environment and the rise of the far right: Labour is the only national party that can realistically battle them. The Tories ignore the rise of the far right, and are meek on the environment, while the Greens will never win enough seats to make a difference. We\u2019re stuck in too dangerous a situation to use protest votes, with openly racist candidates fighting for seats and polling well. I would much rather see the Conservative vote collapse, and Labour\u2019s grow as a result, so choosing who to vote for is easy. \u2022 Dawn Foster is a Guardian columnist",

The \u201cendlessly repeated\u201d mantra about rising employment overlooked that \u201cclose to 40% of children are predicted to be living in poverty two years from now, 16% of people over 65 live in relative poverty and millions of those who are in work are dependent upon various forms of charity to cope,\u201d he said. The report will be formally presented to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on 27 June. The government believes Alston, a New York-based human rights lawyer, could not credibly have reached his conclusions after only an 11-day trip to the UK. Last November he visited nine towns and cities in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, holding town hall meetings and visiting poverty-related charities and organisations including food banks and youth programmes. Rudd is said to be particularly frustrated by Alston\u2019s accusation that the government was responsible for the \u201csystematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population\u201d. She also believes Alston ventured off his beat by making criticisms about cuts to police numbers and legal aid. In a statement, the government said his report was \u201ca barely believable documentation of Britain based on a tiny period of time spent here\u201d and \u201ca completely inaccurate picture of our approach to tackling poverty\u201d. Either side of his trip, Alston worked for several months with a team of legal scholars and staff from the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights researching austerity in the UK. According to the footnotes to the report, they analysed information from three government ministries, the Scottish and Welsh governments, the National Audit Office and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. They also examined reports from organisations including the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the OECD, and received more than 300 written submissions. Labour said the report should be a \u201csource of shame\u201d to ministers and urged them to \u201cend their state of denial\u201d. Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cThis report is a shocking indictment of the brutal cuts to social security introduced by Conservative-led governments since 2010 and the deeply flawed, punitive system that they have created.\u201d The DWP said: \u201cWe take tackling poverty extremely seriously, which is why we spend \u00a395bn a year on welfare and maintain a state pension system that supports people into retirement. All the evidence shows that full-time work is the best way to boost your income and quality of life, which is why our welfare reforms are focused on supporting people into employment and we introduced the national living wage, so people earn more in work.\u201d Groups with years of experience examining poverty in the UK backed Alston\u2019s conclusions. Campbell Robb, the chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: \u201cThere can be no moral justification for failing to act on this report.\u201d Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said Alston had \u201cexposed the government\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the scale of child poverty in the UK. We can reduce child poverty in the UK \u2013 we\u2019ve done it before. But it will require a willingness from government to first see the problem and then to deliver a strategy for solving it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A leading United Nations poverty expert has compared Conservative welfare policies to the creation of 19th-century workhouses and warned that unless austerity is ended, the UK\u2019s poorest people face lives that are \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u201d. In his final report on the impact of austerity on human rights in the UK, Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, accused ministers of being in a state of denial about the impact of policies, including the rollout of universal credit, since 2010. He accused them of the \u201csystematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population\u201d and warned that worse could be yet to come for the most vulnerable, who face \u201ca major adverse impact\u201d if Brexit proceeds. He said leaving the EU was \u201ca tragic distraction from the social and economic policies shaping a Britain that it\u2019s hard to believe any political parties really want\u201d. The New York-based lawyer\u2019s findings, published on Wednesday, follows a two-week fact-finding mission in November after which he angered ministers by calling child poverty in Britain \u201cnot just a disgrace but a social calamity and an economic disaster\u201d. Now he has accused them of refusing to debate the issues he raised and instead deploying \u201cwindow dressing to minimise political fallout\u201d by insisting the country is enjoying record lows in absolute poverty, children in workless households and low unemployment. The \u201cendlessly repeated\u201d mantra about rising employment overlooks that \u201cclose to 40% of children are predicted to be living in poverty two years from now, 16% of people over 65 live in relative poverty and millions of those who are in work are dependent upon various forms of charity to cope\u201d, he said. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, said in November she was \u201cdisappointed to say the least by the extraordinary political nature\u201d of Alston\u2019s language after his tour of places including Newcastle, Glasgow, Belfast, Cardiff, Jaywick and London. Alston replied in his 21-page final report that there was an \u201calmost complete disconnect\u201d between what ministers and the public saw. The impact of austerity was obvious to anyone who opened their eyes, he said. In his most barbed swipe at Rudd and her predecessors in charge of welfare, he said: \u201cIt might seem to some observers that the department of work and pensions has been tasked with designing a digital and sanitised version of the 19th-century workhouse, made infamous by Charles Dickens.\u201d He said he had met people who had sold sex for money and joined gangs to avoid destitution. The government hit back calling Alston\u2019s report \u201cbarely believable\u201d. \u201cThe UN\u2019s own data shows the UK is one of the happiest places in the world to live, and other countries have come here to find out more about how we support people to improve their lives,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said. \u201cTherefore this is a barely believable documentation of Britain, based on a tiny period of time spent here.

Alston said austerity had \u201cdeliberately gutted\u201d local authorities, shrinking library, youth, police and park services to the extent that it was not surprising there were \u201cunheard-of levels of loneliness and isolation\u201d. There was some praise for ministers for increases in work allowances under the universal credit welfare system and supporting the national minimum wage, but Alston said these measures had had not stopped the \u201cdramatic decline in the fortunes of the least well-off\u201d. He recommended ministers reverse local government funding cuts, scrap the benefits cap, eliminate the five-week delay in receiving initial universal credit benefits and rethink the privatisation of services including rural transport. \u201cThomas Hobbes observed long ago, such an approach condemns the least well-off to lives that are \u2018solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the British social contract slowly evaporates, Hobbes\u2019 prediction risks becoming the new reality.\u201d",
