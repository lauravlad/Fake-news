      "bodyText": "An inquiry being co-led by Ed Miliband of Labour\u2019s election campaign is in danger of drawing the wrong conclusions by failing to listen to the people who refused to vote for the party, the potential leadership candidate Lisa Nandy has said. Nandy said the review set up by a group called Labour Together was adopting a misguided approach by being based too much in Westminster. Miliband, who lost to David Cameron in 2015, is among those involved in the review, which will include interviewing all 59 MPs who lost their seats during the crumbling of Labour\u2019s \u201cred wall\u201d of constituencies in the north of England, the Midlands and Wales. But Nandy said it was most important for the party to listen to the voters who had left the party over the years. \u201cI have to be honest, I didn\u2019t know anything about this review until two days ago,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday. \u201cAnd if the lesson drawn from this election is, a review can be drawn up in a meeting room in Westminster without any reference to the two parts of the Labour movement \u2013 our councillor base and trade union base \u2013 that were probably the reason we didn\u2019t have a worse result, I just don\u2019t think that people are drawing the right lessons at all. \u201cWe need to be out in places like Ashfield, listening to people like the ex-miner I met yesterday, not sitting in meeting rooms in Westminster trying to debate this out amongst ourselves with the help of a few thinktanks.\u201cI just think the approach is wrong.\u201d The Wigan MP, who is conducting her own visits to constituencies that Labour lost, said a phrase that kept recurring was \u201cLabour\u2019s not for us any more\u201d. Nandy said she spent Monday knocking on doors in Ashfield, and found trust in Labour was the main issue. The backbencher said: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about the role of Jeremy Corbyn in this election campaign. \u201cBut there was just a general sense that at the top of the Labour party we don\u2019t speak for people like them any more, a sense we don\u2019t have skin in the game, that we\u2019re not rooted in those communities, and we\u2019re just not like them, and we don\u2019t come very often to just ask people what they think and to listen to what they\u2019ve got to say. \u201cWe often come in and tell them that we\u2019ve got all the answers and we can fix it, and what people told us loud and clear in this election campaign is: \u2018You\u2019re just not listening.\u2019\u201d Nandy said crime was the \u201cgreat unspoken issue\u201d of the election campaign, with many communities facing problems with drugs and antisocial behaviour, while police and council resources had been cut by the Tories in government. Nandy is considered a potential candidate on the soft left of the party and last week she criticised the party\u2019s shift to supporting a second referendum. She is likely to go up against Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who both pushed for a position in favour of a second referendum. Two other leading candidates are Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is supported by the Corbynite wing of the party, and Clive Lewis, a candidate on the pro-European left. Jess Phillips, the backbencher and women\u2019s rights campaigner, is also expected to stand. Following Nandy\u2019s intervention, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, defended the decision to allow Miliband to be involved in the inquiry. He said the former party leader \u201cis one of many people who should be properly examining why we lost\u201d, even though Miliband oversaw a major defeat himself. Khan, who served in Miliband\u2019s shadow cabinet, said: \u201cI\u2019m fed up with losing. I don\u2019t believe in heroic failure, we\u2019ve lost four general elections now in a row. \u201cI want the next leader to unite our party, unite our country, unite those who voted leave with those who voted remain, unite the north with the south, the old with the young. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s important not just Ed Miliband but many others look at why we lost and learn the right lessons.\u201d Khan also said the next Labour leader should not be chosen on the basis of their gender or the location of their constituency, amid calls from some for Corbyn\u2019s successor to be a woman and from the north or Midlands to help Labour win back its heartlands that turned Tory. Without backing any candidate, he said: \u201cI think the idea that the next Labour leader should be chosen on the geography of their seat or their gender is wrong. I want to see the Labour leader chosen on the ideas he or she has, on their vision for our country and a proper analysis of why we lost.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Beneath the surface disorder of modern British politics, there are steadier patterns to be found. One of them is so regular, and so central to the workings of the whole system, that it\u2019s rarely noticed, let alone challenged.</p> <p>This pattern is hugely to the advantage of the Conservatives. Here\u2019s how it works. When the Tories are in power, as they have been for 27 of the last 40 years, they often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/16/strong-economy-tories-weak-labour\" title=\"\">struggle to govern effectively</a>. An election follows. The Tories run a negative campaign, drawing attention away from their own failures and ineptitude to the potential problems of a Labour government. To the surprise of some, the Tories win: either decisively or just well enough to stay in office. They announce that they will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-pledges-to-prioritise-nhs-after-election-victory\" title=\"\">govern differently </a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/election-in-the-media-evasion-lies-good-journalism-is-all-we-have\" title=\"\">this time</a>. Much of the media <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/election-in-the-media-evasion-lies-good-journalism-is-all-we-have\" title=\"\">believes them</a>. The Tories struggle in government once again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Faith in their credentials helps win tight elections. That they always find a way to rule is a self-fulfilling prophecy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Boris Johnson has already been through all these stages except the last one \u2013 and with a large majority, the temporary momentum that always follows a Queen\u2019s speech and the UK\u2019s scheduled exit from the EU next month to dangle before their supporters, the Conservatives will probably be able to enjoy promising things, rather than having to deliver them, for a while yet. This is Johnson\u2019s favourite and most effective political mode. \u201cGovernment will now engage flat-out on a programme of change for the better,\u201d he pledged, with characteristic energy and vagueness, during the debate on the Queen\u2019s speech. \u201cA new golden age for this United Kingdom is now within reach.\u201d</p> <p>In one sense, the Tories have earned this easy phase with their handsome election victory. In a democracy, why shouldn\u2019t a re-elected government enjoy a honeymoon, when journalists and voters give them the benefit of the doubt ? Yet <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/1219797/Boris-Johnson-brexit-golden-age\" title=\"\">the credulity</a> with which the promises of this and other returning Conservative administrations have been greeted, often by commentators who only weeks earlier were castigating the same ministers for their incompetence, suggests something more political is going on.

      "bodyText": "Beneath the surface disorder of modern British politics, there are steadier patterns to be found. One of them is so regular, and so central to the workings of the whole system, that it\u2019s rarely noticed, let alone challenged. This pattern is hugely to the advantage of the Conservatives. Here\u2019s how it works. When the Tories are in power, as they have been for 27 of the last 40 years, they often struggle to govern effectively. An election follows. The Tories run a negative campaign, drawing attention away from their own failures and ineptitude to the potential problems of a Labour government. To the surprise of some, the Tories win: either decisively or just well enough to stay in office. They announce that they will govern differently this time. Much of the media believes them. The Tories struggle in government once again. Boris Johnson has already been through all these stages except the last one \u2013 and with a large majority, the temporary momentum that always follows a Queen\u2019s speech and the UK\u2019s scheduled exit from the EU next month to dangle before their supporters, the Conservatives will probably be able to enjoy promising things, rather than having to deliver them, for a while yet. This is Johnson\u2019s favourite and most effective political mode. \u201cGovernment will now engage flat-out on a programme of change for the better,\u201d he pledged, with characteristic energy and vagueness, during the debate on the Queen\u2019s speech. \u201cA new golden age for this United Kingdom is now within reach.\u201d In one sense, the Tories have earned this easy phase with their handsome election victory. In a democracy, why shouldn\u2019t a re-elected government enjoy a honeymoon, when journalists and voters give them the benefit of the doubt ? Yet the credulity with which the promises of this and other returning Conservative administrations have been greeted, often by commentators who only weeks earlier were castigating the same ministers for their incompetence, suggests something more political is going on. There is damaging deference towards them \u2013 an unstated but widely held assumption that they shouldn\u2019t be judged too exactingly by their record in office. The Labour party receives the opposite treatment. Even mistakes it made in government decades ago, in an entirely different political and economic context \u2013 such as failing to control the then powerful unions during the winter of discontent \u2013 are widely taken as warnings about how it would govern next time. Sometimes, the deference shown towards the Tories comes from left-of-centre journalists and reflects a pessimism that the Tories are, despite all their flaws, Britain\u2019s natural ruling class. And sometimes it comes from the right and reflects an optimism that the Tories, however often they have disappointed and compromised in the past, always have the potential to rediscover their true path. \u201cPolitics has been transformed in a week,\u201d declared the Daily Telegraph giddily after the election. \u201cSuddenly they seem like a whole new party.\u201d Either way, the media\u2019s impulse to take incoming Tory premiers at their word echoes the inclination of many voters to trust Tory governments to be financially prudent, streetwise on foreign policy, and generally competent and stable \u2013 despite all evidence to the contrary.

It could be the hardest set of challenges faced by a new government since the 70s. Johnson may learn to be more conscientious. Unexpected talents may emerge from a cabinet seemingly made up of fanatics and chancers. Dominic Cummings may metamorphose from a sly campaign strategist into someone who can reinvent the British state. But don\u2019t hold your breath. Only three years ago, in her first speech as prime minister, Theresa May promised \u201cto make Britain a country that works for everyone\u201d, almost exactly as Johnson is doing now.
