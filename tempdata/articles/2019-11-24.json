      "bodyText": "A Labour government would compel property developers to meet the costs of building at least 50,000 discounted homes, as part of a package of measures to help renters and first-time buyers, the party will announce today. The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, has drawn up proposals to allow local authorities to use the planning process to force developers to build a certain number of properties to be earmarked for local first-time buyers. These would be sold at a discount of up to 50% to the local market rate, with the size of the reduction dependent on the gap between earnings and house prices in the local area - and the local authority could choose to target them at key workers such as nurses or teachers. Healey said in Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency of Uxbridge, in London, where the average house price is \u00a3350,000, the price of new homes built in this way could be just \u00a3190,000. The properties would be earmarked as first-time buyer homes in perpetuity, and would have to be sold on at a discount to market rates. \u201cLabour\u2019s new discount homes will give hope to aspiring first time buyers on ordinary incomes who have been failed by the Tories over the past decade,\u201d Healey said. \u201cHousing should be for the many, not the few, so a Labour government will cut the price of a first home for working people and lock in the discount to help future first time buyers too.\u201d Labour made housing a key theme in its manifesto, published last week - and has already promised to build 100,000 council homes, and 50,000 social homes each year by the end of the next parliament. As well as increasing the opportunities for first time buyers, Jeremy Corbyn is promising to take on exploitative landlords: and he will announce on Monday that Labour would introduce a charter of renters\u2019 rights and a national \u201cproperty MOT\u201d to tackle squalid private housing. The Labour leader said he would introduce a legal requirement for landlords to complete an independent annual inspection to ensure homes were up to minimum standards. If landlords let out substandard properties or flouted the rules, they would face fines of up to \u00a3100,000 and be forced to repay rent to tenants, he said. Corbyn\u2019s close aides have been trying to broaden the general election debate beyond Brexit, where Boris Johnson has driven home his promise to leave the EU by the end of January in an effort to win over disgruntled leave voters. Labour said its research had found that tenants collectively pay more than \u00a310bn a year in rent to landlords letting out substandard homes. The party said that nationally one in four private rented homes were classed as \u201cnon-decent\u201d, meaning they are damp, cold, in disrepair or unsafe to live in. Labour\u2019s private renters\u2019 charter will be based on three key rights, including the right to an affordable rented home with increases capped at inflation and powers for further controls for certain high rent areas; the right to a secure rented home, with new open-ended tenancies, protecting tenants from unfair eviction; and thirdly, the right to a decent rented home, with new minimum standards, backed by a new annual property MOT and fresh local enforcement powers. A Labour government would introduce legislation covering the private rented sector in the first Queen\u2019s speech, the party said, and pass legislation within a year to enshrine the new charter of renters\u2019 rights. These would be enforced by primary and secondary legislation, new local enforcement powers for councils and government funding for renters\u2019 unions to allow tenants to organise and defend their rights, the party claimed. Corbyn said: \u201cLabour will be on the side of tenants and take on dodgy landlords who have been given free rein for too long. Real change means taking on those who exploit the housing crisis to charge eye-watering rents for substandard accommodation.\u201d Healey said: \u201cThe power imbalance in the private rental market is at the heart of our housing crisis, with rents eating up too much of people\u2019s pay, tenants afraid of eviction if they report problems, and families with children forced to uproot their lives at short notice. \u201cMany landlords provide decent homes that tenants are happy with, but the Conservatives have gifted rogue landlords the freedom to flourish. Labour will put bad landlords out of business.\u201d The Conservative party\u2019s record on housing has been seized upon by Labour as a potential weakness during the campaign. Two weeks ago, the National Audit Office disclosed that successive Tory governments have failed to deliver a single new \u201cstarter home\u201d despite promising to build 200,000 by 2020. Corbyn has promised a record-breaking affordable house building programme including 100,000 new council houses a year by 2024. Boris Johnson has announced measures to help first-time buyers and boost private house building, promising a 1m homes over the next five years. Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201cFor decades renters have had to live with the fear of being evicted from their home for no reason.

The Conservatives claim their policy will cost the NHS \u00a3879m in 2023/24. </p> \n  <p>On <strong>increasing the number of police officers, </strong>Full Fact finds that the pledge would return the number of officers to almost, but not quite, the total there was in 2010. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of police officers in England and Wales fell by 20,752 - a 14% drop. But because the country\u2019s population has grown since 2010, the number of police officers per person has fallen by 19%. Recruiting another 20,000 police officers would therefore leave the number of police officers per person at least 6% lower than it was in 2010.</p> \n  <p>The phrase <strong>\u201cGet Brexit done\u201d</strong> appears in the Conservative manifesto 22 times, but Brexit is a process, not an event. The UK will stop being a member of the EU if Johnson\u2019s deal goes through, but negotiations with the EU on a future trade deal will take place across a transition period, during which time the UK will still follow EU rules and pay into the EU budget. Based on past deals, this may take years to negotiate. </p> \n  <p>On <strong>increased spending, </strong>the manifesto pledges \u00a33bn of extra day-to-day spending by the final years of the next parliament - a figure that looks considerably smaller than pledges from other parties. But these figures aren\u2019t necessarily comparable - the Conservatives did not include costings for every pledge in the manifesto; only for new spending announcements made since the election was called. So while the Conservatives plan to increase annual current spending by \u00a33bn compared to what\u2019s already been announced, the overall annual extra spend will be much higher than that.

The prime minister\u2019s claim that the government will build 40 new hospitals rapidly fell apart in late September, although the PM continues to push the misleading assertion. The government has confirmed that six existing hospitals in England are being given \u00a32.7bn by 2025 as part of the programme - an upgrade rather than a fresh build. Another 21 hospital trusts are being given \u00a3100m in seed funding to prepare a business case for their hospitals - but no money for any actual building work.

According to the Sunday Times, defence chiefs are discussing plans to slash the size of the British Army amid fears they will face further cuts. But asked by reporters if troops would be cut, Johnson replied with a firm no.</p> \n  <p>It is correct, however, that the manifesto does not include a firm pledge to \u201cmaintain the overall size of the armed forces\u201d, as it did under Theresa May in 2017. The 2015 Tory manifesto pledged to keep the Army\u2019s strength at minimum of 82,000 but that commitment was dropped - with the Army hovering around 73,000.</p> \n  <p>The manifesto maintains the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid but does little to assuage fears that Johnson plans to alter the way in which the aid budget is spent. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T18:00:56.081Z\">at 6.00pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddabe108f080fd59fb1686b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/georgina-hayes\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T17:39:32.192Z\">5.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">IFS on Conservative manifesto: Lack of significant policy action 'remarkable'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong> (IFS) has accused the Conservatives of pushing a \u201cfundamentally damaging narrative\u201d in promising more money for health, pensions and schools without raising the money in tax, NIC or VAT to pay for them. </p> \n  <p><strong>Commenting on the Conservative Party manifesto, Paul Johnson, IFS Director, said:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos were notable for the scale of their ambitions the Conservative one is not. If a single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have been calling it modest. As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable.</p> \n   <p>In part that is because the chancellor announced some big spending rises back In September. Other than for health and schools, though, that was a one-off increase. Taken at face value today\u2019s manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, that\u2019s it. Health and school spending will continue to rise. Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in.</p> \n   <p>One notable omission is any plan for social care. In his first speech as prime minister Boris Johnson promised to \u201cfix the crisis in social care once and for all\u201d. After two decades of dither by both parties in government it seems we are no further forward.</p> \n   <p>On the tax side the rise in the National Insurance threshold was well trailed. The ambition for it to get to \u00a312,500 may remain, but only the initial rise to \u00a39,500 has been costed and firmly promised. Most in paid work would benefit, but by less than \u00a32 a week. Another \u00a36 billion would need to be found to get to \u00a312,500 by the end of the parliament. Given the pressures on the spending side that is not surprising.</p> \n   <p>Perhaps the biggest, and least welcome, announcement is the \u201ctriple tax lock\u201d: no increases in rates of income tax, NICs or VAT. That\u2019s a constraint the chancellor may come to regret. It is also part of a fundamentally damaging narrative \u2013 that we can have the public services we want, with more money for health and pensions and schools \u2013 without paying for them. We can\u2019t.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddabcd08f087b800b6204da\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richard-partington\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T17:26:10.955Z\">5.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Business analysis: Company bosses likely to welcome this manifesto</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Johnson has not always had the smoothest relationship with business, given his infamous remarks about their Brexit concerns, though company bosses are likely to broadly welcome this manifesto. </p> \n  <p>The CBI said firms would be \u201cheartened by a pro-enterprise vision\u201d and praised the \u00a33bn national skills fund for training workers. But there are questions about the impact of Brexit for firms that are yet to be answered. <br></p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s decision to scrap the planned corporation tax cut has gone down badly with some Tory supporters. <br></p> \n  <p>Ever since the 1980s the Tories have argued business tax cuts boost the economy and swell the public purse. The headline rate of corporation tax has been slashed since 2010 from 28% to 19% and receipts have increased, but economists believe economic recovery and crackdowns on tax avoidance are the real reasons. <br></p> \n  <p>Britain also now has among the lowest corporate tax rates in the developed world. The prime minister has been told further cuts would have little impact beyond damaging the public finances, including from George Osborne\u2019s former special adviser, Rupert Harrison. Labour also has a sharply contrasting plan, promising to raise the headline rate to 26%, in a clear election dividing line. <br></p> \n  <p>A review of business rates could be a double-edged sword. Companies could save millions of pounds from reforms to a system widely regarded to be broken. Retailers in particular have lobbied hard for cuts, saying the tax is among reasons for shop closures and job losses on the high street. But councils have grown more reliant on business rates revenue amid cuts to central government funding.

The prime minister will argue Britain and the EU are in close alignment, so precedents for lengthy trade talks do not apply.

When it comes to day-to-day spending, the Tory plan would increase the amount spent by just \u00a32.9bn per year by 2023-24, compared to \u00a382.9bn for Labour and \u00a362.9bn for the Lib Dems. </p> \n  <p>On these grounds, Labour would spend almost \u00a328 more than present for every pound the Conservatives promise, in the clearest attempt by the Tories to put clear blue water between Johnson and Corbyn. The differences are stark. </p> \n  <p>According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, the plan would lift government spending as a share of national income a handful of places on the international league table for wealthy nations. Labour plan a German-sized state with spending around 45% of GDP, while the Conservatives aim to match the Netherlands at roughly 41%. Though modest in comparison to Labour, it would still mean the biggest increase in the size of the state under a Tory government since Harold Macmillan.</p> \n  <p>Johnson will hope the public believe Labour lack credibility with the public finances, with a boom-and-bust spending package to match. But it could backfire. The Tories could be charged with failing to credibly turn the page on a decade of austerity, while committing insufficient funds to tackle the climate emergency. The Tory manifesto therefore offers relative status-quo, versus fundamental reform. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddaa96f8f083aa6d578a428\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T16:03:29.769Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s Corbyn\u2019s full response to the Conservative manifesto:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson has launched a manifesto for billionaires.

      "bodyText": "The live blog will now be closing for the night. For a summary of the day\u2019s events, read my colleague\u2019s analysis: Artists, actors and musicians joined Jeremy Corbyn on Sunday night at the Labour campaign\u2019s arts launch in east London, to throw their support behind the party\u2019s manifesto. Emeli Sand\u00e9, MIA, Lily Allen, as well as the filmmaker Ken Loach were among the stars who attended the Arts for All policy charter launch at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Labour committed to put support for the arts \u201cat the heart of government\u201d, promising \u00a31bn of new investment in upgrading and building new libraries, museums, galleries and other arts venues. The party also promised to invest \u00a3175m a year in an arts pupil premium for primary school children, to launch a new \u201cTown of Culture\u201d competition, invest \u00a31bn in youth services, maintain free access to national museums and galleries, and introduce greater transparency in lottery funding. Research by the House of Commons library has shown that libraries, museums and art galleries across England have had their funding slashed by at least \u00a3640m since 2010. At the launch, MIA described Corbyn as \u201cthe last stand that England has got\u201d, adding that it would be \u201cvery hard\u201d to find another candidate who was \u201cnot corrupted\u201d to replace him as leader of the opposition should he fail to become prime minister. Loach, who directed the Bafta-winning film I, Daniel Blake, said Labour faced \u201cthe fight of our lives\u201d against the \u201cpublic school bluster\u201d of the Tories. Addressing the crowd, Corbyn said: \u201cI love the arts, I love theatre, I love art, music, I love the inspiration that it brings to all our lives. \u201cArts, music and culture are not separate from science, engineering and ideas. You need that inspiration in whatever you do. \u201cOur arts policy is to create a \u00a31bn arts fund, and that will ensure that the libraries, theatres, and the local arts facilities are improved and remain available for all.\u201d Referring to Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to reveal his Conservative manifesto pledges in Telford, near to where Mr Corbyn grew up, he joked: \u201cAre they trying to insult me or something?\u201d Read the Guardian\u2019s parliamentary sketch writer John Crace\u2019s take on the Conservative manifesto launch: Following Jo Swinson confirming last week that she would be prepared to use a nuclear weapon, Nicola Sturgeon writes for the Guardian on why she\u2019d never press the nuclear button. She writes: \u201cIt\u2019s absurd that a willingness to kill millions is now seen as a virility test for leadership, and I want no part.\u201d Read it here: The independent charity Full Fact has scrutinised today\u2019s Conservative manifesto launch. On the cost of new nurses, of which the manifesto promises 50,000, Full Fact calculates that 50,000 extra nurses at pay band 5 (\u00a324,000 per annum) would cost the NHS \u00a32.8bn a year, when factoring in the costs of national insurance, pensions and training. The Conservatives claim their policy will cost the NHS \u00a3879m in 2023/24. On increasing the number of police officers, Full Fact finds that the pledge would return the number of officers to almost, but not quite, the total there was in 2010. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of police officers in England and Wales fell by 20,752 - a 14% drop. But because the country\u2019s population has grown since 2010, the number of police officers per person has fallen by 19%. Recruiting another 20,000 police officers would therefore leave the number of police officers per person at least 6% lower than it was in 2010. The phrase \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d appears in the Conservative manifesto 22 times, but Brexit is a process, not an event. The UK will stop being a member of the EU if Johnson\u2019s deal goes through, but negotiations with the EU on a future trade deal will take place across a transition period, during which time the UK will still follow EU rules and pay into the EU budget. Based on past deals, this may take years to negotiate. On increased spending, the manifesto pledges \u00a33bn of extra day-to-day spending by the final years of the next parliament - a figure that looks considerably smaller than pledges from other parties. But these figures aren\u2019t necessarily comparable - the Conservatives did not include costings for every pledge in the manifesto; only for new spending announcements made since the election was called. So while the Conservatives plan to increase annual current spending by \u00a33bn compared to what\u2019s already been announced, the overall annual extra spend will be much higher than that. For example, the manifesto spending list omits its headline pledges on school funding, the NHS, and police officers. Will Moy, Chief Executive of Full Fact, said: In less than three weeks\u2019 time, voters will make a decision that will affect their lives and communities. We all deserve information that is accurate and honest, which is why we and others must fully scrutinise the promises made by our politicians. Candidates and parties are asking voters for their trust for the next five years, and like the other main parties, the Conservatives can do more to meet the standards we expect. Over the next few days we\u2019ll be working with experts to scrutinise today\u2019s claims in depth. A glaring omission is an increase in the higher-rate income tax threshold, which could anger Tory voters. The prime minister appears to have concluded that this tax cut for the rich would prove an electoral mistake. The triple tax lock is similar to Labour\u2019s promise not to raise income taxes, VAT and national insurance, although Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party will target the top 5% of earners. Such constraints could be unwise if the government finds it needs to raise more money to fund public services. Any chancellor could also be hamstrung in an economic downturn. The big promise to cut national insurance comes with a \u00a32.5bn price tag, according to the manifesto costing document. However, Johnson has been warned that an ambition to take the threshold all the way up to \u00a312,500 would come with an even heftier price tag of around \u00a36bn more - a figure missing from the five-year plan at present. Plans to raise the minimum wage are nothing new, nor is a promise to end the benefits freeze. It was always set to lift in 2020 after four years, though has caused significant damage, costing seven million families an average of \u00a3560 each per year. Guardian specialists break down the detail of the Conservative manifesto. Read our analysis on pledges from \u00a334bn extra for the NHS to the \u201cget Brexit done\u201d vow The manifesto promises a \u201ctransport revolution\u201d but not much of it is new and it was pot holes which made the headlines before the launch, with \u00a32bn pledged to filling them over the next four years. This is considerably more than the \u00a3500m allocated to a \u201creversing Beeching fund\u201d for railways, but to meet that promise experts say they will need more funds. It also dwarfs the money being pledged for infrastructure to support electric vehicles - \u00a3600m over six years \u2013 and an investment of \u00a3350m in cycling. The \u00a329bn investment in strategic roads sounds very like money pledged back in 2018 by the then chancellor, Philip Hammond, rather than new money, and does not appear in the costings document. The manifesto pledge on broadband confirms that the Conservatives have rowed back on a previous promise made by Boris Johnson to install full-fibre broadband to every home and business by 2025. That\u2019s been replaced by the promise of \u201cfull-fibre and gigabit-capable\u201d broadband, which is still ambitious but will be easier to achieve than the original plan and still provide faster speeds for consumers. The NHS has undoubtedly been the main domestic issue of the campaign so far, with attempts at spending one-upmanship between the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems and claims that a post-Brexit US trade deal would allow the NHS to be put \u201cup for sale\u201d dominating coverage outside of Brexit. But some of Johnson\u2019s key NHS pledges have proven to be problematic. The prime minister\u2019s claim that the government will build 40 new hospitals rapidly fell apart in late September, although the PM continues to push the misleading assertion. The government has confirmed that six existing hospitals in England are being given \u00a32.7bn by 2025 as part of the programme - an upgrade rather than a fresh build. Another 21 hospital trusts are being given \u00a3100m in seed funding to prepare a business case for their hospitals - but no money for any actual building work. The work would then start between 2025 and 2030. And on manifesto launch day, the pledge to recruit 50,000 nurses was immediately thrown into doubt when it emerged 19,000 of them would be \u201cretained\u201d staff and 12,000 would be from overseas. As he presented the manifesto, Boris Johnson moved fast to put to bed reports that troop numbers could be cut under a Conservative government. According to the Sunday Times, defence chiefs are discussing plans to slash the size of the British Army amid fears they will face further cuts. But asked by reporters if troops would be cut, Johnson replied with a firm no. It is correct, however, that the manifesto does not include a firm pledge to \u201cmaintain the overall size of the armed forces\u201d, as it did under Theresa May in 2017. The 2015 Tory manifesto pledged to keep the Army\u2019s strength at minimum of 82,000 but that commitment was dropped - with the Army hovering around 73,000. The manifesto maintains the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid but does little to assuage fears that Johnson plans to alter the way in which the aid budget is spent. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has accused the Conservatives of pushing a \u201cfundamentally damaging narrative\u201d in promising more money for health, pensions and schools without raising the money in tax, NIC or VAT to pay for them. Commenting on the Conservative Party manifesto, Paul Johnson, IFS Director, said: If the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos were notable for the scale of their ambitions the Conservative one is not. If a single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have been calling it modest. As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable. In part that is because the chancellor announced some big spending rises back In September. Other than for health and schools, though, that was a one-off increase. Taken at face value today\u2019s manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, that\u2019s it. Health and school spending will continue to rise. Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in. One notable omission is any plan for social care. In his first speech as prime minister Boris Johnson promised to \u201cfix the crisis in social care once and for all\u201d. After two decades of dither by both parties in government it seems we are no further forward. On the tax side the rise in the National Insurance threshold was well trailed. The ambition for it to get to \u00a312,500 may remain, but only the initial rise to \u00a39,500 has been costed and firmly promised. Most in paid work would benefit, but by less than \u00a32 a week. Another \u00a36 billion would need to be found to get to \u00a312,500 by the end of the parliament. Given the pressures on the spending side that is not surprising. Perhaps the biggest, and least welcome, announcement is the \u201ctriple tax lock\u201d: no increases in rates of income tax, NICs or VAT. That\u2019s a constraint the chancellor may come to regret. It is also part of a fundamentally damaging narrative \u2013 that we can have the public services we want, with more money for health and pensions and schools \u2013 without paying for them. We can\u2019t. Johnson has not always had the smoothest relationship with business, given his infamous remarks about their Brexit concerns, though company bosses are likely to broadly welcome this manifesto. The CBI said firms would be \u201cheartened by a pro-enterprise vision\u201d and praised the \u00a33bn national skills fund for training workers. But there are questions about the impact of Brexit for firms that are yet to be answered. Johnson\u2019s decision to scrap the planned corporation tax cut has gone down badly with some Tory supporters. Ever since the 1980s the Tories have argued business tax cuts boost the economy and swell the public purse. The headline rate of corporation tax has been slashed since 2010 from 28% to 19% and receipts have increased, but economists believe economic recovery and crackdowns on tax avoidance are the real reasons. Britain also now has among the lowest corporate tax rates in the developed world. The prime minister has been told further cuts would have little impact beyond damaging the public finances, including from George Osborne\u2019s former special adviser, Rupert Harrison. Labour also has a sharply contrasting plan, promising to raise the headline rate to 26%, in a clear election dividing line. A review of business rates could be a double-edged sword. Companies could save millions of pounds from reforms to a system widely regarded to be broken. Retailers in particular have lobbied hard for cuts, saying the tax is among reasons for shop closures and job losses on the high street. But councils have grown more reliant on business rates revenue amid cuts to central government funding. Further cuts present additional challenges. Along with \u201cthe will of the people\u201d, \u201cnorth London metropolitan elite\u201d and \u201ctake back control\u201d, \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d has become well established in the lexicon of Brexiter bingo. Nigel Farage has been banging on about the fabled approach for many years. Now the offer has reached the mainstream political offer, with the Tories\u2019 pledging to adopt the framework in the UK. It is unusual that the party has included this pledge before hearing back from the Migration Advisory Committee (Mac), which has been asked by the home secretary, Priti Patel, to review the feasibility of introducing an Australian-style points-based system in the UK. Beyond this, the detail remains light. The manifesto states that \u201cmost people coming into the country will need a clear job offer\u201d. This already deviates from the Australian system in that one of the key features of that approach is that a job offer is not required. What will points be issued for? The manifesto mentions English language and \u201cgood education\u201d - the Australian system is far more complex. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has criticised the Conservative manifesto pledge on 50,000 extra nurses. Of the 50,000, 12,000 would come from abroad, 14,000 would be new undergraduate students, 5,000 would do degree apprenticeships and 19,000 are nurses who would otherwise have left the profession, but who the Conservatives hope to \u201cretain\u201d. \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 claim on nurses is frankly deceitful \u2013 the sums simply don\u2019t add up. First we had Johnson\u2019s fake 40 new hospitals, now we have his fake 50,000 extra nurses\u2019,\u201d said Ashworth. Matt Hancock and Tory ministers forced through the abolition of the bursary partly causing the nursing crisis afflicting our NHS today. The new damaging Tory nurses\u2019 tax on European nurses will make it impossible to deliver the nurses our NHS needs. Labour will deliver over 50,000 new nurses through bringing back the bursary and allowing ethical international recruitment. As part of a new series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and we\u2019ll post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until polling week. Tomorrow, the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, will answer your questions about the Tory manifesto, campaign and policies, just how realistic the pledges are and what they might mean for you. You can ask your question via our form here. The central mantra of \u201cget Brexit done\u201d runs through the Tory manifesto like a stick of rock, but there are major questions about how oven-ready Johnson\u2019s plan really is. The document commits to negotiating a trade deal with the EU next year, and not to extend the implementation period beyond December 2020 - effectively leaving the prospect of a disruptive no-deal Brexit firmly on the table. Johnson could argue this strengthens his hand with Brussels, but leading trade experts warn that international agreements are fiendishly complex and can take several years to conclude. The prime minister will argue Britain and the EU are in close alignment, so precedents for lengthy trade talks do not apply. But there are risks to his approach. Talks cannot legally begin until the UK leaves the EU, currently scheduled for 31 January - leaving only 11 months to strike a deal to avoid no-deal Brexit. Theresa May had originally envisaged two years of talks. Experts say that on average, it takes 48 months to negotiate any trade deal, while a deal between Canada and the EU took seven years. The manifesto is further complicated by an aim to negotiate free trade deals with countries accounting for 80% of UK trade within three years. Talks with the USA, Australia and Japan are planned first, \u201cnegotiated in parallel with our EU deal\u201d. But experts say priorities will need to be made, as a deal with one trade partner could affect what can be negotiated with another. The recipe for Johnson\u2019s oven-ready Brexit plan extends far beyond this election, to the end of 2020 and beyond. And this from our media editor, Jim Waterson. This from the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason. The Tories\u2019 toughened stance on law and order is by now well-known, with Boris Johnson making his pledge to recruit 20,000 police officers one of the first he made as prime minister. Increased use of stop-and-search, longer sentences for some violent and sex offenders, and creating 10,000 new prison places are all in there. However, much of what they\u2019ve proposed goes against the evidence of what works when attempting to reduce crime and reoffending. Experts warn stop and search entrenches knife crime. The government\u2019s own serious violent crime strategy states that violent crime has a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d, low educational attainment, poor health, unemployment and more. Short prison sentences, which were close to being scrapped before Johnson took office, are proven to be ineffective. The Tories are getting tough on crime without being so tough on \u2013 or interested in \u2013 its causes. Some more criticism of the failure of the Tory manifesto to address the crisis in social care. And on what appears to be a lack of money for their Northern Powerhouse rail pledge, from the political editor of the Manchester Evening News. The Conservatives are offering a fraction of what the other leading opposition parties are proposing. When it comes to day-to-day spending, the Tory plan would increase the amount spent by just \u00a32.9bn per year by 2023-24, compared to \u00a382.9bn for Labour and \u00a362.9bn for the Lib Dems. On these grounds, Labour would spend almost \u00a328 more than present for every pound the Conservatives promise, in the clearest attempt by the Tories to put clear blue water between Johnson and Corbyn. The differences are stark. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, the plan would lift government spending as a share of national income a handful of places on the international league table for wealthy nations. Labour plan a German-sized state with spending around 45% of GDP, while the Conservatives aim to match the Netherlands at roughly 41%. Though modest in comparison to Labour, it would still mean the biggest increase in the size of the state under a Tory government since Harold Macmillan. Johnson will hope the public believe Labour lack credibility with the public finances, with a boom-and-bust spending package to match. But it could backfire. The Tories could be charged with failing to credibly turn the page on a decade of austerity, while committing insufficient funds to tackle the climate emergency. The Tory manifesto therefore offers relative status-quo, versus fundamental reform. Here\u2019s Corbyn\u2019s full response to the Conservative manifesto: Boris Johnson has launched a manifesto for billionaires. They bought it and you\u2019ll pay for it. After a decade of the Conservatives cutting our NHS, police and schools, all Boris Johnson is offering is more of the same: more cuts, more failure, and years more of Brexit uncertainty. Boris Johnson can\u2019t be trusted. Older people face a triple whammy as he has failed to protect free TV licences for over 75s, refused to grant justice to women unfairly affected by the increase in the state pension age, and not offered a plan or extra money to fix the social care crisis. In contrast, Labour\u2019s manifesto is full of popular policies that the political establishment has blocked for a generation. The pledge for more money for schools was first made in the summer but no cash was forthcoming straight away. The schools budget was already set to rise by \u00a31bn a year by 2023 due to an increase in the number of students, and it\u2019s not clear if that\u2019s included in the \u00a314bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that because student numbers are set to rise, and once inflation is taken into account. The extra money for schools adds up to a 7.4% real terms increase in spending per pupil between 2019-20 and 2022-23. This is less than the 8% it has worked out would be needed to reverse cuts in funding since 2009-10. The Conservative offer on childcare is less generous than Labour\u2019s \u2013 it does not explicitly promise free childcare for younger children, and it is unclear how money from the \u00a31bn fund would be allocated. Unions have responded to the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto and are, predictably, unimpressed. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said: Tinkering around the edges offers nothing for those in our deindustrialised heartlands, or for those who voted Leave and are thinking of voting Tory or for their Brexit Party bedfellows. There\u2019s nothing in it for young people, for pensioners, for nurses, for teachers, for car workers, for public sector workers. The Tories will do nothing to rebuild our manufacturing industries or stop the abuses of migrant workers by greedy bosses who use them to undercut pay and conditions. Manuel Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, said: This wafer thin offering from the Tories stands in stark contrast to Labour\u2019s comprehensive and fully costed manifesto to reboot Britain. No serious party would come to the table with so little to say, and on Brexit, Johnson just sounds like a scratched record. He may not be aware but the Tories have been promising to get Brexit done for over three years. Saying it time and time again won\u2019t make it happen and simply makes him look like even more of an Eton-educated buffoon. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: No-one should be fooled by the promises for the NHS and public sector. For the past nine years the Tories have slashed funding and let services slide. Now they are trumpeting a reversal of their own bungled policy of scrapping the nursing bursary - a problem of their own making. Social care needs a massive investment and the amounts they propose would barely make a dent. The call for higher wages will ring hollow to the millions of people who have seen their wages frozen under the Conservatives. Jeremy Corbyn has responded to the launch of the Conservative party manifesto, pointing out that they chose Shropshire \u2013 his home county \u2013 to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s a manifesto paid for by billionaires, written for billionaires, and will be delivered for billionaires but the problem is the rest of us will have to pay for it,\u201d he said. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been speaking to the BBC about the manifesto. One of the new announcements of the day was a commitment to deliver 50,000 new nurses and the return of the nurse bursary. He was asked about whether his party was wrong to cut nurse bursaries. \u201cOne of the things about coming in as a relatively new health secretary with a new prime minister is that you can review things and work out what is the best way to go forward,\u201d he said. Asked about why there isn\u2019t a full policy proposal on social care, he says their plan comes in three parts: to put more money into the system as it is now, to find a cross party consensus (\u201cyou can only solve a long-term problem like this with a cross-party consensus), and guaranteeing that people won\u2019t have to sell their home to pay for their care. Hancock is asked if he is open to the idea of making social care free at the point of use and funded by tax-payers. That idea fits with our commitment that people wouldn\u2019t have to sell their home to pay for their care ... but I don\u2019t want to say anything more than that because I don\u2019t want to put down further red lines, if you like, other than those we\u2019ve set out in this document, because we are absolutely determined \u2013 if we are returned with a majority \u2013 immediately after the election to get on and get stuck into building that consensus for a solution that the whole country can get behind. BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has a link to a pdf of the Tory manifesto. You can have a read here. The Conservative party doesn\u2019t seem to have published the manifesto online yet. This is from Huffington Post\u2019s Paul Waugh, who is at the launch and has a hard copy. Paul Johnson from the Institute for Fiscal Studies has been talking to the BBC. He said that the claim that the Conservatives were promising the biggest ever \u201ccash boost to the NHS\u201d was \u201cbroadly true\u201d in cash terms, but not in real terms, so was \u201cmisleading\u201d. \u201cOnce you take into account the fact that spending is a lot higher than it was in the past, it\u2019s not such a big increase,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a substantial increase. It\u2019s bigger than we\u2019ve seen over the past 10 years, but it\u2019s not in line, actually, with what the NHS got in the past 40 or 50 years.\u201d He said that the big increases in spending in the manifesto were already announced in the last spending round. \u201cWhat this seems to imply is that outside of schools and hospitals there\u2019s not going to be much to go around in the remaining four years of parliament,\u201d he said. A lot of the cuts we\u2019ve seen in justice and local government \u201care pretty much baked in if you take this manifesto at face value\u201d. Here are some more points from the manifesto: A Conservative government would get rid of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. They would aim to have 80% of UK trade covered by free trade agreements within the next three years. The party would increase the defence budget by at least 0.5%. They would ensure workers have the right to request a more more predictable contract. Mortgage lending rules that came in after the crash are designed to stop people taking on loans they could struggle to repay in future, but the Conservatives appear to be saying they would make changes to free-up lending. Fixing interest rates offsets some of the risk, but if prices fall there will be more people at risk of negative equity. Previous attempts by lenders to offer long-term fixed-rate mortgages have failed, so this would need a big change in the market and homebuyers\u2019 attitudes. A big problem with cutting deposits for first-time buyers is it is likely to fuel demand for homes without tackling the supply-side problems. Renters will be pleased with the pledges on no-fault evictions, and lifetime deposits, but social housing will be lost with the maintenance of right-to-buy. The Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, asks about the Conservative party\u2019s decision to change one of its Twitter pages to resemble a fact-checking site during the first leaders\u2019 debate \u201cI haven\u2019t followed this Twitter stuff with the attention you would like, Rowena,\u201d he says. \u201cI will apprise myself of the detail of this\u201d. He then changes the subject to attacking Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to remain neutral on any second EU referendum. Asked why a pledge to lift the higher rate income tax threshold \u2013 which he promised in his leadership campaign \u2013 is not in the manifesto, Johnson says: \u201cI haven\u2019t lost my tax-cutting zeal.\u201d He says it\u2019s \u201cimportant to focus tax cuts where people need them most\u201d. The Daily Mail\u2019s political editor asks him why there is no big plan to deal with the pressures on social care in the manifesto. Johnson repeats the line \u2013 used by cabinet ministers over the last few days - that they will be reaching out to other parties to find a way to address the problem. He promises that nobody will have to sell their home to fund their care. The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn asks about maintaining troop numbers. Johnson interrupts him to say they would not cut the armed services. He says there is a \u201csharp distinction\u201d between his position and that of the leader of the opposition. He responds to a question about fiscal discipline and he says \u201cwe are doing this sensibly\u201d and that a Conservative government would be bringing debt down. A journalist from the Shropshire Star asks about the A&amp;E department in Telford. \u201cWe will certainly make sure the A&amp;E in Telford is kept open,\u201d says Johnson. He says that he is sure the health secretary, Matt Hancock, would be happy to talk to the reporter about it afterwards. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby asks him about trust. Voters laughed at you in TV debates when you said that truth in politics is important, she says. Johnson says he was determined to leave the EU by 31 October and parliament prevented this from happening. \u201cThat is why we do need to fix this broken parliament, get a working majority and get that deal over the line.\u201d The BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, asks whether Johnson acknowledges that people would be making a big leap of faith in voting for him after he broke his promise on taking the UK out of Europe by the end of October. Johnson says that parliament blocked him from doing so. He says that for three and half years people have seen politicians engaged in endless \u201cdither and delay\u201d and that they want to see Brexit done. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston says that the Conservatives are pledging \u00a33bn a year of extra public service spending compared to Labour\u2019s \u00a383bn a year, and \u00a38bn of increased investment compared to \u00a380bn a year from Jeremy Corbyn. Why wouldn\u2019t people who want to see improvements in public services vote for Labour? Johnson says he couldn\u2019t disagree more. By 2033, we will we see a 29% increase in funding in the NHS, he says. Tory plans would include the biggest ever cash boost to the NHS. \u201cIt is true that we are doing it in a sensible way,\u201d he says. Johnson says they are making big commitments and they can only do that because \u201cwe have a dynamic and growing economy\u201d. He says all Labour governments end with an economic crisis. \u201cThe only difference with Corbyn and McDonnell is they propose to start with an economic crisis\u201d. This line gets the biggest cheer yet: Let\u2019s go carbon neutral by 2050 and Corbyn neutral by Christmas. That\u2019s it from Johnson\u2019s speech. Now some questions from the media. The manifesto says a Conservative government would build \u201cNorthern Powerhouse Rail\u201d between Leeds and Manchester, and then focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle. They would make a \u00a328.8bn investment in strategic and local roads. More from the manifesto. Johnson says the party is proud to have confirmed \u00a334bn per year by the end of the parliament in additional funding for the NHS. Within the first three months of our new term, we will enshrine in law our fully-funded, long-term NHS plan. Johnson mocks Corbyn\u2019s neutral position on Brexit, saying that if the Labour leader doesn\u2019t believe in the deal he will try and agree with the EU \u201cthen who does believe in it?\u201d \u201cIt would be farcical and comical if the consequences of that approach weren\u2019t so disastrous,\u201d he says. Johnson repeats the claim that \u201cCorbynomics\u201d would mean \u00a32,400 extra in taxes for every person. (We fact checked this claim here.) PA Media has been pulling announcements from the manifesto. It pledges to provide \u00a31bn of additional funding for social care in every year of the next parliament, but stops short of providing a plan to solve the social care funding shortage, other than stating that the money raised cannot come from forcing elderly care recipients to sell their homes. We will build a cross-party consensus to bring forward an answer that solves the problem, commands the widest support, and stands the test of time. That consensus will consider a range of options but one condition we do make is that nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it. Johnson says the Tories will invest millions more every week in science, education and infrastructure. He says his government set a net zero carbon emissions target of 2050. And the party will do all of those things without raising VAT, national insurance contributions or income tax, he says. He repeats his line that the deal is \u201coven ready\u201d to go and would allow them to restore confidence and certainty to businesses. \u201cGet Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and our minds on the priorities of the British people.\u201d He says the manifesto commits them to providing 50,000 more nurses. Johnson is taking to the stage to some pretty dramatic music and chants of \u201cBoris\u201d. He says the other parties want to frustrate the will of the people. Corbyn \u201cused to be indecisive,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cNow he\u2019s not so sure\u201d. Here are some lines from the manifesto, as reported by Reuters. The Conservatives will create up to 10 free ports around the UK. They will not extend the Brexit deadline implementation period beyond December 2020. They will no longer allow people to claim child benefit for children living overseas after Brexit. They will deliver 50,000 more nurses. Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 who has not been seen in public since his disastrous remarks on Grenfell \u2013 is not at the launch. You can watch the live feed of the Conservative party manifesto launch at the top of this blog or here. The party\u2019s chairman, James Cleverly, is on the stage repeating the slogan \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. He says the kind of change Corbyn is offering is not the kind of change the UK needs. All of their policies are rooted in the past. Ours look to the future. Theirs empower the state. Ours support real people. Boris Johnson is about to take to the stage in Telford to launch his party\u2019s manifesto. The cabinet have arrived. The BBC has defended the broadcast of an edited clip of Boris Johnson\u2019s Question Time performance that sparked a row on Twitter, reports Aaron Walawalkar. Audience members could be heard laughing after Johnson was asked whether it was important for someone in his position \u201cto always tell the truth\u201d during the live broadcast of the Leaders Special on Friday night. Twitter user Nick Flaks noticed this laughter was seemingly missing from the clip broadcast during BBC News\u2019 lunchtime bulletin on Saturday. Veteran columnist Peter Oborne likened the video edit to something that would normally be seen \u201con state TV in Soviet Russia\u201d, demanding the BBC explain itself. The BBC presenter Huw Edwards hit back, dismissing Oborne as sounding \u201ccrackers\u201d. A BBC News spokesperson said: \u201cThis clip, which was played in full on the 10 O\u2019clock News last night, was shortened for timing reasons in today\u2019s lunchtime bulletin. We\u2019ve fully covered Boris Johnson\u2019s appearance on the BBC QT special, and the reaction to it, across our outlets.\u201d Speaking ahead of the Conservative manifesto launch in Telford at 2pm, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, said the party\u2019s manifesto would be published along with \u201cthe most detailed most transparent costings that have ever been published in British electoral history by any party\u201d. He said the only way to avoid a no-deal Brexit was to deliver a Conservative majority at the next election, which would allow the UK to leave the EU by the end of January. Labour has announced it would spend \u00a358bn on compensating women who have been financially hit by the decision to raise the pension age from 60 to 66 (see full story here). The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that the government has \u201cfailed the women who were born in the 1950s\u201d. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, criticised the announcement \u2013 which doesn\u2019t appear in Labour\u2019s manifesto \u2013 as being another item on a wishlist. \u201cWhere\u2019s the money coming from is the question that was not answered.\u201d she asked. Swinson told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show that the Conservatives were on course to get a majority and that her party was the only one that could stop them. \u201cWho is going to stop Boris Johnson from getting a majority?\u201d she said. \u201cIf we look at things as they stand, it is not the Labour party. Even in seats like Grimsby, Labour are not even managing to hold their own.\u201d Latest polling suggests Labour is set to lose all but one of its seats in Scotland. A Panelbase study for the Sunday Times suggested that only Ian Murray, a frequent critic of the party\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would be returned to the House of Commons. The poll, which surveyed 1,009 people in Scotland, found that support for Labour in Scotland could dip from 27% to 20%. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has given an interview to PA Media in which she has indicated her party could potentially do business with Labour in a hung parliament if Jeremy Corbyn was not leader. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, responding to Sajid Javid\u2019s comments from this morning: Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru, has also been speaking to broadcasters this morning. He told the BBC\u2019s deputy political editor, John Pienaar, that he wouldn\u2019t apologise for likening Wales\u2019s relationship with England to that of a colonial power. \u201c[An] extractive economy with political power outside of its own nation. I mean, what word would you use to describe that?\u201d said Price. I think that Wales, like any western country itself, benefited from colonialism. And we as a nation have a moral debt to those countries as well. But that\u2019s not to exclude the fact that Wales suffered too in different ways and in a different context. But, you know, I can take you, John, round communities in Wales where you have intergenerational poverty. You know, it\u2019s there in the physical fabric of those communities. It\u2019s there on the faces of the people. And I\u2019m not going to apologise about feeling angry about that. Today\u2019s Observer has an interview with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, which is worth a read. Here are some key quotes. On Labour\u2019s election chances: I do believe in miracles, but we don\u2019t need a miracle. Last time, at this stage of the campaign, I was getting lots of phone calls from colleagues saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to be wiped out and [we\u2019re] really worried\u2019. We\u2019re at that stage now. I\u2019m getting the phone calls which are saying: \u2018I think, at best, [Labour will be the] largest party [in parliament]\u2019. Then people saying: \u2018Actually, on the doorstep, it doesn\u2019t feel like the polls\u2019. On the scale of the party\u2019s spending commitments: The problems we face, the issues that we face, are big. They\u2019re huge. So it does require a huge response. We\u2019ve got these weeks to get that message across. But you\u2019re right. We talk about billions. People just switch off. So the issue for us is translating that into what does it mean in your local area \u2026 so people don\u2019t think the big numbers are just unreal. Asked if they would accept a continuation of freedom of movement with the EU in a future deal: It will be a negotiating issue \u2026 Of course, we welcome the principles of free movement, but we also recognise that there are issues that have to be addressed. Here is a summary of the highlights from this morning\u2019s political broadcast interviews: Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would not remain neutral in any second EU referendum. He told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that members of the shadow cabinet would be able to campaign on the basis of their judgment. He said: \u201cI\u2019ll wait until I see the details of the deal that we negotiate. I\u2019ve said up until now \u2013 I was in the negotiations with the Conservatives for six weeks and I couldn\u2019t see a deal even emerging then that could beat remain, but let\u2019s see what we can negotiate.\u201d Chancellor Sajid Javid told the same programme that the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto would be published along with \u201cthe most detailed most transparent costings that have ever been published in British electoral history by any party\u201d. He said the only way to avoid a no-deal Brexit was to deliver a Conservative majority at the next election, which would allow the UK to leave the EU by the end of January. On the Labour party\u2019s announcement that it would spend \u00a358bn on women caught in a pension trap (see full story here), the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that the government has \u201cfailed the women who were born in the 1950s\u201d, adding: \u201cThey stole their pension, that contract, that agreement that they thought they had, and then accelerated it so those women didn\u2019t have the chance to prepare for that.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, told Marr that the Conservatives were on course to get a majority and that her party was the only one that could stop them. \u201cWho is going to stop Boris Johnson from getting a majority?\u201d she said. \u201cIf we look at things as they stand, it is not the Labour party. Even in seats like Grimsby, Labour are not even managing to hold their own.\u201d Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, set out her red lines for supporting a minority Labour government. She said she would want to see Trident nuclear weapons scrapped, more powers handed to Holyrood, as well as the granting of a second independence vote. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has given an interview to PA Media in which she has indicated her party could potentially do business with Labour in a hung parliament if Jeremy Corbyn was not leader. She said she could see no circumstance in which the DUP would support a minority Labour administration with Corbyn as prime minister, but acknowledged there were others in his party with whom she could consider working. Jeremy Corbyn, of course, is an anathema to anyone who believes in the United Kingdom. I mean, he would destroy the economy. We\u2019ve seen that through his manifesto launch. I mean, some of it is complete fantastical stuff. How he\u2019s going to fund that no one knows, he would wreck the economy. He would wreck the defence of our nation as well. And more than that it would lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom. So therefore, we cannot see any circumstances, I see no circumstance where we would support a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour party. Of course, there are others in the Labour party who take a different view to Jeremy Corbyn. And, if it comes to be the case that someone else is leading the Labour party, then we will judge it against not only our 12-point plan but whether it\u2019s good for Northern Ireland to be in communication with whoever\u2019s leading the Labour party at that time. Foster rejected the suggestion that Corbyn\u2019s position on Brexit, with his opposition to the erection of economic barriers down the Irish Sea, was more unionist than either Theresa May or Boris Johnson. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably a tactical attack for him on the Conservative party as opposed to anything he really genuinely believes in terms of the United Kingdom,\u201d she said. Asked whether unionism would be in trouble if Johnson secured a large majority, thus enabling him to ratify his deal in parliament, Foster said: Well, I don\u2019t think they will come back with a large majority. But we will still continue to use our influence there if they do come back with a large majority and to make sure that Northern Ireland\u2019s voice is heard with our strong team of DUP MPs. Some more polling, this time from Opinium for the Observer, has the Conservatives with a 19-point lead over Labour. That statement by Swinson that the Conservatives are on course to win a majority is yet more evidence that the party is shifting its position from \u201cSwinson could be prime minister\u201d to \u201cwe can help deny Johnson a majority\u201d. The BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, wrote this a couple of days ago, noting the shift. There\u2019s some polling here on Westminster voting intentions in Scotland that shows the Conservatives up seven points. Michael Gove has just been speaking to Marr. He was asked about social care and he said \u201cwe want to forge a consensus\u201d on the issue. \u201cHow are you going to do a consensual deal with people you revile so much?\u201d asked Marr. Gove said there are people in the Labour party \u2013 though not in the leadership \u2013 who they could work with. Gove says the political challenge is one for all parties. \u201cThe approach that we in the Conservative party take towards these big issues is actually to be generous, open and inclusive and to say let\u2019s work together in order to make sure we have a solution that spans the generation.\u201d Asked about maintaining the overall size of the armed forces, he says: \u201cWe have absolutely no plans to reduce the size of the armed forces at all.\u201d (I\u2019ve previously written about the army\u2019s recruitment crisis, with frontline combat units operating as much as 40% below strength. You can read below.) Asked if there would be any possibility of asking for another EU extension beyond one year in the next phase, Gove said: \u201cNo \u2026 we\u2019ll be out of the EU by January.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon was on Sky earlier. She said her party would only ever enter into a \u201cless formal arrangement\u201d to support a minority Labour government. In terms of supporting a minority Labour government, I have been clear we wouldn\u2019t have a formal coalition, it would be a less formal arrangement, and yes of course I would expect [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party to respect Scotland\u2019s right to choose our own future. Swinson\u2019s party could end up with a lot of sway in a future hung parliament, says Marr. He asks what their priority would be. \u201cOf course, the Liberal Democrats want to stop Brexit and we will be campaigning to stop Brexit,\u201d she says. \u201cAs things stand, Boris Johnson is on course to get a majority,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at the polls right now, that is what they say.\u201d The Liberal Democrats are the party in the best position to take many seats from the Conservatives. Swinson says the Lib Dems would vote in favour of having a second EU referendum with Boris Johnson\u2019s deal as one option and remaining as the other option. Marr says that the Question Time show on Friday night showed that there is still a lot of anger towards the Lib Dems from \u201clefty-leaning, remain-voters\u201d. Swinson says that in coalition there were constant battles that weren\u2019t always seen by the public because of the principle of collective responsibility. She\u2019s asked what was going through her mind when she voted for 17% cut in social care budgets and cuts to the police. They were making difficult decisions in the context of the a smaller economy after the financial crash, she says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t win more battles in that coalition.\u201d The Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show. \u201cIt\u2019s not gone terribly well has it?\u201d starts Marr (ouch). \u201cWell, I\u2019m enjoying the campaign. Clearly there has been a squeeze,\u201d says Swinson. She says \u201cthe stitch-up\u201d between Nigel Farage and the Conservatives has had an effect. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop Boris Johnson getting a majority? Well, it\u2019s not the Labour party,\u201d she says. Swinson argues that even in seats such as Grimsby the Labour party are not contenders. Rayner says what Labour is suggesting corporation tax is raised to wouldn\u2019t even bring it up to 2010 levels and it would be less than it was under Thatcher. Asked about Labour\u2019s approach to the gender recognition act, over which there has been some confusion. \u201cWe will protect spaces under the qualities act \u2026 but we will also protect transgender women as well,\u201d she says. My colleague Michael Savage has some background on this: \u201cWe need to get past Brexit,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people listening to this show will have had enough.\u201d She is asked about the party\u2019s pledge to women caught in a pension trap (see McDonnell\u2019s interview earlier). She said the situation \u201cfundamentally undermines the contract between a government and its people,\u201d. Marr says Labour is not being honest when it says its tax plans would affect only the richest 5%. Two million people on marriage tax allowance (which Labour will scrap) would each lose \u00a3250 a year. Rayner says the party\u2019s measures would present a net benefit to families. \u201cEverybody bar the top 5% would be better off under Labour,\u201d she says. Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, is on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. She is asked if a future Labour government \u2013 as opposed to just Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister \u2013 would take a position on the deal it had negotiated with Brussels in a future EU referendum. \u201cThat\u2019s a hypothetical,\u201d she says. McDonnell was asked if he was happy to see billionaires in the UK. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a more equal society,\u201d he said. \u201cI meet with very rich people in the City and elsewhere and they don\u2019t want to be stepping over homeless people as they come out of their offices \u2026 they don\u2019t want to live in gated communities.\u201d He was asked about the Labour line that it would not consider another Scottish independence referendum in \u201cthe early years of a Labour government\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything in the first two or three years, at least,\u201d he said. Speaking to Ridge earlier, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said members of the shadow cabinet would be allowed to campaign how they wanted in a future second referendum, while Corbyn would remain a neutral \u201chonest broker\u201d. McDonnell avoids saying how he would campaign, but says he will not remain neutral and that he has not seen a deal so far that is as good as remain. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a leader who will divide the country \u2013 it\u2019s divided already,\u201d he says. He\u2019s asked about Labour\u2019s announcement today that it would create a \u00a358bn compensation scheme for 3 million women who believe they have been left thousands of pounds out of pocket after steep increases to the state pension age. Here\u2019s the story: Ridge asks McDonnell why the measure is not in the party\u2019s manifesto costings. \u201cWith these decisions \u2026 it\u2019s outside of the score card. It\u2019s a very special arrangement,\u201d he says. She asks if the measure is something the party has cooked up since Johnson was asked about it on Friday night\u2019s BBC Question Time. McDonnell says they\u2019ve been working on it for the past 18 months. The chancellor is asked about rumours of rifts between him and Johnson. \u201cWere you relieved when he said he\u2019d keep you on as chancellor?\u201d he is asked. Javid says: \u201cIt was a great answer.\u201d Javid is asked about no-deal planning. \u201cThe only risk of no deal is if there isn\u2019t a Conservative majority,\u201d he says. He repeats the line that there is a deal \u201cready to go\u201d and that a Conservative government could get it done by the end of January. Javid says the Tory manifesto will be \u201cthe most green manifesto that any party has ever published\u201d. He\u2019s asked about a cut to inheritance tax. \u201cJust wait and see what\u2019s in the manifesto,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will cut taxes whenever we can afford it an whenever it is prudent for the country.\u201d Sajid Javid is on Sky now. He says that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plans mean a tax increase of \u00a32,400 per person. \u201cWhere\u2019s that [figure] from?\u201d says Ridge. He dodges the question. Ridge asks him about the Tory plans to borrow billions more. Javid says we have had a decade of recovery and that it is important to balance the books, but also to get the economy going. \u201cToday we have strong economic fundamentals, more people employed than ever before,\u201d he says. He says they will balance day-to-day spending and have an \u201cinfrastructure revolution\u201d. He says he is clear that debt will be lower at the end of the next parliament than it is today. Ridge asks about Moody\u2019s decision to lower the UK\u2019s credit outlook to negative. People will be thinking \u201cwhat was the point of austerity?\u201d she says. Javid says that that decision was because of the paralysis in our parliament. Good morning everyone, I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I will be liveblogging for you today as we gear up to the launch of the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto later today. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge at the moment, so I\u2019ll bring you highlights from that shortly. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and the Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, are due on after that. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, are due to appear on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, which starts at 9am. Boris Johnson will launch his party\u2019s manifesto in the West Midlands this afternoon, committing a Tory government to not raise income tax, VAT or national insurance for five years. He will also pledge to protect the value of state pensions, boost spending by \u00a31bn on childcare during school terms and holidays, and cut energy bills by up to \u00a3750 a year for those in social housing.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson gave a rambling answer about the hunting of the snark, Fermat\u2019s last theorem and croutons when he was asked to justify why the Conservative party masqueraded as an independent fact-checking service on Twitter. The prime minister struggled to answer when pressed by the Guardian on whether the stunt by the Conservative campaign headquarters (CCHQ) Twitter feed undermined trust in politics. At first, Johnson claimed the \u201cTwittersphere is not my province\u201d, despite his personal account tweeting many times a day to his 1.2m followers. He then claimed wrongly that \u201cLabour have some sort of operation which is very similar to this\u201d before saying he \u201chadn\u2019t really followed this Twitter stuff as much as others would like\u201d and would \u201capprise himself\u201d of the facts. Johnson then launched into a circuitous aside about how on the issue of trust there was one fact that should be found \u201clike the hunting of the snark\u201d or the \u201cquest for the answer of Fermat\u2019s last theorem\u201d, which was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position on leaving the EU. He continued with his metaphors saying it was like the \u201criddle of the Sphinx or the Bermuda Triangle\u201d and ended with a comparison of Labour\u2019s Brexit policy to croutons in a minestrone soup. Corbyn has committed to negotiating a Brexit deal and then putting it to a second referendum in which he would remain neutral. The prime minister said finding Labour\u2019s Brexit policy was the \u201creal issue\u201d and asked the media to \u201credouble their efforts and send out search parties\u201d to find the truth. His answer avoided the issue of whether the Conservatives were wrong to rebrand the official Twitter account as factcheckUK during last week\u2019s televised debate. Following the move, Full Fact, an independent factchecking service, said it was \u201cinappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account factcheckUK during this debate.\u201d Twitter also issued a statement condemning CCHQ\u2019s behaviour and warning that any further attempts to \u201cmislead people\u201d during the election campaign would result in action.",

      "body": "<p>There is much to be welcomed in the Labour party\u2019s manifesto, particularly the idea of the Sovereign Land Trust to buy land and lease it back to communities, the commitment to zero-carbon new homes and an end to right-to-buy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/jeremy-corbyn-urges-public-to-vote-for-his-manifesto-of-hope-labour-tax-spend-plans\" title=\"\">Corbyn unveils Labour\u2019s most radical manifesto for decades</a>, 22 November).</p> <p>But \u2013 as an architect who was active in London in the 1960s and 70s, at the height of the postwar expansion of council house building \u2013 I have some misgivings about the commitment to build at a rate of 150,000 units a year. The maximum achieved during the 1950s and 60s was an average of about 200,000, following a build-up of about three years. When there was a major push to increase throughput by industrialised building and package-dealing with little or no design input from planners and architects, standards fell, social and environmental consequences were dire and many of the products of those years have been demolished.</p> <p>Labour should learn from this that the careful construction of humane communities, which sustain lives and are loved, requires generous lead-in time. We start from a low base with most local authorities bled dry of professional expertise. Also, overheating in the construction industry runs into storages of mortals and skilled labour, producing inflation.</p> <p>Furthermore, there is no mention of existing housing and the need to revive incentives to upgrade this. At present, the 20% VAT levied on maintenance and retrofit (with a few minor exemptions such as insulants) provides an inbuilt financial incentive for site clearance and new build, which is VAT exempt. Only with the equalisation of this tax across retrofit and new build can an objective cost-benefit analysis be made of alternative approaches to the existing stock.</p> <p>The brownfield first requirement should be revived. In the absence of these moderations, Labour\u2019s housing policies are in danger of continuing the present dominance of big developers, demanding huge sites with immeasurable damage to social cohesion, plus continuing pressure on the green belt.<br><strong>Kate Macintosh</strong><br><em>Winchester, </em><em>Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 You report on Labour\u2019s promise to tackle the housing crisis as an unchallenged good (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/labour-to-unveil-75bn-social-housing-plan-to-build-for-the-many\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s \u00a375bn pledge to tackle UK housing crisis</a>, 21 November). However, if it is not accompanied by parallel investment in infrastructure and roads, it can be a disaster for individual localities.</p> <p>In my area, thousands of houses have been built without any additional doctors\u2019 surgeries or schools, and in an area with just two main roads leading through the increasingly gridlocked town of Aylesbury.

      "bodyText": "There is much to be welcomed in the Labour party\u2019s manifesto, particularly the idea of the Sovereign Land Trust to buy land and lease it back to communities, the commitment to zero-carbon new homes and an end to right-to-buy (Corbyn unveils Labour\u2019s most radical manifesto for decades, 22 November). But \u2013 as an architect who was active in London in the 1960s and 70s, at the height of the postwar expansion of council house building \u2013 I have some misgivings about the commitment to build at a rate of 150,000 units a year. The maximum achieved during the 1950s and 60s was an average of about 200,000, following a build-up of about three years. When there was a major push to increase throughput by industrialised building and package-dealing with little or no design input from planners and architects, standards fell, social and environmental consequences were dire and many of the products of those years have been demolished. Labour should learn from this that the careful construction of humane communities, which sustain lives and are loved, requires generous lead-in time. We start from a low base with most local authorities bled dry of professional expertise. Also, overheating in the construction industry runs into storages of mortals and skilled labour, producing inflation. Furthermore, there is no mention of existing housing and the need to revive incentives to upgrade this. At present, the 20% VAT levied on maintenance and retrofit (with a few minor exemptions such as insulants) provides an inbuilt financial incentive for site clearance and new build, which is VAT exempt. Only with the equalisation of this tax across retrofit and new build can an objective cost-benefit analysis be made of alternative approaches to the existing stock. The brownfield first requirement should be revived. In the absence of these moderations, Labour\u2019s housing policies are in danger of continuing the present dominance of big developers, demanding huge sites with immeasurable damage to social cohesion, plus continuing pressure on the green belt. Kate Macintosh Winchester, Hampshire \u2022 You report on Labour\u2019s promise to tackle the housing crisis as an unchallenged good (Labour\u2019s \u00a375bn pledge to tackle UK housing crisis, 21 November). However, if it is not accompanied by parallel investment in infrastructure and roads, it can be a disaster for individual localities. In my area, thousands of houses have been built without any additional doctors\u2019 surgeries or schools, and in an area with just two main roads leading through the increasingly gridlocked town of Aylesbury. A ring road is promised, but only after all the houses are in place, so before that happens we face years of traffic misery and lack of facilities. The houses are not even serving local people as they are designed and priced to attract escapees from London and are unaffordable to young people who want to stay local. Finally, those of us who chose to live in smaller villages find the town steadily moving towards us, damaging our environment and polluting our air. Unrestrained building, unless matched by appropriate infrastructure and respect for the environment, can be a blight on an area. Jill Wallis Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire \u2022 Labour\u2019s plans to spend \u00a375bn on new build is expensive and comes with enormous social and environmental implications.

But it\u2019s expensive, with monthly fees as high as \u00a31,000, and we\u2019re struggling. To make matters worse, under universal credit we are forced to pay these eye-watering childcare bills in advance, and wait up to a month to be reimbursed. As a result, many of us have been forced into debt. We\u2019ve had to resort to desperate measures \u2013 cutting back on essentials, relying on foodbanks or going without meals ourselves so that our children can eat. Some of us have even had to give up good jobs we love because we can\u2019t afford childcare. We\u2019re not alone. Up and down the country, thousands of low-income parents like us have been left feeling that the system is stacked against us. We know this because our petition calling on the government to scrap upfront childcare costs has received more than 103,000 signatures. Labour\u2019s commitment to scrapping upfront costs, announced in their manifesto, is a clear sign that they want to do more to support families. We urge the leaders of the other main political parties to follow Labour\u2019s lead and address this issue. Not doing so is setting families up to struggle. Whichever government is elected on 12 December will determine the future of families like ours. We call on all party leaders to commit to addressing this problem as a top priority. Whoever is elected into No 10 needs to act before the number of parents forced into debt and hardship spirals out of control.

But Corbyn has a clear story, of sorts: of a hapless, often hopeless country somehow taken prisoner by \u2013 to quote from his <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/11/jeremy-corbyns-manifesto-launch-speech-full-transcript/\" title=\"\">speech</a> \u2013 \u201cthe bankers, the billionaires and the establishment\u201d, who may or may not be the same people as \u201cthe tax dodgers, the bad bosses and the big polluters\u201d. Citing Franklin Roosevelt, Corbyn suggested he \u201cwelcomes their hatred\u201d; the best way to start to make Britain fairer, it seems, is to draw them out of their mansions and expose them to as much public fury as possible.</p> \n<p>The logic behind this stuff is clear enough: it draws on the kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-new-populism\" title=\"\">textbook populism</a> that has been in the ascendant for the past five years all over the world, and is mostly located on the right rather than the left. To the extent that it vividly talks about no end of very real inequalities and imbalances and identifies their alleged source, perhaps it will find an audience. But in a country wearied by the furies of Brexit and the shouting people see whenever they make the mistake of watching Question Time, I am not sure it speaks to what many people want from politics. After Nigel Farage\u2019s nastiness, Boris Johnson\u2019s brazen untruths, and the misanthropic nonsense that has been echoing out of the White House, it may sound like yet more faux-macho belligerence. For anyone on the left, this goes into something fundamental: can you really root progressive, hopeful, human politics in blame, resentment and loathing?</p> \n<p>There are other problems. Big, transformative ideas require dedicated effort, over years \u2013 the building of coalitions across society, and the kind of open, pluralistic mindset that too many Labour people seem to have long mislaid, and are hardly going to rediscover in three weeks flat. Boldness, moreover, always demands reassurance: convincing people that comparable things have been accomplished before and that they can therefore be done again (the essential message of \u201ctake back control\u201d, \u201cmake America great again\u201d, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/17/democrats-not-headed-too-far-left-says-ocasio-cortez-we-are-bringing-party-home\" title=\"\">recent insistence</a> that Bernie Sanders\u2019 run for the Democratic nomination is \u201cbringing the party home\u201d). Beyond the odd reference to the evils of Thatcherism and the usual fuzzy tributes to 1945, something is still lacking in Labour\u2019s thinking. Many people will see its plans for what Corbyn rather awkwardly calls an \u201cinvestment blitz\u201d as having fallen from the sky, when they ought to feel like the expression of things that are already woven into our past and present, waiting for the chance to be revived.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9ae2a55b-dfe2-4666-ae9e-d46523c85005\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HDjyuHYo8Ow?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Though Corbyn talks in terms of hope, his broad-sweep view of the country is too often reducible to an endless expanse of dodgy landlords, empty streets and boarded-up shops. But the best political stories draw on the kind of optimism grounded in people\u2019s everyday experiences. To those who believe that Brexit Britain is an awful dystopia this may sound strange, but when I am out reporting these days, I do not tend to return full of misery. Talking to people about their experiences is often infuriating and upsetting. But I also usually marvel at the way that people work together, the capacity of communities to change things at the grassroots, and small kindnesses that bridge social divides. Beyond a belligerent Brexit hardcore, what millions of people essentially want seems simple enough \u2013 security, community, and some spirit of togetherness. When the pollster Deborah Mattinson recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/17/election-weary-voters-normal-politics\" title=\"\">asked</a> voters to fill in the blank in \u201cMake Britain \u2026 again\u201d, it was telling that they chose \u201ccalm\u201d, \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cone nation\u201d. People await something that can inspire their confidence that such modest hopes might be realised, and give them faith that the country might at last heal its wounds. Modern politics moves fast; the prevailing numbers may yet shift. But less than three weeks from polling day, what might turn this election from a distant spectacle into a watershed moment has yet to arrive. If you are involved in politics or brimming with the passions yet to grip most voters, do not blame the public for that absence: you have work to do, before it is too late.</p> \n<p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

But Corbyn has a clear story, of sorts: of a hapless, often hopeless country somehow taken prisoner by \u2013 to quote from his speech \u2013 \u201cthe bankers, the billionaires and the establishment\u201d, who may or may not be the same people as \u201cthe tax dodgers, the bad bosses and the big polluters\u201d. Citing Franklin Roosevelt, Corbyn suggested he \u201cwelcomes their hatred\u201d; the best way to start to make Britain fairer, it seems, is to draw them out of their mansions and expose them to as much public fury as possible. The logic behind this stuff is clear enough: it draws on the kind of textbook populism that has been in the ascendant for the past five years all over the world, and is mostly located on the right rather than the left. To the extent that it vividly talks about no end of very real inequalities and imbalances and identifies their alleged source, perhaps it will find an audience. But in a country wearied by the furies of Brexit and the shouting people see whenever they make the mistake of watching Question Time, I am not sure it speaks to what many people want from politics. After Nigel Farage\u2019s nastiness, Boris Johnson\u2019s brazen untruths, and the misanthropic nonsense that has been echoing out of the White House, it may sound like yet more faux-macho belligerence. For anyone on the left, this goes into something fundamental: can you really root progressive, hopeful, human politics in blame, resentment and loathing? There are other problems. Big, transformative ideas require dedicated effort, over years \u2013 the building of coalitions across society, and the kind of open, pluralistic mindset that too many Labour people seem to have long mislaid, and are hardly going to rediscover in three weeks flat. Boldness, moreover, always demands reassurance: convincing people that comparable things have been accomplished before and that they can therefore be done again (the essential message of \u201ctake back control\u201d, \u201cmake America great again\u201d, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s recent insistence that Bernie Sanders\u2019 run for the Democratic nomination is \u201cbringing the party home\u201d). Beyond the odd reference to the evils of Thatcherism and the usual fuzzy tributes to 1945, something is still lacking in Labour\u2019s thinking. Many people will see its plans for what Corbyn rather awkwardly calls an \u201cinvestment blitz\u201d as having fallen from the sky, when they ought to feel like the expression of things that are already woven into our past and present, waiting for the chance to be revived. Though Corbyn talks in terms of hope, his broad-sweep view of the country is too often reducible to an endless expanse of dodgy landlords, empty streets and boarded-up shops. But the best political stories draw on the kind of optimism grounded in people\u2019s everyday experiences. To those who believe that Brexit Britain is an awful dystopia this may sound strange, but when I am out reporting these days, I do not tend to return full of misery. Talking to people about their experiences is often infuriating and upsetting. But I also usually marvel at the way that people work together, the capacity of communities to change things at the grassroots, and small kindnesses that bridge social divides. Beyond a belligerent Brexit hardcore, what millions of people essentially want seems simple enough \u2013 security, community, and some spirit of togetherness. When the pollster Deborah Mattinson recently asked voters to fill in the blank in \u201cMake Britain \u2026 again\u201d, it was telling that they chose \u201ccalm\u201d, \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cone nation\u201d. People await something that can inspire their confidence that such modest hopes might be realised, and give them faith that the country might at last heal its wounds. Modern politics moves fast; the prevailing numbers may yet shift. But less than three weeks from polling day, what might turn this election from a distant spectacle into a watershed moment has yet to arrive. If you are involved in politics or brimming with the passions yet to grip most voters, do not blame the public for that absence: you have work to do, before it is too late. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

At the time of writing, more than 670,000 people under 34 registered to vote in the previous seven days.</p> <p>With the registration deadline only two days away, the Electoral Commission has made a final plea, telling people the process can be done while \u201cwaiting for the kettle to boil\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt only takes five minutes to register online,\u201d said Craig Westwood, the director of communication, policy and research at the Electoral Commission. \u201cIf you want to make sure your voice is heard, and you\u2019re not already registered, go online and register now.\u201d</p> <p>Online registration closes on midnight on Tuesday. Applications for post, postal proxy applications and for changes to existing postal or proxy votes need to be made by 5pm the same day.</p> <p>There are still up to 9.4 million people missing from the electoral roll. Without a huge final push, warned Willie Sullivan, the senior director (campaigns) at the <a href=\"https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/who-we-are/\">Electoral Reform Society</a>, many young people will be left out of the decision.</p> <p>\u201cThese new figures show just how tight this election could be and the importance of voters, particularly young people and other hard-to-reach groups, getting registered to vote,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Millennials \u2013 defined as people born between 1981 and 1996 \u2013 are significantly less likely to participate in electoral politics than older generations. Until recently, the UK had one of the largest gaps between the electoral participation of older and younger people of any developed country. </p> <p>All the seats identified in IF\u2019s research are highly marginal; the size of the incumbent\u2019s majority varies from only 20 in Labour-held Kensington to 2,690 in Conservative-controlled Corby. The 10 constituencies where new voters could make the biggest difference are Kensington, Dudley North, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Southampton (Itchen), Richmond Park, Crewe and Nantwich, Arfon, Ceredigion, and Canterbury.</p> <p>The statistical modelling also found that there are 28 marginal seats where the incumbent MP\u2019s majority is less than 10% of the number of potential voters aged between 18 and 34, with the Kensington constituency having the tightest margin.</p> <p>The latest polling data suggests that the very significant differences in how voters of different ages cast their ballots at the 2017 general election are likely to be maintained; <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/\">YouGov</a>, polling at the end of October, gave Labour a sizeable lead among potential voters aged 18 to 24.</p> <p>Although the specific situation will vary considerably from seat to seat, Hanton said, this suggests a higher turnout among new voters in any of these marginals would likely benefit Labour significantly more than it would the Conservatives.</p> <p>\u201cThis data is not meant to suggest either that first-time voters can dramatically shift the outcome of the whole election, or that those who live in safe constituencies shouldn\u2019t bother to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is merely meant to illustrate the point \u2026 that young people hold more power than probably either they, or for that matter many politicians, have realised, and like all voters their influence is magnified if they happen to live in a marginal seat,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\">Resolution Foundation</a>, said: \u201cThe average age of local residents is increasingly determining who represents them in Westminster. The oldest and youngest parliamentary constituencies have become safer for their respective parties in recent elections. The risk is that this causes the main parties to double down on their core bases \u2013 turning Labour into the millennials party and the Conservatives into the pensioner party.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "First-time voters could unseat their MP in 56 marginal seats across the country, according to an exclusive analysis of the 1.2m new electors who have come of age in England and Wales since the 2017 general election. Thirty of these seats are held by the Conservative party, 20 are held by Labour, four by the Liberal Democrats (almost a fifth of their seats) and two by Plaid Cymru. Of the 20 seats where the number of new voters exceeds the incumbent MP\u2019s majority by the biggest margin, nine belong to the Conservatives, nine to Labour, and two to Plaid Cymru, according to the statistical analysis by the Intergenerational Foundation (IF). \u201cUnder Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system some votes really are much more important than others; in any given election only a small minority of the most marginal constituencies actually change hands,\u201d said Angus Hanton, the co-founder of the IF. \u201cWinning British elections is about winning marginals.\u201d Last Friday, when the BBC hosted a leaders\u2019 debate, 206,011 young people under the age of 34 registered to vote \u2013 102,768 of whom were under 25, according to the most recent data. At the time of writing, more than 670,000 people under 34 registered to vote in the previous seven days. With the registration deadline only two days away, the Electoral Commission has made a final plea, telling people the process can be done while \u201cwaiting for the kettle to boil\u201d. \u201cIt only takes five minutes to register online,\u201d said Craig Westwood, the director of communication, policy and research at the Electoral Commission. \u201cIf you want to make sure your voice is heard, and you\u2019re not already registered, go online and register now.\u201d Online registration closes on midnight on Tuesday. Applications for post, postal proxy applications and for changes to existing postal or proxy votes need to be made by 5pm the same day. There are still up to 9.4 million people missing from the electoral roll. Without a huge final push, warned Willie Sullivan, the senior director (campaigns) at the Electoral Reform Society, many young people will be left out of the decision. \u201cThese new figures show just how tight this election could be and the importance of voters, particularly young people and other hard-to-reach groups, getting registered to vote,\u201d he said. Millennials \u2013 defined as people born between 1981 and 1996 \u2013 are significantly less likely to participate in electoral politics than older generations. Until recently, the UK had one of the largest gaps between the electoral participation of older and younger people of any developed country. All the seats identified in IF\u2019s research are highly marginal; the size of the incumbent\u2019s majority varies from only 20 in Labour-held Kensington to 2,690 in Conservative-controlled Corby. The 10 constituencies where new voters could make the biggest difference are Kensington, Dudley North, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Southampton (Itchen), Richmond Park, Crewe and Nantwich, Arfon, Ceredigion, and Canterbury. The statistical modelling also found that there are 28 marginal seats where the incumbent MP\u2019s majority is less than 10% of the number of potential voters aged between 18 and 34, with the Kensington constituency having the tightest margin. The latest polling data suggests that the very significant differences in how voters of different ages cast their ballots at the 2017 general election are likely to be maintained; YouGov, polling at the end of October, gave Labour a sizeable lead among potential voters aged 18 to 24. Although the specific situation will vary considerably from seat to seat, Hanton said, this suggests a higher turnout among new voters in any of these marginals would likely benefit Labour significantly more than it would the Conservatives. \u201cThis data is not meant to suggest either that first-time voters can dramatically shift the outcome of the whole election, or that those who live in safe constituencies shouldn\u2019t bother to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is merely meant to illustrate the point \u2026 that young people hold more power than probably either they, or for that matter many politicians, have realised, and like all voters their influence is magnified if they happen to live in a marginal seat,\u201d he said. Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThe average age of local residents is increasingly determining who represents them in Westminster. The oldest and youngest parliamentary constituencies have become safer for their respective parties in recent elections. The risk is that this causes the main parties to double down on their core bases \u2013 turning Labour into the millennials party and the Conservatives into the pensioner party.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Two men go head to head in a TV debate. They wrestle with Britain\u2019s relationship to Europe, the meaning of sovereignty, the nature of global influence, the question of job losses. They listen carefully to each other and respond to the other\u2019s points, fierce in defence of their arguments, but reasonable towards their opponent. It\u2019s an illuminating discussion that makes one appreciate the issues more deeply.</p> <p>No, not last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/jeremy-corbyn-boris-johnson-tv-debate-watched-by-67-million-people\" title=\"\">TV spat between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn</a> (as if!) but an hour-long debate on BBC\u2019s <em>Panorama</em> more than 40 years ago between <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zBFh6bpcMo\" title=\"\">Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins</a> in the run-up to the 1975 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the Common Market. Both were cabinet ministers in Harold Wilson\u2019s government, Jenkins an ardent supporter of membership, Benn a passionate opponent.</p> <p>What is striking about the debate is that it could have taken place last week \u2013 the issues at the heart of the Europe question have changed little over that time. What is striking, too, is that the 40-year-old encounter is more illuminating, on both sides, than most discussions we have had since 2016.</p> <p>Comparing the old Benn-Jenkins tussle with current political debates shows not just how shallow and vapid politics has become, but also how politicians\u2019 expectations of the electorate have been transformed. Benn and Jenkins took their audience seriously and so considered their arguments, and those of their opponent, with care.</p> <p>Today, political debates have become vacuous and insipid because politicians have become contemptuous of the electorate. Voters, many believe, are ignorant, swayed more by emotion than by reason, happy to accept lies and drawn to politicians with easy answers. So politicians prefer slogans to reasoned argument, dismiss scrutiny as \u201cpartisanship\u201d and treat truth as if it were a form of entertainment. It\u2019s an approach rooted in a caricature of the electorate. It\u2019s also one shaped by a shift in the relationship between working-class voters, education and politics.</p> <p>In his magnificent book <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300088861/intellectual-life-british-working-classes\" title=\"\"><em>The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes</em></a>, Jonathan Rose traces the struggles of working people to educate themselves, from early autodidactism through education reform to the <a href=\"https://www.wea.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Workers\u2019 Educational Association</a> and the Open University. Drawing on memoirs, diaries, oral history and social surveys, Rose provides \u201can intellectual history of people who were not expected to think for themselves\u201d.</p> <p>The miners\u2019 institutes of south Wales, funded initially by a levy on wages, became \u201cone of the greatest networks of cultural institutions created by working people anywhere in the world\u201d. By 1934, there were more than 100 miners\u2019 libraries in the Welsh coalfield with an average stock of 3,000 books.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Such reading provided not just cultural ballast but political hope, expanding horizons limited by the factory or mine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another triumph of the autodidact tradition was the <a href=\"http://www.everymanslibrary.co.uk/history.aspx\" title=\"\">Everyman\u2019s Library</a>, launched in 1906 by J\u2009M Dent, the 10th child of a Darlington house-painter, who left school aged 13, became a bookbinder and eventually a publisher, whose dream had always been to ensure that \u201cfor a few shillings the reader may have a whole bookshelf of the immortals\u201d. Everyman\u2019s Library did not publish just obvious works that might appeal, such as Dickens or Shakespeare, but such \u201clengthy and intimidating\u201d works as George Grote\u2019s 12-volume <em>History of Greece</em> and six volumes of Ibsen, all of which found a ready audience.

      "bodyText": "Two men go head to head in a TV debate. They wrestle with Britain\u2019s relationship to Europe, the meaning of sovereignty, the nature of global influence, the question of job losses. They listen carefully to each other and respond to the other\u2019s points, fierce in defence of their arguments, but reasonable towards their opponent. It\u2019s an illuminating discussion that makes one appreciate the issues more deeply. No, not last week\u2019s TV spat between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn (as if!) but an hour-long debate on BBC\u2019s Panorama more than 40 years ago between Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins in the run-up to the 1975 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the Common Market. Both were cabinet ministers in Harold Wilson\u2019s government, Jenkins an ardent supporter of membership, Benn a passionate opponent. What is striking about the debate is that it could have taken place last week \u2013 the issues at the heart of the Europe question have changed little over that time. What is striking, too, is that the 40-year-old encounter is more illuminating, on both sides, than most discussions we have had since 2016. Comparing the old Benn-Jenkins tussle with current political debates shows not just how shallow and vapid politics has become, but also how politicians\u2019 expectations of the electorate have been transformed. Benn and Jenkins took their audience seriously and so considered their arguments, and those of their opponent, with care. Today, political debates have become vacuous and insipid because politicians have become contemptuous of the electorate. Voters, many believe, are ignorant, swayed more by emotion than by reason, happy to accept lies and drawn to politicians with easy answers. So politicians prefer slogans to reasoned argument, dismiss scrutiny as \u201cpartisanship\u201d and treat truth as if it were a form of entertainment. It\u2019s an approach rooted in a caricature of the electorate. It\u2019s also one shaped by a shift in the relationship between working-class voters, education and politics. In his magnificent book The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes, Jonathan Rose traces the struggles of working people to educate themselves, from early autodidactism through education reform to the Workers\u2019 Educational Association and the Open University. Drawing on memoirs, diaries, oral history and social surveys, Rose provides \u201can intellectual history of people who were not expected to think for themselves\u201d. The miners\u2019 institutes of south Wales, funded initially by a levy on wages, became \u201cone of the greatest networks of cultural institutions created by working people anywhere in the world\u201d. By 1934, there were more than 100 miners\u2019 libraries in the Welsh coalfield with an average stock of 3,000 books. Another triumph of the autodidact tradition was the Everyman\u2019s Library, launched in 1906 by J\u2009M Dent, the 10th child of a Darlington house-painter, who left school aged 13, became a bookbinder and eventually a publisher, whose dream had always been to ensure that \u201cfor a few shillings the reader may have a whole bookshelf of the immortals\u201d. Everyman\u2019s Library did not publish just obvious works that might appeal, such as Dickens or Shakespeare, but such \u201clengthy and intimidating\u201d works as George Grote\u2019s 12-volume History of Greece and six volumes of Ibsen, all of which found a ready audience. Such reading provided not just cultural ballast but political hope, too, revealing the possibility of new worlds, and expanding horizons that might have been limited by the factory or the mine. \u201cThe Labour movement,\u201d a Coventry millworker observed, \u201cgrew out of mutual improvement societies.\u201d It was a tradition sustained by communities that helped cultivate dignity, organisations that nurtured the spirit of self-improvement, collective struggles that enlarged the range of the possible. Much of that has disappeared. The dislocation of working-class communities, the destruction of Labour movement organisations and the expunging of trade union struggles have all unstitched the relationship between knowledge and political change. Education today, as the political scientist David Runciman has observed, \u201csorts us according to where we feel we belong\u201d. As western societies have become more technocratic, \u201cempowering a new class of experts, for whom education is a prerequisite of entry into the elite\u201d \u2013 bankers, lawyers, doctors, civil servants, pundits, academics \u2013 so knowledge no longer seems to \u201cspeak for itself\u201d but \u201cfor the world view of the people who possess it\u201d. Knowledge, instead, becomes a marker of the place one possesses in society. This has led one side to deride \u201cexperts\u201d, the other to view the electorate as ignorant and incapable of deep reasoning. That a 40-year-old debate is more clarifying about Brexit than one held last week reveals the degree to which politics has become hollowed out. We should take care that the contempt shown to the electorate does not become a self-fulfilling prophecy. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

Most of the financial sector (close to 80%) fuels finance, insurance and real estate rather than the productive capacity of the economy. And overall, the economy is not growing through investment, but private debt-fuelled consumption, putting the ratio of private debt to disposable income back at the level it was before the crisis. And that, not public debt, caused it.</p> <p>This means we need to shift gear if we are to avoid another crisis, and fuel the economy through investment. Interest rates are low, but rather than investing in easy \u201cshovel-ready projects\u201d, there is an opportunity to use the array of policy tools to transform the economy towards investment and innovation with a green direction.</p> <p>In this respect, the Labour party should be applauded for talking about a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d. But a real green new deal, one that moves the economy from being extractive to one that is productive with a green direction, cannot be half-hearted. The initial plans for net-zero emissions by 2030 were disappointingly watered down.</p> <p>But the 10-year green transformation fund is a good start and will cost \u00a325bn a year. The problem is not one of short-run cost but whether its structure will create long-term growth and profit opportunities, upgrading energy, transport and other networks. The ambition must be to create a green trajectory in all sectors and this is best done not necessarily via nationalisations but by getting symbiotic (versus parasitic) \u201cdeals\u201d. An example of this saw the German steel industry lower its material content through conditions that the government set. So, here too, there should be fewer backroom deals, fewer handouts and more transformation with a public purpose.</p> <p>Labour is also planning to spend \u00a330bn a year in a social transformation fund to put back into the NHS, schools and social services the money that was siphoned out from 10 years of austerity. The levels of homelessness and teenage knife crime are an embarrassment to the pretence of being a civilised country. Beyond the cost to human lives it also makes poor long-run economic sense as it costs more to imprison someone than to educate them</p> <p>Between now and the election, the debate should be less about the \u201cmoney tree\u201d accusation and more about the detail of the plans. Policies should be lined up towards concrete societal goals, and increasing the expectations of future growth opportunities by business is key to getting the economy on track.</p> <p>Business must also pay its fair share of tax, but the narrative must move from a punitive one to one that is really win-win: invest in people so they can all create value, invest in communities so they flourish, invest in innovation to stimulate productivity and give it all a green direction.
