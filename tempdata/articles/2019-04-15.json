Over the past few weeks, a project that began in part as a joke among tired Chinese developers has turned into a nationwide debate about work culture and a rare protest against practices at some of the country\u2019s largest companies. In late March, a group of developers started a project on the code-sharing platform Github called \u201c996.icu\u201d \u2013 a reference to a comment by a programmer that working such a schedule could land an employee in the intensive care unit. The discussion gained momentum, as users added to a blacklist of more than 150 companies that push their staff to work excessive hours, posting evidence of unpaid, often compulsory or heavily encouraged overtime. According to Chinese law, businesses should not allow their staff to work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week, and overtime is restricted to 36 hours a month. But former and current employees of companies included on the blacklist \u2013 including Bytedance, the creator of the video app TikTok, Huawei and the e-commerce platform Pinduoduo \u2013 say such laws are regularly flouted. Users have uploaded screenshots of conversations where employers ask them to work late in the evening. Each company listed is given a number for the type of hours they tend to push, in some cases beyond the 996 work schedule. Ant Financial, a financial services company affiliated with Alibaba, is listed as having a \u201c9106\u201d work schedule \u2013 starting at 9am, ending at 10pm, for six days a week. In another case, staff at a software firm in Shandong province said they were required to work more than 100 hours of overtime in a month. The long hours at Chinese tech firms are a relatively new development as China\u2019s tech industry has expanded with startups modelling themselves more after those in Silicon Valley. Chinese tech companies are known for encouraging an obsession with work: Huawei reportedly promotes an aggressive, cut-throat \u201cwolf culture\u201d among its ranks. Chinese tech executives have defended the long hours at their companies. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, one of the companies included in the blacklist, called the 996 schedule \u201ca huge blessing\u201d and said workers should consider it an honour rather than a burden. \u201cIf you join Alibaba, you should get ready to work 12 hours a day. Otherwise why did you come to Alibaba? We don\u2019t need those who comfortably work eight hours,\u201d he said, according to comments posted on the company\u2019s Wechat account on Friday. Richard Liu, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce company JD.com, also defended the 996 schedule. In a note on Friday, Liu recalled how in the early days of the company he would wake up every two hours so that he could offer customers a 24-hour service. Liu said that since then, the number of \u201cslackers\u201d in his company had grown. \u201cIf this carries on, JD will have no hope and the company will be heartlessly kicked out of the market! Slackers are not my brothers.\u201d As China\u2019s economy has slowed and bubbles have emerged in the tech sector, more employees are starting to reconsider the merits of working long hours. \u201cThey [employees] were willing to accept long hours when business was good and they were being well rewarded but that is not the case any more. Staff are being laid off and pay is stagnating so staff are less willing to work as hard,\u201d said Geoffrey Crothall of China Labour Bulletin. The debate has spread across Chinese social media, where many users have criticised the tech industry\u2019s work culture as \u201cinhumane\u201d. Even Chinese state media has weighed in. In an editorial on Sunday the People\u2019s Daily said: \u201cEmployees who object to 996 cannot be labelled as \u2018slackers\u2019 or \u2018not fighters\u2019. Their real needs should be considered.\u201d The topic has also prompted a broader debate about the kind of work-life balance \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 engendered by Chinese companies. One user commented on the discussion forum Zhihu: \u201cMost of today\u2019s companies are machines that cannot stop running. We are all screws on top. If the screw is rusty, just polish it, put a little lubricant on, then twist it on again and use it. If it breaks, they\u2019ll find a new screw to replace you. The machine cannot stop.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang.",

      "body": "<p>The twin pillars of Tory pro-Europeanism, the two men who defended that lonely cause in the Thatcher heyday and through the long trudge of the Major years, have responded very differently to Brexit. On one side stands Michael Heseltine, belated darling of the remainers, the lion in winter who won <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annaturley/status/1109537486689185793\" title=\"\">a deluge of Twitter love</a> for his speech before a vast crowd at last month\u2019s People\u2019s Vote rally, where he spoke lyrically of his lost European dream. And there, on the other, is Kenneth Clarke, 79 this summer, not in the House of Lords but still slugging it out as a working MP, on his feet asking pointed questions, moving amendments in nail-biting midnight sessions, even tabling the alternative Brexit proposal \u2013 continued membership of a customs union \u2013 that came closest to success, falling short by just three votes.</p> <p>It is not merely that Hezza, as Clarke calls him, has retired from the Commons while Clarke is still there: Father of the House, no less, in recognition of the fact that he has served continuously since 1970, a record matched only by Dennis Skinner. It also points to a deeper difference. Clarke is a devout pragmatist, an evangelical realist. Pro-European he may be, but that faith is trumped by his deference to \u201cthe real world\u201d, a phrase he uses no fewer than five times when the two of us meet in his corner office at Portcullis House.</p> <p>And so, while Heseltine or the next generation of (formerly) Conservative pro-Europeans such as Anna Soubry are holding out for a second referendum that might keep Britain in the EU, Clarke is committed to accepting reality, as he sees it. \u201cUnless and until I can see an opportunity of actually reversing Brexit and restoring a stable membership of the European Union, then in the real world I concentrate on minimising the damage,\u201d he says, sitting behind a desk that could only belong to Ken Clarke. (On it are several copies of the Nottingham Post; a cassette of Artie Shaw\u2019s greatest hits; and a small booklet that turns out to be the Rules and By-laws of the Garrick Club.) \u201cOnly an ideologue deals with the world as he would wish it to be, as opposed to the world as it is.\u201d When he recalls Edward Heath, the first Tory prime minister Clarke served as a frontbencher, he describes him as a \u201cfanatic pro-European\u201d. It is not a compliment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"04dd495ffa87c2ab89e2f4e63bdd5a0686893727\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04dd495ffa87c2ab89e2f4e63bdd5a0686893727/145_447_8543_5126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarke in his office, behind a desk that could only belong to him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clarke in his office, behind a desk that could only belong to him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is how Clarke, so vehement a pro-European he once championed Britain joining the euro, has found himself breaking from his one-time comrades in the cause, becoming instead an advocate of soft Brexit. It has made him that rare creature on the Conservative benches: a Europhile MP who has voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, filing into the aye lobby against the ultras who dismiss it as not Brexity enough and the remainers who see it as too Brexity to stomach.</p> <p>It has been lonely for the former chancellor, former home secretary and serially defeated Tory leadership candidate. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so annoyed by the fact that nobody\u2019s been able to compromise: everybody votes everything else down apart from their own perfect solution. I have made a very considerable compromise.\u201d</p> <p>It has been compromise upon compromise for him. When he proposed his customs union amendment, he did it with no love or enthusiasm. It was, he admitted, no more than a \u201clowest common denominator\u201d. For one thing, it called only for <em>a</em> customs union. \u201cAgain, pragmatic old me, not <em>the</em> customs union.\u201d</p> <p>He knows that\u2019s not good enough. \u201cI personally am desperately anxious that we stay in the single market for economic reasons. And I think we should retain the closest links we can, politically, and within the fields of security and criminal justice enforcement and so on. But it was a start. At least it didn\u2019t exclude anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Why not hold out for the big prize, of staying in the EU? Winning a second referendum would deliver that, and then he wouldn\u2019t have to compromise. The great European project that has dominated his working life could live on. \u201cGreat friends of mine, political friends as well as personal friends, like Michael and Anna, are convinced that another referendum can save us the whole thing,\u201d he concedes. But he just can\u2019t bring himself to join them. \u201cI think referendums are ridiculous. One opinion poll with a simple yes/no answer to a question that contains hundreds of complex questions. Referendums are designed to get round parliamentary government, and people only demand referendums when they think they can\u2019t get a majority in parliament.\u201d He takes a breath. \u201cMussolini was the most brilliant practitioner of referendums.\u201d</p> <p>But no one\u2019s urging Clarke to become a habitual user of referendums. Just one, to deal with the mess left by the last one. \u201cJust one they think they might win,\u201d he says of the second referendum crowd, warming to his theme, talking over several attempts I make to interject, although doing it with that trademark laugh in his voice that ensures he never seems rude \u2013 a technique that made him one of the Conservatives\u2019 most effective messengers on the airwaves for four decades. \u201cUnless remain won by an enormous majority, I don\u2019t think it would solve anything. I think it would just lead to bitter, angry division, which is already there among the public. I think the campaigning would almost certainly be as silly as it was last time.\u201d</p> <p>However much Brexit appals him, referendums seem to appal him more. Throughout our conversation, he refers to the ballot of 23 June 2016 as \u201cone opinion poll\u201d. In which case, should parliament simply have ignored the vote to leave, carrying on as if nothing had happened? Seriously, if he were in charge, what would he have said to the British electorate the day after they had voted for Brexit?</p> <p>\u201cSomehow I would have to say: \u2018Well, it\u2019s not quite as simple as that. Leaving the EU probably isn\u2019t going to make the faintest difference to most of the things that so annoy you. What I will take on board is that you feel so angry about the ruling class and politicians, and the establishment and so on.\u2019 Because anger was the main emotion let loose by the referendum campaign and since.\u201d</p> <p>Which is not to say he is dismissive of those who voted leave or what motivated them. He links the leave vote to \u201cwhat\u2019s going wrong in every western democracy: Trump, the yellow jackets, anarchists in Italy\u201d. He explains: \u201cWe achieved considerable economic success from the 1980s, 1990s, onwards, which hugely advantaged the young, the educated and the entrepreneurial. We neglected that bulk of the population being left behind and living in post-industrial towns where their living standards were static or falling. And the new globalised economy, the rules-based order, the digital revolution meant nothing to them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4da6b3ad05b422b2fac34f80ad1d5b0d3d94f8f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4da6b3ad05b422b2fac34f80ad1d5b0d3d94f8f2/0_75_5149_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarke (left) in 1985 with Norman Tebbit and Margaret Thatcher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clarke (left) in 1985 with Norman Tebbit and Margaret Thatcher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople want scapegoats: they blame foreigners and immigrants. You know, for Trump, it\u2019s all the fault of the Mexicans. For the British, it\u2019s all the fault of Brussels. Now, I blame the political class to which I belong \u2013 the establishment, of which I was undoubtedly a member \u2013 for failing to see this coming.\u201d</p> <p>So he does include himself in this failure? Yes, he says. \u201cI did not see it coming.\u201d He represents \u201cthe prosperous part\u201d of Nottinghamshire, where the schools were good and house prices were high. But in the old mining towns, the signs were there. He admits he should have seen them earlier.</p> <p>Still, others bear the chief blame for the current nightmare. He looks back on what will soon be a half-century in parliament and notes what he calls \u201cthe symmetry of my career: I started the year we were joining the European Union, I\u2019m finishing when it looks as though we\u2019re leaving\u201d, and thinks he was lucky that his time coincided with EU membership, a period when Britain at last discovered its role in the world: \u201cWe found our vocation as a European power.\u201d But then came that dreaded opinion poll, as he calls it, in 2016. \u201cThe whole thing\u2019s been thrown away by a silly whim of David Cameron, who thought he\u2019d get some short-term, party political advantage by running this stunt.\u201d</p> <p>What about May herself, whom he famously was caught calling a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/ken-clarke-caught-camera-ridiculing-tory-leadership-candidates-theresa-may-michael-gove\" title=\"\">\u201cbloody difficult woman\u201d</a>? \u201cShe is a bloody difficult woman, because she gets fixed ideas in her head, she sticks to them stubbornly. But I say that with some praise.\u201d So we shouldn\u2019t blame her for this mess? \u201cOh, it\u2019s not Theresa\u2019s fault. She has walked into the biggest collection of political problems facing any prime minister in my lifetime, with the possible exception of Clement Attlee. Most of them would have been overwhelmed by what she inherited. And she has qualities, among them the rather stubborn doggedness and sense of duty of a traditional home counties Tory lady.\u201d</p> <p>He refers to Attlee several times: \u201cQuite a hero of mine.\u201d He has praise for Tony Blair, too, as \u201ca good prime minister who made one catastrophic mistake which I bitterly opposed, the invasion of Iraq.\u201d How might Blair have handled Brexit? \u201cHe had the political skills; he might well have made a better job of it.\u201d John Major, meanwhile, \u201cwould have been worried sick by it\u201d. But at the top of the list is the woman he served for so long: \u201cMargaret was the best prime minister of my lifetime. Mythology has turned Thatcher into someone regarded either as a goddess by her supporters or an evil witch by her opponents. She was a very pragmatic, rather odd, distinctive, determined woman with very, very forceful leadership qualities and absolute determination which might have got her through.\u201d It\u2019s a surprise to hear Clarke describe Thatcher as \u201cpragmatic\u201d. One more reason why he says: \u201cTheresa May is no Margaret Thatcher.\u201d</p> <p>What would Thatcher have done? The very thought of it makes Clarke smile. Watching her wrestle with Brexit would, he says, have been \u201cquite something\u201d. He\u2019s quite clear on one thing, though. \u201cShe was never in favour of leaving the European Union. She got exploited by hardline Eurosceptics in her dotage. When she was in office she was very pro-Europe economically, [even if] deeply suspicious of political Europe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ea441f940374461670ad80405d1c27f9b80f5e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ea441f940374461670ad80405d1c27f9b80f5e6/0_84_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarke (right) in 1999 with then prime minister Tony Blair (centre) and Michael Heseltine at the launch of a cross-party Britain in Europe campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clarke (right) in 1999 with then prime minister Tony Blair (centre) and Michael Heseltine at the launch of a cross-party Britain in Europe campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How would she have voted in 2016? \u201cShe would have voted remain, just as she campaigned very heavily to remain\u201d in the 1975 referendum. True, she had a \u201cbad temper towards Europe towards the end\u201d but that was \u201cbecause she got on very badly with [German chancellor Helmut] Kohl and [French president Fran\u00e7ois] Mitterrand, who patronised her \u2026 They weren\u2019t quite ready for a woman being their political equal, which she certainly was.\u201d</p> <p>Yet another Tory leadership election is looming; Clarke must have lost count of the number he has witnessed. He won\u2019t say who he likes: \u201cThat would be the kiss of death.\u201d Intriguingly, he tells me he has spotted \u201csome very substantial men and women\u201d on both the Labour and Tory benches among those elected in 2010. They\u2019re the ones to watch.</p> <p>All this talk of leaders and leadership nudges us towards the fact that he never made it himself, despite attempts in 1997, 2001 and 2005. What kind of prime minister would he have been? \u201cSometimes kind people put me in the category of good prime ministers we might have had. It\u2019s a very good club to be in. Denis Healey, Roy Jenkins, Rab Butler, Geoffrey Howe. And I will say it\u2019s the best club to be in because nobody ever knows how bad you would have been if you\u2019d ever done it.\u201d He will say this, though. \u201cI would have enjoyed it. That was one thing that would distinguish me from John Major: whatever else I\u2019d have done, I\u2019d have been determined to enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>I hesitate before making the next suggestion, although his response tells me I needn\u2019t have worried. Is it possible that he\u2019s enjoying, if only a little bit, Brexit itself? After all, it revolves around the great cause of his life; it is pure, compelling drama; and he is at the centre of it. Some politicians would be offended by such a thought, or at least affect to be. Not Clarke.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hugely entertaining, if it were not so deadly serious. Oh, for a political addict, there\u2019s nothing more fascinating than the bizarre, day-by-day, incompetent manoeuvrings that are going on. It\u2019s like a parody version of student politics. The trouble is, the subject matter is of desperate importance to the wellbeing of next generations \u2026 I take an extremely active part in parliament not just \u2019cause I\u2019m indulging myself as an old parliamentarian who\u2019s got hooked on it. But because I\u2019m actually having an opportunity \u2013 a privilege \u2013 of taking part in the public debate on vitally important things that matter a lot to me. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s doing me a power of good: it\u2019s very therapeutic to a man approaching his 80th year and all that.\u201d</p> <p>Therapeutic seems the right word. Clarke was widowed in 2015, losing Gillian, his wife of more than 50 years, with whom he had two children. Does that help explain his decision not to retire from parliament, fighting for re-election in 2017 despite making some earlier noises about standing down?</p> <p>\u201cI normally avoid getting too personal in interviews, but my advice to all my friends who find themselves bereaved is: the best way of coping with bereavement is to keep yourself busy. Do not become a recluse, feeling sorry for yourself. Try to get busier than you usually are. That\u2019s not the reason I\u2019ve stayed in politics \u2013 I\u2019m just an addict \u2013 but I think it helps. I think it helped me cope with the bereavement that I remained so absorbed and so obsessed on a daily basis with my political life, yes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3af6dba6723b109a20ccec3c6a147703d189225a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3af6dba6723b109a20ccec3c6a147703d189225a/0_271_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarke with Theresa May at Tory party conference in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clarke with Theresa May at Tory party conference in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our time is nearly up. Clarke gamely agrees to pose for the photographer with an unlit cigar: maverick, he might be, but he\u2019s not going to light up in his office. It strikes me that the difference between him and Heseltine might not just be Clarke\u2019s get-on-with-it pragmatism, but that speaking of heartbreak at the loss of something he cherished for half a century \u2013 whether it\u2019s a marriage or the European dream \u2013 is just not him.</p> <p>So he will confess to feeling \u201cdispirited and annoyed\u201d by Brexit, infuriated by it and by a \u201cpolitical establishment that is spectacularly weak and unable to cope with the crisis we\u2019ve created\u201d, but he does not become elegiac. It is a matter of temperament. \u201cI\u2019m so laid-back that I\u2019m almost horizontal, is how I would describe myself. I\u2019m a naturally cheery and gregarious guy.\u201d</p> <p>He collects his things; he has dinner plans. I assume there\u2019s a function to attend, maybe black tie, perhaps a speech to give. Not tonight, he says. He has a weekly semi-appointment to keep at the Kennington Tandoori: table for one, just him and a copy of the Economist. He\u2019s looking forward to it.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 May 2019 to clarify that Clarke\u2019s record of having voted for May\u2019s deal three times does not make him \u201crare\u201d among Tory MPs, the majority of whom have joined him in the aye lobby on each occasion.</p>",

And so, while Heseltine or the next generation of (formerly) Conservative pro-Europeans such as Anna Soubry are holding out for a second referendum that might keep Britain in the EU, Clarke is committed to accepting reality, as he sees it. \u201cUnless and until I can see an opportunity of actually reversing Brexit and restoring a stable membership of the European Union, then in the real world I concentrate on minimising the damage,\u201d he says, sitting behind a desk that could only belong to Ken Clarke. (On it are several copies of the Nottingham Post; a cassette of Artie Shaw\u2019s greatest hits; and a small booklet that turns out to be the Rules and By-laws of the Garrick Club.) \u201cOnly an ideologue deals with the world as he would wish it to be, as opposed to the world as it is.\u201d When he recalls Edward Heath, the first Tory prime minister Clarke served as a frontbencher, he describes him as a \u201cfanatic pro-European\u201d. It is not a compliment. This is how Clarke, so vehement a pro-European he once championed Britain joining the euro, has found himself breaking from his one-time comrades in the cause, becoming instead an advocate of soft Brexit. It has made him that rare creature on the Conservative benches: a Europhile MP who has voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, filing into the aye lobby against the ultras who dismiss it as not Brexity enough and the remainers who see it as too Brexity to stomach. It has been lonely for the former chancellor, former home secretary and serially defeated Tory leadership candidate. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so annoyed by the fact that nobody\u2019s been able to compromise: everybody votes everything else down apart from their own perfect solution. I have made a very considerable compromise.\u201d It has been compromise upon compromise for him. When he proposed his customs union amendment, he did it with no love or enthusiasm. It was, he admitted, no more than a \u201clowest common denominator\u201d. For one thing, it called only for a customs union. \u201cAgain, pragmatic old me, not the customs union.\u201d He knows that\u2019s not good enough. \u201cI personally am desperately anxious that we stay in the single market for economic reasons. And I think we should retain the closest links we can, politically, and within the fields of security and criminal justice enforcement and so on. But it was a start. At least it didn\u2019t exclude anything else.\u201d Why not hold out for the big prize, of staying in the EU? Winning a second referendum would deliver that, and then he wouldn\u2019t have to compromise. The great European project that has dominated his working life could live on. \u201cGreat friends of mine, political friends as well as personal friends, like Michael and Anna, are convinced that another referendum can save us the whole thing,\u201d he concedes. But he just can\u2019t bring himself to join them. \u201cI think referendums are ridiculous. One opinion poll with a simple yes/no answer to a question that contains hundreds of complex questions. Referendums are designed to get round parliamentary government, and people only demand referendums when they think they can\u2019t get a majority in parliament.\u201d He takes a breath. \u201cMussolini was the most brilliant practitioner of referendums.\u201d But no one\u2019s urging Clarke to become a habitual user of referendums. Just one, to deal with the mess left by the last one. \u201cJust one they think they might win,\u201d he says of the second referendum crowd, warming to his theme, talking over several attempts I make to interject, although doing it with that trademark laugh in his voice that ensures he never seems rude \u2013 a technique that made him one of the Conservatives\u2019 most effective messengers on the airwaves for four decades. \u201cUnless remain won by an enormous majority, I don\u2019t think it would solve anything. I think it would just lead to bitter, angry division, which is already there among the public. I think the campaigning would almost certainly be as silly as it was last time.\u201d However much Brexit appals him, referendums seem to appal him more. Throughout our conversation, he refers to the ballot of 23 June 2016 as \u201cone opinion poll\u201d. In which case, should parliament simply have ignored the vote to leave, carrying on as if nothing had happened? Seriously, if he were in charge, what would he have said to the British electorate the day after they had voted for Brexit? \u201cSomehow I would have to say: \u2018Well, it\u2019s not quite as simple as that. Leaving the EU probably isn\u2019t going to make the faintest difference to most of the things that so annoy you. What I will take on board is that you feel so angry about the ruling class and politicians, and the establishment and so on.\u2019 Because anger was the main emotion let loose by the referendum campaign and since.\u201d Which is not to say he is dismissive of those who voted leave or what motivated them. He links the leave vote to \u201cwhat\u2019s going wrong in every western democracy: Trump, the yellow jackets, anarchists in Italy\u201d. He explains: \u201cWe achieved considerable economic success from the 1980s, 1990s, onwards, which hugely advantaged the young, the educated and the entrepreneurial. We neglected that bulk of the population being left behind and living in post-industrial towns where their living standards were static or falling. And the new globalised economy, the rules-based order, the digital revolution meant nothing to them. \u201cPeople want scapegoats: they blame foreigners and immigrants. You know, for Trump, it\u2019s all the fault of the Mexicans. For the British, it\u2019s all the fault of Brussels. Now, I blame the political class to which I belong \u2013 the establishment, of which I was undoubtedly a member \u2013 for failing to see this coming.\u201d So he does include himself in this failure? Yes, he says. \u201cI did not see it coming.\u201d He represents \u201cthe prosperous part\u201d of Nottinghamshire, where the schools were good and house prices were high. But in the old mining towns, the signs were there. He admits he should have seen them earlier. Still, others bear the chief blame for the current nightmare. He looks back on what will soon be a half-century in parliament and notes what he calls \u201cthe symmetry of my career: I started the year we were joining the European Union, I\u2019m finishing when it looks as though we\u2019re leaving\u201d, and thinks he was lucky that his time coincided with EU membership, a period when Britain at last discovered its role in the world: \u201cWe found our vocation as a European power.\u201d But then came that dreaded opinion poll, as he calls it, in 2016. \u201cThe whole thing\u2019s been thrown away by a silly whim of David Cameron, who thought he\u2019d get some short-term, party political advantage by running this stunt.\u201d What about May herself, whom he famously was caught calling a \u201cbloody difficult woman\u201d? \u201cShe is a bloody difficult woman, because she gets fixed ideas in her head, she sticks to them stubbornly. But I say that with some praise.\u201d So we shouldn\u2019t blame her for this mess? \u201cOh, it\u2019s not Theresa\u2019s fault. She has walked into the biggest collection of political problems facing any prime minister in my lifetime, with the possible exception of Clement Attlee. Most of them would have been overwhelmed by what she inherited. And she has qualities, among them the rather stubborn doggedness and sense of duty of a traditional home counties Tory lady.\u201d He refers to Attlee several times: \u201cQuite a hero of mine.\u201d He has praise for Tony Blair, too, as \u201ca good prime minister who made one catastrophic mistake which I bitterly opposed, the invasion of Iraq.\u201d How might Blair have handled Brexit? \u201cHe had the political skills; he might well have made a better job of it.\u201d John Major, meanwhile, \u201cwould have been worried sick by it\u201d. But at the top of the list is the woman he served for so long: \u201cMargaret was the best prime minister of my lifetime. Mythology has turned Thatcher into someone regarded either as a goddess by her supporters or an evil witch by her opponents. She was a very pragmatic, rather odd, distinctive, determined woman with very, very forceful leadership qualities and absolute determination which might have got her through.\u201d It\u2019s a surprise to hear Clarke describe Thatcher as \u201cpragmatic\u201d. One more reason why he says: \u201cTheresa May is no Margaret Thatcher.\u201d What would Thatcher have done? The very thought of it makes Clarke smile. Watching her wrestle with Brexit would, he says, have been \u201cquite something\u201d. He\u2019s quite clear on one thing, though. \u201cShe was never in favour of leaving the European Union. She got exploited by hardline Eurosceptics in her dotage. When she was in office she was very pro-Europe economically, [even if] deeply suspicious of political Europe.\u201d How would she have voted in 2016? \u201cShe would have voted remain, just as she campaigned very heavily to remain\u201d in the 1975 referendum. True, she had a \u201cbad temper towards Europe towards the end\u201d but that was \u201cbecause she got on very badly with [German chancellor Helmut] Kohl and [French president Fran\u00e7ois] Mitterrand, who patronised her \u2026 They weren\u2019t quite ready for a woman being their political equal, which she certainly was.\u201d Yet another Tory leadership election is looming; Clarke must have lost count of the number he has witnessed. He won\u2019t say who he likes: \u201cThat would be the kiss of death.\u201d Intriguingly, he tells me he has spotted \u201csome very substantial men and women\u201d on both the Labour and Tory benches among those elected in 2010. They\u2019re the ones to watch. All this talk of leaders and leadership nudges us towards the fact that he never made it himself, despite attempts in 1997, 2001 and 2005. What kind of prime minister would he have been? \u201cSometimes kind people put me in the category of good prime ministers we might have had. It\u2019s a very good club to be in. Denis Healey, Roy Jenkins, Rab Butler, Geoffrey Howe. And I will say it\u2019s the best club to be in because nobody ever knows how bad you would have been if you\u2019d ever done it.\u201d He will say this, though. \u201cI would have enjoyed it. That was one thing that would distinguish me from John Major: whatever else I\u2019d have done, I\u2019d have been determined to enjoy it.\u201d I hesitate before making the next suggestion, although his response tells me I needn\u2019t have worried. Is it possible that he\u2019s enjoying, if only a little bit, Brexit itself? After all, it revolves around the great cause of his life; it is pure, compelling drama; and he is at the centre of it. Some politicians would be offended by such a thought, or at least affect to be. Not Clarke. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely entertaining, if it were not so deadly serious. Oh, for a political addict, there\u2019s nothing more fascinating than the bizarre, day-by-day, incompetent manoeuvrings that are going on. It\u2019s like a parody version of student politics. The trouble is, the subject matter is of desperate importance to the wellbeing of next generations \u2026 I take an extremely active part in parliament not just \u2019cause I\u2019m indulging myself as an old parliamentarian who\u2019s got hooked on it. But because I\u2019m actually having an opportunity \u2013 a privilege \u2013 of taking part in the public debate on vitally important things that matter a lot to me. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s doing me a power of good: it\u2019s very therapeutic to a man approaching his 80th year and all that.\u201d Therapeutic seems the right word. Clarke was widowed in 2015, losing Gillian, his wife of more than 50 years, with whom he had two children. Does that help explain his decision not to retire from parliament, fighting for re-election in 2017 despite making some earlier noises about standing down? \u201cI normally avoid getting too personal in interviews, but my advice to all my friends who find themselves bereaved is: the best way of coping with bereavement is to keep yourself busy. Do not become a recluse, feeling sorry for yourself. Try to get busier than you usually are. That\u2019s not the reason I\u2019ve stayed in politics \u2013 I\u2019m just an addict \u2013 but I think it helps. I think it helped me cope with the bereavement that I remained so absorbed and so obsessed on a daily basis with my political life, yes.\u201d Our time is nearly up. Clarke gamely agrees to pose for the photographer with an unlit cigar: maverick, he might be, but he\u2019s not going to light up in his office. It strikes me that the difference between him and Heseltine might not just be Clarke\u2019s get-on-with-it pragmatism, but that speaking of heartbreak at the loss of something he cherished for half a century \u2013 whether it\u2019s a marriage or the European dream \u2013 is just not him. So he will confess to feeling \u201cdispirited and annoyed\u201d by Brexit, infuriated by it and by a \u201cpolitical establishment that is spectacularly weak and unable to cope with the crisis we\u2019ve created\u201d, but he does not become elegiac. It is a matter of temperament. \u201cI\u2019m so laid-back that I\u2019m almost horizontal, is how I would describe myself. I\u2019m a naturally cheery and gregarious guy.\u201d He collects his things; he has dinner plans. I assume there\u2019s a function to attend, maybe black tie, perhaps a speech to give. Not tonight, he says. He has a weekly semi-appointment to keep at the Kennington Tandoori: table for one, just him and a copy of the Economist. He\u2019s looking forward to it. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 May 2019 to clarify that Clarke\u2019s record of having voted for May\u2019s deal three times does not make him \u201crare\u201d among Tory MPs, the majority of whom have joined him in the aye lobby on each occasion.",
