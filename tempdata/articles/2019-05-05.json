      "body": "<p>The latest gaffe by the Conservative education minister Theodore Agnew once again shows how tone-deaf the privileged are to the reality of those who face a bumpier ride. His attack on the policy of widening participation at universities (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/03/education-minister-brands-lowering-of-a-level-grades-as-lunacy\" title=\"\">It\u2019s lunacy to let students into universities with E grades, says minister</a>, 4 May) effectively amounts to a writing off of millions of people at 18.</p> <p>There is plenty of evidence about how well students from state schools do at university compared to their privately educated peers: last month it was revealed that a quarter of students with A-level grades below three Ds achieved a first at university. This should be celebrated, not denigrated.</p> <p>We should be encouraging students to aspire to university and taking their individual circumstances into account, not running down their achievements or turning away those who potentially could benefit most from higher education.<br><strong>Matt Waddup</strong><br><em>Head of policy and campaigns, University and College Union</em></p> <p>\u2022 As someone who achieved a D and an E at A-level and is now a university lecturer, I must take issue with Theodore Agnew\u2019s comments to the private schools\u2019 conference. I went to one of the private schools Agnew praises. It was educationally poor, many of the teachers were not qualified, and it was rife with snobbery and bullying. I stopped trying academically because hardly anyone was encouraging me.

      "bodyText": "The latest gaffe by the Conservative education minister Theodore Agnew once again shows how tone-deaf the privileged are to the reality of those who face a bumpier ride. His attack on the policy of widening participation at universities (It\u2019s lunacy to let students into universities with E grades, says minister, 4 May) effectively amounts to a writing off of millions of people at 18. There is plenty of evidence about how well students from state schools do at university compared to their privately educated peers: last month it was revealed that a quarter of students with A-level grades below three Ds achieved a first at university. This should be celebrated, not denigrated. We should be encouraging students to aspire to university and taking their individual circumstances into account, not running down their achievements or turning away those who potentially could benefit most from higher education. Matt Waddup Head of policy and campaigns, University and College Union \u2022 As someone who achieved a D and an E at A-level and is now a university lecturer, I must take issue with Theodore Agnew\u2019s comments to the private schools\u2019 conference. I went to one of the private schools Agnew praises. It was educationally poor, many of the teachers were not qualified, and it was rife with snobbery and bullying. I stopped trying academically because hardly anyone was encouraging me. I scraped into what was then Christchurch College Canterbury and emerged after three happy years with a 2:1. My passion for teaching has been driven in part by my experience of the demoralising effects of bad teaching.

      "body": "<p>Last Friday morning, my head spun. Having voted in two local elections \u2013 for our town and district councils \u2013 and then spent the first few hours of the next day following the results, my partner and I got our polling cards for yet another contest.

God knows what the poor souls who have diligently served as MEPs must feel about this sudden gatecrashing of their world: here is yet another woeful instalment of the Brexit drama, now replayed by celebrity leave and remain campaigners as a pantomime of futile gestures.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If councils are to attract and retain new people, they need not warm words, but meaningful power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The local elections in England (and Northern Ireland), by contrast, were mundane but altogether more worthwhile. Politics now moves so quickly that basing credible predictions for national politics on local contests is something of a mug\u2019s game: think back to 2017, when Labour got thumped in council contests, only to pull off that minor miracle at the general election. But in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/03/tories-lose-over-1200-seats-in-local-elections-as-major-parties-suffer\" title=\"\">huge losses suffered by the Tories</a>, widespread Labour failure, surges for the Lib Dems and Greens, and a huge increase in support for independents \u2013 not to mention the fact that many places <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnestevens/status/1124288114099392512\" title=\"\">had mountains of spoilt ballot papers</a> \u2013 there was a clear enough picture: of a seething, quicksilver politics that mutates at speed, with everything now infused with the cultural and political tensions brought to a head by Brexit.</p> <p>As the resulting noise dies down, the lucky winners will be faced once again with the basic fact of modern local government. The austerity imposed on councils for about a decade is grinding on, and the room for effective politics remains far too small. And woven into this grimness is another big problem. In 2004, 96.5% of local councillors in England were white; according to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-47947867\" title=\"\">recent figures,</a> published just before last week\u2019s elections, the figure was 95.8%. The same stats suggested that over a quarter of councillors were aged over 70, up from 14% 15 years ago, and half were over 60. Two-thirds were men.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/30/abuse-long-hours-and-pitiful-pay-younger-councillors-abandon-local-politics\" title=\"\">the Guardian told the stories</a> of a handful of councillors who were about to stand down. They were \u201cmainly people in their 30s who have risen to run councils with budgets of \u00a3100m or more\u201d. They spoke of laughably meagre pay and serious stress \u2013 now made worse by a clear shift in public attitudes towards even local politicians. The outgoing Tory leader of Pendle council in east Lancashire, who has been paid a princely \u00a36,500 a year, pinned the blame on Brexit: \u201cWe were given a yes-or-no decision, and everything now is right or wrong. There\u2019s nothing in the middle now \u2026 I think that\u2019s what\u2019s made the whole atmosphere of politics horrific, actually.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f9ef991fff1d5daea30e138e5a9f108f73f89d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f9ef991fff1d5daea30e138e5a9f108f73f89d5/0_2595_4701_2819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leeds civic hall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The biggest recent news about childhood obesity came not from the Department of Health, but a programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/02/leeds-lower-child-obesity-henry\">created in Leeds</a>.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having read his story, I had a long conversation with one of the people who represents my own community: Martin Dimery, a 62-year-old former drama teacher who is one of two Green party representatives on Somerset county council, having heroically beaten the Tories in 2017 by a margin of four votes.

      "bodyText": "Last Friday morning, my head spun. Having voted in two local elections \u2013 for our town and district councils \u2013 and then spent the first few hours of the next day following the results, my partner and I got our polling cards for yet another contest. This caused a brief fit of amusement about Brexit Britain\u2019s weird addiction to sending us to polling stations, before we realised we had effectively received our tickets for an awful reality TV show. Thanks chiefly to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party and the pithily named Change UK \u2013 the Independent Group \u2013 many of the contestants in the looming European elections form a rum old crowd. From a former BBC newsreader, through superannuated Tories and newspaper columnists, on to the former editor of the lads\u2019 magazine Loaded, with the independent candidate who calls himself Tommy Robinson as the rubbish punchline. God knows what the poor souls who have diligently served as MEPs must feel about this sudden gatecrashing of their world: here is yet another woeful instalment of the Brexit drama, now replayed by celebrity leave and remain campaigners as a pantomime of futile gestures. The local elections in England (and Northern Ireland), by contrast, were mundane but altogether more worthwhile. Politics now moves so quickly that basing credible predictions for national politics on local contests is something of a mug\u2019s game: think back to 2017, when Labour got thumped in council contests, only to pull off that minor miracle at the general election. But in the huge losses suffered by the Tories, widespread Labour failure, surges for the Lib Dems and Greens, and a huge increase in support for independents \u2013 not to mention the fact that many places had mountains of spoilt ballot papers \u2013 there was a clear enough picture: of a seething, quicksilver politics that mutates at speed, with everything now infused with the cultural and political tensions brought to a head by Brexit. As the resulting noise dies down, the lucky winners will be faced once again with the basic fact of modern local government. The austerity imposed on councils for about a decade is grinding on, and the room for effective politics remains far too small. And woven into this grimness is another big problem. In 2004, 96.5% of local councillors in England were white; according to recent figures, published just before last week\u2019s elections, the figure was 95.8%. The same stats suggested that over a quarter of councillors were aged over 70, up from 14% 15 years ago, and half were over 60. Two-thirds were men. Last week, the Guardian told the stories of a handful of councillors who were about to stand down. They were \u201cmainly people in their 30s who have risen to run councils with budgets of \u00a3100m or more\u201d. They spoke of laughably meagre pay and serious stress \u2013 now made worse by a clear shift in public attitudes towards even local politicians. The outgoing Tory leader of Pendle council in east Lancashire, who has been paid a princely \u00a36,500 a year, pinned the blame on Brexit: \u201cWe were given a yes-or-no decision, and everything now is right or wrong. There\u2019s nothing in the middle now \u2026 I think that\u2019s what\u2019s made the whole atmosphere of politics horrific, actually.\u201d Having read his story, I had a long conversation with one of the people who represents my own community: Martin Dimery, a 62-year-old former drama teacher who is one of two Green party representatives on Somerset county council, having heroically beaten the Tories in 2017 by a margin of four votes. He told me about his key role in such small victories as the council\u2019s decision to move away from single-use plastic, as well as hard work on pushing the ruling Conservatives to stop proposed cuts to education for disabled children. When I mentioned hostility from the public, he emitted a mirthless laugh: \u201cI\u2019ve had people slamming the door on me recently. They say: \u2018You\u2019ve betrayed the country because of Brexit.\u2019 You\u2019re just another person standing there with a rosette, and they tell you they don\u2019t trust you.\u201d At the heart of the crisis in local politics is a deep contradiction. For 15 years at least, Westminster politicians have habitually talked up somehow reviving local government. But power has continued to be snatched from people on the ground. (Consider, for example, the story of how elected local politicians have been shoved out of any control or oversight of state education.) Meanwhile austerity has ensured that helpless local politicians are answerable for nonsensical policies authored by Westminster, just as our exit from the EU and the noise made by moronic opportunists has poisoned debate at every level. Yet here is the fascinating thing. Despite cuts, crises and the sense that far too many councils are locked into decline, there is some cause for hope. The realisation that central government is too remote to solve a whole host of problems, and most things are best dealt with at the most local level, feels like it has become unanswerable: something highlighted not just by failures at the top (picture the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, and the point will instantly become clear), but by a host of trailblazing examples of how to do things differently. The biggest recent news about childhood obesity came not from the Department of Health, but a programme created in Leeds. The new Labour party is setting great store by the so-called Preston model, whereby that city\u2019s council is boosting the local economy by using its financial clout to help local business. If you want to know about the cutting edge of regeneration, it is best to talk to people who have either created local success stories or are trying to, in Manchester, Plymouth or Doncaster. This continuing revolution, moreover, is not restricted to big places. Where I live, in the 25,000-population town of Frome, the coalition of independents in charge of the town council \u2013 who last week won all 17 of its seats, a feat they pulled off for the second time \u2013 have spent eight years encouraging sustainable transport, assisting local charities and helping to ease the realities of poverty and inequality.

When one of the major parties plunged, the other soared. A terrible day for the Tories would be a triumphant day for Labour and vice versa.</p> <p>This previously reliable rule is one of the many that has been unravelled by Brexit. It is now possible for both the major parties and their leaders to be in crisis at the same time. It is also possible for neither party to be able to agree how to extract themselves from their respective emergencies. The latest evidence of this is provided by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/may/02/local-elections-2019-live-results-for-english-councils\" title=\"\">local elections</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/03/local-elections-five-things-we-have-learned-so-far\" title=\"\">conflicting responses</a> of both Tories and Labour people to results that were harrowing for each.</p> <p>You can assign different weights to the complex factors in play during these contests at the risk of getting lost in thickets of analysis. Keep an eye on the big picture and there is one simple and inescapable message: Britain is repelled by both the parties that have dominated its politics for the past century or so. Wherever there was a viable alternative to the two ugly sisters, they got pummelled. When all the results were in, the Tories and Labour wound up with a projected national vote share of just 28% each, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48091592\" title=\"\">their worst combined score</a> for many a year.</p> <p>This re-establishes a long-term trend of voter revolt against the blue-red duopoly that has dominated British politics since 1945. I have been suggesting for some time that the rise in their combined share at the last general election was the product of freak circumstances and a false positive for the big two. That looks even more the case today. Multi-party politics is alive and kicking. The fragmentation of voter allegiances continues. Neither the red tribe nor the blue clan is exhibiting a capacity to get anywhere near to speaking for a majority of Britons.</p> <p>The main beneficiary in these elections were the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/03/liberal-democrats-vince-cable-fight-back-as-tory-strongholds-taken-in-local-election\" title=\"\">Lib Dems</a>, up by more than 700 seats. They were due a revival after the savaging inflicted on their local government base during their time in office with the Tories. Voter memories of Lib-Dem participation in the coalition may be softening, perhaps in part because that period looks like an era of strong and stable government compared with the chaos that has been unleashed since. The Lib Dems are returning to their historical role, which is to outperform at a council level and offer a home for voters discontented with the big two. In many parts of the country, the Lib-Dem surge was augmented by its appeal to anti-Brexit voters as a party unequivocally in favour of a fresh referendum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96797b84112f0d4fe925919bb3491831b231156f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96797b84112f0d4fe925919bb3491831b231156f/0_336_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green party supporters in Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green party supporters in Brighton, where the party won eight seats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Hasson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/03/greens-celebrate-phenomenal-local-election-gains\" title=\"\">The Greens</a>, the second biggest winners, also benefited from their clear opposition to Brexit. It is reasonable to suggest that the Greens may have enjoyed a further boost from the additional salience given to their central cause by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/27/extinction-rebellion-activists-stage-die-in-protests-across-globe\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a>. Anger towards the reds and the blues was further reflected in victories for many independents, more than 600 of whom won seats.</p> <p>There is a sliver of consolation in this for the Tories. As the governing party, and one that has been in office for nine austerity-dominated years, the Tories should not expect to be liked. Given the multitude of reasons they have supplied for the public to turn against them, the Tories should expect to be loathed. Their leader is a self-lamed duck who even gets barracked by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/may/03/why-dont-you-resign-theresa-may-heckled-at-welsh-conservative-conference-video\" title=\"\">tweedy heckler</a> at one of her own party conferences. Many of the big donors to the Conservative party are on strike. So are many of their shrivelled band of activists. Less than 24 hours before the polls opened, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/01/gavin-williamson-sacked-as-defence-secretary-over-huawei-leak\" title=\"\">Gavin Williamson</a> became the first cabinet minister in decades to be sacked for leaking confidential deliberations within government, ensuring that yet another example of Tory infighting and mayhem was in voters\u2019 minds as they filled in their ballots. The former defence secretary prolonged that furore into voting day itself by noisily protesting that he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice. He even staked his children\u2019s life on his innocence, though not, you may have noted, his own life or that of his <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/gavin-williamson-michael-fallon-chief-whip-defence-secretary-pet-tarantula-cronus-a8033366.html\" title=\"\">pet spider</a>.</p> <p>The Tory loss of around 1,300 council seats is atrocious and at the same time not in the least surprising. Given that its own members describe this government as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/18/johnny-mercer-tory-backbencher-frustration-may-government\" title=\"\">\u201cshitshow\u201d</a>, it is astonishing that anyone was willing to lend them a vote. The greater shocker is Labour\u2019s performance, which was much worse than either the professional psephologists or the party\u2019s own strategists had been forecasting. It is scant comfort for Labour that the party lost far fewer seats than the Tories and mitigated some of its council defeats by picking up gains here and there. The principal party of opposition should be winning at local elections and winning large at this stage of the electoral cycle. Yet Labour is failing to harvest the political bounty we would normally expect for the principal opposition when the government is so poisonously divided and visibly anarchic. Labour managed to turn in a performance that went backwards on its poor showing in 2015 when these seats were last contested. For the party to be confident of winning the general election it keeps calling for, it has to be doing much, much better than this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eccb8bdfd55faca68bf14a9ef9e66612ab6ce70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eccb8bdfd55faca68bf14a9ef9e66612ab6ce70/0_129_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Labour campaigners have publicly reported that Jeremy Corbyn was an issue on the doorstep.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In times past, such a dismal showing by the principal party of opposition would trigger a debate about the future of its leader. His personal ratings are historically dire and some Labour campaigners have publicly reported that <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-05-03/why-tories-and-labour-should-be-petrified-by-local-elections/\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> was an issue on the doorstep, but the thought that he might be a large component of the problem remains a taboo topic for most of the party. So Labour people have tried to muster some alternative explanations for this failure. One is that the party\u2019s more popular messages about domestic issues have been drowned out by the never-ending pyschodramas of Brexit. There is something in that, but a more skilful opposition would spend less time moaning about the climate and more energy trying to change the weather. Another excuse offered by Labour spokespeople is that the party is suffering from a general mood of \u201ca plague on both your houses\u201d among voters who are sick of Westminster politicking in general and the rat\u2019s maze of Brexit in particular. This sounds true. If it is, this is a serious problem for the party. It was supposed to be one of Mr Corbyn\u2019s great virtues that the career rebel could capture and channel \u201canti-establishment\u201d feeling to Labour\u2019s benefit. He arguably did that, especially among younger voters, at the 2017 election.</p> <p>It is hard to escape the conclusion that Labour is paying a punishing price for its leader\u2019s ducking and diving over Brexit. Labour\u2019s endless weaving and swerving, designed to avoid alienating either leave or remain supporters by facing both ways, is now repelling both. This has not just made Mr Corbyn look unprincipled and equivocal on the greatest question facing the nation, it has damaged him more generally by exposing the Labour leader as no different to any other machinating, slippery, cynical politician.</p> <p>Both he and Theresa May have an incentive to try to find a way through the Brexit impasse and resolve what is a nightmare for both parties. She needs a fix in order to be able to depart Number 10 with some shreds of dignity and before her party throws her out. He needs a fix because Brexit is becoming as damaging to Labour as it is to the Tories. So both have reacted to these results in the same way, by saying that they show the country <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellMP/status/1124210656146862080\" title=\"\">wants to \u201cmove on\u201d</a>. Acolytes of the two leaders insist that they will intensify the effort to bring the cross-party talks to a conclusion.</p> <p>Yet it is hard to see any kind of deal between the two party leaderships that would \u201csort\u201d Brexit in a way that commanded the consent of their members, their parliamentary parties or a majority of voters. The Tory party will explode if there is a compromise that leans into Mr Corbyn\u2019s version of Brexit. Labour will detonate if its frontbench tries to enable Mrs May to deliver any kind of Brexit. Even if the two leaders can broker a bargain, it is hugely uncertain whether it could be got through the Commons and absolutely guaranteed to be enormously unpopular with vast swaths of voters on both sides of the argument.</p> <p>Brexit is simply too big for these discredited and divided parties. It is too much for their epically unpopular leaders. It is too huge to be resolved by a Westminster \u201cfix\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

I have been suggesting for some time that the rise in their combined share at the last general election was the product of freak circumstances and a false positive for the big two. That looks even more the case today. Multi-party politics is alive and kicking. The fragmentation of voter allegiances continues. Neither the red tribe nor the blue clan is exhibiting a capacity to get anywhere near to speaking for a majority of Britons. The main beneficiary in these elections were the Lib Dems, up by more than 700 seats. They were due a revival after the savaging inflicted on their local government base during their time in office with the Tories. Voter memories of Lib-Dem participation in the coalition may be softening, perhaps in part because that period looks like an era of strong and stable government compared with the chaos that has been unleashed since. The Lib Dems are returning to their historical role, which is to outperform at a council level and offer a home for voters discontented with the big two. In many parts of the country, the Lib-Dem surge was augmented by its appeal to anti-Brexit voters as a party unequivocally in favour of a fresh referendum. The Greens, the second biggest winners, also benefited from their clear opposition to Brexit. It is reasonable to suggest that the Greens may have enjoyed a further boost from the additional salience given to their central cause by Extinction Rebellion. Anger towards the reds and the blues was further reflected in victories for many independents, more than 600 of whom won seats. There is a sliver of consolation in this for the Tories. As the governing party, and one that has been in office for nine austerity-dominated years, the Tories should not expect to be liked. Given the multitude of reasons they have supplied for the public to turn against them, the Tories should expect to be loathed. Their leader is a self-lamed duck who even gets barracked by a tweedy heckler at one of her own party conferences. Many of the big donors to the Conservative party are on strike. So are many of their shrivelled band of activists. Less than 24 hours before the polls opened, Gavin Williamson became the first cabinet minister in decades to be sacked for leaking confidential deliberations within government, ensuring that yet another example of Tory infighting and mayhem was in voters\u2019 minds as they filled in their ballots. The former defence secretary prolonged that furore into voting day itself by noisily protesting that he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice. He even staked his children\u2019s life on his innocence, though not, you may have noted, his own life or that of his pet spider. The Tory loss of around 1,300 council seats is atrocious and at the same time not in the least surprising. Given that its own members describe this government as a \u201cshitshow\u201d, it is astonishing that anyone was willing to lend them a vote. The greater shocker is Labour\u2019s performance, which was much worse than either the professional psephologists or the party\u2019s own strategists had been forecasting. It is scant comfort for Labour that the party lost far fewer seats than the Tories and mitigated some of its council defeats by picking up gains here and there. The principal party of opposition should be winning at local elections and winning large at this stage of the electoral cycle. Yet Labour is failing to harvest the political bounty we would normally expect for the principal opposition when the government is so poisonously divided and visibly anarchic. Labour managed to turn in a performance that went backwards on its poor showing in 2015 when these seats were last contested. For the party to be confident of winning the general election it keeps calling for, it has to be doing much, much better than this. In times past, such a dismal showing by the principal party of opposition would trigger a debate about the future of its leader. His personal ratings are historically dire and some Labour campaigners have publicly reported that Jeremy Corbyn was an issue on the doorstep, but the thought that he might be a large component of the problem remains a taboo topic for most of the party. So Labour people have tried to muster some alternative explanations for this failure. One is that the party\u2019s more popular messages about domestic issues have been drowned out by the never-ending pyschodramas of Brexit. There is something in that, but a more skilful opposition would spend less time moaning about the climate and more energy trying to change the weather. Another excuse offered by Labour spokespeople is that the party is suffering from a general mood of \u201ca plague on both your houses\u201d among voters who are sick of Westminster politicking in general and the rat\u2019s maze of Brexit in particular. This sounds true. If it is, this is a serious problem for the party. It was supposed to be one of Mr Corbyn\u2019s great virtues that the career rebel could capture and channel \u201canti-establishment\u201d feeling to Labour\u2019s benefit. He arguably did that, especially among younger voters, at the 2017 election. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Labour is paying a punishing price for its leader\u2019s ducking and diving over Brexit. Labour\u2019s endless weaving and swerving, designed to avoid alienating either leave or remain supporters by facing both ways, is now repelling both. This has not just made Mr Corbyn look unprincipled and equivocal on the greatest question facing the nation, it has damaged him more generally by exposing the Labour leader as no different to any other machinating, slippery, cynical politician. Both he and Theresa May have an incentive to try to find a way through the Brexit impasse and resolve what is a nightmare for both parties. She needs a fix in order to be able to depart Number 10 with some shreds of dignity and before her party throws her out. He needs a fix because Brexit is becoming as damaging to Labour as it is to the Tories. So both have reacted to these results in the same way, by saying that they show the country wants to \u201cmove on\u201d. Acolytes of the two leaders insist that they will intensify the effort to bring the cross-party talks to a conclusion. Yet it is hard to see any kind of deal between the two party leaderships that would \u201csort\u201d Brexit in a way that commanded the consent of their members, their parliamentary parties or a majority of voters. The Tory party will explode if there is a compromise that leans into Mr Corbyn\u2019s version of Brexit. Labour will detonate if its frontbench tries to enable Mrs May to deliver any kind of Brexit. Even if the two leaders can broker a bargain, it is hugely uncertain whether it could be got through the Commons and absolutely guaranteed to be enormously unpopular with vast swaths of voters on both sides of the argument. Brexit is simply too big for these discredited and divided parties. It is too much for their epically unpopular leaders. It is too huge to be resolved by a Westminster \u201cfix\u201d. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",
