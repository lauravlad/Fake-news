      "bodyText": "MPs have inflicted a fresh humiliating defeat on Theresa May, voting to seize control of the parliamentary timetable to allow backbenchers to hold a series of votes on alternatives to her Brexit deal. An amendment tabled by former Tory minister Oliver Letwin passed, by 329 votes to 302 on Monday night, as MPs expressed their exasperation at the government\u2019s failure to set out a fresh approach. The prime minister had earlier declined to say whether she would abide by the outcome of a process of \u201cindicative votes\u201d. The government issued a punchy statement after the amendment passed, warning that it \u201cupends the balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous, unpredictable precedent for the future\u201d. Three ministers resigned from government in order to back the Letwin amendment: the foreign affairs minister, Alistair Burt, the health minister Steve Brine and the business minister Richard Harrington. A total of 29 Tory MPs rebelled to vote for the amendment. Harrington, who has been outspoken in his warnings about the risk of a no-deal Brexit in recent weeks, accused the government of \u201cplaying roulette with the lives and livelihoods of the vast majority of people in this country\u201d in his resignation letter. The amendment was drawn up by a cross-party group \u2013 led by Letwin and Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn \u2013 and gives MPs a series of votes on the alternatives to May\u2019s deal, such as a softer Brexit or revoking article 50. The prime minister earlier announced that she did not yet have the support to justify holding a third meaningful vote on her deal, but insisted she would not hand parliament a \u201cblank cheque\u201d to decide what happened next. Some Tory Eurosceptics reacted furiously. David TC Davies accused Letwin of having \u201cset himself up as a jobbing prime minister\u201d, and Bill Cash branded the vote a \u201cconstitutional revolution\u201d that the House of Commons would come to regret. After gathering Brexit backers at her country retreat of Chequers over the weekend and consulting the Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, on Monday, May concluded she could not yet win sufficient backing for her twice-defeated deal.

Without parliament\u2019s backing, she must return to Brussels before 12 April and set out an alternative plan. After a weekend of lurid reports about ministerial walkouts and ultimatums, the prime minister appeared undaunted as she addressed the House of Commons on Monday after telling her cabinet she still hoped her deal could win support. May had earlier criticised the Letwin amendment, warning that the process of indicative votes could yield \u201ccontradictory outcomes, or no outcome at all\u201d and set a precedent that would \u201coverturn the balance of our democratic institutions\u201d. And despite failing to set out any alternative to her deal, the prime minister declined to say whether she would abide by the outcome. \u201cNo government could give a blank cheque to commit to an outcome without knowing what it is. So I cannot commit the government to delivering the outcome of any votes held by this house. But I do commit to engaging constructively with this process,\u201d she said. Instead, May insisted she had not given up hope of bringing her deal back for a third vote, saying she would \u201ccontinue to have discussions with colleagues across the house, so that we can bring the vote forward this week, and guarantee Brexit\u201d. Several Brexiters, including Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 who attended Sunday\u2019s Chequers meeting \u2013 have signalled that they may yet support her deal, if the DUP backed it. Downing Street also hopes the threat of what May called a \u201cslow Brexit\u201d, if MPs take over the process and demand a longer Brexit delay and a closer relationship with the EU, could convince more leave backers to support her. Corbyn told the prime minister: \u201cThe government\u2019s approach to Brexit has now become a national embarrassment. Every step of the way along this process the government has refused to reach out, refused to listen and refused to find a consensus that can represent the views of the whole of the country, not just her own party.\u201d During a highly charged debate in the Commons, a string of senior backbenchers condemned what many argued was a deep political crisis. \u201cWhat on earth has happened to our pragmatism, our self-restraint and our common sense?\u201d asked the veteran Conservative MP Nicholas Soames. \u201cLike many others, I have found myself truly distraught at the painful, difficult and intractable position in which our country finds itself.\u201d Controlling the parliamentary timetable is usually a key power of the sitting government, but MPs have been drawing up plans to step in after May repeatedly declined to change course, despite her deal being roundly rejected on two occasions. Defending the move, the Tory rebel Dominic Grieve said parliament had been \u201cprevented from doing its ordinary job\u201d by the \u201cstraitjacket\u201d imposed by the government. \u201cSeeing that the government has run into the sand, and has had its deal rejected, we have got to find an alternative,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be nothing that is forbidden to be discussed.\u201d May had earlier suggested to her deeply divided cabinet that she hoped to hold a third meaningful vote on Tuesday. She then spoke to Foster, in the hope of securing the party\u2019s support for her deal, which she hoped would help win over Tory Brexiters. But DUP sources insisted after that call that their \u201cposition remains unchanged\u201d. Foster\u2019s deputy, Nigel Dodds, later reacted with fury in the Commons when May said the suspension of the Northern Ireland assembly in Stormont was one reason that a no-deal Brexit would be so damaging. In her statement to MPs, May came closer than in recent days to ruling out a no-deal Brexit after last week\u2019s European council meeting agreed to an extension of the article 50 timetable. She told MPs: \u201cUnless this house agrees to it, no deal will not happen.\u201d May had also opened the cabinet meeting by stressing the risks of a no-deal Brexit, amid fears among senior colleagues that she could embrace the idea, rather than accept a longer delay. However, her spokesman afterwards insisted she had not intended to imply that she would never implement no deal; merely that MPs would be likely to seize the opportunity to avoid it. \u201cThe point the prime minister was making is that the house has voted against no deal, and will take every opportunity to prevent no deal,\u201d the spokesman said.",

Professor Russell suggests holding two ballots. The first would ask MPs to rank in preference: a Brexit deal; a Brexit deal subject to a referendum; and last, revoking Brexit. The second would ask MPs to list, in order of preference, the varieties of Brexit deal. It is a novel idea worth considering for its clarity should the current process fail.</p> <p>In politics, partisan character often wins out over collegiate character. Parliament is a creature designed, in William Gladstone\u2019s <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmrefhoc/1117/111710.htm\" title=\"\">words</a>, \u201cnot to govern but to call to account those who govern\u201d. Mrs May exploits this idea ruthlessly. Yet the political moment is unusual because MPs are not voting in a partisan manner. Governments assume that they have control of the Commons agenda. But in truth they only do so on the basis that a parliamentary majority supports the government. When it does not, politics gets stuck. Level-headed parliamentarians are trying to steer a course out of the mire. They ought to be supported by the prime minister, not jeered at for trying to help. Mrs May\u2019s failure to win support from Brexiters for her Brexit policy has sunk her premiership. Let her not take parliament down too.</p>",

What backbenchers lack is the organisation and co-ordination of party to enable a clear choice for Brexit. A series of indicative votes on the different options does not guarantee that one emerges with clearcut support; nor does Ken Clarke\u2019s preferential voting system. Brexit has created constitutional uncertainty, but also opportunity. Meg Russell, of University College London\u2019s Constitution Unit, suggests a novel Commons procedure for breaking the deadlock. Professor Russell suggests holding two ballots. The first would ask MPs to rank in preference: a Brexit deal; a Brexit deal subject to a referendum; and last, revoking Brexit. The second would ask MPs to list, in order of preference, the varieties of Brexit deal. It is a novel idea worth considering for its clarity should the current process fail. In politics, partisan character often wins out over collegiate character. Parliament is a creature designed, in William Gladstone\u2019s words, \u201cnot to govern but to call to account those who govern\u201d. Mrs May exploits this idea ruthlessly. Yet the political moment is unusual because MPs are not voting in a partisan manner. Governments assume that they have control of the Commons agenda. But in truth they only do so on the basis that a parliamentary majority supports the government. When it does not, politics gets stuck. Level-headed parliamentarians are trying to steer a course out of the mire. They ought to be supported by the prime minister, not jeered at for trying to help. Mrs May\u2019s failure to win support from Brexiters for her Brexit policy has sunk her premiership. Let her not take parliament down too.",

      "bodyText": "Re your report on the confidential Cabinet Office document on \u201cOperation Yellowhammer\u201d (Revealed: secret plan for months of no-deal chaos, 23 March), it is hard to comprehend that any government could be making such plans. It is the first task of government to ensure the security and wellbeing of its citizens. To be actively planning how to mitigate a serious disaster that is quite unnecessary and has been brought about by this government is a complete dereliction of duty. The plans themselves would be unworkable, involving incessant form-filling and reporting instead of action. It is exactly the same approach that has been applied to the NHS and the teaching profession, but in an emergency situation the results would be dire. It behoves those who would lead us to save us from this danger by revoking article 50, removing the threat of no-deal and the promise of permanent cliff-edge scenarios and negotiations were we to pass a deal. As for the so-called European Research Group, they might be better described as the Evasion of Responsibility Group. Margaret Yerrell Budleigh Salterton, Devon \u2022 Presumably the codename \u201cOperation Yellowhammer\u201d for the government\u2019s emergency food and medicine provisions, derives from the song of said bird, always popularly rendered as \u201ca little bit of bread and no cheese\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has urged MPs not to condemn Britain to a \u201cslow Brexit\u201d this week, as she conceded she did not yet have the support in parliament to bring back her deal for a third meaningful vote. After gathering Brexit-backing grandees at her country retreat of Chequers on Sunday, and speaking on Monday to the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, May said she had reached the conclusion she could not yet win the vote. \u201cI have had to conclude that as things stand, there is still not sufficient support in the house to bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote,\u201d she said, as she reported to MPs on last week\u2019s European council summit. May also came as close as she has done to ruling out a no-deal Brexit, stressing the damage it would do to the union \u2013 a message she also delivered to cabinet, according to government sources. \u201cUnless this house agrees to it, no deal will not happen,\u201d May said. The prime minister said she would whip her own MPs on Monday evening against an amendment tabled by the former Tory minister Oliver Letwin that will allow MPs to take control of the parliamentary timetable, and carry out a process of \u201cindicative votes\u201d. Government ministers privately accept that the amendment is likely to pass on Monday evening \u2013 and that it is likely to point towards support for a softer Brexit in parliament. But the prime minister said: \u201cI must confess that I am sceptical about the process.\u201d She said it could yield \u201ccontradictory outcomes, or no outcome at all\u201d, and set an unfortunate precedent that would \u201coverturn the balance of our democratic institutions\u201d. May said she could not give a \u201cblank cheque\u201d commitment to implement whatever option MPs supported, but would provide government time for a process of indicative votes to take place. And she renewed her criticism of a Norway-style deal, which she called a \u201cslow Brexit\u201d. \u201cA slow Brexit, which extends article 50 beyond 22 May, forces the British people to take part in European elections and gives up control of any of our borders, laws, money or trade, is not a Brexit that will bring the British people together,\u201d she said. May also made clear she had not given up on the idea of bringing back her own deal to parliament in the coming days. \u201cI hope we can all agree, we are all at the moment of decision,\u201d she said, urging MPs to back her deal and \u201cguarantee Brexit\u201d. A number of senior Brexiters have privately urged the prime minister to set a date for her own departure, in exchange for backing her deal. May said she would \u201ccontinue to have discussions with colleagues across the house, so that we can bring the vote forward this week, and guarantee Brexit\u201d. The prime minister also repeated the explanation she gave in Brussels last week about her strident statement in Downing Street on Wednesday, that was widely criticised by MPs for appearing to blame parliament for her predicament. May said she had been \u201cfrustrated\u201d but insisted that \u201cpeople on all sides of the debate hold passionate views, and I respect those differences\u201d. The government has all but conceded it will lose control of parliament this week and MPs will hold a series of votes on different Brexit options, with ministers believing it would be ultimately pointless for May to offer the government\u2019s own plan. It comes as May\u2019s hopes that she can still force through her withdrawal deal faded after her phone call with the DUP leader, who rejected a personal plea for support. In a meeting with Corbyn later on Monday, the Labour leader also rejected suggestions that the prime minister\u2019s exit deal could be separated from the future relationship. A Labour spokesman said the pair had a \u201cfrank and comprehensive exchange of views\u201d and Corbyn suggested there was no basis to bring back her deal to parliament. \u201cThe Labour leader did not accept the prime minister\u2019s suggestion that the withdrawal agreement could be separated from the political declaration,\u201d the spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "The government has all but conceded it will lose control of parliament this week and MPs will hold a series of votes on different Brexit options, with ministers believing it would be ultimately pointless for Theresa May to offer the government\u2019s own plan. It comes as May\u2019s hopes that she still can force through her withdrawal deal faded after a phone call with Arlene Foster, in which the Democratic Unionist party leader rejected a personal plea for support. In a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn later on Monday, the Labour leader also rejected suggestions that the prime minister\u2019s exit deal could be separated from the future relationship. A Labour spokesman said the pair had a \u201cfrank and comprehensive exchange of views\u201d and Corbyn suggested there was no basis to bring back her deal to parliament. \u201cThe Labour leader did not accept the prime minister\u2019s suggestion that the withdrawal agreement could be separated from the political declaration,\u201d the spokesman said. It is understood that May suggested in her hour-long meeting with Corbyn that the government would not be bound by the decision of parliament in any indicative votes. The government will whip Conservative MPs against an amendment to a motion on Monday that would give MPs control over the parliamentary order paper on Wednesday, to pave the way for votes on Brexit options in parliament. May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington, who will open the debate, had been in intense discussions with the leaders of the group of MPs who are pushing the motion, including the Tory MP Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn and Stephen Kinnock. However, government sources suggested they had now conceded that May could not offer her own version of indicative votes and MPs were determined to press ahead with their plan regardless. Downing Street said May told a cabinet meeting on Monday morning she would table a new meaningful vote only if the government felt certain of the numbers. In a telephone call straight after the meeting, Foster said she would not change her party\u2019s position. \u201cThe position remains unchanged,\u201d a source said. May\u2019s spokesman said there was a sense of \u201cdetermination\u201d at the meeting and the prime minister\u2019s future was not raised by any cabinet minister. One cabinet source said Jeremy Hunt had wanted to delay the meaningful vote until close to 12 April in order to pressure Labour MPs into supporting the deal for fear of leaving without an agreement, but that was not backed by those cabinet ministers who want to take no deal off the table. Several cabinet members also raised concerns about indicative votes being held by the government over concerns that they would cause chaos and lead to a general election. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is understood to have been the main voice warning of the risk of a general election if parliament seizes control of Brexit from the government, saying there was a need to honour the 2017 election manifesto. Monday\u2019s key amendment has been tabled by Letwin and Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee, which would set aside Wednesday for MPs to take control of House of Commons business in order to hold the series of votes on different Brexit outcomes. May\u2019s spokesman said there were concerns about the constitutional implications of the amendment. \u201cThe prime minister has previously said that tying the government\u2019s hands in this way by seeking to commandeer the order paper would have far-reaching implications for the way in which the UK is governed and the balance of powers and responsibilities in our democratic institutions,\u201d the spokesman said. Depending on the outcome of talks and votes on Monday, the prime minister still could table a meaningful vote for Tuesday via a late-night emergency business motion, shortly after MPs have voted on Monday night.",

The chances of May\u2019s deal being passed appeared to grow even more distant after a summit on Sunday at her Chequers country retreat, with Boris Johnson and other leading hard-Brexiters leaving without agreement. Tory rebels present said the prime minister repeated \u201call the same lines\u201d about her deal and that nothing new emerged during the three-hour meeting, at which Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith and Dominic Raab were also present. The talks took place amid reports of an imminent coup to remove the prime minister \u2013 claims that were forcefully denied by Michael Gove, David Lidington and Philip Hammond. However, calls for May to depart soon have grown, with the Sun on Monday using its front page for an editorial demanding the prime minister step down. Nigel Evans, a leading Conservative Brexiter, and joint executive secretary of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said on Monday that May should set out a plans to quit to get her deal through. \u201cClearly a number of people do not want the prime minister anywhere near the next phase of negotiations, which is the future trading relationship between ourselves and the EU,\u201d he told Today. If she left there could be \u201can orderly replacement of the prime minister\u201d with a full leadership contest, he said. Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former minister who is among those who have led the amendment on the indicative votes, now signed by more than 120 MPs, told Today it could take several rounds of voting to find a consensus. \u201cI think MPs are very grown up and sensible about this, and given the opportunity, eventually \u2013 not necessarily in the first round \u2013 they will probably come up with an alternative,\u201d he said.

The prime minister, the only woman present, also invited her effective deputy, Lidington, and the environment secretary, Gove, plus Julian Smith, the chief whip, and Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman. Cabinet colleagues at the meeting, including Gove, had hoped it would be possible to persuade Johnson and Raab \u2013 both rival Tory leadership contenders who are holding out against the deal \u2013 to end their standoff by dropping their opposition together. However, any compromise from Johnson appeared unlikely as he used his latest Telegraph column to attack the government, saying it had \u201cbottled\u201d Brexit and the UK should leave the EU immediately.",
