However, this one had a new set piece: a giant flashing modular orb, and a giant window with a view of the Place de la Concorde and the Eiffel Tower. It turned the catwalk into a pavement, so we could imagine the clothes in the real world, but also meant the show could probably be seen by those outside. A reminder, perhaps, that it\u2019s not just the critics that matter.</p>",

He described the collection as \u201ca Polaroid snapshot of this young British creative community\u201d. Slimane\u2019s success at Celine remains to be seen, though his womenswear has already appeared on several red carpets. During his four years at Saint Laurent, it\u2019s thought he tripled the company\u2019s profits. Dior and Louis Vuitton have hired the biggest names in fashion to oversee their menswear \u2013 and with that category set to outperform women\u2019s in 2022 \u2013 it is hoped Slimane will do the same for Celine. Like several shows this week (including the Celine women\u2019s show), this one took place in a specially constructed branded box. However, this one had a new set piece: a giant flashing modular orb, and a giant window with a view of the Place de la Concorde and the Eiffel Tower. It turned the catwalk into a pavement, so we could imagine the clothes in the real world, but also meant the show could probably be seen by those outside. A reminder, perhaps, that it\u2019s not just the critics that matter.",

The Saints, however, owned the tiebreaker, so they\u2019ll be hosting today\u2019s game. So, it\u2019s pretty fitting that the two of them will face each other in the NFC Championship Game with a Super Bowl appearance on the line.</p> <p>The Rams had a slightly easier time getting to the penultimate round of the playoffs. While the final score of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/12/cowboys-rams-chiefs-colts-nfl-playoffs\">win over the Dallas Cowboys</a> was 30-22, the Cowboys were coming from behind the entire way. Led by the running back duo of Todd Gurley and CJ Anderson, they managed to end the Cowboys without much fuss.</p> <p>Unfortunately for them, Drew Brees and the Saints will prove to be a somewhat more difficult task, particularly since they will have home field advantage today (not that the Coliseum makes for the most daunting place to play for opponents, but still). The Saints 20-14 comeback victory against the Philadelphia Eagles finally ended Nick Foles\u2019s magical postseason run. Now there\u2019s one more victory away from giving their Hall-of-Fame quarterback an attempt to pick up his second Super Bowl ring.<br></p> <p>This should be a good game, unlike most of the ones we had last weekend. You can contribute to our liveblog by emailing us (to <a href=\"mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com\">hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com</a>) or tweeting at us (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a>) with your question, analysis, freewheeling commentary or what have you.

In the meantime here\u2019s his preview of today\u2019s game:</p> <p><strong>What the Rams need to do</strong>: The Rams need to keep relying on their running game. Everyone was expecting Todd Gurley to have a big game against the Dallas Cowboys last weekend but nobody was expecting CJ Anderson to outdo him, or for both running backs to pick up <a href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/sports/saints/article_b6617bfe-190a-11e9-b21a-27e6f31e0c7a.html\">more than 100 yards each</a>. Now the Saints defense will have to game plan for both men.</p> <p><strong>What the Saints need to do</strong>: Get in front early. The Saints had to crawl out of a 14-0 hole against the Philadelphia Eagles last week. That\u2019s not going to work against a much tougher opponent in the Rams, who dominated in the first half against Dallas, going up 20-3 on their way to a 30-22 victory.</p> <p><strong>Key player for the Rams</strong>: <strong>Aaron Donald, DT</strong>. Donald led the league in sacks during the regular season with 20.5, and is favorite to be named defensive player of the year. He\u2019s going to have his work cut out against Drew Brees, however. Donald managed a few tackles on the future hall of famer in their last meeting, <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001011200/article/payton-aaron-donald-is-nfls-best-defensive-player\">but no sacks</a>.</p> <p><strong>Key player for the Saints</strong>: <strong>Michael Thomas, WR</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/playoffs/2019/01/13/los-angeles-rams-new-orleans-saints-nfc-championship-game-preview/2567388002/\">Last time </a>these two teams faced each other, Thomas accumulated 211 yards and scored a key touchdown late on. Last weekend, Thomas went off for 171 yards and yet another touchdown against the Eagles. He will be a factor again.</p> <p><strong>Unheralded players to watch</strong>: <strong>The kickers</strong>. It doesn\u2019t get much more unheralded than being a kicker, but we\u2019ve already seen how important they can be in a winner-takes-all scenario. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/07/cody-parker-chicago-bears-philadelphia-eagles-nfl-playoffs\">Just ask poor Cody Parkey</a>, whose blocked field-goal ended the Chicago Bears\u2019 season. So, watch Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein and Saints kicker Wil Lutz. If casual football fans know one of their names after the game ends, that probably means something bad has happened. The usually reliable Lutz, in fact, nearly found himself the Saints\u2019 fall guy with his<a href=\"https://www.nola.com/saints/2019/01/saints-kicker-will-lutz-caught-a-little-bit-of-the-ground-on-missed-52-yard-field-goal.html\"> fourth-quarter miss</a> against the Eagles, but the Saints were able to hold on to win 20-14.</p> <p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Rams 24-28 Saints</p> </div>   </div>",

These teams were competing for the title of the best team in the NFL for much of the game. It makes sense that four quarters weren\u2019t going to be enough and that it would come down to a field goal (hey did someone predict that the key player would end up being the kicker?) In any case, I\u2019m going to become a mere spectator to the AFC Championship Game (join David Lengel for his liveblog here and The game report for this game is down below.). Meanwhile, thanks to everybody who read along to our liveblog, especially those who contributed. Ciao! Ben Dunn: The Saints just cannot catch a break in the post-season. On the wrong end of the Miracle last year, and this year the wrong side of the New Orleans No-Call. Unreal. There will be plenty of talk about the no-call at the end of regulation, and that\u2019s understandable and man would I be mad as a New Orleans fans, but the Saints had mishandled that drive from the very beginning. They had chances to win and couldn\u2019t convert. The Rams have won the NFC Championship Game! What incredible poise by Goff and the Rams who could have been dead several times there. Rams 26-23 Saints, FINAL The Rams can win it here with a field goal, since the Saints have already had possession in this overtime. AND IT\u2019S GOOD! THE RAMS ARE HEADED TO THE SUPER BOWL! Rams 23-23 Saints, 11:47, OT The Rams pick up a first down on their first possession of overtime, but lose three yards on the next play. Goff finds Higbee for a 6 yard gain. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 7 at the New Orleans 39. On the next play, Goff throws to Cooks who drops it. Saints take a timeout, with Zeurlein coming out for a 57 yard attempt. Rams 23-23 Saints, 13:55, OT Brees throws a dangerous long pass and it\u2019s intercepted by Johnson at the Saints 46! Falling on the back as he does so. Rams 23-23 Saints, 14:48, OT On 1st &amp; 10, Brees\u2019s pass is tipped and goes incomplete. 2nd &amp; 10, Brees throws deep and this time there\u2019s a flag, leading to some sarcastic clapping. It\u2019s defensive pass interference, which gives them 14 yards and an automatic first down. They\u2019re at their own 40 now. On 1st &amp; 10, Ingram gets stuffed, a huge loss. Six yards. Rams 23-23 Saints, 15:00, OT Kamara brings out the ball to start overtime. He gets to the NO 26. Ben Dunn: If the Rams win this, that non-call on the obvious foul on the Saints WR is going to be a huge talking point. If that was called, as it should have been, that was game over. Not wrong. The Saints will have the ball to start overtime, so they have a shot still. Rams 23-23 Saints, end of regulation The Rams kick it off, probably just hoping for no return here. Kamara takes it out of the end zone and gives it a decent return but remains well within Saints territory. Drew Brees takes a knee and we\u2019re going to overtime and the crowd is steamed. Rams 23-23 Saints, :15, 4th quarter The Rams get it into field goal range. It\u2019s a 48-yard attempt for Zuerlein. The crowd gets loud. The kick is JUST good. Rams 20-23 Saints, :45, 4th quarter 3rd &amp; 3, Goff finds Woods who gets it to the New Orleans 33. The Rams take another timeout. Rams 20-23 Saints, 1:12, 4th quarter 2nd &amp; 10, Goff hits Reynolds for a first down that takes them to their own 44. On 1st &amp; 10, Goff throws incomplete. 2nd &amp; 10, Cooks gets seven yards. Rams 20-23 Saints, 1:37, 4th quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Goff throws incomplete. That\u2019s a start for the Saints defense. Rams 20-23 Saints, 1:41, 4th quarter Now the Rams have a lot of time to even this thing out or win it outright. Lutz\u2019s kickoff goes for a touchback. Rams 20-23 Saints, 1:45, 4th quarter It\u2019s 3rd and 10 now for the Saints, who are in danger of botching this drive. Brees throws incomplete\u2026 and it feels like there should be a flag on the play somewhere. Instead, the Saints have to settle for a field goal. Lutz\u2019s kick is good. The crowd is booing, which is understandable. Rams 20-20 Saints, 1:49, 4th quarter Kamara gets stuffed for no gain and the Rams take a timeout. Rams 20-20 Saints, 2:00, 4th quarter The Saints are now on the Rams 13. On 1st &amp; 10, Brees throws incomplete to Thomas. They take a time-out, that feels like a miscalculation on the Saints considering the clock. And on the next play, Brees has to use a timeout. Rams 20-20 Saints, 2:00, 4th quarter There\u2019s Aaron Donald for the Rams, pushing back Ingram for a two-yard loss. 2nd &amp; 12 for the Saints, Brees throws deep, 43 yards to Ginn! And we\u2019re at the two minute warning with the Saints in good position to win this whole thing. Rams 20-20 Saints, 3:37, 4th quarter Brees finds Austin Carr for a five yard down on first down. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 5 at their 35. Saints are in shotgun, they hand it off to Ingram who is immediately tackled. On 3rd &amp; 2, he throws to Kamara who stays inbounds and reaches the New Orleans 46. That\u2019s a first down. Rams 20-20 Saints, 5:03, 4th quarter I would have went for the touchdown on 4th down. Of course, I would always go for it on fourth down I would be a terrible head coach. Saints are back on the field, Kamara takes the kickoff for a 30 yard gain. Ben Dunn: The game is great. The coaches are having a stormer. Rams and Saints are making adjustments and they are working. They\u2019ve studied the life out of each other and their season strengths are being largely negated. Fascinating to watch. Two high-quality chess-playing head coaches not making many errors so far. And it\u2019s heading for a great finish\u2026 perhaps overtime. Rams 20-20 Saints, 5:16, 4th quarter 2nd &amp; goal, Goff takes it on his own and gets it to the second-yard line. The Saints are lucky there\u2019s not a touchdown. 3rd &amp; goal, Anderson gets the ball\u2026 and he\u2019s just short of the goal line. It\u2019s 4th &amp; goal and it looks like they\u2019re going to go conservative and bring out the field goal unit. It\u2019s a chip-shot, a 19 yarder, except there\u2019s a delay of game which pushes it back to the 24 yard line. No worries, it\u2019s good nonetheless and we have a tied game. Rams 17-20 Saints, 7:23, 4th quarter And another huge throw by Goff, who throws to Reynolds all the way at the Saints 7. That\u2019s a 30+ yard gain. 1st &amp; goal, Anderson gets to the 5 yard line. Rams 17-20 Saints, 8:50, 4th quarter Oh wow. This might be the biggest play of the game, Goff hits Everett who gets the ball and runs it down for a 39 yard gain all the way from deep into their own territory to the Saints\u2019 39 yard line. Anderson picks up 5 yards on first down, their at the New Orleans 40. Rams 17-20 Saints, 9:38, 4th quarter Well, Gurley\u2019s back out there it seems and he gets the ball to start things off, getting about six yards on first down. Woods gets the ball next and gets just one yard. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 3 on the Rams own 16. On the next play, the Rams take a timeout right before Goff throws incomplete, which the fans aren\u2019t super-happy about. And we do have a Gene Loves Jezebel appearance! They did a fantastic job last possession, the offense just couldn\u2019t convert. What a huge penalty that ended up being on New Orleans. Rams 17-20 Saints, 11:04, 4th quarter On 2nd &amp; 20, Kamara gets stopped by Suh after a 3 yard gain. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 17, and it\u2019s looking like this promising drive could fizzle quickly. And it does, Brees\u2019s throw to Ginn is incomplete, nearly picked off, and that will do it. Morstead\u2019s punt puts the Rams on their own 9. Rams 17-20 Saints, 11:51, 4th quarter Saints are at the LA 46. Ingram picks up 4 yards, but wait there\u2019s a penalty that will push them back 10 yards. It\u2019s 1st &amp; 20 at the New Orleans 44 now. Brees throws incomplete to Dan Arnold. So make that 2nd &amp; 20. Rams 17-20 Saints, 12:29, 4th quarter The Rams are punting from their own seven\u2026 except there\u2019s a penalty on the Saints that pushes them up five yards. And there\u2019s a flag on the punt, this time on the Rams, a 15-yard chop block penalty that, after the catch, means that the Saints are starting in LA territory. Rams 17-20 Saints, 12:59, 4th quarter Let\u2019s see if that \u201cno call\u201d ends up hurting the Saints here. The Rams take the field with a chance to tie or better. The announcers are speculating on Gurley\u2019s health here, it\u2019s a surprise we haven\u2019t seen him. And thanks to a huge sack by Cam Jordan, they limit the Rams to a 3-0. Rams 17-20 Saints, 14:56, 4th quarter Brees throws incomplete to start the fourth quarter, Saints fans want a call here and there might be holding here. The Saints have to punt instead. Natson catches the punt on the Rams 34. Rams 17-20 Saints, end of the 3rd quarter The ball comes out on the next play, but Kamara gets right on so all they lose is a down. 2nd &amp; 10, Ingram picks up three. That will due it for the third. I\u2019m thinking this might be a suspenseful fourth quarter, so stick with us. Rams 17-20 Saints, 1:57, 3rd quarter Zuerlein\u2019s kickoff is another touchback. Not a lot of drama when it comes to that department. The Saints immediately get the first down thanks to Brees throw to Tre\u2019Quan Smith. Brees, working in the shotgun, then finds Thomas to their own 44 and Ingram gets the first down and more, all the way to midfield. Rams 17-20 Saints, 3:06, 3rd quarter It looks like an elbow injury for Bell (and by looks, I mean the replay made painfully clear). Josh Reynolds gets stopped right before the goal line. It\u2019s 1st &amp; goal at the one. And almost disaster for the Rams, as Goff fumbles at the snap to lose a few yards. They\u2019re at the 3 now. Anderson picks up a yard on next down and on 3rd &amp; goal, Goff finds Tyler Higbee open in the end zone for a touchdown. With another successful extra point it once again becomes a three-point game. Rams 10-20 Saints, 5:15, 3rd quarter And Goff goes long\u2026 a long throw to Cooks that gets them to the halfway mark. On the next play, Anderson gets about a yard. 2nd &amp; 9\u2026 a yellow flag flies down, it\u2019s offside on the Saints. That\u2019s five yards and no play. 2nd &amp; 4. Goff finds Cooks for a 25 yard gain and they\u2019re already at the Saints 17. The Saints\u2019 Von Bell looks to be hurt so we get an injury timeout. Rams 10-20 Saints, 7:25, 3rd quarter Anderson picks up four yards. Huge 3rd &amp; 2 here, and the Rams convert. Goff throws short to Cooks for a another four. That\u2019s a new first down. Rams 10-20 Saints, 8:04, 3rd quarter Lutz\u2019s kickoff is yet another touchback, they\u2019ll be on their own 25. Goff finds Woods for a four-yard gain to start their possession. Rams 10-20 Saints, 8:37, 3rd quarter They\u2019re rolling now. On 2nd &amp; 1, the Saints pick up a first down and it\u2019s 1st and goal. On his first attempt, Brees throws incomplete, underthrown to Thomas. 2nd &amp; goal, Taysom Hill gets the ball for some reason, his throw to Kamara is complete. 3rd &amp; goal, Hill decides to go back to being a receiver, which works out rather well. Brees connects with him for a touchdown. Lutz\u2019s extra point is good. Rams 10-13 Saints, 11:08, 3rd quarter Saints are going super-fast now. Brees finds Kamara again, why go away with what\u2019s working, he gets 8 yards here. They\u2019re in the red zone now. Rams 10-13 Saints, 11:55, 3rd quarter And Kamara gets the ball again and picks up 9 this time around. 2nd &amp; 1\u2026 yep that\u2019s Kamara again, this time for a seven-yard run. That\u2019s another first down and on the next, Ingram runs it again and they\u2019re already on the LA 26. Rams 10-13 Saints, 13:03, 3rd quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Ingram gets about six yards. 2nd &amp; 4, Brees targets Kamara, their MVP of the game so far, who easily gets a first down. Rams 10-13 Saints, 14:16, 3rd quarter Woods gets the ball to start the first half, who gets taken for a four-yard loss. On 2nd &amp; 13, Goff throws incomplete to Woods who can\u2019t make the catch. 3rd &amp; 14, Goff throws incomplete yet again. Let\u2019s see if they fake punt again And nope. Just a real punt, one that puts the Saints at the own 29 after a bit of rolling. And we begin the second half with a touchback. The Rams will start at their own 25. The Ying Yang Twins apparently are doing the halftime performance, which makes more sense for New Orleans than Jimmy Buffett who should legally be forced to root for the Dolphins. Donald Buchnowski: I am here in the Dominican Republic keeping up and my family in Buffalo are all for the Saints!!! Well, they\u2019re ahead for now but that was a brutal way to end the half. Still, we knew 13 points wasn\u2019t going to be a comfortable cushion in this game. From Pranjal Tiwari: I\u2019m still confused by \u201clove will tear us apart\u201d making an appearance today. Do you know if that\u2019s a Saints anthem or something, or was it the broadcaster that used it? Very strange. And now \u201cShe Sells Sanctuary\u201d by The Cult! Goth / New wave production manager perhaps? I\u2019m hoping for Gene Loves Jezebel next. I guarantee that there is no NFL team that has a Joy Division song as an anthem but if there did it would probably be the Browns. Roger Kirkby: To The comment about headphones, up in the rafters sit a bunch of guys relaying what is going on, on the field to the coordinators on the ground. Either that or they podcast the game. I knew someone in the audience would know the full answer. I guess the way to tell is if they start advertising SeatGeeks.com midway through their conversations. Well this was looking like a one-sided affair until the last minute of the half. That huge completion by Goff changed everything and the Rams will have the ball to start the half. This is definitely looking different from most of the snoozers last weekend. Rams 10-13 Saints, end of the first half That will quiet down the crowd. What an absolute game-changer for the Rams. Kamara returns the Rams punt to the 20. Drew Brees decides to kneel here and take things to the half. Rams 10-13 Saints, :23, 2nd quarter There\u2019s a flag on the punt, on the receiving team it turns out. It\u2019s a 10-yard penalty on the Rams, which will mean that they will be starting at their 19. Goff throws to Reynolds who gets 9 yards. 2nd &amp; 1. They connect again for a 13 yard gain that brings them to their own 41. The clock is now a factor here as well. 1st &amp; 10, Goff throws in complete. On 2nd &amp; 10, Goff\u2019s pass is tipped, and is also incomplete. So it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 10, less than a minute to go in the half\u2026 and Goff finds Cooks for a 17 yard gain into New Orleans territory. Rams used their second timeout. Holy heck, Goff throws to Cooks for 36 yards! They\u2019re at the Saints 6\u2026 for a split second! Gurley runs in for a touchdown. The extra point is good! It\u2019s a three-point game! It\u2019s certainly a factor. Rams 3-13 Saints, 2:00, 2nd quarter That\u2019s a better showing for LA, Ndamukong Suh sacks Brees for a six yard loss, and then gets a half-sack on the next play, by pushing Brees back on first yard. The Rams get another stop on the next play, a play that brings us to the two-minute warning. Rams 3-13 Saints, 3:50, 2nd quarter Kamara gets two yards on 1st down. Ginn picks up 6 yards on 2nd &amp; 8. A big 3rd &amp; 2 here for the Rams defense. And they do not pass the test, Brees finds Kamara for a first down. Rams 3-13 Saints, 5:27, 2nd quarter 2nd &amp; 10, Anderson picks up 6 yards, to the Rams 40. He\u2019s having another big night. On 3rd &amp; 4, Goff throws incomplete and that will stall things out. Hekker\u2019s punt will put the Saints at their own 17. Rams 3-13 Saints, 6:18, 2nd quarter Goff throws incomplete and the Saints take a timeout. Rams 3-13 Saints, 6:18, 2nd quarter Anderson picks up 3 yards for the Rams on first down. On 2nd &amp; 7, Woods makes a great catch of Goff\u2019s throw for a 6 yard gain. A big 3rd &amp; 1 for Los Angeles here. Anderson just gets it. Email from Ezra Finkelstein: Do all players have headsets in their helmets? Because otherwise why are all the coordinators talking into their headsets? I believe just the quarterback and an additional player on the defense. Rams 3-13 Saints, 8:15, 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 12, a pressured Brees throws on the run for a seven yard gain. Not sure how exactly he did it, but it\u2019s still a 3rd &amp; 5 and his throw to Kamara goes incomplete. The Saints punt and JoJo Natson makes a fair catch on the Rams 22. Rams 3-13 Saints, 9:45, 2nd quarter Zuerlein\u2019s kickoff ends up being a touchback. On first down, Kamara gets stuffed for a two yard loss back to the Saints 23. Rams 3-13 Saints, 9:49, 2nd quarter Goff finds Brandin Cooks for a four-yard gain on first down. On second down, they hand off to CJ Anderson who can\u2019t quite get anywhere. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 6 at the Saints 18, Gurley gets the ball and drops it but there\u2019s a flag on the play\u2026 but there\u2019s no penalty. It\u2019s 4th down for the Rams. Greg Zuerlein makes his debut for a 36 yard field goal that\u2019s down the middle and the Rams are on the board. Rams 0-13 Saints, 11:47, 2nd quarter The Rams are at the Saints 26 in their first real scoring chance of the game. Anderson gets the ball the next carry for a four yard gain and another first down. Rams 0-13 Saints, 12:09, 2nd quarter The Rams allow Goff to return as quarterback. On 1st &amp; 10 at the Saints 45, he throw incomplete. On 2nd &amp; 10, Goff finds Gerald Everett for 11 yards and another 1st down. CJ Anderson picks up 8 yards on the next down. The Saints\u2019 AJ Klein gets medical attention as we head into an injury break. Rams 0-13 Saints, 13:31, 2nd quarter Woods gets a gain of a single yard on 3rd down\u2026 and the Rams decide to let punter Johnny Hekker find Sam Shields for a 12 yards gain on a fake punt! Now that is some creative offense! Their first 1st down! Roger Kirkby: No imagination from either team so far, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s low scoring. Maybe they are just too scared of both offences. Remember the Rams were way down against the Saints earlier this season. Well, the Saints offense seems to have picked up. The Rams\u2026 not so much. Rams 0-13 Saints, end of the 1st quarter 2nd &amp; 10. The crowd has not gotten louder, CJ Anderson picks up 5 yards again\u2026 for the last play of the quarter. The Rams have a total of 15 yards and have had zero first downs. Rams 0-13 Saints, :32, 1st quarter CJ Anderson gets his first carry of the game, for 5 yards. On 2nd &amp; 5, the Rams pick up another penalty, this time a false start that negates their gain. The Rams take a timeout. The announcers speculate that the crowd noise is a factor here. Rams 0-13 Saints, 1:40, 1st quarter Another Lutz kick, another touchback. Now would be a good time for the Rams to get their first 1st down. And \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d episodes, apparently. Rams 0-13 Saints, 1:40, 1st quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Brees throws to Ginn who can\u2019t quite make the completion. 2nd &amp; 10, Kamara gains about 6 yards. 3rd &amp; 4 at the Los Angeles 12\u2026 and Kamara can only pick up another two yards. On 4th and 2, the Saints, who are aggressive, put the offense back on the field\u2026 an they draw a defensive encroachment penalty for a first down. And on the next play, Brees finds Garrett Griffin for the first touchdown of the game and the extra point is good. That was Griffin\u2019s first catch of the year. Rams 0-6 Saints, 3:08, 1st quarter The Saints pick up two yards on first down. On 2nd &amp; 8, Thomas catches a Brees pass and gets tackled immediately. It\u2019ll be 3rd &amp; 2, and another chance for the Rams to shut down a promising drive by New Orleans. Instead, Brees finds an open Thomas who picks up a first down at the Rams 18. Rams 0-6 Saints, 5:05, 1st quarter It really feels like the Saints should already be up by two touchdowns considering their first two possessions. Wow, Josh Hill picks up 24 yards to get to the LA 44. He comes off a little dazed, however. That\u2019s not a good sign. Rams 0-6 Saints, 5:35, 1st quarter The Rams\u2019 punt puts the Saints at their own 34, decent starting position. Wait, I\u2019m pretty sure the broadcast just went out with \u201cLove Will Tear Us Apart.\u201d Kind of a downbeat choice there, guys. Rams 0-6 Saints, 5:35, 1st quarter And the Saints hold the Rams to a 3-0. Might be a decent defensive battle brewing here. Rams 0-6 Saints, 7:10, 1st quarter Lutz\u2019s kickoff goes to the end zone again for a second straight touchback. Email from Ezra Finkelstein Pretty dull game so far,with the run game of both teams not working.Wonder if Bill Belichick is watching... Good question, I would think he\u2019s still getting the Patriots prepared. Rams 0-6 Saints, 7:10, 1st quarter So, the Saints take over at the Rams 15. The Rams defense steps up though, limiting Brees and the Saints to a 3-0. Lutz kicks a 29 yard field goal right through the uprights. Again, could be worse for the Rams. Rams 0-3 Saints, 8:42, 1st quarter On 2nd &amp; 3, Gurley gets stuffed for a loss. It\u2019ll be 3rd &amp; 7, Goff\u2019s pass gets deflected and then intercepted by Demario Davis! Oof! Rams 0-3 Saints, 9:26, 1st quarter Well, that could have gone worse for the Rams. It looked like Brees had thrown a sure touchdown pass at the end of that Saints drive. There\u2019s a flag on the kickoff, an illegal block on the Rams, who will start on their own 10. On 1st &amp; 10, Jared Goff throws to Robert Woods, who picks up about seven yards. Rams 0-3 Saints, 10:07, 1st quarter On 3rd &amp; 7, Brees throws to Dan Arnold who can\u2019t quite hold on for the touchdown. Big drop. The Saints have to settle for a field goal here. Wil Lutz\u2019s 37 yard field goal is good and New Orleans is on the board first. Email by Roger Kirkby: Hi Hunter, watching the game in a pub in London, definitely not the same as watching it in a bar in California. I\u2019d like to see the Rams win. It would make coming back to LA the right decision. They have to fight for the honor of LA football after the Chargers laid an egg last Sunday. Rams 0-0 Saints, 10:12, 1st quarter And on the next throw, Drews and Kamara connect again and get to the 22 yard mark. 1st &amp; 10, Brees throws incomplete. On 2nd &amp; 10, Brees finds Thomas for a three yard gain before Aqib Talib stops him. The Saints take a very early timeout. Rams 0-0 Saints, 11:53, 1st quarter Mark Ingram picks up 9 yards on 1st down but then gets stuffed for a two yard loss. 3rd &amp; 3, Rams could make a big stop here. Instead Brees throws long to Kamara. A beautiful 21 yard pass to get the Saints to the Rams 36. Rams 0-0 Saints, 14:16, 1st quarter The Saints are starting at their own 25. Brees throws to Michael Thomas on 1st &amp; 10, but it\u2019s incomplete. On 2nd down, Alvin Kamara picks up about two yards. On 3rd and long, Brees finds Ted Ginn for a nine yard completion and a first down. Rams 0-0 Saints, 15:00, 1st quarter Rams win the toss and they will (rightfully) defer. That\u2019s my one NFL strategy: always defer on the opening coin toss. That means the Saints will receive to start the first half while the Rams will start off the second half. The Ram\u2019s kickoff goes to the end zone for a touchback. Jimmy Buffett is singing the national anthem (?). Okay I\u2019ve definitely taken something. I\u2019m giving it a 3/10 and I\u2019m being super-generous. And the lights go out and the fire display goes off (I hope that\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing) as the players start taking the field. We are getting closer to kickoff and more importantly, we\u2019re getting closer to the end of the pregame show. Something just happened involving Rob Riggle and puppets. Or I have accidentally ingested something psychoactive. This liveblog could get dicey shortly if the latter. I\u2019ve already made my prediction, I\u2019ve got the Saints just outlasting the Rams. I am pretty much putting all my faith in the venerable Drew Brees making the Super Bowl for the first time since his 2009 victory. Your thoughts? Send them here and we\u2019ll include them on in the liveblog, either by emailing them to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com or tweeting them to @HunterFelt. The FOX NFL pregame show has like three more people on it than necessary, this is like a scene from a Marx Brothers movie. The set is about to topple over thanks to the combined weight. AFC Championship Game Later in the day, 6:40pm EST to be precise, the Guardian will be liveblogging the AFC Championship Game between the New England Patriots and the Kansas City Chiefs. It should be a great match between the top quarterback in the league in Tom Brady and his possible successor in Patrick Mahomes. The Patriots ran all over the Los Angeles Chargers while the Chiefs handled the Indianapolis Colts with ease. This one should be a much closer game, at least if their regular season matchup is anything to go by. For a good chunk of the season, the Los Angeles Rams and the New Orleans Saints were fighting for the best record in the NFL, and they both managed to secure it, ending the season at 13-3. The Saints, however, owned the tiebreaker, so they\u2019ll be hosting today\u2019s game. So, it\u2019s pretty fitting that the two of them will face each other in the NFC Championship Game with a Super Bowl appearance on the line. The Rams had a slightly easier time getting to the penultimate round of the playoffs. While the final score of their win over the Dallas Cowboys was 30-22, the Cowboys were coming from behind the entire way. Led by the running back duo of Todd Gurley and CJ Anderson, they managed to end the Cowboys without much fuss. Unfortunately for them, Drew Brees and the Saints will prove to be a somewhat more difficult task, particularly since they will have home field advantage today (not that the Coliseum makes for the most daunting place to play for opponents, but still). The Saints 20-14 comeback victory against the Philadelphia Eagles finally ended Nick Foles\u2019s magical postseason run. Now there\u2019s one more victory away from giving their Hall-of-Fame quarterback an attempt to pick up his second Super Bowl ring. This should be a good game, unlike most of the ones we had last weekend. You can contribute to our liveblog by emailing us (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweeting at us (@HunterFelt) with your question, analysis, freewheeling commentary or what have you. It\u2019s the LA Rams vs the New Orleans Saints at the Mercedes-Benz Superbowl. We\u2019re about a half-hour away from kickoff, but your humble host will be returning beforehand. Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s his preview of today\u2019s game: What the Rams need to do: The Rams need to keep relying on their running game. Everyone was expecting Todd Gurley to have a big game against the Dallas Cowboys last weekend but nobody was expecting CJ Anderson to outdo him, or for both running backs to pick up more than 100 yards each. Now the Saints defense will have to game plan for both men. What the Saints need to do: Get in front early. The Saints had to crawl out of a 14-0 hole against the Philadelphia Eagles last week. That\u2019s not going to work against a much tougher opponent in the Rams, who dominated in the first half against Dallas, going up 20-3 on their way to a 30-22 victory. Key player for the Rams: Aaron Donald, DT. Donald led the league in sacks during the regular season with 20.5, and is favorite to be named defensive player of the year. He\u2019s going to have his work cut out against Drew Brees, however. Donald managed a few tackles on the future hall of famer in their last meeting, but no sacks. Key player for the Saints: Michael Thomas, WR. Last time these two teams faced each other, Thomas accumulated 211 yards and scored a key touchdown late on. Last weekend, Thomas went off for 171 yards and yet another touchdown against the Eagles. He will be a factor again. Unheralded players to watch: The kickers. It doesn\u2019t get much more unheralded than being a kicker, but we\u2019ve already seen how important they can be in a winner-takes-all scenario. Just ask poor Cody Parkey, whose blocked field-goal ended the Chicago Bears\u2019 season. So, watch Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein and Saints kicker Wil Lutz. If casual football fans know one of their names after the game ends, that probably means something bad has happened. The usually reliable Lutz, in fact, nearly found himself the Saints\u2019 fall guy with his fourth-quarter miss against the Eagles, but the Saints were able to hold on to win 20-14. Prediction: Rams 24-28 Saints",

Hesitant at first, and then, as the night ticked on, in a torrent, as surprise turned to shock and then fear. \u201cIs Dutts gone?\u201d \u201cDo you have any update on Dutts?\u201d \u201cDid we lose Dickson?\u201d They didn\u2019t. The Liberal National party held on to the minister\u2019s seat at the last federal election by about 1,500 votes. A couple of blocks, really. But the scare, on a night filled with Liberal electoral horrors, had come as a surprise. The man who would be leader had almost lost his seat in a fight no one, not even Labor, had even seriously considered to be on the cards. The battle for Dickson began about 9pm on 2 July 2016. And it has been raging ever since. Peter Dutton may not be the most popular man in the party room, but you wouldn\u2019t know it north of the border. The LNP, officially one party in Queensland, by and large adores the former police officer, a hang-up from when soon-to-be former senator Barry O\u2019Sullivan attempted to shape the party, and its candidates, in his mould. Dutton, along with Stuart Robert and Steve Ciobo, is one of the party\u2019s best fundraisers, and remains popular with the Young LNP; a figure who is able to marshal support in an increasingly fractured party. But all of that means nothing if the voters don\u2019t feel the same way. And so, Dutton\u2019s own \u201ccaravan of courage\u201d \u2013 the mobile office he has trotted out since 2001\u2013 has been back on the road, trying to win back enough votes to keep the swing against both the government and his personal brand at bay. Dutton\u2019s politics may not have changed, but Dickson has. Those postcodes between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast have attracted more and more young families and professionals, with McMansions and houses with media rooms springing up in the northern suburbs, for the same price as an inner-city two-bedder. Further north you hit Samford, with its \u201cretreats\u201d, country pubs and \u201cgive way to horse riders\u201d signs. Dutton saw the change coming. Before the 2010 election he tried to jump seats to the Gold Coast, where a blue corflute, no matter the face, is enough to win you the electorate. But that was when George Brandis still held sway, and branches will do as branches want \u2013 Dutton found himself locked out. So to Dickson he returned. But relief at change only lasts so long, and Labor, without even really trying, managed to make enough of a dent in Dutton\u2019s margin that suddenly toppling the man-who-could-have-been-prime minister became the little campaign that could. \u201cIt\u2019s ... not great,\u201d an LNP strategist says when asked about the campaign for Dickson. \u201cWe are in trouble. He knows it, we know it, Labor knows it. It\u2019s almost like starting from scratch.\u201d That\u2019s obvious to those following the campaign from the outside. Paul Williams, a senior politics lecturer at Griffith University, predicts Dutton will lose. \u201cOn a 2% margin, improved slightly in the redistribution from 1.6%, Dickson\u2019s margin is still so fragile that it almost certainly won\u2019t withstand the national swing to Labor, even if that swing \u2013 appearing to be about 4% or 5% nationally \u2013 were muted in Queensland,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, given the Scott Morrison coup has done little to reverse the Coalition slide in Queensland, the swing north of the Tweed, even in outer metro and regional seats, is likely to be strong. \u201cWith GetUp also campaigning in Dickson, it\u2019s almost certain Dutton will be defeated. \u201cIf and when Queensland federal LNP representation is decimated, defeated MPs and grassroots members will likely blame the state executive for pursuing an arch-conservative strategy that included advocacy for a Dutton move against Malcolm Turnbull.\u201d GetUp announced it would be targeting Dickson almost immediately after the last election. The Greens have worked to put in a good showing, and Labor sent Ali France, a United Voice left candidate, out into the field as soon as possible. There are still those in Labor who question whether a right faction candidate such as Linda Lavarch, who was defeated by France, might have been a wiser choice. But France, a disability advocate and a local, is clearly campaigning to win. And Labor, still not convinced of victory, but able to see several scenarios where it happens, has thrown its full campaign might behind her bid. \u201cWe are very much ready for an election in Dickson,\u201d France says. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last six months solidly door knocking and talking to voters about the issues that are important to them and the overwhelming feedback is that they want stability and an end to the chaos in Canberra. \u201cWinning this seat, however, is not going to be easy. Peter Dutton is a formidable campaigner, he\u2019s held this seat for 18 years and he\u2019s boasted of a $650,000 war chest in which to fight this election. \u201cOur strength is our people. We have an incredible group of local volunteers that is growing every day and we will deliver the biggest field campaign that this seat has ever seen. Our goal is to have had a conversation with every household in Dickson by election day and we are well on our way to achieving that goal.\u201d Speaking on background, Labor strategists say they see the Dickson campaign as twofold. Not only are they attempting to keep Dutton in the electorate for as much time as possible, blunting his impact during the wider election campaign, they also believe that for every $1 Labor spends, Dutton is spending double. And that keeps campaign funds away from other areas, where other Coalition MPs are in trouble. Dutton has been a regular at roads announcements, as he embarks on a campaign those around him have likened to Queensland Labor\u2019s tactics in 2013 \u2013 the \u201cI\u2019ll fight for you, no matter who is in government\u201d route \u2013 given the Coalition\u2019s unlikely election prospects. He has also been digging in. Dutton, not the party, has hired Geoffrey Greene to help on his campaign. A former Queensland and South Australian party state director, Greene was best known for his work behind the scenes for John Howard\u2019s campaigns. Then he became best known as the former LNP director who was expelled from the party he helped create during a time of mass internal turmoil, launching a million-dollar-plus lawsuit against the organisation, which he later dropped. Greene has been part of Dutton\u2019s campaign for almost a year, in a sign, at least to Dutton\u2019s party colleagues, that he is seriously worried about losing the seat, even if outwardly it\u2019s business as usual. On the ground and in public, Dutton is doing his best to deflect from GetUp\u2019s campaign, painting it as an outsider\u2019s attempt to disrupt local politics. \u201cWell Dickson has always been a very close marginal seat,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2007 we won by 217 votes, but people know that GetUp is a front for the Greens. \u201cThe fact is that the Greens don\u2019t support us on border protection, GetUp don\u2019t support us on border protection, but most people in my electorate would see GetUp as a southern outfit run by the Greens and they aren\u2019t going to be told what to do by suits out of the Greens movement in inner-city Melbourne and Sydney.\u201d But compounding Dutton\u2019s challenge is that he\u2019s not alone among Queensland LNP MPs whose seats are in danger. That\u2019s why Morrison spent part of November travelling across the state, why the Coalition will base its federal campaign office in Brisbane, and why the entire cabinet will hit the sunshine state in the coming days. Labor has identified eight of the Coalition\u2019s 21 Queensland seat as potentially winnable \u2013 Leichhardt, Flynn, Bonner, Petrie, Dickson, Capricornia, Forde and Dawson, with Brisbane considered a maybe. Luke Howarth\u2019s personal popularity in Petrie is expected to withstand any anti-government spin and Warren Entsch\u2019s decision to go round one last time is thought to have saved Leichhardt. It has the Coalition spread thin and it has taken a while for the LNP, and for Dutton, to catch on to Labor\u2019s local messaging. While tough on border security may play well at a macro level, it\u2019s parking, roads and roundabouts that win votes in Brisbane\u2019s northern suburbs. That\u2019s meant the man who launched a prime ministerial bid by telling Australia he hoped to be able to show more of his smile, now shares that turtle-who-lost-his-shell bemusement from billboards in his electorate. The Duttsmobile is back on the road \u201ctalking about the local issues\u201d. You want strong borders and a new parking lot? Get you an MP who can do both. But with the state Labor government having stepped in to solve local issues, complete with Labor branding, as often as possible, it hasn\u2019t left Dutton with a lot of ammunition. And yet, despite two-and-a-half years of campaigning, no one seems sure of whether or not Dickson is done. \u201cLook, the swing is on, that\u2019s just a fact,\u201d another LNP strategist says. \u201cHe\u2019s got visibility across the country, but it\u2019s not all positive.

We\u2019ve got the time and the inclination and the resources. If we manage to win the federal election and topple Dutton? That\u2019s just icing for us in Queensland.\u201d Dutton himself has had to soften his image, now announcing policies, as with the recent proposal for a national sex offender public register, as \u201cnot too hard and not too soft\u201d. The Goldilocks approach to policy is in marked difference to the man who once publicly declared certain news organisations as being \u201cdead\u201d to him, because he didn\u2019t like their reports. A Dutton under electoral pressure is a Dutton who wants to know what everyone thinks. The LNP may think Dutton himself is one of the strongest elements to its campaign. But Labor thinks the same thing. Just for their own campaign. \u201cHas this campaign been perfect? No. No campaign is,\u201d another Labor campaigner says. \u201cAnd we may not pull it off. But you know what will be better than seeing Dutton in the opposition benches? Not seeing Dutton across the benches at all. And best of all, it will be for no other reason than he did it himself.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mention the title to J\u00fcrgen Klopp and he tends to go into meltdown but there are days and there are games when a 29-year-old dream sharpens into focus. Liverpool endured and enjoyed one of those days against Crystal Palace when their manager\u2019s fist-pumping celebrations resurfaced long after he left the Anfield pitch to reinforce the point he is understandably averse to say. The countdown is under way. Liverpool did not perform like title favourites against Roy Hodgson\u2019s dangerous side, who scored as many goals as 10 previous visiting teams to Anfield combined this season yet departed ruing their lack of points, fortune and goalkeeping options. The nature of Liverpool\u2019s 19th victory in 23 league outings, a truly outstanding return, will not have been lost on Pep Guardiola, however. The single-minded pursuit of three more invaluable points, the breaks and the composure shown at 0-1 and 2-2 were not lost on Klopp either. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many ways there are to win a football game but we had pretty much a few of them already,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cI know we are a really good football team but that is not enough. It is really not enough to be a good or a fantastic or even a world-class football team because we are playing in a competition with a couple of world-class football teams and hundreds of fantastic football teams. We have to make sure that we just fight in each game like it\u2019s the last game and the boys did that.

You\u2019re really not one to let bygones be bygones. \u2022 \u201cLies, violence, cruelty \u2026 That\u2019s the world.\u201d You said it, Valjean!",

      "bodyText": "BARCELONA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Lionel Messi came off the bench to inspire Barcelona to a 3-1 win over a dogged Leganes side on Sunday, creating one goal and scoring another to keep the Catalans five points clear at the top of La Liga. Messi, left out of the starting line-up for only the second time this season when fit, was called on with 64 minutes on the clock and the game poised at 1-1 after Leganes forward Martin Braithwaite had cancelled out Ousmane Dembele\u2019s first-half opener with a 57th-minute strike. The Argentine quickly provided the spark Barca needed by firing a venomous shot from the outside the area which was too powerful for goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar to hold, and Luis Suarez pounced to stab home on the rebound in the 71st minute after a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) review. La Liga\u2019s top scorer made sure of the victory in stoppage- time, sweeping across the area and hammering the ball past a helpless Cuellar for his 18th goal of the season in Spain\u2019s top flight, taking leaders Barca on to 46 points, five clear of nearest challengers Atletico Madrid, after 20 games. It took Lionel Messi\u2019s magic to win it, and he came on just as Leganes, thanks to that goal from Martin Braithwaite, believed they could get something from the match. The magician needed just 30 minutes to find an assist, a goal and another win. 90+6 mins: Messi, on a charge, forces a corner he takes himself. Then links up again with Alba, whose centred pass finds Suarez, who can\u2019t beat Cuellar this time. 90+5 mins: Barcelona want more. Rakitic, who has been key to their gaining control of this game, fires a rocket of a shot just wide of the goal. 90+3 mins: That was telepathy between Messi and Alba. There is no better panic button in football than Messi, who has won this game with those two interventions. Alba and Messi combine, exchanging passes twice over, and Messi is found in the box. He has space to fire in a right-foot shot. It\u2019s over. 90 mins: Into time added on, of which there will be seven minutes. There have been plenty of stoppages. 89 mins: Barcelona trying to see this one out and look a little nervy. A wayward pass from Coutinho goes down badly with the crowd. Each one of those must be a pang in his heart. 86 mins: Leganes now on the attack, but Silva is stopped by Pique and the ball is on the edge of the opposite box in a flash. Messi and Malcom almost create something. Meanwhile, El Zhar is on for Leganes, but probably too late for his genius to change the path of this match. 83 mins: Barcelona playing at a tempo that suits them. Leganes sitting off them. Coutinho, a minor player in this half, has a shot blocked. There was a brief flurry when Santos, the Leganes sub, almost found space in the box after another long ball, but Alba recovered his positioning just at the right time. 81 mins: Leganes have lost the fight they showed in that revival at the start of the second half. They are totally scared of Messi, who almost creates another goal for Suarez. This time, the ball is hacked clear. 79 mins: Nearly an amazing goal as Messi and Suarez link up, and the Uruguayan gets the shot in. Then Cuellar, with vengeance on his mind, leaves one on Suarez. The ref didn\u2019t see that one and VAR ignored it, too. 77 mins: Back to that goal. It was allowed to stand as Suarez got there first to a ball that was begging to be hit. Cuellar had just pulled off a tremendous save but couldn\u2019t react quick enough. 75 mins: Valverde might want to take Messi off but he has used up all of his subs. 73 mins: Real confusion over whether the goal stands as Cuellar is given treatment to what looked a damaged arm. The crowd never really got to celebrate properly, one of the pitfalls of VAR. His first real intervention and Messi has created the goal. A thunderous shot and Cuellar spills the ball on to the bar with a fine save, and Suarez bundles in. VAR is called for as Suarez clatters into Cuellar. It will stand. 68 mins: Dembele hobbles round the field to go down the tunnel. This will be Barcelona\u2019s final change as Malcom comes on. Rakitic came on for Arthur before. 65 mins: Dembele is down in the Leganes half. He fell nastily on his left leg as he slipped. That looked painful and he is receiving treatment on his ankle. He doesn\u2019t look capable of continuing. A sad end for the best player on the field. Malcom will come on for Dembele. 64 mins: The cheers mean Messi is on. Alena is off, instead of Coutinho, who will drop into midfield. 62 mins: Another Leganes attack. Mauricio Pellegrino has played this well. It\u2019s as if his team tried to just get through the first half and have preserved their energy for this forward push. 61 mins: Booking for Roberto as Braithwaite makes a marauding run down the middle. Roberto was lucky Pique was on the scene or else that was a red card. 60 mins: Here he comes. The tracksuit is off. 58 mins: First shot, first goal for Leganes. Ridiculous. At least the Messi fans will see Messi now. Poor Pip Coutinho. Wow! The Pulis combo of Nyom and Braithwaite make that goal in a fashion their mentor would approve of. A long ball, and Braithwaite scores after a deflection off Alba. 56 mins: More magic from Dembele takes him past Silva, before some agricultural fouling stops him in his tracks. Alena, who has been decent so far tonight, plays the ball to Suarez, who gets a shot in, but can\u2019t direct it. 54 mins: \u201cMessi, Messi, Messi,\u201d the Messi fans sing. Alena gets a yellow for a late tackle on Omeruo. 52 mins: Messi is warming up, and the crowd finds its voice. There will a few tourists waiting to see if they will get to see the great man. 50 mins: Beautiful pass from Dembele and Roberto is send down the wing, before being fouled by Silva. Dembele playing with the confidence that Coutinho lacks. Barca don\u2019t make much of the free-kick. 49 mins: Magic from Dembele, when a backheeled flick finds its way to Coutinho whose shot is deflected, even if the referee doesn\u2019t spot that Barca are owed a corner. 47 mins: Barcelona resume as they left the first half, with heavy possession but Jonathan Silva tries a long cross to find Braithwaite. Ter Stegen collects to smother the danger. 46 mins: Back underway, and how long do we have to wait until Messi comes on? He needs his fix of goals. And from Charles Antaki: \u201cYou have to wonder what personal misgivings Lu\u00eds Enrique has, or had, about Jordi Alba for the national team - on the showing tonight he\u2019s been pretty fantastic all round. Is there a better left back anywhere at the moment? He can be a bit over-affectionate in the goal celebrations, true, and Enrique looks to be on the less sentimental side.\u201d Emails, first from David Morgan: \u201cDespite all the doom mongering before he left, Liverpool didn\u2019t miss a beat after Coutinho left. And that was even before Van Dijk and Allison were signed. But, of course he was doomed to disappoint at Barcelona where he can never hope to fill the boots of Iniesta and X\u00e1vi.\u201d Reminder of Saturday\u2019s action from La Liga. Real Madrid breathed new life into their stuttering season as they secured a 2-0 La Liga victory at home to Sevilla. Having wasted any number of chances, they were on course to drop further points and leave their manager, Santiago Solari, under increasing pressure, until Casemiro brilliantly curled in from long range in the 78th minute and then Luka Modric added a late second. While they are still truly to join the title race led by Barcelona, the three points maintained the pressure on Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, who later won 3-0 at Huesca. Real\u2019s victory moved them ahead of Sevilla, who fell to fourth. With Sevilla content to attack on the counter from the outset, the hosts dominated possession but struggled to create chances. The second half began in similar fashion, but Modric began to exert greater influence and, as he sent a dipping effort into the side netting on the hour mark, the opening goal felt imminent. Dani Ceballos struck the crossbar from 30 yards before Casemiro gave Real Madrid the lead. Modric then sealed victory in stoppage time. Finding himself in space in the penalty area, the Croatian drew the goalkeeper before curling the ball past inside the near post. 45 mins: Leganes look satisfied that this ended up with just a 1-0 deficit. Barcelona dominated without looking completely on their game. Dembele deserved his goal, which was artfully crafted, while Coutinho seems to be trying a little too hard. 44 mins: Leganes holding on for half-time here but Dembele escapes down the right. The ball comes back for Coutinho but his shot is wide. The pain is apparent on his face. A big chance missed. 42 mins: Another wayward pass from Coutinho. This has not been a good night for him. In fact, with no Messi to shadow him, it\u2019s been poor. This is his big chance. 40 mins: Penalty claim for Suarez! He goes down after Cuellar collides with his right foot. It\u2019s not given, by dint of Suarez having lost the run of the ball. VAR confirms the decision, though Suarez disputes it. He and Cuellar have a nip at each other. 39 mins: K\u00e1ri Tulinius emails in: \u201cI read and hear a lot about how Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s not doing too well at Barcelona, but everytime I see him play, he\u2019s good at pressing as well as creative and sharp in attack. Is there some flaw in his play I\u2019m missing? Enjoy the rest of the match!\u201d He does seem to give the ball away a bit, but then again so does Messi. Dembele just went on a dribbling run there and gave it away when he ran out of options to pass to. 38 mins: If Messi is to be required, then it will be in place of Coutinho, it would seem likely. 36 mins: It\u2019s only been a year since Coutinho arrived but he has a way to go to convince that Liverpool, in using his \u00a3142 huge fee to buy Van Dijk and Alisson, didn\u2019t get the best part of that deal. \u00a3142m! 34 mins: That goal came from Barcelona\u2019s most reliable outlets today, Dembele and Alba. Some intelligence from Coutinho, too, though he follows that up with a wayward pass and the failure to get to a through ball. It isn\u2019t happening for him at Barca, is it? Lovely move, and a goal after Pique starts off with some great skill, and the ball finds itself to Dembele who releases it to Alba. They were queueing up and Dembele finishes. 31 mins: Dembele and Suarez go close to a link-up in an inside-right position. Nice improv from the Frenchman but Suarez can\u2019t keep his shot down. 30 mins: Nyom on the overlap is the outlet for a rare attack, but his cross is miles away from Braithwaite. Omeruo collects the third yellow of the evening for Leganes after a foul on Suarez. Both Tarin and Nyom were already in the book. 28 mins: Leganes look comfortable if incapable of creating a chance. The long ball is the order of the day. More Pulisian overtones. 26 mins: Free-kick for Barca and it is in Messi range. But Suarez can only drill it off the wall, and into the hands of Cuellar. Meanwhile, Nyom and Alba get involved. Alba shoves Nyom who falls to the floor in Oscar-winning fashion. 24 mins: Suarez takes a swing at a shot and it balloons into the crowd. The spectator who catches it takes a selfie with the ball. With another ball, goalkeeper Cuellar is booed as he takes his time with the goal-kick. Time-wasting already. 22 mins: Dembele again looks lively, but his pass is wayward. There is a real player within him, but all the pieces are not quite together. 19 mins: Suarez tries to make a turn on the edge of the box but is stopped in his tracks, as Barcelona build up a head of steam. 17 mins: Dembele, who looks the major danger down the flanks, again makes an escape down the left. Leganes only just clear the danger. 16 mins: No Denis Suarez on the Barca bench; does that mean he is headed to Arsenal? 14 mins: Barcelona almost get Alba down the left flank for an opening but the ball gets stuck under his feet. Then Alena makes a lovely solo run from midfield which is stopped just before he can make the final pass. 12 mins: Busquets is booked for a swipe to the chin of En-Nesyri. That\u2019s an early card to have to protect for the veteran. 11 mins: Do Braithwaite and Nyom discuss the golden days with Tony Pulis? They surely must do. 9 mins: A blazing run by Dembele down the right, but his cut-back is not quite precise enough. Omeuruo was left for dead. 7 mins: A first glimpse of the Dembele skill set, but his magic trick does not set Barcelona off. Braithwaite is booked for a high kick on Pique, having made the type of challenge Tony Pulis would approve of. 6 mins: Leganes keeping their shape here. Allan Nyom, the West Brom and Watford legend, is getting involved. The ball is pressed all the way back to Ter Stegen, but the keeper is typically comfortable on the ball. 4 mins: Coutinho has chance to show his class but his pass is just too long for Roberto to keep in. A slow start to this game and it looks as if Braithwaite will be the target man for Leganes. 2 mins: Sergi Roberto almost got caught dallying by Martin Braithwaite, who has escaped the clutches of Tony Pulis and joined on loan from Middlesbrough. 1 min: And away we go, and the lower tiers of the stand do look somewhat empty. That Coutinho, Dembele and Suarez combo starts together for the first time in attack. The midfield trio of Busquets, Arthur and Ale\u00f1\u00e1 takes the eye for Barcelona. No Rakitic, who takes his place on that star-studded bench. The players are in the tunnel, getting ready for the big one as the Barcelona anthem rings out in what looks a chilly and not particularly full Nou Camp. Rivkaoppenheim tweets in to point out that Levante\u2019s challenge to the result has already been and gone. \u201cThe sole judge of Competition, Carmen Perez, considers in accordance with the regulations in effect in the RFEF that the complaint presented by Levante UD at 9:33 am on this Friday has been received outside the established deadline,\u201d a statement from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) read on Friday. \u201cOnce the complaint and the corresponding allegations have been studied, the single judge of Competition has decided to maintain the result of the tie and keep FC Barcelona in the draw for the quarter-finals of this afternoon for the reasons previously stated.\u201d Barca will play Sevilla in the semis. A reminder that last week\u2019s Copa del Rey win over Levante may not stand for Barcelona. Memories of the teams\u2019 last meeting. Last-placed Legan\u00e9s came from behind to beat Barcelona and hand the defending La Liga champions their second setback in four days. Philippe Coutinho opened the scoring early, but the hosts rallied with goals in three second-half minutes to earn their first win in six league games. Legan\u00e9s\u2019 winner came thanks to a blunder by Gerard Piqu\u00e9, who misplayed a clearance inside the area. \u00d3scar Rodr\u00edguez, a former member of Real Madrid\u2019s youth teams who is on loan with Legan\u00e9s, took advantage of Piqu\u00e9\u2019s uncharacteristic mistake to score the 52nd-minute winner. It came just after Nabil El Zhar had equalised with a header from close range following a long ball into the Barcelona area. The Legan\u00e9s goalkeeper, Iv\u00e1n Cu\u00e9llar, made a series of great saves near the end to preserve the victory. The Madrid side had never earned a point against Barcelona in their three seasons in the first division, and this was their first win of this campaign and moved them out of the bottom three. Bar\u00e7a manager Ernesto Valverde hinted Messi might sit this one out in his preview press conference. It\u2019s possible that he might not play one of the upcoming games. We\u2019re reaching the point when we start to count down matches. We need to be stronger than ever to achieve our objectives. The fixture list is tough, we know this month is tough. We\u2019ll have to make some changes and look at certain situations. We need to be smart when rotating. In analogue fashion. Barcelona team: Ter Stegen; Sergi Roberto, Piqu\u00e9, Vermaelen, Jordi Alba; Busquets, Arthur, Ale\u00f1\u00e1; Coutinho, Dembele, Su\u00e1rez Legan\u00e9s team: Cu\u00e9llar; Nyom, Tar\u00edn, Siovas, Omeruo, Jonathan Silva; Recio, Vesga, \u00d3scar; En-Nesyri, Braithwaite Here are the teams. Just as Messi is benched, El Zhar gets the same treatment. This looks a formality for Barcelona, with Legan\u00e9s one of the strugglers towards the bottom of the table but that ignores what happened when last they met. Along with Real Betis, Legan\u00e9s are one of two sides to beat Bar\u00e7a in La Liga. That was back in September, when Mauricio Pellegrino\u2019s team began the day bottom of the table yet shocked the champions with a 2-1 win. Two Liverpool luminaries were on the scoresheet in Philippe Coutinho and Nabil El Zhar, the latter of whom might be recalled by Kopites doing the \u201cten-year challenge\u201d, and his equaliser was followed 68 seconds later by Oscar Rodriguez\u2019s winner. Not only that, but Legan\u00e9s beat Real Madrid this week in the Copa del Rey, with the goalscorer being Martin Braithwaite, the Danish forward whose name sounds like someone who was in the year above at school. Actually, thinking on all that and the fact that Lionel Messi doesn\u2019t start, this is happening. It is on.",

      "bodyText": "Reaching the last eight of Europe may yet prove the easy bit for those involved in this season\u2019s quarter-finals. With the United Kingdom currently due to leave the European Union on that same March weekend, there is potential for travel disruption although tournament organisers say that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, they have been assured that free movement of fans or players will not be immediately affected. With at least half of the quarter-finals in the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup set to involve cross-border flights either to or from Europe, however, officials from European Professional Club Rugby are keeping a close watch on Brexit developments. EPCR\u2019s chairman, Simon Halliday, says he hopes no one will be left \u201csitting on the tarmac\u201d and remains optimistic neither competition will be undermined. Alongside an intriguing list of Champions Cup quarter-finals due to be staged in London, Paris, Dublin and Edinburgh, nevertheless, there could be an issue in the Challenge Cup where Northampton and Bristol are both scheduled to play games in France. \u201cThe Challenge Cup might be the bigger challenge,\u201d said Halliday. \u201cNorthampton travelling to Clermont and Bristol going to La Rochelle could be an issue.\u201d Few other Englishmen, however, will need to worry unduly about being stranded abroad. For the second successive season there is just one English club \u2013 Saracens \u2013 in the last eight of the Champions Cup, in stark contrast to the Pro14 which boasts no fewer than five representatives including both Scotland\u2019s participants, Edinburgh and Glasgow. It is the first time two Scottish teams have made the knockout stages and the first time since 2011-12 France and England have collectively contributed only three quarter-finalists. Even before Wasps and Bath succumbed to round-six defeats, it was already a campaign for most to forget. Four sides \u2013 Wasps, Gloucester, Leicester and Newcastle \u2013 ended up at the bottom of their pools, with Wales\u2019s teams also with nothing to shout about. The Welsh regions lost 17 of their 24 matches across both competitions and now have no representatives in the knockout stages. All four Irish provinces, in contrast, have something to look forward to; in this season\u2019s Champions Cup their record against English sides reads P10 W9 D 1 L0, with none of England\u2019s sides winning in Ireland in last season\u2019s tournament either. The argument that the Irish system works better than its English equivalent grows harder to dispute by the day. How exactly to reverse the tide is something to be debated between now and England\u2019s trip to face Ireland next week in the opening round of the Six Nations. It is certainly indicative of Irish strength in depth that Munster\u2019s Tadhg Beirne, who won another man of the match award against Exeter, is highly unlikely to start against England despite being among the most effective breakdown operators in Europe. It is premature, nevertheless, to say the Premiership is totally snookered. Saracens may be lone English wolves in the last eight but their top seeding will earn them a home semi-final should they beat Glasgow at Allianz Park in the quarter-finals. Before a ball was kicked it was not hard to visualise them facing either Leinster or Racing 92 in the final in Newcastle on 11 May and that prospect remains very much alive. Saracens, with Maro Itoje and the Vunipola brothers back fit again, also have the comfort of knowing they beat the Warriors at the same stage two years ago and defeated them twice in this season\u2019s pool stages. To rewrite that script Glasgow will have to find a way of matching their opponents\u2019 pack strength for the full 80 minutes, having proved unable to sustain their first-quarter blitz in north London on Saturday. The prospects of Leinster defending their title on 11 May, have also been significantly enhanced by the confirmation of their home draw against Ulster, with Toulouse opting not to push on for a try bonus point against Bath and settling for a more convenient trip to Paris to face Racing 92. Edinburgh\u2019s reward for winning five of their six pool games is a home tie against Munster, narrow 9-7 victors over Exeter in a titanic struggle in Limerick. The Chiefs, however, believe their latest near-miss will stand them in good stead in the years ahead. \u201cI know people are going to say that Exeter have failed again but we haven\u2019t had that many attempts at this,\u201d said Rob Baxter, the director of rugby. \u201cThe players are of the right age and they are going to get better.\u201d Not everything in Europe should be viewed along nationalistic lines: two of the stand-out players in Europe so far this season have been Fijian, with Bill Mata of Edinburgh and Racing\u2019s Leone Nakarawa good enough to grace any pack in the world.

Top stories The US president, Donald Trump, has raised the possibility of one day granting amnesty to migrants living in the US illegally, after Democrats rejected his latest plan to fund a wall along the southern border and reopen the US government. In a remark that angered Republicans while not being taken seriously by Democrats, Trump suggested legal status could be given to millions of undocumented people as part of a future grand bargain on American immigration law. The president floated the idea in a tweet on Sunday that stressed he was, for now, only offering to extend legal protections for some refugees and people who were brought to the US illegally as children. The US is now more than four weeks into its longest government shutdown. Australia\u2019s home affairs department is seeking to calm concerns about the encryption legislation rushed through parliament at the end of 2018, promising to help pay for the costs of new surveillance capabilities and to consult the tech industry on implementation. This month the department has contacted industry participants seeking help to write guidelines for the new regime. But despite the assurances, the industry fears that without further amendments to clarify the scope of \u201csystemic weaknesses\u201d, the notices to build new capabilities will compromise other tech users. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation has funded its first project. The not-for-profit that was awarded a controversial $443.3m grant for the Great Barrier Reef by the Turnbull government will on Monday announce a research survey that will be carried out by a government agency. A 25-day health survey of remote parts of the reef by the Australian Institute of Marine Science is the first venture awarded money through the Reef Trust partnership set up by the government last year. The announcement comes after publication of an official audit last week that found serious failings in departmental processes when the government selected the foundation without a competitive tender.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is expected to reject calls to forge a cross-party consensus on Brexit when she lays out her plan B to parliament on Monday, choosing instead to back new diplomatic efforts in Brussels to renegotiate the Irish backstop. The prime minister held a conference call with her bitterly divided cabinet from the country retreat of Chequers on Sunday evening. Cabinet sources said the consensus on the 90-minute call was to renew efforts to find acceptable changes to the backstop arrangement but that the conversation was light on specifics. One said there were \u201cno actual solutions\u201d proposed during the call. \u201cIt is difficult to know \u2013 as ever \u2013 what she will do,\u201d another said. \u201cBut the broad agreement is on the need to bring DUP and Tory rebels on board.\u201d Despite her claim in the wake of last week\u2019s significant defeat in parliament that she would speak to \u201csenior parliamentarians\u201d from all parties to seek a compromise, government sources insisted her overriding priority was to prevent a historic split in the Tory party. Several senior Conservative MPs have suggested they could form a breakaway party if May opted to support a customs union \u2013 one of Labour\u2019s central demands, which is also backed by Tory supporters of a Norway-style soft Brexit. Whitehall sources said the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, had counselled her to consider a customs union after last week\u2019s catastrophic defeat, when her deal was rejected by an overwhelming majority of 230 votes. But when the government tables a formal statement on Monday, setting out its next steps, it is instead expected to focus on seeking changes to the Irish backstop in order to win over Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s European Research Group and the DUP. The prime minister could then travel to Brussels as early as Monday evening \u2013 though Downing Street denied it would be that soon. May\u2019s move comes as fresh polling evidence suggests the public are sanguine about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. A poll by ICM conducted after last week\u2019s government defeat and seen by the Guardian asked voters what should happen next. The most popular option, backed by 28% of voters, was a no-deal Brexit. Demonstrating the divide in public opinion, the next most popular option, supported by 24% of the public, is to start the process of holding a second referendum. In the representative online poll of 2,046 adults between 16\u201318 January, just 8% thought May should press ahead with trying to win support for her deal in parliament, while 11% thought she should call a general election. Earlier on Sunday, Liam Fox said it was \u201cthe overwhelming view\u201d among party colleagues that the prime minister\u2019s deal was salvageable if she could get change on the backstop. \u201cThat seems to me to be the area that we\u2019re coalescing around,\u201d the international trade secretary said. \u201cA lot of my colleagues in the House of Commons have said that if we make changes on the backstop we\u2019d be willing to vote for the agreement.\u201d However, Downing Street and Irish government sources poured cold water on reports that the government was considering the possibility of a joint UK-Irish treaty that would replace the backstop. The plan is favoured by some hard Brexiters, including the former cabinet minister Owen Paterson, and was given some weight by Fox, who said he favoured a \u201cdifferent mechanism\u201d to prevent a hard border. \u201cOf course both Ireland and the United Kingdom have both said that we don\u2019t want to see a hard border and the Irish prime minister has said in the event of no deal, he wouldn\u2019t want to see a hard border,\u201d Fox said. \u201cNow given that we\u2019re in that same place that should be the area that we need to look to find some compromise.\u201d However, a Downing Street source said the plan was \u201cnot one we recognise\u201d. Irish sources said the government would reject any approach from May for a bilateral side deal, calling the idea a \u201cnon-starter\u201d and saying the EU was very clear the withdrawal agreement could not be reopened unless May changed her red lines. A No 10 source also dismissed reports that the Good Friday agreement could be amended to add a clause pledging there would be no hard border, saying it was not under consideration and had not been discussed on the call.

Tory chair Brandon Lewis emailed all Conservative members on Sunday asking for donations with the subject line \u201cCorbyn wants an election,\u201d though he later insisted the party was preparing for local elections in May. Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has stepped up his calls for article 50 to be extended for a year, so that a series of citizens\u2019 assemblies could be held to determine what should happen next. \u201cParliament must inflict a second defeat on the government \u2013 by voting next Tuesday to extend article 50 for a year.

Michele Campagnaro went close on the right but he coughed the ball up and Leinster could all too easily clear their lines \u2013 indeed, a feature of the first half was the carelessness with which the home side treated the ball. With little more than pride to play for Wasps were much better after the interval and Campagnaro went close again before Hughes powered over under the posts. Leinster were playing within themselves but added a third try through Cronin \u2013 another driving lineout \u2013 before Robson struck with a delightful show and go, selling Andrew Porter the dummy. Leinster added a fine fourth, finished by the replacement Noel Reid after a burst up the middle by the replacement Cian Healy before Marcus Watson finished off for Wasps in the corner late on. Elsewhere in the pool Toulouse squeezed past Bath 23-17 ensuring they face an away trip to Racing 92. A bonus point win would have meant an away trip to Leinster so it is probably not surprising it did not materialise.",

      "bodyText": "West Indies\u2019 interim head coach, Richard Pybus, claims to have a near Zen-like focus leading into Wednesday\u2019s first Test despite his recent appointment causing the latest round of political infighting in the Caribbean. After three years as director of cricket the Englishman returned as a high performance director last year before now stepping into a nine-month tenure as head coach following Stuart Law\u2019s switch to Middlesex and an interim spell for the team under Nic Pothas. The appointment appears to have been made unilaterally by the West Indies Cricket Board president, Dave Cameron \u2013 Pybus was not on the original shortlist drawn up by the current director of cricket, Jimmy Adams \u2013 and it prompted the former captain Darren Sammy to offer a withering assessment of his credentials on social media. The Leeward Islands president, Enoch Lewis, has now been referred to the board\u2019s ethics committee after speaking out publicly too, having been the one vote against when Cameron ran his decision past the six territories that make up West Indies. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the landscape.

The Sports Direct boss is understood to have held talks with suppliers to the ailing business about a rescue deal, which could see him link the HMV brand to other parts of his high street empire including House of Fraser, Sports Direct or potentially Game Digital, in which Sports Direct owns a 25% stake. A successful deal for HMV\u2019s 125 stores would see Ashley grab another major slice of the high street following Sports Direct\u2019s acquisition of the bike specialist Evans Cycles in October and department store chain House of Fraser in August, both of which were bought out of administration. While Ashley takes a look at many potential retail deals, and Sports Direct holds stakes in multiple high street chains including the struggling French Connection and Debenhams, \u200esources told Sky News \u2013 which first reported Ashley\u2019s interest in HMV \u2013 that he was serious about buying the music retailer. Ashley has also made clear his interest in Debenhams, which is seeking to refinance its debts by the end of this month after a torrid 2018. Ashley has offered to bail the department store chain out with a \u00a340m loan on terms that would give him the whip hand over the company, in which Sports Direct already owns a near 30% stake. The tycoon has also been linked with a potential bid for Hamleys, the toy retailer, which was put up for sale by its Chinese owner, C.banner in October. It reported a \u00a39.2m loss the year to 31 December 2017, compared with a \u00a31.7m profit the previous year. Ashley is understood to have tabled a bid to HMV\u2019s administrators at KPMG last week, as have a number of interested parties thought to include Elliott Advisors, which bought the Waterstones bookstore chain last year. KPMG declined to comment, while Sports Direct did not respond to a request for comment. A North American music retailer is also said to have expressed an interest in some HMV sites. One source said this could be Sunrise Records, which took over about 70 HMV stores in Canada after the chain went bust there in 2017. Hopes of a rescue of the entire group, which includes nine Fopp stores, are slim amid Brexit uncertainty, falling DVD sales and heavy competition from Amazon and the supermarkets. HMV\u2019s 125 UK stores remain open while talks with suppliers and potential buyers continue.

However, several music industry experts have said that music labels and film companies would be reluctant to see the last major high street home entertainment chain disappear, handing more power to Amazon.

The economic fears, weak consumer market and structural changes have hit profits and sales at traditional chains and put a dampener on private equity interest in the retail sector, leaving Ashley the opportunity to pick up well-known brands relatively cheaply.

      "bodyText": "A brutal crackdown in Zimbabwe that has followed protests against fuel price rises is \u201cjust a foretaste of things to come\u201d, the president\u2019s spokesman has said. The harsh words will increase concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in the poor southern African country, coming after a week in which police and soldiers have beaten civilians, shot 12 people dead and detained at least 600 people, many without charge. \u201c[The] government will not stand by while such narrow interests play out so violently,\u201d President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s spokesman George Charamba told the state-controlled Sunday Mail newspaper. The repression followed a national strike called by unions after the government ordered a massive fuel price hike eight days ago. The price rise, of about 250%, is the latest blow to millions of citizens who are increasingly unable to buy basics such as fuel, food and medicines. Inflation is running at 40% \u2013 its highest rate since hyperinflation forced Zimbabwe to abandon its currency 10 years ago in favour of dollars, electronic cash and \u201cbond notes\u201d issued by the central bank. The violence is the worst seen in Zimbabwe for a decade, prompting many to make comparisons with the worst days of the 37-year rule of the autocratic former president Robert Mugabe. The government has called the unrest \u201cterrorism\u201d and blamed the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Mnangagwa, a ruling Zanu-PF party stalwart, took power when Mugabe was ousted in a military takeover in November 2017 and then won contested elections last year. On Sunday the president, who has been touring central Asia, Russia and Europe in a bid to drum up investment for the country\u2019s crippled economy, said he would return to Zimbabwe instead of attending this week\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cIn light of the economic situation, I will be returning home \u2026 The first priority is to get Zimbabwe calm, stable and working again,\u201d Mnangagwa tweeted. The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said it treated 68 gunshot wounds and 100-plus other cases of \u201cassaults with sharp objects, booted feet, baton sticks\u201d last week. There were further reports of violence over the weekend, as army and police patrols searched hundreds of homes in Harare, the capital, for property stolen in outbreaks of looting last week. Large numbers of people remain missing \u2013 including senior union officials involved in organising the three-day shutdown. Armed police were also reported to have surrounded the homes of senior officials and parliamentarians from the MDC. Chalton Hwende, the MDC representative for Kuwadzana East, a poor area on the outskirts of Harare, said six opposition lawmakers were already in custody. Some have been charged with inciting violence, though the party was careful to call for peaceful protests and was not involved in the organisation of the shutdown. \u201cThis is all just an excuse to destroy the MDC. Mugabe was just the face of the machine. We always expected things to get worse,\u201d Hwende said. Much of the repression has been concentrated in poor neighbourhoods and satellite towns of Harare, such as Chitungwiza and Ruwa, which voted heavily for the MDC in the elections last July. On Saturday, a series of funerals brought hundreds on to the streets. Neighbours of a 35-year-old shot on the second day of the crackdown described \u201cunidentified [people] monitoring the dead man\u2019s family\u201d. Kelvin Tinashe Choto, 22, was shot in the head while watching the protests in Harare. \u201cHe was our future,\u201d said his father, Julius Choto, as the family buried him in Chitungwiza on Saturday. \u201cI have been robbed.

Mugabe\u2019s rule left Zimbabwe with vast debts, a crumbling infrastructure and soaring unemployment, especially among young people. Most of its 16 million people live hand-to-mouth, or survive on remittances from the extensive diaspora. Albert Taurai, in hospital in Harare with a broken spine, said he had gone to buy food when he was attacked by a group of armed men in plain clothes. They struck him with iron bars on the back, thighs and ankles, saying \u201cZimbabwe will never be shut down\u201d. \u201cI have seen both Mugabe and Mnangagwa. This just is worse than Mugabe,\u201d Taurai, 46, said.",

While Erik Lamela is a fine replacement for Son, Fernando Llorente will not turn and run with the ball as Kane is able to do, so one expects Spurs\u2019 attacks to be a little slower than they might ordinarily be. </p> <p>Fulham may just sense an opportunity to get something out of this game. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side certainly need the points after Newcastle\u2019s victory over Cardiff lifted them out of the relegation zone and seven points clear of Fulham. Ryan Babel has been brought in to try and create more opportunities for Aleksandar Mitrovic, whose consistent form and regular goals offer hope that the Cottagers can turn things around, even if they ship goals with alarming regularity. Let\u2019s hope the burly striker has put his yoga bust-up behind him and is ready to focus on today\u2019s game. </p> <p>And for what it\u2019s worth, I think Babel is a decent addition. He\u2019s been a more mature and hardworking presence on the flanks for the Netherlands in their return to form and does not appear to have lost much pace, even at 32. As for Spurs, with Arsenal and Manchester United lingering with intent outside the top four, they need to keep their nerve at Craven Cottage and show that they can hold it together during the run-in. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/mauricio-pochettino-no-need-to-change-philosophy-absence-kane-son\">Mauricio Pochettino says there is no need to change Spurs\u2019 philosophy</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T15:10:52.464Z\">at 3.10pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with the report from Craven Cottage. Thanks for your emails and tweets. Have a good evening. Nkoudou, whose brilliant cross created the winner, has immediately got into the dressing room and fumbled around for his phone before tweeting this: It\u2019s his first tweet since August. He just wants to people to notice him. And they did today. Not sure this tweet was necessary, mind. Here\u2019s Claudio Ranieri: \u201cIt was a good match. The first half was fantastic for us. We scored a goal and the perhaps we should have had a penalty. In the second half we tried to do our best but we lack experience. We had a free-kick with one minute to go and we put the ball into the box. Why? I shout: \u2018Take the ball to the corner!\u2019 We have to continue to fight. I am very happy with Ryan Babel. He made a very good first half. He needs more time to be fit. I am confident. I never lose my confidence about the team.\u201d He\u2019s quite chipper considering he\u2019s just had a point swiped from his grasp in the dying seconds. Graeme Sounness and Jamie Redknapp are tearing into Fulham\u2019s defence for not defending the winning goal better. Perhaps Bryan could have done better to get in front of Winks but I still think the cross was an absolute peach. Bryan may well have scored an own goal if he\u2019d got in front of him. The match-winner, Harry Winks, speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s a great moment and a win that we needed. I can\u2019t remember the last time I scored [Vertonghen reminds him that it was two years ago]. We needed to bounce back after United. We knew it would be tough but we dug in and did our best.\u201d Then Vertonghen speaks: \u201cErik Dier came on and that gave Harry the freedom to play higher up the pitch. It was a great cross from Nkoudou and Harry did the rest. We don\u2019t want to draw this season,\u201d he laughs. They haven\u2019t drawn once. \u201cWe just want to win games. We had to push to keep us up there.\u201d Tottenham showed a great deal of character there \u2013 they were the very opposite of Spursy. They fought back gamely and despite having a misfiring striker on the pitch, still huffed and puffed sufficiently to blow Fulham down. Tottenham\u2019s squad is beginning to look awfully thin, though, and Alli\u2019s hamstring injury may force Pochettino to bang on Daniel Levy\u2019s door and demand a bit of cash to get someone, anyone, in while the transfer window is still open. Ian Copestake\u2019s back: \u201cRe: 73rd minute: did Mitrovic go down in slow motion as the photo suggests while being repeatedly shot by advancing rebels before the helicopter could reach him? It might not have helped his cause.\u201d Yeah, something like that Ian. And that\u2019s that. Fulham worked so hard to earn a point but Spurs were worth their narrow win. They improved in the second half and kept the pressure on. Fulham missed Babel when he went off and Mitrovic grew isolated. Llorente will be a relieved man having scored an own goal and missed a handful of chances. Here\u2019s how the Premier League table looks: 90+4 min: A Harry has his say on this game but it\u2019s Harry Winks, not Kane. It came after a wonderful cross from the left by Nkoudou, who landed the ball on Winks\u2019s head five yards from goal. The youngster simply couldn\u2019t miss. And didn\u2019t. Ranieri looks horrified but it was a moment of quality from the Spurs outcast Nkoudou that created the goal. Winks wins it! 90 min: Lloris makes a hash of a clearance that lands at Chambers\u2019 feet near the halfway line. He has a pop at goal but it\u2019s blocked and Spurs break. Both sides want the win here it seems. 89 min: Llorente has a chance to get a shot away as the ball squirts through to him in the penalty area but La Marchand puts the Spaniard under pressure and he takes a heavy touch and tumbles to the turf like a rag doll. It\u2019s really not been his day. 88 min: Some more contenders for the failed-potential XI: For more on that particular story read here. 87 min: Spurs are pinging the ball around the edge of the Fulham box but the home team are working like terriers to make sure there are no gaps in their massed ranks of defenders. 85 min: Nkoudou is on in place of Alli. I believe he last played for Spurs in 1897. 84 min: But Dier calmly steps in and wins back possession. But then Fulham come back at Tottenham as Christie drives forwards with the ball from the right. But he gets to the edge of the box and overhits his pass in to Mitrovic, who hangs his head in disgust. 82 min: Alli clutches his hamstring as he tumbles into the hoardings on the touchline. It\u2019s gone pop there. This is bad news for Spurs. He\u2019ll be out for a few weeks by the looks of it. Spurs are down to 10 and Fulham are attacking \u2026 81 min: Seri is off and Ciss\u00e9 is on for Fulham. Meanwhile, Christie has another nibble at Rose and concedes a free-kick over by the left touchline. Rose whips in a beautiful cross that Llorente only has to connect with solidly to head home \u2026 but he doesn\u2019t move his head quick enough and the ball grazes his forehead and goes wide. That was a poor miss. Fulham survive \u2026 80 min: Christie is late into a tackle with Rose just outside the box. It should be a booking for the Fulham wing-back but Craig Pawson sees it differently and books an incredulous Rose for diving. Replays show it was a clear foul. Fulham are lucky and Rose is very unlucky. 78 min: Dier has come on for Lamela. Are Spurs settling for the point or do they just lack options? 77 min: \u201cDid Opta weigh in on the Sessegnon-for-Babel substitution thusly? Ryan the Elder (32) is practically old enough to be Ryan the Younger\u2019s (18) father. Generations,\u201d writes Peter Oh. Fulham, meanwhile, are scrapping away and the effect has been to disrupt Tottenham\u2019s improved passing game. It\u2019s all rather bitty. 76 min: Fulham have conceded 13 goals in the last 15 minutes of matches this season. Buckle up Fulham fans! 75 min: And then Seri gets a yellow card for a tackle that would have been applauded in 1973 but going through the back of Llorente and hooking the ball away is a bookable offence in 2019. 73 min: Mitrovic is also getting frustrated. He gets involved in a wrestling match with Sanchez and both players drag each other to the turf after coming together like rutting stags. Both get booked for their trouble too. 72 min: Schurrle is replaced by Kebano. That was necessary. Schurrle has been playing hide and seek this half and Mitrovic is isolated. 70 min: Ream slides in and prevents Trippier from using his cultured right foot to whip a cross in. Spurs are prepared to play patiently when required though. Winks dinks a ball to the back post, Fulham clear for a corner. It\u2019s curled in to the near post but Sergio Rico does well to punch clear. \u201cI can\u2019t think of failed-potential XI as such,\u201d writes Ben Oates. \u201cDefenders don\u2019t seem to get hyped up as much, but an absurdly attacking line-up of Denilson(not Arsenal\u2019s), Cassano, Adriano, Freddy Adu, Ariel Ortega with Michael Johnson bringing up the rear is a decent start.\u201d 69 min: Fulham are gradually working their way back into the game. Sanchez and Mitrovic are having a ding-dong battle but since Babel has gone off Mitrovic\u2019s support has gone awol. Schurrle is nowhere to be seen and Sessegnon is staying out wide. 66 min: Seri finds Sessegnon in space on the left-hand side but the young scamp has drifted offside. He\u2019d snuck in behind Trippier then too. \u201cAntonio Cassano could be in the failed-potential XI team,\u201d writes Ed Rostron. \u201cSublime technique, thrilling flair for the unexpected, wasted his peak years on [bedroom gymnastics] and cake in a Madrid hotel room. Well, \u2018wasted\u2019 might not be the right word.\u201d 65 min: A failed potential XI contender, comprising solely of Toffees: No room for Billy Kenny? 63 min: Christie and Rose clash in the Fulham area. There\u2019s half-hearted shout for a penalty by Spurs but Pawson waves it away. 62 min: The corner comes to nothing but Spurs regain possession and are all over Fulham here now. The home team are chasing shadows. They can\u2019t get a touch. 59 min: Rose cuts inside from the left touchline and has eyes on goal. He races into the penalty area and cocks his right boot, only to see his shot clatter off the outstretched leg of Odoi and on to the crossbar and out for a corner. Thud! What an important touch that was by the Fulham defender. 57 min: The Spurs fans are in fine voice now and their team are playing with a similarly perky rhythm, popping the ball around much quicker and moving with more urgency. Trippier tries to send Alli through in the inside-right channel but his ball is just a yard too quick for his teammate. 56 min: Babel is replaced by Sessegnon. That\u2019s not a reflection on his quality of play so far in this match, just his fitness. 54 min: Fulham have a shout for a penalty turned down as Lloris does very well to get to the ball ahead of Mitrovic. He makes clean contact and then Spurs break \u2026 Rico flaps at a cross and Eriksen has a pop at goal from 10 yards but his shot is blocked and Fulham escape. They\u2019re wobbling now though. That\u2019s more like it from Alli \u2026 but my oh my that was terrible defending from Fulham. Ream had a load of time to hook the ball clear on the edge of the box but took a swing and a miss when it appeared easier to make contact. Eriksen picked up possession and floated the ball to Alli, who headed home with aplomb from eight yards. 49 min: Winks tries to loft the ball into the channel for Llorente, who sets off on a Kane-like run into the channel before taking one look at how fast the ball is moving and deciding to put the brakes on and roll his eyes instead. 48 min: Babel looks capable of bouncing any Spurs player off the ball. He\u2019s certainly learned how to use his body in his wilderness years. 46 min: Odoi diligently stands his ground under pressure in the corner. And buys a throw-in after cleverly knocking the ball against Rose. Spurs come back at Fulham though, who will look to crank up the pressure. 45 min: There are no changes. Here we go. Let\u2019s hope it is as entertaining as the first half was. What can Spurs do to turn this round? There\u2019s not a lot on their bench. Pochettino did say he might consider playing Alli as a fake nine. He\u2019s done a good job of playing as an invisible 10 so far. He needs to get closer to Llorente. Rose and Trippier need to push on too. Llorente is strong in the air. A few crosses wouldn\u2019t go amiss. \u201cOn the subject of Babel, I always have a massive soft spot for players who were considered the next big thing but never reached their full potential (although I imagine that for loads of them, it\u2019s probably due to their having terrible personalities and work ethics),\u201d writes Ed Mattille. \u201cQuaresma is one of my favourites, for example. Might I suggest a make-your-team-of-11-stars-who-failed-miserably challenge?\u201d Readers? A tenuous Spurs link but an entertaining interview all the same: Well, that was entertaining. Fulham are worth their lead even if it took Llorente to score the goal for them. Fulham have played the best football and considering he is supposed to be struggling for match-fitness, Babel had a cracking first half, as did Mitrovic. Fulham\u2019s defence was solid too. 45 min: Spurs win a corner \u2026 but Eriksen\u2019s attempted centre sums up this first half for Spurs by dribbling into the sidenetting as though a toddler has taken it. 43 min: Fulham are all over Spurs here. Chambers thinks he\u2019s Messi for a moment and sends Babel through on goal with a backheel but as the fired-up red-head shoots, Vetonghen slides in and deflects the ball wide for a corner. Seri drills the dead ball to the back post, where Schurrle lofts it back in and over to Seri. He dinks the ball into the box and Chambers fires at goal but his shot canons off someone and into Lloris\u2019s arms. 41 min: Babel gathers the ball on the left and shuffles wuickly up the line before dinking a lovely ball to Schurrle on the back post. the German cocks his foot and clatters a volley at Lloris, whose strong hand claws the ball away. Mitrovic heads the ball in \u2026 but he\u2019s offside. That was a lovely move \u2026 and Babel is doing the business here. 39 min: Christie curls in a delicious right-footed cross that Babel leaps to reach by the penalty spot but the ball glances off the forward\u2019s head and lands over the bar by about six inches. He\u2019s getting closer \u2026 \u201cMy respect, thanks and love for Benitez is very nearly unlimited. But for all his tactical abilities, he never seemed to be quite so hot at developing raw young players,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cI had a lot of time for Babel, but (it pains me to admit it), Benitez was probably the wrong manager for him at that time. I always felt that, had he gone to Arsenal, Wenger would have turned him into an absolute star.\u201d I wrote something similar about Babel nine years ago. Has it aged well? I\u2019m not sure: 38 min: Ranieri will be very happy with what he is seeing from his team. Pochettino, meanwhile, will want to see more from Alli, who has struggled to link up with Llorente at all. 36 min: It\u2019s all got a bit scrappy, which will suit Fulham. Spurs can\u2019t stitch together passes with any regularity. Schurrle is unlucky to concede a corner as the ball is drilled into him miles from his own goal. The ball pings off him and out for a corner. Eriksen swings it in but Mitrovic leaps above all others and clears for Fulham. 33 min: The barrel-chested Mitrovic holds the ball up brilliantly and then releases Bryan up the left wing with a clever backheel. Bryan clips the ball towards Schurrle on the back post but Rose clears for a corner, from which Spurs manage to avoid conceding an own goal thanks to Lloris taking matters into his own hands and stepping out to punch clear. 32 min: Eriksen fizzes it in at the near post. A huge cry of \u201cAWAAAY!\u201d goes up and Le Marchand obliges with a firm header upfield. Then Alderweireld drills a delicious crossfield ball all of 40 yards to Trippier on the right. His cross is deflected out for a corner, which Fulham defend successfully once more. 30 min: Winks tries to slalom his way through the Fulham defence as Spurs apply the pressure. He shimmies past one defender but is halted by Ream. Fulham\u2019s defence has been (and let\u2019s whisper it) reasonably solid so far. Christie concedes a corner after some nice interplay between Winks and Rose. 27 min: Babel clatters a shot wide from the inside left channel. It was only a half chance but he did well to get it away. He looks sprightly for 32 years old. Maybe it\u2019s all that time spent playing in places where the food is good and the weather is fine. 25 min: Benjamin Oates writes: \u201cIn my workday boredom, I\u2019ve decided to pick a played for both Fulham/Tottenham 6-a-side team. In a typically Spursy attack-heavy team, with have Adel Taarabt in goal (size is the main reason here), Sean Davis as a one-man backline, Scott Parker and Clint Dempsey in midfield with Dimitar Berbatov and Alan Mullery leading the line. Steed Malbranque is sub/physio/waterboy/spokeperson should any drama arise.\u201d Parker will be doing all the work in that team Ben. Poor Scott. 23 min: Llorente almost atones for his own goal within minutes, but his header from 10 yards goes straight at Sergio Rico, stinging the keeper\u2019s palms before bouncing away. In fact, it came off Llorente\u2019s shoulder after a delicious delivery from Vertonghen on the left that arced in at the striker. 21 min: Lamela drives into the box and has a chance to shoot when 18 yards out but instead tries to square the ball with the outside of his left foot to Llorente, who is about five yards behind the ball. 19 min: Spurs had looked particularly nervy when defending the previous corners. Fulham players had grouped together in one clump, making it difficult to get close to them. A Tinkerman tactic that appears to have worked a treat. The man brought in to score for Spurs in Kane\u2019s absence \u2026 scores for Fulham. Oh dear! A corner came in from the right and Llorente was unsighted as the ball came past Schurrle and doinked off his right leg and in at the near post. Game on! 14 min: Another corner for Fulham after Joe Bryan\u2019s cross is deflected wide. The ball is swung in from the right and Mitrovic jumps but appears to have his shirt pulled by Vertonghen as the defender falls, taking the Fulham striker with him. That looked like a penalty to me but the area was so packed it was probably hard for Craig Pawson to get a good sight of it. 12 min: From the resulting corner Seri hoiks over the bar after Spurs make a meal of clearing the ball. 11 min: Mitrovic flicks the ball on for Babel, who does brilliantly to shrug off Sanchez and hare into the box \u2026 but as he closes in on Lloris, Sanchez has another nibble and his shot at the near-post is taken under pressure and the Spurs keeper does well to turn it wide. What a chance to make an impact. Babel looked sharp there. Should he have scored? Perhaps. 9 min: Alderweireld drives a lovely pass forwards into the right-channel for Alli, who collects the ball and scampers into the area. But as he turns inside Le Marchand nicks the ball off hiss toe with impeccable timing and clears the danger. 8 min: Spurs are gathering a head of steam. Trippier collects the ball on the right wing and shapes to cross but instead cleverly cuts the ball back to Eriksen on the edge of the box. On his right foot this time, he fizzes a shot at goal that deflects off a defender and goes out for a corner \u2013 a corner that is cleared easily at the near post. 7 min: Eriksen gets a spare yard in midfield and fancies a shot at goal from 25 yards. He looks up and sets his sights \u2026 but slices his left-footed shot harmlessly wide. 6 min: \u2026 but clatters a low, disappointing, free-kick straight into the Fulham wall. It\u2019s yet to get going this. 5 min: Christie goes through the back of Rose and concedes a free-kick on the left edge of the penalty area. It\u2019s in a dangerous position. Eriksen stands over it \u2026 4 min: Llorente has won his aerial battles so far, looking to flick the ball on to Alli when he can. 2 min: Handball is given against Alli in midfield. The free-kick\u2019s about 40 yards out. Fulham send the big men forwards. Seri finds Mitrovic on the left edge of the 18-yard box but he is crowded out and Tottenham clear. It wasn\u2019t the best delivery. 1 min: We\u2019re under way. Fulham, in white and black, are shooting from left to right on my TV. Spurs in their dark blue with light blue trim, are going the other way. The teams trot out into the chill late-afternoon air at Craven Cottage. It\u2019s a lovely old ground that fair shakes when the crowd are rocking and the action is hot. Let\u2019s hope it does so this afternoon. Alex Brown is short on optimism: \u201cGregg, I am in the Jonny Haynes stand where we are blinded by the setting sun. And ready for another Fulham car crash.\u201d Is that a physical and metaphorical setting sun Alex? \u201cI am sure Ryan B\u2019s red head has nothing to do with coming back to the Premier League just to play Liverpool again. Shame that will not be at Anfield as he would be shown some love,\u201d sniffs a sentimental Ian Copestake. Maybe he will wind the clock back today Ian \u2026 just for you! Babel, Mitrovic and Sch\u00fcrrle looks like a handy forward line on paper. With Tottenham playing three at the back there\u2019s a chance Fulham could cause them trouble if Spurs struggle to adapt to the defensive tweak quickly enough. And here\u2019s Claudio Ranieri: \u201cI hope we react after the strange defeat against Burnley and I hope Ryan Babel can bring something good to us \u2026 personality, experience \u2026 It is a very tough match for us. We have played against five of the top six teams in the league and we have to find a solution to steal some results from those games.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino speaks: \u201cFernando [Llorente] has the opportunity to play because he was good in the FA Cup and scored a hat-trick. It\u2019s a good opportunity for him to show his quality. [Against Manchester United] I think the performance was one of the best we have showed this season. The result wasn\u2019t the result we expected but I think the performance was good and we managed the game unbelievably in the second half and the goalkeeper was incredible. They deserved the victory.\u201d Second-placed Manchester City have completed a 3-0 stroll against Huddersfield to pull eight points clear of Spurs, in third. Here\u2019s what the Premier League table looks like before kick-off. How will Fernando Llorente fare today? He was at his best when he played under Marcelo Bielsa at Athletic Bilbao. And despite his height, they didn\u2019t just hoik the ball forwards to him. Bielsa got plenty of runners up in support and utilised his ability to hold the ball up from passes into feet so he could then involve his breaking midfielders. Eriksen, Alli and Lamela will have to use him like a wall and pop passes in and out of his feet. Also, Spurs have Sterling on the bench! Kazaiah Sterling. The 20-year-old will make his Premier League debut if called upon. Like pictures? Well gawp at these Premier League snaps from the weekend\u2019s games then. Fulham: Sergio Rico, Odoi, Le Marchand, Ream, Christie, Chambers, Seri, Bryan, Sch\u00fcrrle, Mitrovic, Babel. Subs: Bettinelli, Ryan Sessegnon, Kebano, Cairney, Ayite, Vietto, Ciss\u00e9. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Trippier, Winks, Eriksen, Rose, Lamela, Alli, Llorente. Subs: Nkoudou, Dier, Foyth, Gazzaniga, Davies, Skipp, Sterling. Referee: Craig Pawson (South Yorkshire) So Babel starts! Good or bad, given his red hairdo, we won\u2019t miss him today. Afternoon. On paper 3rd v 19th in the Premier League should be a routine win for Tottenham, but Harry Kane\u2019s injury and Son Heung-min\u2019s departure for the Asian Cup means there is just a little uncertainty about how this game may play out. While Erik Lamela is a fine replacement for Son, Fernando Llorente will not turn and run with the ball as Kane is able to do, so one expects Spurs\u2019 attacks to be a little slower than they might ordinarily be. Fulham may just sense an opportunity to get something out of this game. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side certainly need the points after Newcastle\u2019s victory over Cardiff lifted them out of the relegation zone and seven points clear of Fulham. Ryan Babel has been brought in to try and create more opportunities for Aleksandar Mitrovic, whose consistent form and regular goals offer hope that the Cottagers can turn things around, even if they ship goals with alarming regularity. Let\u2019s hope the burly striker has put his yoga bust-up behind him and is ready to focus on today\u2019s game. And for what it\u2019s worth, I think Babel is a decent addition. He\u2019s been a more mature and hardworking presence on the flanks for the Netherlands in their return to form and does not appear to have lost much pace, even at 32. As for Spurs, with Arsenal and Manchester United lingering with intent outside the top four, they need to keep their nerve at Craven Cottage and show that they can hold it together during the run-in.",

      "body": "<p>It is acknowledged that columnists like Afua Hirsch (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/15/rod-liddle-deaths-black-children-rightwing-violence\" title=\"\">Rod Liddle is wrong about black deaths</a>, 16 January) write stuff that is a reflection of their views; what is harder to accept is when those views are informed only by intellectual or prejudicial positions. Both Hirsch and Liddle arrive at conclusions about the causes of black teenage deaths (predominantly in London) without having had adequate (or perhaps any) experience of this tragedy on the ground.</p> <p>Although the majority of black boys in London achieve well in school and thereafter, a few things cannot be denied: black boys in London are massively over-represented in stabbings; black-on-black violence is significantly gang-related; gangs in London are crime-focused; the age of recruitment and grooming of young people for gang activity is dropping to primary school levels. Poverty and deprivation (of life chances and opportunity) can drive boys and young men into violent criminal activity. When male role models for these boys are neighbourhood gang elders (often replacing absent fathers) and a \u201cgangsta\u201d culture prevails, the boys stand little chance of escaping.</p> <p>Agencies must collaborate and intervene. When they do, and if it\u2019s done right, the success and achievement of these young people can be breathtaking. Without exception, there are no lost causes, as long as we keep them alive.<br><strong>Julian Lee</strong><br><em>(Executive </em><em>headteacher </em><em>in east London, 2010-2018), Winchester, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Afua Hirsch is right to focus on the self-blaming narrative that has taken hold in some sections of the black community in relation to knife crime and black-on-black violence. However, when she states \u201cmost violent crime is conducted by white people and the majority of stabbing victims in Britain are white. But as long as any black children are tragically dying on the streets, it is hugely important to debate the causes\u201d, she buys into the same narrative.</p> <p>Black-on-black violence is a myth created by a section of the law and order lobby to facilitate an acceptance by the black community of intrusive policing techniques. The causes of black-on-black knife crime are the same as those of white-on-white knife crime \u2013 but we do not speak of white-on-white violence.</p> <p>Knife crime results from fear, social insecurity, and the development of a drugs-based counter-economy which fills the gaps caused by austerity. We should focus on the issue of knife crime per se and abandon the racialisation of it (not least because it is important to debate the causes whoever is the victim).</p> <p>The construct of black-on-black crime was developed to allow Operation Trident a foothold in the black community. Operation Trident was initially focused on supposed Yardie gun violence\u2013 another racialised policing construct. It has been repackaged to deal with black-on-black crime \u2013 a term which implies there is something peculiarly pathological about crime within the black community.<br><strong>Nick Moss</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 In article after weary article, Afua Hirsch depicts a cold-hearted, white supremacist Britain which is simply not the one I see around me. My friend in her nineties is being looked after in a care home by a young black man with all the tenderness and devotion of a son. Recently, a group of older people, black and white, some disabled, were enjoying a day in the park, having a laugh and looking out for one another. Kids of all races from my local primary school walk past me holding hands. And I doubt if my black and Asian friends bother to think of me as a white, middle-class, fairly privileged male, indelibly tainted by the criminal legacy of post-imperial Britain. We\u2019re just friends, just people.

      "bodyText": "It is acknowledged that columnists like Afua Hirsch (Rod Liddle is wrong about black deaths, 16 January) write stuff that is a reflection of their views; what is harder to accept is when those views are informed only by intellectual or prejudicial positions. Both Hirsch and Liddle arrive at conclusions about the causes of black teenage deaths (predominantly in London) without having had adequate (or perhaps any) experience of this tragedy on the ground. Although the majority of black boys in London achieve well in school and thereafter, a few things cannot be denied: black boys in London are massively over-represented in stabbings; black-on-black violence is significantly gang-related; gangs in London are crime-focused; the age of recruitment and grooming of young people for gang activity is dropping to primary school levels. Poverty and deprivation (of life chances and opportunity) can drive boys and young men into violent criminal activity. When male role models for these boys are neighbourhood gang elders (often replacing absent fathers) and a \u201cgangsta\u201d culture prevails, the boys stand little chance of escaping. Agencies must collaborate and intervene. When they do, and if it\u2019s done right, the success and achievement of these young people can be breathtaking. Without exception, there are no lost causes, as long as we keep them alive. Julian Lee (Executive headteacher in east London, 2010-2018), Winchester, Hampshire \u2022 Afua Hirsch is right to focus on the self-blaming narrative that has taken hold in some sections of the black community in relation to knife crime and black-on-black violence. However, when she states \u201cmost violent crime is conducted by white people and the majority of stabbing victims in Britain are white. But as long as any black children are tragically dying on the streets, it is hugely important to debate the causes\u201d, she buys into the same narrative. Black-on-black violence is a myth created by a section of the law and order lobby to facilitate an acceptance by the black community of intrusive policing techniques. The causes of black-on-black knife crime are the same as those of white-on-white knife crime \u2013 but we do not speak of white-on-white violence. Knife crime results from fear, social insecurity, and the development of a drugs-based counter-economy which fills the gaps caused by austerity. We should focus on the issue of knife crime per se and abandon the racialisation of it (not least because it is important to debate the causes whoever is the victim). The construct of black-on-black crime was developed to allow Operation Trident a foothold in the black community. Operation Trident was initially focused on supposed Yardie gun violence\u2013 another racialised policing construct. It has been repackaged to deal with black-on-black crime \u2013 a term which implies there is something peculiarly pathological about crime within the black community. Nick Moss London \u2022 In article after weary article, Afua Hirsch depicts a cold-hearted, white supremacist Britain which is simply not the one I see around me. My friend in her nineties is being looked after in a care home by a young black man with all the tenderness and devotion of a son. Recently, a group of older people, black and white, some disabled, were enjoying a day in the park, having a laugh and looking out for one another. Kids of all races from my local primary school walk past me holding hands. And I doubt if my black and Asian friends bother to think of me as a white, middle-class, fairly privileged male, indelibly tainted by the criminal legacy of post-imperial Britain. We\u2019re just friends, just people. Sure the garden isn\u2019t always rosy, sure there\u2019s a long way to go and we must always stand up against the racists and the bigots, but all Hirsch seems to see is oppression and injustice wherever she turns. To use that old cliche, what brings us together is greater than what divides us. So much of Hirsch\u2019s writing makes her the problem rather than the solution. Alan Clark London \u2022 Much as I sometimes wish Mr Liddle would moderate his views, do not stop journalists like him, Jeremy Clarkson and Melanie Phillips raising uncomfortable topics because, if we are not careful, they become \u201cno go\u201d areas for debate.

It should also haunt the Commonwealth, which is none of the above.</p> <p>In 2013, on behalf of all member states, the Queen signed a Commonwealth charter whose chapters on democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression the current Rwandan regime flagrantly defies.

It should also haunt the Commonwealth, which is none of the above. In 2013, on behalf of all member states, the Queen signed a Commonwealth charter whose chapters on democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression the current Rwandan regime flagrantly defies.

      "bodyText": "MPs are to ambush Theresa May\u2019s statement on Monday with amendments aimed at stopping a no-deal Brexit, as well as paving the way for \u201cindicative votes\u201d to show whether any proposal can command a parliamentary majority. The Labour frontbench is undecided as to whether to back either proposal. Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, is planning to put down a tightly worded amendment to give time for a bill which would give parliament the power to back an extension of article 50. The move has been devised by the former Tory minister Nick Boles, with the support of other Tories such as Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan and the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee Hilary Benn. However, another more radical amendment by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve would allow a motion put forward by a minority of 300 MPs from at least five parties \u2014 including 10 Tory MPs \u2014 to be debated as the first item for MPs in the Commons the next day. Grieve\u2019s amendment would in effect give parliament the power to hold \u201cindicative votes\u201d on which Brexit options can command a majority in parliament, such as a Norway-style deal or a second referendum. Previously a majority has been needed to push forward such debates. Both camps indicated they intend to table their amendments as soon as possible on Monday, following the expected motion from the prime minister laying out the next stage of the government\u2019s Brexit plan. MPs hoping to stop no-deal are set to meet in Benn\u2019s parliamentary office before the prime minister\u2019s statement on Monday afternoon, when she is also expected to lay a \u201cneutral motion\u201d which sets out the next phase of her plan to get her deal through. A No 10 spokesman said there was deep unease at the wider implications of such amendments. \u201cAny attempt to remove the government\u2019s power to meet the legal conditions of an orderly exit at this moment of historic significance is extremely concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cThis news should serve as a reminder to those MPs who want to deliver Brexit that they need to vote for it, otherwise there is a danger that parliament could stop Brexit.\u201d Those behind Cooper\u2019s bill insist it does not require some of the more controversial measures contained in the proposed Grieve amendment. The only amendment required would be one to give time to her specific bill. The bill says that if there is no deal in place before the end of February, the government must put a binding motion before parliament to seek an extension of article 50 until the end of 2019. \u201cUltimately this is the government\u2019s responsibility to sort this out,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBut at the moment there is no sign yet they are ready to do so; that means MPs are having to come up with sensible ways to give the government more time because of its failures and delays.\u201d Labour is as yet undecided on how to direct its MPs over both amendments and stressed the need for caution in taking steps that would restrain future governments\u2019 right to act. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at any proposal that removes the threat of a chaotic no-deal exit,\u201d one party source said. Party strategists are wary of setting any precedent that could prevent them implementing a radical manifesto, if they narrowly won a future general election. There are a number of other obstacles to Cooper\u2019s bill progressing, including time for the bill to reach committee and report stage and progress through the House of Lords. Grieve said his amendment was aimed at facilitating wider debate in the Commons on different options for Brexit. \u201cI am hopeful it is possible to take the opportunity that has been offered to us to change the procedures of the House to allow both to be considered.\u201d The idea of indicative votes has been favoured by several cabinet ministers including business secretary Greg Clark and education secretary Damian Hinds as a way of finding out which kind of Brexit deal would command a majority, though the prime minister is understood to be instinctively opposed. Grieve\u2019s amendment would allow such votes to take place. Grieve also tabled two bills last week which would begin preparations for a new poll to take place but the MP stressed that his amendment alone would not allow MPs to simply order a new referendum \u2013 because of the money it would cost. \u201cWe have to be clear that for parliament to enact a bill for a referendum [it] would require a money resolution which would require further constitutional changes of immense significance, which I cannot see being feasible and not without serious risk of undermining our constitution,\u201d he said.",

The band had sought assurances from Represent, the online retailer that sold the T-shirts, that the garments would be ethically made, and said the manufacturer was changed without their knowledge.<br></p>\n    <p>The band pledged to personally fund an investigation into the factory\u2019s working conditions and demanded Represent donate profits to \u201ccampaigns with the intention to end such injustices\u201d.</p>\n    <p>A Comic Relief spokesman said the charity was \u201cshocked and concerned\u201d and had also checked the ethical sourcing credentials of the supplier, which was then changed without its knowledge.

He admitted being a part-owner and co-founder of the company behind the factory, Interstoff, but said he resigned from the board five years ago.</p>\n    <p>Interstoff Apparels' director, Naimul Bashar Chowdhury, confirmed the factory produced blank T-shirts for Stanley/Stella. He said Alam was \u201ca mere shareholder of the company\u201d and was not involved in the management of the business.</p>\n    <p>He said the company would investigate the Guardian\u2019s findings but also described them as \u201csimply not true\u201d, adding that Interstoff has a \u201czero-tolerance policy on harassment and use of any slangs or abusive language\u201d. However, he admitted there had been \u201csingle incidents\u201d in the \u201clong past where verbal abuse have resulted to employee dismissal\u201d.</p>\n    <p>He said no complaints had been received about excessive targets and the company adhered to the government\u2019s legal minimum wages. It has a \u201cparticipation committee\u201d elected by workers to voice complaints, he said, adding that the factory is regularly audited.</p>\n    <p>\u201cThe living wage is a debatable and subjective issue; we for ourselves can say our basic pay is as per the local law and we have over that different performance-based financial incentives,\u201d Chowdhury added.</p>\n    <p>He pointed out the company employs 80 disabled workers, staff are trained about harassment and abuse, and a medical centre at the factory provides healthcare. Pregnant workers are given monthly checkups, Chowdhury said.</p>\n    <p>Bruno Van Sieleghem, the sustainability manager at Stanley/Stella, said the brand was investigating the findings and \u201cstrongly committed to help this country and his workers to improve their welfare\u201d. The Fair Wear Foundation, a organisation funded by brands that works to improve standards, audits Interstoff every three years, he said, adding that the company's team is \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d FWF\u2019s \u201ccorrective action plan\u201d.</p>\n    <p>He said Stanley/Stella was aware that machinists at Interstoff work overtime until 9pm, but not that they stayed on until midnight. He said the brand had received no reports about employees complaining of harassment at the factory.</p>\n    <p>He said the brand, which received approximately \u20ac5 (\u00a34.40) for each T-shirt, was committed to improving standards for garment workers in Bangladesh, but admitted it used factories in the country because they offer a \u201ccompetitive price\u201d. The T-shirts were printed by a company in the Czech Republic, Van Sieleghem added.</p>\n    <p>FWF said it inspected the factory in December, interviewing 30 workers off-site. The organisation said some \u201cnon-compliances\u201d were discovered, but the interviews \u201cdid not reflect the allegations of harassment in the factory\u201d. However, the foundation acknowledged that this \u201cdoes not mean this did not happen\u201d.</p>\n    <p>It described the hours at the factory as \u201cexcessive\u201d, but FWF said it found workers are \u201cfree to refuse overtime\u201d. It said it supported staff being paid a living wage.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The factory was employed to produce the T-shirts by the Belgian brand Stanley/Stella, which claimed to closely monitor operations. But Muller warned: \u201cThe evidence coming out of this factory clearly shows the failure of auditing and current brand monitoring. Stanley/Stella claim to have monitored all their Bangladesh factories, and yet the evidence shows gross violations of labour laws and human rights. Brands must step up their game.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bruno Van Sieleghem, the sustainability manager at Stanley/Stella, said the company was investigating the findings and remained \u201cstrongly committed to help this country and workers to improve their welfare\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/spicegirlst-zip/giv-3902wVd6pLOew7d4/\" data-alt=\"spice girls graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/spicegirlst-zip/giv-3902wVd6pLOew7d4/\">spice girls graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The T-shirts were produced at Interstoff\u2019s factory in Gazipur, about three hours\u2019 drive from the capital, Dhaka.

      "bodyText": "Spice Girls T-shirts sold to raise money for Comic Relief\u2019s \u201cgender justice\u201d campaign were made at a factory in Bangladesh where women earn the equivalent of 35p an hour during shifts in which they claim to be verbally abused and harassed, a Guardian investigation has found. The charity tops, bearing the message \u201c#IWannaBeASpiceGirl\u201d, were produced by mostly female machinists who said they were forced to work up to 16 hours a day and called \u201cdaughters of prostitutes\u201d by managers for not hitting targets. Money raised from sales of the \u00a319.40 T-shirts will be donated to Comic Relief\u2019s fund to help \u201cchampion equality for women\u201d. The charity is due to receive \u00a311.60 for each of the T-shirts, which were commissioned and designed by the band, but said it has yet to be given any money. Announcing the partnership, the Spice Girls said the cause was important to them because \u201cequality and the movement of people power have always been at the heart of the band\u201d. But one of the machinists at the factory that produced the garments \u2013 modelled on social media by the TV presenter Holly Willoughby, the singers Sam Smith and Jessie J, and the Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill \u2013 said: \u201cWe don\u2019t get paid enough and we work in inhuman conditions.\u201d The T-shirts, which also have the words \u201cgender justice\u201d on the back, were made by workers earning significantly less than a living wage. The factory is part-owned by a minister in Bangladesh\u2019s authoritarian coalition government, which won 96% of the vote last month in an election described as \u201cfarcical\u201d by critics. There is no suggestion any of the celebrities were aware of conditions at the factory. A spokesman for the Spice Girls said they were \u201cdeeply shocked and appalled\u201d and would personally fund an investigation into the factory\u2019s working conditions. Comic Relief said the charity was \u201cshocked and concerned\u201d. Both said they had checked the ethical sourcing credentials of Represent, the online retailer commissioned by the Spice Girls to make the T-shirts, but it had subsequently changed manufacturer without their knowledge. Represent said it took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d and would refund customers on request. The band said Represent should donate profits to \u201ccampaigns with the intention to end such injustices\u201d. The company behind the factory that made the T-shirts, Interstoff Apparels, said the findings would be investigated but were \u201csimply not true\u201d. However, a catalogue of evidence about conditions faced by the employees was uncovered, including allegations that: Some machinists are paid 8,800Tk (\u00a382) a month, according to a recent payslip \u2013 meaning they earn the equivalent of 35p an hour for a 54-hour week. The sum is well below the 16,000Tk unions have been demanding and falls far short of living wage estimates. Employees are forced to work overtime to hit \u201cimpossible\u201d targets of sewing thousands of garments a day, meaning they are sometimes working 16-hour shifts that finish at midnight. Factory workers who do not make the targets are verbally abused by management and reduced to tears. Some have been made to work despite ill-health. The revelations shine a light on the risks of complex supply chains and will add to longstanding concerns over conditions at manufacturers of garments sold at considerable markups by British retailers. Saying the conditions appeared to be \u201cfar beyond the normal illegalities\u201d at factories in Bangladesh, Dominique Muller, the policy director at the campaign group Labour Behind the Label, added: \u201cIt is absolutely essential that celebrities, charities and brands ensure that their goods are made in factories which pay a decent wage and provide decent work.\u201d The factory was employed to produce the T-shirts by the Belgian brand Stanley/Stella, which claimed to closely monitor operations. But Muller warned: \u201cThe evidence coming out of this factory clearly shows the failure of auditing and current brand monitoring. Stanley/Stella claim to have monitored all their Bangladesh factories, and yet the evidence shows gross violations of labour laws and human rights. Brands must step up their game.\u201d Bruno Van Sieleghem, the sustainability manager at Stanley/Stella, said the company was investigating the findings and remained \u201cstrongly committed to help this country and workers to improve their welfare\u201d. The T-shirts were produced at Interstoff\u2019s factory in Gazipur, about three hours\u2019 drive from the capital, Dhaka. The company is co-owned by Shahriar Alam, a Bangladeshi foreign affairs minister, and makes garments for a number of British retailers. Interstoff exported \u00a343m of goods and made a \u00a32m pre-tax profit in 2014-15, according to accounts filed with Companies House in the UK. In 2013-14, it made a \u00a32.5m pre-tax profit. Alam, whose government has been accused of cracking down on free speech by arresting reporters, said he did not think it was \u201cright from a journalistic point of view to add my name to this story\u201d. He admitted being a part-owner and co-founder of Interstoff, but said he resigned from the board five years ago. Interstoff said he was not involved in the management of the business. A campaigner in Bangladesh, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals from the government, said: \u201cThe women who are producing these clothes are getting poverty wages. They don\u2019t have a dignified job. What kind of gender justice is that?\u201d According to the Asia Floor Wage Alliance, a global coalition of trade unions, workers\u2019 groups and human rights organisations, the monthly living wage for Bangladesh in 2017 was 37,661Tk. Another report, produced by academics for ISEAL, a non-profit group, set the living wage for Gazipur at 13,630Tk in 2016. In 2014, Comic Relief pledged to pay all its employees a living wage. But workers in Gazipur, whose ID passes were seen by the Guardian, face a different reality. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a machinist who has worked at the factory for more than five years and earned 9,080Tk a month, including an attendance bonus, said: \u201cWe hardly get anything. The wages we get are very minimum. It\u2019s barely enough to survive.\u201d The machinist, who has neck problems from being hunched over a sewing machine, struggles to get by and provide for her seven-year-old son. \u201cInside the production manager\u2019s office, they use very bad, abusive language, like \u2018this isn\u2019t your father\u2019s factory\u2019, \u2018the door is wide open, leave if you can\u2019t meet the production goals\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they use more obscene language like \u2018khankir baccha\u2019 (daughter of a prostitute), and many more that I can\u2019t even say. \u201cSometimes many female workers can\u2019t bear the insults and pressure from the management, and they quit. Even last month, a few of my colleagues left because they faced very bad behaviour and they were shattered.\u201d Machinists at the factory, which employs about 4,000 people, work from 8am until 5pm six days a week, including an hour\u2019s paid lunch break a day, but are regularly forced to do overtime, workers claim. The overtime is understood to be paid at a higher rate to regular shifts. The mother-of-one, who lives in a small room with her husband and child, said: \u201cIf the management wants us to do overtime then we don\u2019t have any other choice but to do it.\u201d She estimated she has to work overtime in the evenings for half the days in the month. Last year, the machinist added, a colleague who was three months\u2019 pregnant quit after she was forced by management to work until midnight despite vomiting. She also claimed employees often faint in the heat of the factory, while many experience neck and back problems. Another machinist, who has worked for Interstoff since 2013, said she was forced to take out loans to get by. The single mother-of-two earns 8,450Tk a month including an attendance bonus. She recently had to borrow 20,000Tk from her brother. \u201cThe amount I get paid is not enough at all. You see I am the only breadwinner of the family. I singlehandedly have to pay for my daughter\u2019s education and also have to meet the expenses of the family as well,\u201d she said. \u201cOur supervisor is very intimidating and scary.

The charity was due to receive approximately \u00a311.60 for each \u00a319.40 T-shirt sold but had yet to be given any money, the spokesman added.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Represent said it would refund customers on request, calling the reported conditions at the factory \u201cappalling and unacceptable\u201d.</p>\n    <p>A spokesman said: \u201cRepresent has strict ethical sourcing standards for all of our manufacturers, and we had felt confident printing on blank shirts from Stanley/Stella for this campaign due to the brand\u2019s strong reputation and leadership within the Fair Wear Foundation.</p>\n    <p>\u201cTo clarify, Comic Relief and Spice Girls did everything in their power to ensure ethical sourcing, and we take full responsibility for the choice of Stanley/Stella in this campaign, and confirm that this is something that we didn\u2019t bring to the attention of Spice Girls or Comic Relief.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The factory's co-owner Shahriar Alam, a Bangladeshi foreign affairs minister, said he did not think it was \u201cright from a journalistic point of view to add my name to this story\u201d. He admitted being a part-owner and co-founder of the company behind the factory, Interstoff, but said he resigned from the board five years ago.</p>\n    <p>Interstoff Apparels' director, Naimul Bashar Chowdhury, confirmed the factory produced blank T-shirts for Stanley/Stella. He said Alam was \u201ca mere shareholder of the company\u201d and was not involved in the management of the business.</p>\n    <p>He said the company would investigate the Guardian\u2019s findings but also described them as \u201csimply not true\u201d, adding that Interstoff has a \u201czero-tolerance policy on harassment and use of any slangs or abusive language\u201d. However, he admitted there had been \u201csingle incidents\u201d in the \u201clong past where verbal abuse have resulted to employee dismissal\u201d.</p>\n    <p>He said no complaints had been received about excessive targets and the company adhered to the government\u2019s legal minimum wages. It has a \u201cparticipation committee\u201d elected by workers to voice complaints, he said, adding that the factory is regularly audited.</p>\n    <p>\u201cThe living wage is a debatable and subjective issue; we for ourselves can say our basic pay is as per the local law and we have over that different performance-based financial incentives,\u201d Chowdhury added.</p>\n    <p>He pointed out the company employs 80 disabled workers, staff are trained about harassment and abuse, and a medical centre at the factory provides healthcare. Pregnant workers are given monthly checkups, Chowdhury said.</p>\n    <p>Bruno Van Sieleghem, the sustainability manager at Stanley/Stella, said the brand was investigating the findings and \u201cstrongly committed to help this country and his workers to improve their welfare\u201d. The Fair Wear Foundation, a organisation funded by brands that works to improve standards, audits Interstoff every three years, he said, adding that the company's team is \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d FWF\u2019s \u201ccorrective action plan\u201d.</p>\n    <p>He said Stanley/Stella was aware that machinists at Interstoff work overtime until 9pm, but not that they stayed on until midnight. He said the brand had received no reports about employees complaining of harassment at the factory.</p>\n    <p>He said the brand, which received approximately \u20ac5 (\u00a34.40) for each T-shirt, was committed to improving standards for garment workers in Bangladesh, but admitted it used factories in the country because they offer a \u201ccompetitive price\u201d. The T-shirts were printed by a company in the Czech Republic, Van Sieleghem added.</p>\n    <p>FWF said it inspected the factory in December, interviewing 30 workers off-site. The organisation said some \u201cnon-compliances\u201d were discovered, but the interviews \u201cdid not reflect the allegations of harassment in the factory\u201d. However, the foundation acknowledged that this \u201cdoes not mean this did not happen\u201d.</p>\n    <p>It described the hours at the factory as \u201cexcessive\u201d, but FWF said it found workers are \u201cfree to refuse overtime\u201d. It said it supported staff being paid a living wage.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cSo she had to work from eight in the morning till midnight.

      "bodyText": "Salma has never even heard of the Spice Girls. Her life, hunched over a sewing machine for up to 16 hours a day, is a world away from the luxuries enjoyed by the millionaire pop band. But while neither knows it, Salma and the Spice Girls are connected. The factory where she has worked for more than five years, off a narrow, winding road three hours\u2019 drive from Dhaka, is where charity T-shirts designed by the group were made. The \u00a319.40 garments were produced on behalf of the Spice Girls and then sold to raise money for a Comic Relief campaign intended to \u201cchampion equality for women\u201d, which pointed out how \u201cwomen earn less\u201d. It is a reality Salma knows only too well. Perched on a chair in the tiny room she shares with her husband and seven-year-old son \u2013 barely more than 3.5 metres by 3.5 metres (12ft x 12ft) in size \u2013 she describes the harsh reality of her working life at the Interstoff Apparels factory. Salma, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, speaks gently but vividly recounts the repeated injustices she and her colleagues face. A small gas-burning stove on the floor in a small corridor is shared between four families. There is one toilet \u2013 a hole in the ground \u2013 and an overhead pipe without a shower head for washing. Despite her modest surroundings, at 5,000 Bangladeshi taka (\u00a346.30) a month, the rent eats up more than half her 9,080Tk salary, which includes an attendance bonus that she does not receive if she is sick. Even with her husband\u2019s income, the couple barely get by, with bills including their son\u2019s school fees, food, electricity and medical expenses. Other workers at Interstoff Apparels\u2019 factory earn less, Salma said. Salaries are set by grades that depend on experience. Pay is to rise this month as the government increases the minimum wage in the garment industry to 8,000Tk a month. It is the first rise in five years, but workers point out it does little for more experienced employees who already earn more. Salma is expecting a modest increase of a few hundred taka, but is unsure exactly what she will receive. Workers at the factory are given \u201cimpossible\u201d targets of sewing up to 2,000 garments a day, she said. Speaking through a translator, Salma, who is in her mid-20s, explained: \u201cSuppose someone is given a production target, but she couldn\u2019t hit her goal. The chances are high that she\u2019d get verbally scolded very badly. She might even get called inside the office of the production manager and get verbally abused. \u201cInside the production manager\u2019s office they use very bad, abusive language. Like, \u2018This isn\u2019t your father\u2019s factory\u2019, \u2018The door is wide open, leave if you can\u2019t meet the production goals\u2019. \u201cSometimes they use more obscene language like \u2018khankir baccha\u2019 (daughter of a prostitute), and many more that I can\u2019t even say. \u201cSometimes many female workers can\u2019t bear the insults and pressure from the management, and they quit. Even last month, a few of my colleagues left because they faced very bad behaviour and they were shattered.\u201d Workers, including those who are pregnant, have to do overtime, she claimed. \u201cMany workers don\u2019t want to do the overtime, sometimes they even cry when the management make them do overtime forcefully. There was a worker I knew who was pregnant and she was forced to do night duty on top of her regular hours and overtime,\u201d Salma said. \u201cSo she had to work from eight in the morning till midnight. She was crying all the time. \u201cOne day she was throwing up and she repeatedly said she\u2019s not feeling well. Still she was forced to work late. She left the job the next day because of that incident. \u201cIt pains so much when we watch this kind of incidents, but there\u2019s only so much we could do.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump may have talked to Michael Cohen in advance about Cohen\u2019s false testimony to Congress on their pursuit of a property deal in Russia, the president\u2019s attorney said on Sunday. Rudy Giuliani said it would have been \u201cperfectly normal\u201d for Trump to discuss the testimony with Cohen, his former legal fixer who has admitted to lying to Congress about when the \u201cTrump Tower Moscow\u201d project ended. \u201cSo what if he talked to him?\u201d Giuliani said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, while insisting that Trump did not instruct Cohen to lie in the testimony. Cohen initially told a congressional committee investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election that the Trump Organization\u2019s pursuit of a property deal in Russia ended before the Republican primary began in January 2016. But last November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and admitted discussions on the Moscow deal actually continued well into 2016. He said he had briefed Trump and members of Trump\u2019s family extensively. Special counsel Robert Mueller said in a court filing last month Cohen told investigators about \u201cpreparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries\u201d, indicating that the White House may have been in the loop about his false testimony. Late on Friday, the office of the special counsel disputed an explosive BuzzFeed News report that said Trump personally directed Cohen to lie to Congress. BuzzFeed has said it stands by the story, which was sourced to unnamed federal law enforcement officials. One of the story\u2019s authors, Anthony Cormier, said on Sunday his sources maintained the information was accurate. \u201cI have further confirmation that this is right,\u201d Cormier told CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources. \u201cWe are being told to stand our ground.\u201d Giuliani said on Sunday Cohen had a clearer oversight of the Russia project than Trump, and that Trump had been too busy with his campaign to pay close attention. He said any advance discussion about Cohen\u2019s testimony would have involved Cohen telling Trump what he intended to say and Trump trusting that it would be accurate. \u201cThe guy driving this testimony was Michael Cohen,\u201d Giuliani told CNN. Giuliani also reiterated a past statement that the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations may have continued even beyond the June 2016 date given when Cohen admitted that his earlier testimony was false. On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Giuliani said Trump\u2019s team had told Mueller the discussions \u201cwent on throughout 2016\u201d and continued \u201cprobably up to, could be up to, as far as October, November\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Labor would require firms to first look for local workers before filling skills shortages in a bid to use $50bn of government contracts to encourage local employment. Bill Shorten will announce Labor\u2019s beefed up procurement policy on the campaign trail in Queensland on Monday, part of his nine-day bus tour of key marginals. Under the opposition\u2019s proposal, companies bidding for government projects worth more than $10m will be required to develop a local jobs plan if Labor is elected. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to Shorten companies will \u201chave to undertake local labour market testing for any new employees required for the project, to ensure temporary work visa holders are not undercutting local wages\u201d. Employers are currently required to conduct labour market testing for certain visas \u2013 such as the temporary skills shortage visa \u2013 by advertising jobs for at least a month before sponsoring non-Australian workers. Labor\u2019s policy appears to extend that by imposing a new requirement to look for locals before hiring workers on other visas. But a spokesman for the shadow industry minister, Kim Carr, told Guardian Australia the policy \u201cis not about the visa status of a worker\u201d. \u201cOn commonwealth government-funded projects and procurement, bidders will be expected to set out how they will test the local region for any new workers or suppliers required for the project or contract,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example if a project in Townsville needed to hire a new person they should demonstrate how they will test the Townsville employment market before going to the rest of Australia or overseas.\u201d The policy may also mean government contracts reimpose labour market testing even where a trade deal creates an exemption to the visa condition. For example, the TPP11 deal waives labour market testing for workers from Canada, Peru, Mexico, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. Labor insists the policy is consistent with Australia\u2019s international agreements. Projects over $250m would have to ensure that local firms are provided with a fair opportunity to win work by developing an Australian industry participation plan, preventing them being excluded by firms who use overseas suppliers without putting work to an open tender. \u201cLabor believes that if local small and medium businesses can do the job competitively, then the job should be done locally,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cIf bidders on large government contracts can\u2019t show how they\u2019ll support competitive local business and local jobs, then they shouldn\u2019t be getting contracts. It\u2019s simple \u2013 no local jobs, no contract.\u201d Labor would require one in 10 workers on major projects to be apprentices from the local area, which Shorten said would \u201censure we are giving young locals the chance to learn the skills they need for a job, and help older workers retrain for new jobs\u201d. As the Coalition government has boasted of reducing permanent migration from 190,000 to 162,000, Labor has instead focused on the number of temporary visa holders with work rights in Australia, following the lead of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Shorten has said that there are 1.6m people in Australia with visas granting work rights, and said the government \u201ccan\u2019t be serious about migration levels\u201d because it has ignored the issue. Labor\u2019s local jobs pitch is aimed at working class voters in Queensland regional marginal seats, especially those tempted by the economic nationalist pitch of minor parties One Nation, Katter\u2019s Australia Party and Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia Party.

      "bodyText": "The not-for-profit foundation that was awarded a controversial $443.3m grant for the Great Barrier Reef has funded its first project \u2013 a research survey that will be carried out by a government agency. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation will announce on Monday that a 25-day health survey of remote parts of the reef by the Australian Institute of Marine Science is the first venture awarded money through the Reef Trust partnership set up by the government last year. The announcement comes after publication of an official audit last week that found serious failings in departmental processes when the government selected the foundation without a competitive tender. Researchers from the government agency have set out on the 25-day trip to remote far northern reefs to survey their health and the effect of severe coral bleaching that occurred during the last mass bleaching event in 2017. The foundation has co-funded the project with a grant to Aims of $574,000. Aims has contributed $833,000 from its own budget toward the trip. Eighteen scientists and crew are on board the research vessel RV Solander and are surveying more than 20 reefs off Cape York, from Cooktown to north of Cape Grenville, to check for signs of coral recovery since bleaching as a result of high ocean temperatures caused mass coral mortality in 2016 and 2017. \u201cReefs in the northern region of the Great Barrier Reef have not been surveyed since late 2016 after a severe coral bleaching event affected the region meaning that the section is long overdue for a health check,\u201d the foundation\u2019s managing director, Anna Marsden, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t currently know the extent of coral loss attributable to the latest bleaching in 2017 or of any other disturbances that have occurred in that time.\u201d In 2017, not-for-profit group Great Barrier Reef Legacy conducted a 21-day study of 12 reefs between Cape York and Cooktown with 20 scientists and crew after use of a boat and about $200,000 were donated. Aims said the expeditions were not comparable because the data the government agency collected was part of long term monitoring work it had conducted for the past 35 years. On Monday, renowned coral reef scientist Terry Hughes tweeted that the claim northern reefs had not been properly surveyed was \u201cincorrect\u201d. Labor\u2019s environment spokesman, Tony Burke, said Aims was a government agency that should have been directly funded. \u201cIt is absurd that government scientist had to seek the permission of a small private foundation to access taxpayers funds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dispute over the history of research into the northern reef reinforces the stupidity of using a private foundation to do core government work. It doesn\u2019t hold the corporate memory that is held within official government agencies.\u201d Up to 23 reefs will be surveyed by manta tow where coral cover and crown-of-thorns starfish numbers are calculated around the reef perimeter. Eight reefs will have full surveys conducted by manta tow, divers and using baited remote underwater video stations. Marsden said findings from this survey would be used to guide future monitoring work and the allocation of further funding through the reef grant for climate adaptation work and crown-of-thorns starfish control. They will also serve as a baseline to understand the health of the reefs before any future bleaching occurs. Britta Schaffelke, the program director for the Great Barrier Reef research program at Aims, said little was currently understood about the area being surveyed and the scientists would collect data on both the health of the reefs and the fish communities there. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in the longer-term health of the reef and what we\u2019re more interested in is how reefs recover,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know in the future bleaching will occur but do we understand how they recover and why do some reefs not recover as quickly as they should be? \u201cThat\u2019s why getting this data is so important.\u201d Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of Aims, said it was the first time the RV Solander, which has laboratories, flow-through aquariums and high-tech computing and diving facilities, had been used in Queensland waters. \u201cThis expedition is part of Aims\u2019s commitment to survey the current health of the Great Barrier Reef, as it has done every two years for the past 35 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the situation has eased, there is still the potential for warm sea temperatures to cause coral bleaching.\u201d Both Labor and the Greens have questioned why the grant was awarded to the foundation instead of funds going directly to the environment department and government agencies such as Aims and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority that work on the reef. A Senate inquiry has been examining the process behind the reef grant. The Australian National Audit Office\u2019s audit, which was released last week, found the government gave the department just 11 days to find a private organisation to award the funds to and the department chose the foundation as the \u201cobvious\u201d partner after three days. The audit found the department applied insufficient scrutiny to numerous aspects of the proposal.",

The guava (Rhodomyrtus psidioides) is heading for extinction, says Fensham, of the University of Queensland \u2013 but not because of land clearing or climate change. Instead it\u2019s the relentless march of the invasive fungi myrtle rust that will cause its demise. Myrtle rust is just one example of the invasive pests \u2013 weeds, animals and pathogens \u2013 that are cutting a swathe through Australia\u2019s unique native flora and fauna. Research published in September in the Pacific Conservation Biology journal revealed that invasive pests are the No 1 threat to Australia\u2019s most at-risk species \u2013 above climate change, land clearing or energy production. Some 207 invasive plants, 57 animals and three pathogens (including myrtle rust) were affecting 1,257 threatened species. \u201cInvasives are the major driver of species loss, so if we are worried about extinctions, then we should worry about invasives,\u201d says Andrew Cox, the chief executive of the Invasive Species Council. \u201cWe are clearly losing the fight against invasive species,\u201d says Prof John Woinarski, of Charles Darwin University and the National Environmental Science Program\u2019s threatened species recovery hub. He says Australia\u2019s history as a large, isolated island means its flora and fauna are \u201cpoorly prepared\u201d when invaders come in. When Europeans first arrived in Australia, so did a whole suite of invaders \u2013 rabbits, deer, horses, foxes, pigs and cats. Andy Sheppard, a senior principal research scientist at CSIRO working on invasive species management, says: \u201cThat might be a long time ago, but those species spread rapidly and now in Australia foxes and feral cats are driving more native species to extinction than any other impacts. \u201cAs a result, we have a higher extinction rate of native mammals than anywhere else in the world.\u201d Similarly thousands of exotic plants, some of which were released deliberately to push out native species, were introduced by so-called \u201cacclimatisation societies\u201d and, from the 1920s, the government\u2019s commonwealth plant introduction program. Grasslands and pastoral lands became full of foreign plants and grasses, changing fire regimes. This problem isn\u2019t confined to history \u2013 the invaders keep coming. Sheppard says a new exotic vertebrate establishes in Australia once every five years, with roughly 10 invasive plants establishing each year. As Australia continues to grow its international trade \u2013 through commerce and tourism \u2013 the challenge for Australia\u2019s biosecurity system to keep out unwanted plants, animals and pathogens grows ever greater. Sheppard says there is a broad \u201crule of 10s\u201d where only one in 10 invaders manages to establish itself in Australia, and only one in 10 of those causes problems. But those that do hold on can be expensive. Red fire ants \u2013 first detected around the port of Brisbane in 2001 \u2013 are considered a multibillion-dollar risk due to their impacts on crops and their ability to put outdoor recreation areas out-of-bounds. The ants are the subject of a $38m-a-year national eradication program but the battle goes on \u2013 a new detection was discovered a kilometre outside a \u201ccontainment zone\u201d in south-east Queensland in May 2018. Then there are the sleepers, the species that have gone through a \u201clag phase\u201d \u2013 a period when an invasive has established but doesn\u2019t cause a problem, until it does. \u201cA lot of invasives have gone through that lag phase \u2013 they\u2019ll exist at low numbers and then something changes,\u201d says Sheppard, saying periods of drought or good rainfall might be a trigger. \u201cThey might then have an increase in the resources they need and then you get that logarithmic growth.\u201d One example of an invasive emerging from a \u201clag phase\u201d is the feral deer. Sheppard says it \u201creally took off\u201d in the past decade and is now causing major problems in national parks. Many of Australia\u2019s more recent exotic weed arrivals start life, says Sheppard, in people\u2019s gardens. Two examples now listed as weeds of national significance are water hyacinths, which were introduced as ornamental plants in garden ponds and lakes; and the Bellyache bush, brought in as a garden plant in the late 1800s. \u201cThey jump the garden fence and, before you know it, they\u2019re in national parks,\u201d Sheppard says. Making everything more complicated is the march of human-caused climate change, which has the potential to widen the range of some invasives. A report from the Invasive Species Council found the range of the invasive fox could expand into more alpine areas as temperatures rose. Warming ocean waters off Tasmania have helped invasive sea urchins to extend their range, playing a major role in the disappearance of kelp forests. Would more funding solve the problem? A July 2017 review of Australia\u2019s policies on biosecurity, commissioned by state and federal agriculture ministers, warned that while the risks were continuing to build, all budgets to tackle the problem were under \u201csignificant pressure\u201d, with funding from governments \u201cstatic or declining\u201d. Between 2013-14 and 2015-16, overall government funding for biosecurity fell from $545m to $425m. The review\u2019s analysis of biosecurity funding found more money was coming from external sources, such as industry or the collection of levies. Over the same period, this reliance on external cash ballooned from $259m to $574m. The government is trying to raise $108m a year for biosecurity by introducing a $10 levy on shipping containers, but the shipping and logistics industry pushed back when the move was announced in the 2018 federal budget. The report said volumes of traded goods and arrivals of visitors from overseas were all forecast to increase, in particular from \u201chigher-risk regions\u201d, and likely to make an already bad situation worse. But throwing money at more biosecurity measures would have only a limited impact on risks to the economy, the report said. About $90m was spent on biosecurity for four key routes for invasives to enter Australia \u2013 air and sea passengers, commercial vessels, sea containers and timber imports. The federal agriculture department uses a model to work out the benefits of investing in biosecurity measures \u2013 known as the risk-return resource allocation model. Tripling this $90m investment would still leave Australia exposed to about $2.1bn of risk to the agricultural sector, according to the review\u2019s modelling. The report said: \u201cThis highlights the importance of seeking innovative approaches, pre-border and post-border as well as at the border, to biosecurity risk management; simply increasing funding is not a \u2018silver bullet\u2019.\u201d A national stocktake of biosecurity spending, with figures available from 2013 onwards, does not include spending on research and innovation. When the 2017 review tried to find these numbers, they reported comprehensive data on public investment was \u201cnot currently available\u201d. But Andreas Glanznig, the CEO of the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions, a national research institute that collaborates across governments, agencies and industry, says it will not necessarily be extra funding that makes the difference, but how it is spent. \u201cWe are at crisis point and innovation and new game changing ideas are key to movement. Business as usual will see a fast-downward spiral.\u201d Among the centre\u2019s research projects are innovations such as using faster DNA techniques to detect invasives, developing \u201cintelligent\u201d traps that can learn to distinguish different species, and understanding if Australia could overcome controversies around the use of so-called \u201cgene drives\u201d that could be deployed against some invasive animals. Economy v environment In 2015, Woinarski led research published in leading journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science that described the \u201congoing unravelling\u201d of Australia\u2019s fauna. The causes were complex, he wrote, but the loss of numerous mammals was \u201cprimarily\u201d thanks to feral cats and the European red fox. \u201cThe issue is particularly acute for Australian mammals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have lost 34 in the last 250 years \u2013 no other country comes close.\u201d Getting invasive species under control is critically important because so much of Australia\u2019s wildlife exists nowhere else, he says. Cox says funding is much more likely to be released if an invasive pest affects a key sector of the economy or a major industry. Environmental impacts such as species loss are not given the same weight. He says there needs to be a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d to tackle invasives, but with an approach that gives more weight to current and potential environmental impacts. \u201cBiosecurity is usually run from agricultural departments, so there is an inherent bias in the whole system,\u201d he says. \u201cAt both state and federal level, the lead agency is usually agriculture, so the problem always tends to be seen through an agricultural lens.

Thus, May\u2019s supposedly cunning plan looks like procrastination at best and moonshine at worst.</p> <p>The greater question is whether this energising burst of parliamentary self-assertion will break the logjam. At the very least, it is an exhilarating antidote to the slogan-packed rightwing populism of the Brexiteers. On Sunday\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, the stony-featured trade secretary, Liam Fox, posed the following question: \u201cIs government the servant of parliament or is government the servant of the people?\u201d One of the last century\u2019s many lessons is never to trust a politician who uses such language.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/20/nigel-farage-to-lead-new-pro-brexit-party-if-eu-departure-delayed-ukip\">Nigel Farage to lead new pro-Brexit party if  EU departure delayed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All the same, it is still very hard to see what proposals the Commons \u2013 for all its collective ingenuity \u2013 can muster that will command a majority and be acceptable to Brussels. In addition: so tightly geared is the parliamentary mechanism in this crisis that some of the amendments on the table could have distinctly unforeseen consequences. In the Mail on Sunday, for instance, Jacob Rees-Mogg, in a spectacularly disingenuous call for Tory unity, says that \u201ceven Mrs May\u2019s deal would be better than not leaving at all\u201d. Those MPs now pressing for no deal to be ruled out need to take this seriously. If their amendment is passed, they might become the unwitting enablers of Brexit \u2013 as hardline leavers decide that some form of departure is better than no departure at all.</p> <p>Fox also objected to Marr that the \u201cremainer\u201d Commons was trying to thwart the result of the 2016 referendum: the most fetishised vote in modern British history. Inadvertently, he made the most important point of all. Having voted for Brexit three years ago, the public elected a House of Commons in 2017 that was never going to agree an orderly exit. That contradiction cannot be resolved by those who embody it. MPs are in a dark room, looking for a black cat, that isn\u2019t there.</p> <p>I simply ask: if there is any way of breaking this impasse that doesn\u2019t involve a fresh referendum, will somebody please tell me what it is?</p> <p>\u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Thus, May\u2019s supposedly cunning plan looks like procrastination at best and moonshine at worst. The greater question is whether this energising burst of parliamentary self-assertion will break the logjam. At the very least, it is an exhilarating antidote to the slogan-packed rightwing populism of the Brexiteers. On Sunday\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, the stony-featured trade secretary, Liam Fox, posed the following question: \u201cIs government the servant of parliament or is government the servant of the people?\u201d One of the last century\u2019s many lessons is never to trust a politician who uses such language. All the same, it is still very hard to see what proposals the Commons \u2013 for all its collective ingenuity \u2013 can muster that will command a majority and be acceptable to Brussels. In addition: so tightly geared is the parliamentary mechanism in this crisis that some of the amendments on the table could have distinctly unforeseen consequences. In the Mail on Sunday, for instance, Jacob Rees-Mogg, in a spectacularly disingenuous call for Tory unity, says that \u201ceven Mrs May\u2019s deal would be better than not leaving at all\u201d. Those MPs now pressing for no deal to be ruled out need to take this seriously. If their amendment is passed, they might become the unwitting enablers of Brexit \u2013 as hardline leavers decide that some form of departure is better than no departure at all. Fox also objected to Marr that the \u201cremainer\u201d Commons was trying to thwart the result of the 2016 referendum: the most fetishised vote in modern British history. Inadvertently, he made the most important point of all. Having voted for Brexit three years ago, the public elected a House of Commons in 2017 that was never going to agree an orderly exit. That contradiction cannot be resolved by those who embody it. MPs are in a dark room, looking for a black cat, that isn\u2019t there. I simply ask: if there is any way of breaking this impasse that doesn\u2019t involve a fresh referendum, will somebody please tell me what it is? \u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The troubled cafe chain Patisserie Valerie could collapse this week if last-ditch talks with its banks fail. Luke Johnson, Patisserie Valerie\u2019s leading shareholder, has been seeking to extend a standstill agreement on its bank facilities \u2013 protecting the chain from action to recover debts \u2013 which officially expired at midnight on Friday. On Monday morning the company issued a statement saying that talks with its banks continued and it would provide an update when they were concluded. Without an agreement, the company\u2019s lenders, HSBC and Barclays, could demand repayment of debts that may amount to nearly \u00a310m, potentially forcing Patisserie Valerie to call in administrators. Other options include a second bailout by Johnson, the multimillionaire chairman of the business, who pumped \u00a320m of his money into Patisserie Valerie to keep it afloat after the company uncovered \u201cpotentially fraudulent\u201d accounting irregularities and a financial black hole in October. Johnson was paid back \u00a310m after other shareholders later put up \u00a315m in new funds. The company, which operates 200 cafes and employs 3,000 staff, is expected to provide an official update on its position to the stock market on Monday. In a statement last week, Patisserie Valerie warned profits would be \u201cmaterially below\u201d the estimated \u00a312m when the company first flagged up fears of fraud. It said cashflow was also much lower than expected. The chain revealed it had hired the advisory firm KPMG to consider all options, raising speculation that Patisserie Valerie could be facing insolvency, mass store closures or a debt-for-equity swap. On Sunday, Johnson could not be contacted, and Patisserie Holdings declined to comment on developments over the weekend. Shareholders in Patisserie Valerie, which was previously valued at \u00a3450m, are braced for considerable losses. Shares were suspended in October and have yet to restart trading.

The discovery that a local authority is directly paying public money to a landlord its own officers describe as \u201crogue\u201d is the latest example of the ineffective regulations designed to police the private rented sector\u2019s worst offenders. In October, a Guardian and ITV News investigation revealed how a string of supposedly banned landlords were continuing to rent out properties, while the government\u2019s new rogue landlord database was empty six months after its launch. Bernard McGowan, who boasts a \u00a330m property empire and was convicted six times under the Housing Act between 2014 and 2017, failed Brent council\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d test in 2015.

As we know from managing normal medicines shortages, instances of individual organisations stockpiling can risk additional pressure on the availability of medicines for patients in other areas of the country.\u201d There is also a warning: \u201cTo ensure we manage supply effectively across the NHS, any incidences involving the over-ordering of medicines will be investigated and followed up with the relevant chief or responsible pharmacist directly. I am expecting senior pharmacy leaders to ensure local collaboration to meet patient needs wherever necessary.\u201d The letter also appraises pharmacists of Serious Shortage Protocols (SSPs), which are governed by draft legislation which came before parliament on Friday. The protocols, which will only be issued in exceptional circumstances, will allow ministers to permit a pharmacist to provide an alternative to the item prescribed on a medicine-by-medicine basis. In addition, the letter gives details on other areas of contingency planning, adding that the Department of Health and Social Care has received \u201cvery good engagement from industry\u201d on developing a six-week stockpile of prescription-only medicines and pharmacy medicines to ensure supply for patients is maintained across the NHS. It states that the department has also secured contract agreements for additional warehouse space for stockpiled medicines, including ambient, refrigerated and controlled drug storage. It also advises that participation in clinical research including trials should continue as normal \u201cunless specific instructions from an individual sponsor or formal communications are received\u201d. Investigational medicinal products, which are used in such trials, have been prioritised on alternative routes to ensure that the flow of all these products continues unimpeded after 29 March 2019, it adds. Simon Dukes, the chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC), said that there was \u201ccontinued pressure on the medicines supply chain\u201d and that the body was working with other organisations and the government to minimise any impact. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working closely with pharmaceutical companies to ensure patients can continue to receive the medicines they need, including asking many of them to ensure a minimum of six weeks additional supply of medicine over and above usual buffer stocks in place by 29 March.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ministers have been accused of a \u201cstitch-up\u201d over proposals to redraw the funding formula for councils in a way critics say will redirect scarce cash from deprived inner cities to affluent Conservative-voting shires. The proposed changes \u2013 which include the recommendation that grant allocations should no longer be weighted to reflect the higher costs of poverty and deprivation \u2013 come amid increasing concern over the sustainability of local authority finances. Leaders of urban councils have written to ministers to complain that under the \u201cgrossly unfair and illogical\u201d proposals, potentially tens of millions of pounds would be switched to rural and suburban council areas. Cllr Richard Watts, the leader of Islington council in London and chair of Labour\u2019s local government resources group, said: \u201cThe evidence used by the government to justify these changes seems so bizarrely selective that it\u2019s impossible to avoid the conclusion that the review is a brutal political stitch-up aimed at sparing Tory councils and Tory voters from more cuts while piling misery on the most deprived areas of the country.\u201d He added: \u201cOnly this government would think it is fair to cut money from the communities that need it most to give it to well-off areas.\u201d Northern cities and metropolitan councils see the so-called fair funding review of local government revenue grant funding as an attempt by ministers to prop up financially struggling authorities and declining services in Tory heartlands. An estimated 76% of Conservative MPs represent constituencies covered by county councils. The financial collapse of Northamptonshire county council a year ago \u2013 and well-publicised difficulties faced by other Tory-run counties such as Somerset and East Sussex \u2013 have focused attention on the impact of austerity cuts to local services such as libraries, parks and Sure Start centres in even relatively affluent areas. Details of the proposed changes were contained in a consultation released by the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government just before Christmas. The ministry has insisted the review is a technical exercise designed to simplify grant distribution among English councils and will make the process more transparent. But critics believe ministers have bowed to pressure from the Tory-dominated County Councils Network to shake up the grants system.

Sir Stephen Houghton, the leader of Barnsley council and chair of the Local Government Association special interest group of metropolitan authorities, said the removal of deprivation from the proposed formula was absurd and unacceptable.

Key to this would be a series of citizens\u2019 assemblies whose thinking would then lead to constructive reconsideration by parliament of our relations with Europe, including the option of a renegotiation followed by a referendum. The direct engagement of the British people is now essential in order to address the triple challenge of a government defying the sovereignty of parliament, an ever more divided country, and mounting distrust between parliament and people.

      "body": "<p>When a smart caf\u00e9 opened in his neighbourhood in New York, where he used to live, Buddhist monk and bestselling author Haemin Sunim went along to sample the delicious-looking cake. Hearing the prices, however, he balked and ordered just tea instead \u2013 but that cake stayed in his mind all afternoon. The next day, he was still thinking about it, and the day after that until, finally, he had to go back and treat himself. The verdict? \u201cIt was delicious but not extraordinarily delicious,\u201d he writes in his new book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/love-for-imperfect-things.html\" title=\"\">Love for Imperfect Things</a></em>. \u201cThis must be the kind of feeling people have after winning the Nobel prize or becoming president.\u201d</p> <p>This small, wry slice of everyday life \u2013 and let-down \u2013 is one of many in Sunim\u2019s latest self-care tome, the follow-up to his first book, the wildly successful <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/25/haemin-sunim-things-you-can-only-see-when-you-slow-down\" title=\"\">Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down</a></em>, published in 2012.</p> <p>Sunim, 45, has been dubbed a \u201cmegamonk\u201d. He has the kind of celebrity status that can turn a short stroll through his native Seoul, South Korea, into an embarrassing round of selfie requests. With over 1m followers on Twitter and Facebook, his first book was a quiet call for calm in our insanely busy world. Translated into 30 languages, it sold in the millions. Sunim offers bite-size Buddhism \u2013 mindfulness for the modern age \u2013 mainly through short anecdotes or sparse, haiku-like verse. His writing is gentle and meandering, and often so simple as to seem quite obvious. Haemin Sunim (which means \u201cspontaneous wisdom\u201d) gives insight and advice we might know already, but still fail to heed.</p> <p>The central message in <em>Love for Imperfect Things</em> is the importance of loving and accepting our imperfect selves, our imperfect world \u2013 and imperfect cake \u2013 the way a mother loves her child, no matter what. The book examines the many ways expectations fall short. Our parents don\u2019t understand us. Our children don\u2019t appreciate us. We didn\u2019t nail that \u201cdream job\u201d or, if we did, it hasn\u2019t delivered what we dreamed it would.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His celebrity status can turn a stroll into a round of selfie requests</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat \u2018disappointment\u2019 is a problem of humanity, not just in the west,\u201d says Sunim, speaking to me from New York, where he has come to meet his spiritual teacher. \u201cOne of the reasons I became interested in our relationship with imperfection was reading Sengchan, the sixth-century Chinese Zen master, who said: \u2018True freedom is being without anxiety about imperfection\u2019. I\u2019d never thought of \u2018freedom\u2019 in those terms and I wanted to expand that idea.</p> <p>\u201cOften, one of the hurdles for loving and accepting yourself is the idea of how you should be, how your life should be. But that picture of perfection resides only in your imagination,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t try to be good at something or have a good life, but if you\u2019re dissatisfied and want to change things all the time, you are going to find yourself very unhappy. So the trick is, how can you make peace with what is? That\u2019s the recipe for happiness.\u201d</p> <p><em>Love for Imperfect Things</em> is packed with random advice on how to achieve this, and addresses the worries and disappointments that regularly arise during Sunim\u2019s public talks and Q&amp;As. If you\u2019re worried because your spouse or child has gained weight, for example, Sunim suggests setting an example by looking after your own health with a varied diet and plenty of exercise. Pointing out a loved one\u2019s faults is more likely to hurt them than make them change, he says. To those searching for the perfect soulmate, Sunim suggests there\u2019s \u201cno such thing\u2026 When you work hard to make your relationship work and stay together for a long time, then you each become the person you were meant to be with.\u201d</p> <p>The book\u2019s glimpses into Sunim\u2019s own life as a Buddhist monk are especially enjoyable. The cake incident is one example. In another, Sunim remembers a meditation retreat where an older monk directed him to sweep the steps. Since he was already volunteering diligently in the kitchen, Sunim spent what he later saw was an embarrassing amount of time seething about the extra task, which, in reality, took less than five minutes to complete. From this, he learned to be more mindful of negative thought patterns triggered by very minor issues.</p> <p><em><strong>Su</strong></em><em><strong>nim also describes</strong></em> breakthroughs in his own family relationships. One concerns his father, who used to irritate him by always putting himself last and insisting he was \u201cunimportant\u201d. For this reason, when he rapidly, inexplicably lost weight, he even put off seeing a doctor.</p> <p>\u201cWe get the most annoyed by the people we are closest to,\u201d says Sunim. \u201cWhat helps \u2013 and what helped me \u2013 is not wishing they were different or telling them to change but instead trying to understand them better. I made the effort to talk to my father and ask him questions, not in relation to me but as a separate human being.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I found was very surprising,\u201d he continues. \u201cI saw a man whose own father hadn\u2019t shown him a lot of love and affirmation. His father had valued his oldest son \u2013 and my father, the second son, had internalised that. He saw himself as unimportant. I think understanding your parents as separate to you is a sign of maturity.\u201d His father\u2019s health has since recovered and in the book Sunim thanks him for raising a son with high self-esteem and a positive outlook.</p> <p>Sunim\u2019s father has enjoyed the book \u2013 both parents are extremely proud of their son, though surprised by his \u201ccareer path\u201d. As a student, he left South Korea to study film at the University of California, before switching to religious studies. \u201cI thought film would be a fun and interesting process, but it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking one short film was very time-consuming, such a group effort with so many elements out of my hands. I instantly realised that was not my path. I\u2019d always been very interested in religion, so studying that was very natural for me.\u201d He took a master\u2019s at Harvard, a doctorate at Princeton and then taught in an American college.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Sometimes I need to read my own books for my own advice\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At 25, he decided to become a monk. \u201cI was more interested in personal, spiritual experience than being a scholar,\u201d he says. \u201cAs an academic, you study someone else\u2019s work not so much to inspire or deepen your practice but to prove points \u2013 it\u2019s logical, scientific. With spiritual practice, it\u2019s more personal; it often transcends language.\u201d</p> <p><em>Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down</em> was published first in South Korea, where it spent 41 weeks at number one. I wonder if its success surprised him \u2013 after all, the mindfulness message has been heard before. \u201cI think it\u2019s because I\u2019m writing to help my readers,\u201d says Sunim. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it as an artist, or to give myself expression. People can see that and, traditionally in Korea, people turn to Buddhist monks for advice. I\u2019m part of that.\u201d</p> <p>Sunim admits the success brought pressures. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the book to become so popular, so I didn\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get stopped in restaurants, or in a coffee shop, and asked for a photo. I try to be as gracious as I can, but it\u2019s a little bit awkward for me; though, overall, I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p> <p>Writing is just one way Sunim spreads his message. In South Korea he has opened \u2013 and funded \u2013 two healing centres he calls Schools for Broken Hearts. Anyone navigating difficult times \u2013 divorce, illness, loneliness, family breakdown \u2013 can come, connect, and access practical help from teachers and psychologists. \u201cWhether you\u2019re Christian, Buddhist, Islam\u2026 this is for everyone,\u201d says Sunim. \u201cThat\u2019s what my life revolves around now.\u201d</p> <p>With 50 part-time teachers and 12 full-time employees, it sounds quite an undertaking. In fact, Sunim\u2019s schedule does seem rather full-on for a monk famous for urging us all to slow down.

      "bodyText": "When a smart caf\u00e9 opened in his neighbourhood in New York, where he used to live, Buddhist monk and bestselling author Haemin Sunim went along to sample the delicious-looking cake. Hearing the prices, however, he balked and ordered just tea instead \u2013 but that cake stayed in his mind all afternoon. The next day, he was still thinking about it, and the day after that until, finally, he had to go back and treat himself. The verdict? \u201cIt was delicious but not extraordinarily delicious,\u201d he writes in his new book, Love for Imperfect Things. \u201cThis must be the kind of feeling people have after winning the Nobel prize or becoming president.\u201d This small, wry slice of everyday life \u2013 and let-down \u2013 is one of many in Sunim\u2019s latest self-care tome, the follow-up to his first book, the wildly successful Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down, published in 2012. Sunim, 45, has been dubbed a \u201cmegamonk\u201d. He has the kind of celebrity status that can turn a short stroll through his native Seoul, South Korea, into an embarrassing round of selfie requests. With over 1m followers on Twitter and Facebook, his first book was a quiet call for calm in our insanely busy world. Translated into 30 languages, it sold in the millions. Sunim offers bite-size Buddhism \u2013 mindfulness for the modern age \u2013 mainly through short anecdotes or sparse, haiku-like verse. His writing is gentle and meandering, and often so simple as to seem quite obvious. Haemin Sunim (which means \u201cspontaneous wisdom\u201d) gives insight and advice we might know already, but still fail to heed. The central message in Love for Imperfect Things is the importance of loving and accepting our imperfect selves, our imperfect world \u2013 and imperfect cake \u2013 the way a mother loves her child, no matter what. The book examines the many ways expectations fall short. Our parents don\u2019t understand us. Our children don\u2019t appreciate us. We didn\u2019t nail that \u201cdream job\u201d or, if we did, it hasn\u2019t delivered what we dreamed it would. \u201cThat \u2018disappointment\u2019 is a problem of humanity, not just in the west,\u201d says Sunim, speaking to me from New York, where he has come to meet his spiritual teacher. \u201cOne of the reasons I became interested in our relationship with imperfection was reading Sengchan, the sixth-century Chinese Zen master, who said: \u2018True freedom is being without anxiety about imperfection\u2019. I\u2019d never thought of \u2018freedom\u2019 in those terms and I wanted to expand that idea. \u201cOften, one of the hurdles for loving and accepting yourself is the idea of how you should be, how your life should be. But that picture of perfection resides only in your imagination,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t try to be good at something or have a good life, but if you\u2019re dissatisfied and want to change things all the time, you are going to find yourself very unhappy. So the trick is, how can you make peace with what is? That\u2019s the recipe for happiness.\u201d Love for Imperfect Things is packed with random advice on how to achieve this, and addresses the worries and disappointments that regularly arise during Sunim\u2019s public talks and Q&amp;As. If you\u2019re worried because your spouse or child has gained weight, for example, Sunim suggests setting an example by looking after your own health with a varied diet and plenty of exercise. Pointing out a loved one\u2019s faults is more likely to hurt them than make them change, he says. To those searching for the perfect soulmate, Sunim suggests there\u2019s \u201cno such thing\u2026 When you work hard to make your relationship work and stay together for a long time, then you each become the person you were meant to be with.\u201d The book\u2019s glimpses into Sunim\u2019s own life as a Buddhist monk are especially enjoyable. The cake incident is one example. In another, Sunim remembers a meditation retreat where an older monk directed him to sweep the steps. Since he was already volunteering diligently in the kitchen, Sunim spent what he later saw was an embarrassing amount of time seething about the extra task, which, in reality, took less than five minutes to complete. From this, he learned to be more mindful of negative thought patterns triggered by very minor issues. Sunim also describes breakthroughs in his own family relationships. One concerns his father, who used to irritate him by always putting himself last and insisting he was \u201cunimportant\u201d. For this reason, when he rapidly, inexplicably lost weight, he even put off seeing a doctor. \u201cWe get the most annoyed by the people we are closest to,\u201d says Sunim. \u201cWhat helps \u2013 and what helped me \u2013 is not wishing they were different or telling them to change but instead trying to understand them better. I made the effort to talk to my father and ask him questions, not in relation to me but as a separate human being. \u201cWhat I found was very surprising,\u201d he continues. \u201cI saw a man whose own father hadn\u2019t shown him a lot of love and affirmation. His father had valued his oldest son \u2013 and my father, the second son, had internalised that. He saw himself as unimportant. I think understanding your parents as separate to you is a sign of maturity.\u201d His father\u2019s health has since recovered and in the book Sunim thanks him for raising a son with high self-esteem and a positive outlook. Sunim\u2019s father has enjoyed the book \u2013 both parents are extremely proud of their son, though surprised by his \u201ccareer path\u201d. As a student, he left South Korea to study film at the University of California, before switching to religious studies. \u201cI thought film would be a fun and interesting process, but it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking one short film was very time-consuming, such a group effort with so many elements out of my hands. I instantly realised that was not my path. I\u2019d always been very interested in religion, so studying that was very natural for me.\u201d He took a master\u2019s at Harvard, a doctorate at Princeton and then taught in an American college. At 25, he decided to become a monk. \u201cI was more interested in personal, spiritual experience than being a scholar,\u201d he says. \u201cAs an academic, you study someone else\u2019s work not so much to inspire or deepen your practice but to prove points \u2013 it\u2019s logical, scientific. With spiritual practice, it\u2019s more personal; it often transcends language.\u201d Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down was published first in South Korea, where it spent 41 weeks at number one. I wonder if its success surprised him \u2013 after all, the mindfulness message has been heard before. \u201cI think it\u2019s because I\u2019m writing to help my readers,\u201d says Sunim. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it as an artist, or to give myself expression. People can see that and, traditionally in Korea, people turn to Buddhist monks for advice. I\u2019m part of that.\u201d Sunim admits the success brought pressures. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the book to become so popular, so I didn\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get stopped in restaurants, or in a coffee shop, and asked for a photo. I try to be as gracious as I can, but it\u2019s a little bit awkward for me; though, overall, I\u2019m grateful.\u201d Writing is just one way Sunim spreads his message. In South Korea he has opened \u2013 and funded \u2013 two healing centres he calls Schools for Broken Hearts. Anyone navigating difficult times \u2013 divorce, illness, loneliness, family breakdown \u2013 can come, connect, and access practical help from teachers and psychologists. \u201cWhether you\u2019re Christian, Buddhist, Islam\u2026 this is for everyone,\u201d says Sunim. \u201cThat\u2019s what my life revolves around now.\u201d With 50 part-time teachers and 12 full-time employees, it sounds quite an undertaking. In fact, Sunim\u2019s schedule does seem rather full-on for a monk famous for urging us all to slow down. He was in New York when we speak, he\u2019s in London this month to promote his book, then he will be back in South Korea, where he combines work at his schools with meditation retreats, plus public Q&amp;As across the country once or twice a day. Add to this a meditation app which he hopes to launch later this year. Is he packing a lot in? \u201cI have reduced my engagement with social media,\u201d says Sunim. \u201cI spend less time on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, things like that. \u201cSometimes I need to read my own books for my own advice,\u201d he admits. \u201cJust because I said it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve already embodied it!

      "body": "<p>Amid the anti-globalist chest-thumping of Brexit, Donald Trump, and the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, it may sound like the stuff of folklore. But there was a time in the recent past when all the countries of the world moved quickly to discuss a common threat, agreed an ambitious plan of action and made it work.</p> <p>The Montreal protocol, which <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-2-a&amp;chapter=27&amp;clang=_en\" title=\"\">came into effect 30 years ago</a>, was drawn up to address the alarming thinning of the ozone layer in the Earth\u2019s stratosphere. It was the first agreement in the history of the United Nations to be ratified by all 197 countries. Since it came into effect on 1 January 1989,<strong> </strong>more than 99% of the gases responsible for the problem have been eradicated and the \u201cozone hole\u201d \u2013 which, in the late 80s, vied for headline space with the cold war, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Madonna \u2013 is receding in the sky and the memory.</p> <p>According to the latest UN study, the \u201cozone holes\u201d (there are actually two: one above each pole) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/05/ozone-layer-healing-after-aerosols-un-northern-hemisphere\" title=\"\">are healing</a> at the rate of<strong> </strong>1% to 3% a decade and will have completely vanished in the northern hemisphere by the 2030s and the southern hemisphere by the 2060s. This is cause for back-slapping, but also frustration that the world has not been able to unite as effectively over the climate and biodiversity crises. Here are half a dozen lessons.</p> <h2><strong>Imagery and language matter</strong><br></h2> <p>The satellite animation of the changing atmosphere over the Antarctic first shown in 1985 appeared to show a growing \u201cozone hole\u201d. This was a scientifically imprecise description of the thinning that was concentrated at both poles, but the metaphor \u2013 of the roof over our home planet being punctured \u2013 captured the public imagination and, most importantly, conveyed a sense of urgency. By contrast, many people feel distant from climate problems, which are usually illustrated with images of polar bears, filled with caveats and headlined with vague labels, such as \u201cglobal warming\u201d, which sounds benign (or even desirable for those living in cold countries), and \u201cclimate change\u201d, which comes<strong> </strong>across as a statement of the obvious.</p> <h2><strong>Safety first </strong><br></h2> <p>When scientists raised the alarm about chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases, there was initially uncertainty about their impact on the atmosphere and the process, but the risks from sunlight weakly filtered by the ozone layer (cancer, crop failure, ocean ecosystem collapse) were so great that world leaders decided not to wait. Instead, they applied the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d: \u201cIf in doubt, cut it out.\u201d Even before the science was settled, they started to act. This was also supposed to be the case with the climate, but lobbying to deny the validity of the science, particularly in the US, has stymied action.</p> <h2><strong>Speed counts</strong><br></h2> <p>Governments temporarily put aside cold-war hostilities and united rapidly around a solution to the ozone problem. From the first research in 1973, it took just 16 years for the world to discuss, agree and put in place a solution that reversed the trend. By comparison, scientific warnings that carbon dioxide emissions could disrupt the climate date back to at least 1962 (and the risks were speculated on much earlier). Yet despite numerous international agreements on the subject since then (Rio 1992, Kyoto 1998, Copenhagen 2009, Paris 2015), emissions are still climbing.</p> <h2><strong>Leaders </strong><strong>should lead</strong><br></h2> <p>In the 80s, the environment was not yet the polarising issue it has become, but the dominant figures \u2013 including the US president, George HW Bush, the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher \u2013 still had to overcome business interests, treasury doubts and political short-termism to protect the future health of the planet. They refused to accept the delaying tactics of chemical companies, some of which argued action should wait until the science was clearer.<strong> </strong>Today, Trump, Bolsonaro and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, represent fossil fuel interests, deny science and undermine international cooperation.</p> <h2><strong>The burden must be shared</strong><br></h2> <p>The phased ban on CFCs and dozens of other ozone-depleting gases was an economic blow to chemical firms, refrigerator producers and aerosol-spray manufacturers. Rich countries dealt with the job losses, technology upgrades and other economic consequences internally, but also provided support for poorer nations to manage the transition. From 1991 to 2005, pledges totalled $3.1bn. Similar arrangements exist for climate accords, but the sums need to be far higher because the actions are so much more expensive, the responsibility of industrialised nations is so much greater, and the impact on poor countries is incalculably worse.</p> <h2><strong>If it\u2019s worth doing, it\u2019s worth improving</strong><br></h2> <p>The Montreal protocol has been updated numerous times as the science has sharpened and new climate goals have been incorporated. This month, the Kigali amendment added a plan to cut hydrofluorocarbons by more than 80% over the next 30 years, which would reduce global heating by 0.4C by the end of the century. Under the Paris climate agreement, governments are supposed to ratchet up the ambition of their pledges to cut emissions, but most governments are failing to meet even their current inadequate targets.</p> <p>Looking at this list, a millennial might be tempted to conclude that the Montreal protocol was possible because it came about in a golden age when leaders were smarter, politicians more representative and populations more amenable to scientific persuasion. But, as anyone alive in 1989 knows, that is far too simple an explanation. The reality is that environmental action was easier then because the world had more ecological breathing room, capitalism was less dominant and the corporate push-back \u2013 and control over politics \u2013 was weaker. The ozone layer was a relatively simple fix compared with the climate, which is the biggest, most complex, multidimensional challenge humanity has ever faced. It is one thing confronting a handful of chemical firms, quite another to take on the world\u2019s fossil fuel companies, car manufacturers, cement-makers and agribusiness conglomerates, representing hundreds of millions of jobs, trillions of dollars and 200-odd years of industrial development.</p> <p>Bush, Thatcher, Gorbachev and the then Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, knew this in 1989, when global temperatures were already rising at an unnaturally rapid rate. A year earlier, in a US congressional testimony reported throughout the world, the then Nasa scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/19/james-hansen-nasa-scientist-climate-change-warning\" title=\"\">Jim Hansen had declared</a> \u201cwith 99% confidence\u201d that this heating was a result of human activity. They also knew the problem would be easier to solve then than 30 years in the future. Initially, Bush promised to lead a determined global response to climate change, but \u2013 as the short-term costs of a long-term solution became apparent \u2013 he balked. Instead of a comprehensive response, he merely strengthened research, paved the way for a drawn-out global negotiating process and complacently put his faith in future innovation and entrepreneurship.</p> <p>He may well have reassured himself that his environmental legacy was secure, thanks to action on ozone. But the climate can that he and others kicked forward 30 years ago is still clanking through the corridors of global conferences. It is a lot rustier now, but still basically the same half-response to a problem that becomes bigger and harder to solve with every year that passes.</p> <p>So this year\u2019s anniversary of the implementation of the Montreal protocol should not just inspire nostalgia for 1989, but a curse on the first generation of leaders to dodge climate responsibility. And as we are already suffering the consequences of their failure, it should remind us that every day of delay has a massive and imminent cost. Each fraction of a degree of global heating that can be prevented will save lives, species and money.</p> <p>In our lifetimes, the ozone hole will be closed in the stratosphere while the increasingly angry beast of climate rages below. How angry is up to us. Montreal reminds us that nothing in politics is inevitable, that profits do not have to come before people, that global problems can have global solutions, that we can shape our own future. That depends on how far we are willing to push. In 1989, that wasn\u2019t far enough. Nor has it been since. In 2003, the UN secretary-general, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/ozoneday/background.shtml\" title=\"\">Kofi Annan, called</a> the Montreal protocol \u201cperhaps the single most successful international agreement to date\u201d. Sadly, that still applies today.</p>",

Looking at this list, a millennial might be tempted to conclude that the Montreal protocol was possible because it came about in a golden age when leaders were smarter, politicians more representative and populations more amenable to scientific persuasion. But, as anyone alive in 1989 knows, that is far too simple an explanation. The reality is that environmental action was easier then because the world had more ecological breathing room, capitalism was less dominant and the corporate push-back \u2013 and control over politics \u2013 was weaker. The ozone layer was a relatively simple fix compared with the climate, which is the biggest, most complex, multidimensional challenge humanity has ever faced. It is one thing confronting a handful of chemical firms, quite another to take on the world\u2019s fossil fuel companies, car manufacturers, cement-makers and agribusiness conglomerates, representing hundreds of millions of jobs, trillions of dollars and 200-odd years of industrial development. Bush, Thatcher, Gorbachev and the then Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, knew this in 1989, when global temperatures were already rising at an unnaturally rapid rate. A year earlier, in a US congressional testimony reported throughout the world, the then Nasa scientist Jim Hansen had declared \u201cwith 99% confidence\u201d that this heating was a result of human activity. They also knew the problem would be easier to solve then than 30 years in the future. Initially, Bush promised to lead a determined global response to climate change, but \u2013 as the short-term costs of a long-term solution became apparent \u2013 he balked. Instead of a comprehensive response, he merely strengthened research, paved the way for a drawn-out global negotiating process and complacently put his faith in future innovation and entrepreneurship. He may well have reassured himself that his environmental legacy was secure, thanks to action on ozone. But the climate can that he and others kicked forward 30 years ago is still clanking through the corridors of global conferences. It is a lot rustier now, but still basically the same half-response to a problem that becomes bigger and harder to solve with every year that passes. So this year\u2019s anniversary of the implementation of the Montreal protocol should not just inspire nostalgia for 1989, but a curse on the first generation of leaders to dodge climate responsibility. And as we are already suffering the consequences of their failure, it should remind us that every day of delay has a massive and imminent cost. Each fraction of a degree of global heating that can be prevented will save lives, species and money. In our lifetimes, the ozone hole will be closed in the stratosphere while the increasingly angry beast of climate rages below. How angry is up to us. Montreal reminds us that nothing in politics is inevitable, that profits do not have to come before people, that global problems can have global solutions, that we can shape our own future. That depends on how far we are willing to push. In 1989, that wasn\u2019t far enough. Nor has it been since. In 2003, the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, called the Montreal protocol \u201cperhaps the single most successful international agreement to date\u201d. Sadly, that still applies today.",

      "bodyText": "On the final morning of the Paris shows, Jacquemus, the French label known for putting women in huge hats and men in tiny shorts, showed its first autumn/winter menswear collection. The show was titled Le Meunier (\u2018the miller\u2019) and the invitation arrived with a loaf of bread and the promise of breakfast. Outside, rain spat down but inside the Palais de Tokyo this promise was fulfilled, with guests served buttered bread, Comt\u00e9 cheese, juice and croissants. There were no seats, no light change, and no starting pistol. As people ate, models snaked their way through the crowd before assembling round a table to eat their share. The inspiration was \u201cthe intersection of land and labour\u201d but really this was about real men in real clothes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to show fantasy,\u201d said the brand\u2019s founder, Simon Porte Jacquemus, despite dealing primarily with fantasy in past collections. \u201cIt is about work, about those who wake up early, about reality and about real clothes you can wear.\u201d On the not-catwalk, this was translated literally: workwear jackets and wide-fitting trousers came in cotton canvas and denim, and all models wore duck boots. The jackets came melded with utility vests; work shirts and fisherman jumpers came thickly knitted and in a neutral palette. The white ones were undyed; the khaki green, sunflower yellow and industrial orange versions mirrored a Proven\u00e7al landscape instead of a typical winter sky. Accessories, increasingly the brand\u2019s golden goose, were minimal \u2013 a necklace wallet, a couple of larger bags, and a stiff leather necktie. Pockets abounded. The touches of realism were present \u2013 jackets were triple stitched for durability, and two models wore spectacles \u2013 but looked elevated enough to pass as high fashion. Blink and you\u2019d miss the wheatsheaf embroidery doubling up as stripes.

      "bodyText": "An opposition politician in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has called on his millions of followers to conduct a peaceful campaign of civil disobedience following the rejection of his appeal against election results by the country\u2019s highest court. Martin Fayulu said he considered himself the \u201csole legitimate president-elect\u201d of the country and urged the Congolese people not to recognise \u201cany individual who would claim this authority illegally\u201d. The DRC\u2019s constitutional court confirmed early on Sunday morning that Felix Tshisekedi, the leader of the country\u2019s main opposition party, was the winner of the polls that were held after more than two years of delays in December. Fayulu, who was placed a close second, rejected the provisional official tally released last week, saying it was the product of a secret deal between Tshisekedi and the outgoing president, Joseph Kabila, to cheat him out of a clear win. Leaked internal data seen by the Guardian from the electoral commission in the DRC and from the influential Catholic church, which deployed more than 40,000 monitors on polling day, appears to indicate that Fayulu won convincingly with about 60% of the votes cast. Aides to Kabila and Tshisekedi have denied making any deal, though they have confirmed a dialogue. The influential African Union broke with a long tradition of backing governments in power to implicitly question the results. Experts have described the usually conservative AU\u2019s appeal for the final results to be delayed as \u201cincredible\u201d. On Sunday, the Southern African Development Community, which had previously appeared sceptical of the results, issued a statement to congratulate Tshisekedi on his victory. Officials in Kinshasa suggested that Tshisekedi, who inherited the leadership of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress when his father died in 2017 and has not previously held senior office, may be inaugurated as president as early as Tuesday. Such a swift inauguration would be a gamble that might further destabilise the DRC, intensifying the sporadic unrest in which 34 people have already been killed, 59 wounded and 241 \u201carbitrary arrests\u201d made in the past week, according to the UN human rights office. However, it is unclear whether Fayulu, who has tapped into a deep anger among ordinary people at the behaviour of a corrupt and incompetent elite, can mobilise a broad-based campaign of civil resistance. Though respected, the former business executive turned parliamentarian lacks the nationwide organisation of Tshisekedi. Analysts say most of the security establishment remain loyal to Kabila. Tshisekedi said on Sunday the court\u2019s decision confirming him as the winner of the presidential election was a victory for the entire country. \u201cIt is Congo that won,\u201d he said, speaking to his supporters. \u201cIt is not the victory of one camp against another. I am engaged in a campaign to reconcile all Congolese ... The Congo that we are going to form will not be a Congo of division, hatred or tribalism. It will be a reconciled Congo, a strong Congo that will be focused on development, peace and security.\u201d The poll was meant to enable DRC\u2019s first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence from Belgium. The government spokesman Lambert Mende said by telephone that the ruling party had \u201ctaken note\u201d of the court decision. \u201cFelix Tshisekedi will become the fifth president of the republic,\u201d Mende said. Senior officials known as loyal to Kabila have indicated their willingness to work with Tshisekedi. \u201cI reiterate my congratulations ... and ask the population to allow this first transition of power to take place in peace. Long live democracy,\u201d Julien Paluku, the governor of the restive eastern province of North Kivu, said on Twitter. DRC\u2019s constitutional court is widely seen as loyal to Kabila, who has been in power since his father was assassinated in 2001. Reports suggest that internet service in the DRC has returned, 20 days after it was cut off following the elections in what appeared to be an attempt to dampen speculation about the presidential election results and hinder organisation of protests. Fayulu has called on the international community to reject the poll results. \u201cI ask the entire international community not to recognise a power that has neither legitimacy nor legal standing to represent the Congolese people,\u201d he said.",

The device detonated at 8.10pm.\u201d</p> <p>The attackers failed to kill or injure anyone, said Hamilton. \u201cThe people responsible for this attack have shown no regard for the community or local businesses. They care little about the damage to the area and the disruption they have caused,\u201d he added.</p> <p>No one claimed responsibility but suspicion fell on dissident Irish republicans opposed to the peace process.</p> <p>A spate of bomb attacks in Derry in 2015, including a device found under a police officer\u2019s car, was blamed on dissident republicans. They caused no casualties.</p> <p>The Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, expressed concern and urged anyone with information about the attack to contact the police or Crimestoppers.</p> <p>Bradley said: \u201cThis attempt to disrupt progress in Northern Ireland has rightly been met with utter condemnation from all parts of the community. The small number of people responsible have absolutely nothing to offer Northern Ireland\u2019s future and will not prevail.</p> <p>\u201cOur voices across the political spectrum are united. This is intolerable violence and we want to look forward and build a peaceful future for all in Northern Ireland. \u201d</p> <p>Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, said the attack was an attempt to drag Northern Ireland back into violence and conflict.</p> <p>Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, called it a \u201cpointless act of terror\u201d perpetrated by people with no regard for life.</p> <p>The Foyle Sinn F\u00e9in MP, Elisha McCallion, also condemned the blast.

      "bodyText": "Police in Northern Ireland have arrested four men in connection with Saturday night\u2019s car bomb in Derry city. Two suspects, both in their 20s, were detained early on Sunday after what police called an \u201cunbelievably reckless\u201d attack outside a courthouse in the heart of the city. Two more men, aged 34 and 42 years, were arrested in Derry on Sunday evening. The New IRA, a dissident republican group, was the main line of inquiry, the assistant chief constable, Mark Hamilton, told a media briefing near the scene. Authorities have released CCTV footage of the car stopping outside the courthouse, the driver running away from the vehicle, and the subsequent explosion. Police said they received approximately 10 minutes\u2019 warning before the bomb exploded outside a courthouse on Bishop Street at 8.10pm, giving little time to evacuate hundreds of people from a nearby hotel, the Freemasons\u2019 hall, youth club and other sites. There were no casualties. A pizza delivery vehicle hijacked a short time earlier is believed to have been used in the attack. Witnesses said they heard a loud bang and saw a large plume of smoke. A police forensics team was examining the scene on Sunday, with cordons sealing off access to the charred wreckage of the vehicle. \u201cAt around 7.55pm last night officers on patrol in Bishop Street spotted a suspicious vehicle and were making checks when, around five minutes later, information was received that a device had been left at the courthouse,\u201d Hamilton said in a statement released earlier on Sunday. \u201cWe moved immediately to begin evacuating people from nearby buildings, including hundreds of hotel guests, 150 people from the Masonic Hall and a large number of children from a church youth club. The device detonated at 8.10pm.\u201d The attackers failed to kill or injure anyone, said Hamilton. \u201cThe people responsible for this attack have shown no regard for the community or local businesses. They care little about the damage to the area and the disruption they have caused,\u201d he added. No one claimed responsibility but suspicion fell on dissident Irish republicans opposed to the peace process. A spate of bomb attacks in Derry in 2015, including a device found under a police officer\u2019s car, was blamed on dissident republicans. They caused no casualties. The Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, expressed concern and urged anyone with information about the attack to contact the police or Crimestoppers. Bradley said: \u201cThis attempt to disrupt progress in Northern Ireland has rightly been met with utter condemnation from all parts of the community. The small number of people responsible have absolutely nothing to offer Northern Ireland\u2019s future and will not prevail. \u201cOur voices across the political spectrum are united. This is intolerable violence and we want to look forward and build a peaceful future for all in Northern Ireland. \u201d Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, said the attack was an attempt to drag Northern Ireland back into violence and conflict. Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, called it a \u201cpointless act of terror\u201d perpetrated by people with no regard for life. The Foyle Sinn F\u00e9in MP, Elisha McCallion, also condemned the blast. She said: \u201cDerry is a city moving forward and no one wants this type of incident. It is not representative of the city. I would encourage anyone with information about this incident to bring it to the police.\u201d A handful of small, radical republican groups reject power-sharing in Northern Ireland and accuse Sinn F\u00e9in of selling out by accepting the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which drew a line under the Troubles. Saoradh, a fringe political party backed by New IRA prisoners, attributed the attack to \u201crepublican revolutionaries\u201d and linked it to the centenary of the Soloheadbeg ambush on police in Tipperary, widely seen as the start of Ireland\u2019s war of independence against Britain. \u201cIt seems 100 years later Volunteer Sean Tracey\u2019s comrades continue the unfinished revolution,\u201d said the party\u2019s website. The attack bore all the hallmarks of the New IRA, which has made a point of targeting police and courts, said Marisa McGlinchey, the author of a forthcoming book, Unfinished Business: the Politics of \u2018Dissident\u2019 Irish Republicanism. The group rejected the term dissident and sought to link itself to the IRA, which fought the war of independence a century ago, said McGlinchey, a professor at Coventry University. \u201cIt\u2019s a very deliberate strike to try to underline continuity.\u201d Ireland\u2019s culture minister, Josepha Madigan, is due on Monday to lay a remembrance wreath at the Solohead memorial. Monday is also the 100th anniversary of the first meeting of the D\u00e1il, a breakaway parliament set up by Irish MPs who shunned Westminster. Northern Ireland has drifted in a political vacuum since a row between Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP collapsed the power-sharing executive at Stormont in 2017. Brexit has compounded the instability by reviving contention over the border and and Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional status. Andrew Adonis, the Labour peer, accused Brexiters of playing fast and loose with the region\u2019s peace and stability. \u201cThe prime minister should be in Derry-Londonderry today discussing the state of the city and security \u2013 &amp; then go Belfast to meet all the parties &amp; break the deadlock to set up a Northern Ireland Assembly &amp; Government.

      "body": "<p>Michael Peppiatt\u2019s memoir is subtitled <em>Paris Among </em><em>the Artists</em>, but it could be called <em>A Portrait </em><em>of </em><em>the Art Critic As </em><em>an Older Man</em>. Peppiatt, who is best known for his biography and memoirs of his friend Francis Bacon, has spent the greater part of his working life in Paris, and this book is a love letter to the city, although not an uncritical one. He writes in the preface that he will explore \u201cmy lifelong attachment to this bewitching, temperamental, exasperating city and the deep love-hate relationship that binds me to it\u201d. Yet he is ultimately a romantic, and the scent that rises from these pages is a heady aroma of Gauloises and red wine. Peppiatt, as a young man, was rather fond of the bottle; this book, at its best, has a similarly intoxicating quality, if one allows for the inevitable moments of self-absorption.</p> <p>Peppiatt was brought up to be bilingual, because his father believed that he stood a better chance of getting on in the world if he spoke French. His faith was rewarded when his son obtained a job at the culture magazine <em>R\u00e9alit\u00e9s</em> in 1964, from where he headed to the English-language version of <em>Le Monde</em> and then to <em>Art International</em>, which he both published and edited. He accomplished this, as well as writing numerous books about art, with an air of cultured insouciance. Yet, as he notes, \u201cthe luxuries, the grandeurs, have no meaning without the drudgery and <em>mis\u00e8res</em> of the daily round\u201d. It must be said that Peppiatt\u2019s luxuries and grandeurs are rather more grand than the rest of us might expect. When he writes about drinking champagne at the Paris Ritz, or being led on grand bacchanals by famous chums, it is hard not to feel that Peppiatt has led an unusually gilded existence.</p> <p>This is a memoir in which names are not so much dropped as flung at the reader; it contains sentences such as \u201cI also started going out on the town again with Francis Bacon.\u201d (As in his other books, Bacon is a recurrent, often disruptive presence.) There is a vaguely Pooterish quality to some of Peppiatt\u2019s adventures with the great and good. He fails to meet Giacometti, who lives in the studio next door to his lodgings and for whom Bacon has given him a letter of introduction, because the great sculptor is selfishly dying of stomach cancer in Switzerland. He meets Marlene Dietrich at dinner, but she drunkenly moans that her husband has forbidden her to eat hot dogs. Sonia Orwell dismisses him as an \u201cobscure young man\u201d. James Baldwin\u2019s face is \u201cfull of suffering\u201d, despite or perhaps because of Peppiatt collaring him for half an hour. He fails to speak to Samuel Beckett, despite sitting next to him, and is irked that a passing American (\u201ccomplete with backpack\u201d) is able to engage in a \u201cbrief, courteous\u201d exchange .</p> <p>Peppiatt has an aesthete\u2019s love of life, and there are vivid descriptions of food, drink and romance here that both enrapture and inspire. This enjoyable book works best as an account of a lifelong love affair with the Parisian streets, of the ability to escape the madding crowd and lose oneself in a backyard cafe. In the epilogue, when he recounts how his wife and he have returned once again to live in Paris after two decades in London, there is a movingly elegiac quality to his description of how he is no longer a fl\u00e2neur and boulevardier, but is content to be an observer instead. <em>The Existential Englishman</em> offers elegant proof that Michael Peppiatt\u2019s powers of observation remain undimmed and acute.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Existential Englishman</em> by Michael Peppiatt is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a325).

Peppiatt has an aesthete\u2019s love of life, and there are vivid descriptions of food, drink and romance here that both enrapture and inspire. This enjoyable book works best as an account of a lifelong love affair with the Parisian streets, of the ability to escape the madding crowd and lose oneself in a backyard cafe. In the epilogue, when he recounts how his wife and he have returned once again to live in Paris after two decades in London, there is a movingly elegiac quality to his description of how he is no longer a fl\u00e2neur and boulevardier, but is content to be an observer instead. The Existential Englishman offers elegant proof that Michael Peppiatt\u2019s powers of observation remain undimmed and acute. \u2022 The Existential Englishman by Michael Peppiatt is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a325).

      "bodyText": "A US airstrike in Somalia has killed 52 Islamic militants from al-Shabaab, military officials have said. The strike comes days after a deadly attack by the extremist organisation on a luxury hotel complex in Nairobi, Kenya. A statement from the US Africa command said no civilians had been injured or killed in the strike, which was launched on Saturday in response to an attack by a \u201clarge group\u201d of militants against local Somali forces in a fiercely contested zone south of the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Twenty-one people died in the attack on Nairobi\u2019s dusitD2 hotel complex. Kenyan police have arrested the wife and father of a man identified as the suicide bomber in the attack, police officials said. The attacker, one of five al-Shabaab militants who stormed the complex on Tuesday, was identified as 25-year-old Mahir Khalid Riziki, who grew up in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa. \u201cHe grew up in Mombasa and that is where he was recruited into al-Shabaab,\u201d he said, adding that Riziki had previously been involved in attacks targeting security forces and had travelled to Somalia. Though forced out of major cities, al-Shabaab controls large parts of rural southern and central Somalia and continues to carry out high-profile suicide bombings and other attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere. The group has also conducted a series of assaults on military installations in the unstable east African country, though it has sustained significant casualties. The US has stepped up airstrikes against al-Shabaab in Somalia since Donald Trump took office, carrying out at least 47 strikes last year. Some have targeted top leaders or key financial officials. Al-Shabaab funds its operations through an extensive network of \u201ctaxation\u201d and extortion. In October, the US said an airstrike killed about 60 fighters near the al-Shabaab-controlled community of Harardhere in Mudug province in central Somalia. Research by the Mogadishu-based Hiraan Institute suggests that the organisation has largely adapted to the new threat and that the use of air power alone is likely to be insufficient to defeat the group, which has been fighting to impose an extreme version of Islamic law on Somalia for more than a decade. Civilian casualties blamed on the US have been a factor in al-Shabaab recruitment. Al-Shabaab, which is an affiliate of al-Qaida, was responsible for a bloody assault on a mall in the Kenyan capital in 2013.",

Federer then whacks a backhand well wide to make it 4-4. This is pretty tense, as Fed proves with a weak backhand into the net for no reason. Fed smashes an ace down the middle ... but there is a challenge, which is erroneous. A line judge has made the latest \u201cOut\u201d call off all time. It is out! And now this is match point!!!

Federer starts it off by woefully miscueing a shot into the stands pretty much. Not how you want to start on your serve. Tsitsipas on the other hand smashes two aces, the second just about kissing the line, as proved by Hawkeye. Fed gets back into it as the Greek\u2019s inside-out forearm heads out to make it 3-1. The Swiss then offers up the look of a man about to kill after a bad call from the umpire results in the point being replayed. Much to his relief, he wins that one. Federer levels things up with a sublime backhand down the line. Wonderful. With the pressure back on Tsitsipas he holds his nerve in a rally, ending with Fed finding the net and then he makes it 5-3 with a passing forearm. He then keeps his calm to let a volley pass him, in the knowledge it was heading just out. Tsitsipas serves for the set ... and wins it!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"949e59a9a69f143cb53b41cdfd22585a628fab3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/949e59a9a69f143cb53b41cdfd22585a628fab3e/0_0_3786_2272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stefanos Tsitsipas celebrates after levelling the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stefanos Tsitsipas celebrates after levelling the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T10:32:23.009Z\">at 10.32am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c444949e4b0197a614f6932\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T10:12:54.111Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Second set: </strong><strong>Tsitsipas* 6-7, 6-6 Federer</strong></p> <p>Tsitsipas serves to stay in the set and does so with aplomb as takes the game to love.

They often cut away to the view from just behind the players, which gives us a more intimate feel of the way the game is being played. The overhead shot often seems to make the ball easier to see, but the use of the court cameras should be more encouraged - the awkward bounce and height from the best shots is captured through these frames. If the broadcasters stream these games online, maybe there could be a stream permanently from these cameras, accompanied by nothing but the sounds of the game with optional commentary?

The Greek ensures we go to Deuce with a big serve. Federer gets another chance of a break but a serve down the middle does the job for Tsitsipas to make it eight break points Fed has failed to take in the match. He gets the chance of a ninth and misses out again with a poor shot from the baseline. A tenth comes immediately thanks to a cracking shot across court but it is not taken as Tsitsipas volleys a winner.

Ooooof! Deuce #3 sees Tsitsipas volley his way to advantage but he then gets unlucky on the next point as a Federer shot clips the net and he just gets it back over but the Swiss smashes a winner.

A review is called for from Tsitsipas and he is proven right that Federer\u2019s shot was just out. But we are back to Deuce. The Greek then sends a backhand long and Fed has another chance to break his younger opponent but his return smashes into the net. Federer looks in a good position to break Tsitsipas but stopped when chasing down a drop shot even though he could have got there, even Fed himself looks confused.

Federer shouts \u201cCome on!\u201d when going 4-3 up to show how tough it is out there and there is a similar shout from Tsitsipas when he immediately levels things.

On the upside he then has an out call overturned for a serve as it just kissed the line. This is a fascinating opening game, as Federer takes the game back to Deuce with some superb play at the net which Tsitipas cannot cope with. In the end Tsitipas holds the game. More of this, please. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c442ddee4b00173154a7ba0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T08:14:38.391Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Barty got the better of Sharapova earlier ...</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/20/barty-overcomes-first-set-loss-to-beat-sharapova\">Australian Open: Barty overcomes first-set loss to see off Sharapova</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c442cdde4b00173154a7b9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T08:10:26.872Z\">8.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>They are both out on court and are knocking up a bit. </strong>Some lovely early backhands to get you in the mood.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c432ed3e4b058cfe6d93300\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T08:03:28.517Z\">8.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning!</strong></p> <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas comes into this game hoping that self-belief might be enough to see off Roger Federer but that might a bit of a stretch.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our match report: Here are some post-match quotes from Roger Federer: \u201cI have massive regrets tonight. I felt like I have to win the second set. I don\u2019t care how I do it, but I have to do it. Cost me the game tonight.\u201d On John McEnroe\u2019s on-court remarks that the result marked a changing of the guard, Federer replied: \u201cHe\u2019s in front of the mic a lot. He\u2019s always going to say stuff. I love John. I\u2019ve heard that story the last 10 years. From that standpoint, nothing new there. \u201cAbout Stefanos, I think he\u2019s definitely done a really nice job now the last year and a half. Before that, too, obviously. But beating Novak in Toronto, the likes of Anderson and Zverev, now me here. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to do to get to the next level. He\u2019s doing that. It\u2019s really nice for him. I see him definitely being high up in the game for a long time. That was a good night for him tonight.\u201d Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report will arrive shortly, but here\u2019s a snap report from PA: Roger Federer\u2019s chances of winning a third consecutive Australian Open title were ended as 20-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas came of age on Rod Laver Arena. The Greek, who was not born when Federer made his professional debut, has rapidly established himself as one of the most exciting up-and-coming talents in the game and backed it up spectacularly with a 6-7 (11) 7-6 (3) 7-5 7-6 (5) victory to move through to a first grand slam quarter-final. Federer had not lost a match at Melbourne Park since a semi-final defeat to Novak Djokovic in 2016 but his often brilliant forehand was wayward, especially at the big moments, and he failed to take four set points in the second set that might well have changed the outcome. The 37-year-old must have glimpsed something of his younger self in his opponent, from the flowing single-handed backhand, the willingness to charge the net, and the confidence to believe he could beat his childhood idol, just as Federer did to Pete Sampras at Wimbledon in 2001. Tsitsipas said: \u201cRoger is a legend of the sport, (I have) so much respect for him. He showed such good tennis over the years. I\u2019ve been idolising him since the age of six. It was a dream come true just being on Rod Laver facing him. Winning at the end, I cannot describe it.\u201d Right ... that was an interesting start to everyone\u2019s Sunday. I am off to find a massive coffee and some lunch. You should all do the same. Have we witnessed a star born in Melbourne? Only time will tell but I am looking forward to finding out. Until we meet again. Tsitsipas takes the applause of the crowd and treats them to his sweatbands. He departs the court with a the customary signing of the TV camera. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen such a loud crowd in my life,\u201d Tsitsipas adds. He wasn\u2019t saying that when they were randomly shouting \u201cOut!\u201d. Tsitsipas says: \u201cThere is nothing I can compare it to, I am the happiest man on earth right now. I can\u2019t describe it. \u201cRoger is a legend of our sport, so much respect for him. He showed such good tennis over the years, I\u2019ve been analysing him since the age of since. It was a dream just being on Rod Laver playing against him and to win it at the end, I cannot describe it.\u201d CRASH, BANG, WALLOP WHAT A TENNIS MATCH! Tsitsipas goes back to sit down and take it what he has just achieved. Federer had won the two previous Australian Opens and few would have been surprised by a third. The Greek has his head in his hands, almost in shock. Fourth set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 7-6 Federer TIE-BREAK! Tsitsipas starts with an ace. Federer then sends a forehand down the line a touch long to put him on the back foot. A failed lob from the Greek brings it back to 2-1. WHAT A SHOT FROM FEDERER! After an impressive rally he produces a stunning forehand across the court to make it 2-2. Ooooof! As responses go, an ace down the middle from Tsitsipas is not a bad one. The crowd then erupts when the Greek sends a shot into the net for 3-3. Great athleticism from Tsitsipas gets him to a drop shot from Fed but he then fires it long. Federer then whacks a backhand well wide to make it 4-4. This is pretty tense, as Fed proves with a weak backhand into the net for no reason. Fed smashes an ace down the middle ... but there is a challenge, which is erroneous. A line judge has made the latest \u201cOut\u201d call off all time. It is out! And now this is match point!!! Tsitsipas serves ... and he Fed sends the ball into the net!! GAME, SET AND MATCH!!! Fourth set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 6-6 Federer* Federer is ferocious from the off in this game but he gets a bit excited and sends a wayward forehand wide. Some stunning work at the net from Fed sees him volley a few potential winners but Tsitsipas is equal to them but is eventually worn down by the onslaught. Tsitsipas repeatedly looks like he wants to challenge a call but he has no reviews left. He sends two long for Fed to win. Another tie-break. Fourth set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 6-5 Federer \u201cOh man!\u201d is the cry from Federer after he smashes the ball into the net with a backhand. He doesn\u2019t waste breath next time around as he watches an ace fly by and the Greek takes the game to love. Will he break to win? Fourth set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 5-5 Federer* A break here would see Tsitsipas caused a right old upset in Melbourne. Surely Federer won\u2019t lose the match when serving. His opening serve would indicate I am right and he quickly moves into a 30-0 lead but a fierce backhand gets Tsitsipas back into it but not for long as Federer thwacks a forehand well out of reach and he holds. Fourth set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 5-4 Federer A passing backhand from Federer gets the crowd up on their feet. It was a lovely shot to be fair. Federer really needed that. Tsitsipas, laden with his rich leg cream, does not seem to be moving as quickly as previously as Federer makes it 30-30 but some renewed vigour helps to home the game. Fourth set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 4-4 Federer* The medical assistance and delay has seen the crown turn against Tsitsipas with a bit of booing. Federer tests out his physicality with a wide serve which he cannot reach. The game continues along similar lines as Federer holds with minimal fuss. Tsitsipas has pointed to an arm issue and is now just having some cream rubbed into his legs. It just seems like cramp at the moment. Take on more fluids, mate. Fourth set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 4-3 Federer Here comes the trainer!! Maybe Tsitsipas just wants to allowed the crowd a little break from this intense. The Greek shows no sign of weakness as he steams in a 40-0 lead but he offers Federer a glimpse of hope as the Swiss wins two consecutive points but an ace takes the game. Fourth set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 3-3 Federer* Tsitsipas has called for the trainer due to a leg issue. Federer might be very excited about the prospect his opponent is weakened. He certainly is taking advantage of any impediment in this game, winning it to love after pushing the Greek around the court. Fourth set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 3-2 Federer Federer brings it back to 30-30 with some great athleticism which helped him return a shot with a mishit, much to Tsitsipas\u2019 surprise, resulting in the Greek send a shot well wide. He is not too worried by this and takes the game. As a side note, Tsitsipas has no challenges remaining. James emails (from Melbourne): \u201cI\u2019m at the match, one of the best matches I\u2019ve ever seen live. Torn between my love for Federer and my excitement for how good Tsitsipas is at 20 years old. \u201cI think I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the best ending to this match is Federer to somehow find another level in these two sets and pull out the win. Reminding everyone he is still the master but that Tsitsipas will be entertaining us for many years to come.\u201d I thank you for distracting yourself from this match to email me. Fourth set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 2-2 Federer* Federer is put on the back foot, literally and metaphorically, by Tsitsipas as the Greek takes the first point but this is followed by an ace. Federer is now battling here; he is taken to 30-30 and then produces a incredible volley at the net to put himself in control but he wastes it and is taken to Deuce. Possibly out frustration he smashes a serve and then a volley to take the game. Fourth set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 2-1 Federer Top rallying culminates in Tsitsipas volleying the ball into space to win the first point and he rightly celebrates with a fist pump and he comfortably holds his serve. Fourth set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 1-1 Federer* The fans are getting behind Federer now. Everyone loves Fed. He repays their love with a dropped volley over the net to take the first point of the game. Things go quickly downhill for Fed who goes 15-30 down following a woeful volley at the net. The match has seen some utterly woeful reviews, the latest coming from Tsitsipas who things his mishit forehand was in, it was not. Federer takes the game despite the best efforts of the Greek who returns a drop shot but sends it just long. Fourth set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 1-0 Federer Now he has the advantage, Tsitsipas looks more confident, serving his way to the first game of the fourth set without giving Federer a sniff thanks to three consecutive aces. Third set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 7-5 Federer* WE HAVE A BREAK!!! Tsitsipas smashes a shot straight at Federer who just can\u2019t react quick enough to get a volley back over the net. Fed then sends one long to make it 15-30. If anyone is tiring in this match, it is Federer. Two set points for the Greek ... and he breaks Federer who smashes on into the net!! Third set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 6-5 Federer No fuss from Tsitsipas as he does not offer Federer a chance on his serve. Are we heading for another tie-break? Third set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 5-5 Federer* Tsitsipas is happy to chase whatever Federer sends his way and it does not seem to be tiring him out but it is currently a wasted occupation as Fed holds to love. Third set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 5-4 Federer Those failed break points are quickly forgotten by Tsitsipas as breezes into a 30-0 lead on his serve and an ace wins the game for him. Third set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 4-4 Federer* An opening for Tsitsipas as he goes into a 0-30 lead on Federer\u2019s serve and a cross-court forearm earns two break points. The Swiss comes back strong to take the game to Deuce. They were Tsitsipas\u2019 first break points of the match, which shows how good Fed has been. Speaking of which, Fed holds. If anyone is in the vicinity of Guardian HQ, could they please bring supplies? Some coffee, chocolate biscuits and wine. I think this could be a long one. Third set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 4-3 Federer A superb rally starts the game, ending with a smashing volley from Federer after Tsitsipas just about returned a drop shot. Federer moves the Greek around the court, leading to two break points. Surely this is the time he will finally break his younger opponent ... but he mishits a forearm which almost ended up in Sydney. We are at Deuce and Federer has now failed to take 12 break points. Is that a record against Fed? Tsitsipas is lured into the net and then plays a passing shot down the line to earn advantage. Stunning from Federer to stay in the game after a rally saw both men moving all over the court but culminating in a great backhand down the line from the Swiss to take us back to Deuce. Tsitsipas earns advantage and shouts \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d which does to win the game. Third set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 3-3 Federer* Fed completely messes up a volley. A sign of the pressure? He rectifies the situation to take the game with a perfect volley at the second time of asking. Kath is now trying to make me remember a second thing to learn one thing. I was up very early for this, Kath, you can\u2019t expect too much of me. Third set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 3-2 Federer Federer offers a hand of apology after he clips the net and kills the ball dead to make it 15:15, much to Tsitsipas\u2019 chagrin. The Greek does not flinch and makes up for it with a cracking inside-out forearm. Still no breaks in this match as Tsitsipas sends an ace down the middle. Third set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 2-2 Federer* A slow rally ends with Federer hitting the net but he doesn\u2019t mess about on his next serve to level the score. He goes ahead but then completely miscues a forehand which goes well wide and he is eventually taken to Deuce, a rare bit of pressure on the Federer serve. Did I say pressure? Oh he eases through Deuce with no fuss. Third set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 2-1 Federer It\u2019s 9.30pm in Melbourne and there is another game on after this, which might finish around noon tomorrow at this rate. Fed comes in behind a second serve but needlessly whacks it straight into the net when he must have been eyeing a winner. Tsitsipas volleys his way to winning the game, he his improving as the game goes on. Third set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6, 1-1 Federer* Intense stuff form Federer as he ensures Tsitsipas feels the heat in Melbourne as he takes the game with little fuss. Third set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 7-6, 1-0 Federer Here we go again! It is pretty draining watching this match, so God knows how the lads on the court are feeling. A bad backhand from Tsitsipas needlessly sends a shot wide under little pressure but he makes amends to level things up at 30-30 and then takes the game. There are some very lively ducks or something in the background in Melbourne which is adding a weird background noise. Second set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 7-6 Federer TIE BREAK! Federer starts it off by woefully miscueing a shot into the stands pretty much. Not how you want to start on your serve. Tsitsipas on the other hand smashes two aces, the second just about kissing the line, as proved by Hawkeye. Fed gets back into it as the Greek\u2019s inside-out forearm heads out to make it 3-1. The Swiss then offers up the look of a man about to kill after a bad call from the umpire results in the point being replayed. Much to his relief, he wins that one. Federer levels things up with a sublime backhand down the line. Wonderful. With the pressure back on Tsitsipas he holds his nerve in a rally, ending with Fed finding the net and then he makes it 5-3 with a passing forearm. He then keeps his calm to let a volley pass him, in the knowledge it was heading just out. Tsitsipas serves for the set ... and wins it! Second set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 6-6 Federer Tsitsipas serves to stay in the set and does so with aplomb as takes the game to love. No break point chances for Fed here. Another tie-break. Abhijato says: \u201cI wanted to comment on the camera angles used in this Open. They often cut away to the view from just behind the players, which gives us a more intimate feel of the way the game is being played. The overhead shot often seems to make the ball easier to see, but the use of the court cameras should be more encouraged - the awkward bounce and height from the best shots is captured through these frames. If the broadcasters stream these games online, maybe there could be a stream permanently from these cameras, accompanied by nothing but the sounds of the game with optional commentary? I would pay to watch them any day.\u201d I have found some of the TV directing very strange. Keep it simple, lads. Second set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 5-6 Federer* A lesser man might have collapsed under the pressure from Federer but Tsitsipas is giving everything to stay in this game, so much so his shoelace has broken. A quick change of footwear means we are back playing but it is business as usual for Federer as he takes the game. Second set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 5-5 Federer After playing Come On Eileen, we are back to the real business of tennis. There is some creaking in Tsitsipas\u2019 game, he has put in a lot of effort to be fair, and after a stunning rally he hits a backhand long giving a break point. The Greek ensures we go to Deuce with a big serve. Federer gets another chance of a break but a serve down the middle does the job for Tsitsipas to make it eight break points Fed has failed to take in the match. He gets the chance of a ninth and misses out again with a poor shot from the baseline. A tenth comes immediately thanks to a cracking shot across court but it is not taken as Tsitsipas volleys a winner. Great endeavour from the Greek, who then gets his own chance to win the game which he does take. Second set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 4-5 Federer* Bish, bash, bosh. Federer wins the game to love. Great serving from him today. Second set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 4-4 Federer Federer lures Tsitsipas to then net then flashes a forehand past him. Federer does similar again but this time beats him with cunning rather than power to make it 0-30. The Greek recovers with a couple of heaving shots to level things up and head to Deuce thanks to a stunning backhand down the line from Federer following one of the match\u2019s better rallies. Ooooof! Deuce #3 sees Tsitsipas volley his way to advantage but he then gets unlucky on the next point as a Federer shot clips the net and he just gets it back over but the Swiss smashes a winner. Deuce #5 gives Federer break point but his backhand, when he has a chance of winning the game, goes very long. Don\u2019t worry, there is always Deuce #6 to bring this to a conclusion and it does as Federer sends the ball into the net. Still no breaks of serve. Second set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 3-4 Federer* Federer has won 10 points in a row on serve and takes the game. Federer is looking the more likely winner at the moment, I would say. Second set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 3-3 Federer Will I learn how to spell Tsitsipas off the top of my head before this match finishes? No probably not. The last break points on serve were in the opening game of the match but we have another! Federer brings Tsitsipas to the net and then smashes a forehand straight back past him. The Greek takes us to Deuce despite looking trouble during the crucial rally but it is Fed who overhits a forehand. A review is called for from Tsitsipas and he is proven right that Federer\u2019s shot was just out. But we are back to Deuce. The Greek then sends a backhand long and Fed has another chance to break his younger opponent but his return smashes into the net. Federer looks in a good position to break Tsitsipas but stopped when chasing down a drop shot even though he could have got there, even Fed himself looks confused. Serve is held by the Greek after three break points. Lively. Second set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 2-3 Federer* Federer takes the games to love. Easy peasy. Tony emails: \u201cRe the morons in the crowd shouting out during rallies - surely the stewards, or indeed other members of the crowd, can identify the loud-mouthed miscreants and have them removed? Seeing a few idiots frogmarched out of the stands might discourage the others? \u201cPS what a terrific match this is!\u201d It is a great match and to we should ensure it continues in this way by having the idiots removed quickly and in as embarrassing a fashion as possible. Second set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 2-2 Federer This is not going to be a quick match, is it? Both players are looking in stupendous form and know the other\u2019s weakness, which is making it compelling viewing. The Greek ensures that no service games have been lost as he takes the game 40-15, concluding with a dramatic volley. Second set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 1-2 Federer* We might be here for quite a while here. Federer is looking more and more clinical as the match progresses but Tsitsipas shows what he is made of with a great backhand return to a serve and then Federer messes up a drop shot to make it 30-30. Fed takes the game. Second set: Tsitsipas* 6-7, 1-1 Federer Tsitsipas tries to regain his composure after a whirlwind first game of the second set as he serves himself back into the game, making it 30-0 with a great backhand volley to keep things interesting and he also takes the game to love. Lovely stuff. Second set: Tsitsipas 6-7, 0-1 Federer* The Greek had a bit of a chat with the umpire there as it is the second time someone has shouted out from the crowd with an erroneous call of \u201cOut!\u201d. The umpire has warned the crowd but they do not seem intelligent enough to understand it. Federer takes the game to love. First set: Tsitsipas 6-7 Federer Tsitsipas starts the tie-break by taking the first two points to put the pressure back on Federer. A bad backhand from the Greek misses its mark and levels it at 2-2 but he follows that up with an ace. It\u2019s 3-3 thanks to a great volley from Federer forcing his opponent to send the ball long in response. Federer shouts \u201cCome on!\u201d when going 4-3 up to show how tough it is out there and there is a similar shout from Tsitsipas when he immediately levels things. Plenty of quality and commitment in the tie-break. Federer sends a forehand long to make it 5-5 but then Tsitsipas can\u2019t return the following serve. But some positive tennis from the Greek allows him to volley a winner from the net to level things up. Federer miscues a forehand to give his opponent Set Point but there is no chance he is giving him a chance with a superb serve which kisses the line. Set Point is then with Federer but he fails to take it and then smashes a forehand into the net for no reason from the baseline, leaving Tsitsipas a chance to take the set but we all know that is not happening on Federer\u2019s serve as he volleys a winner and then a drop shot leaves him on the brink but he sends his shot well wide to make it 10-10. It goes to 11-11 as the Greek hits the net with a backhand. It\u2019s Set Point once again for Fed as he doesn\u2019t mess about with a forehand. Federer then wins the first set after some tosser in the crowd shouts \u201cOut!\u201d. Tsitsipas is not happy but those are the breaks when idiots are around. First set: Tsitsipas 6-6 Federer* Federer has been put under plenty of pressure and a drop shot from Tsitsipas forces him to send his response into the net. The Swiss does not worry and wins the next two points thanks to some great first serving. Here comes a tie-break. First set: Tsitsipas* 6-5 Federer Tsitsipas loses his first point on his serve for a while as he fails to execute a backhand, which hits the net. He regains his composure and sends some powerful shots Federer\u2019s way which he just can\u2019t fire back and the Greek takes the game with a great backhand volley at the net, made all the better as he was falling over at the time. First set: Tsitsipas 5-5 Federer* Needing to win the game to stay in the set brings out the best of Federer as he goes 30-0 up but then Tsitsipas shows his worth with a great backhand down the line to get back into the game. A stunning rally results in Federer smashing a winner which flicks the line, before the Swiss takes the game. First set: Tsitsipas* 5-4 Federer Federer is getting moved around the court here by Tsitsipas and he does not like it. His forehand is coming under pressure and even his backhand is being undermined. Tsitsipas wins the game and has now won the last 13 points on his serve. First set: Tsitsipas 4-4 Federer* New balls in Melbourne result in Federer misjudging their bounce and firing one well off court. He produces his first ace in response but then his fifth forced error of the game lets his opponent back in and Tsitsipas takes us to Deuce with a stunning backhand out of Federer\u2019s reach across court from the baseline. Federer gets into the net to earn advantage and then takes the game. First set: Tsitsipas* 4-3 Federer Tsitsipas is targeting the forehand and it is working for him. Not to mention he stunning ace down the middle to make it 40-0. He then finishes off by putting plenty of spin on a shot and Federer can only smash it into the net. We\u2019ve got a game on here. First set: Tsitsipas 3-3 Federer* There is a challenge from Tsitipas on a Federer serve to get the game going. The Greek has a chat with the umpire and in the end loses his challenge. Federer makes Tsitipas move around the court, almost playing with him but the 20-year-old gets his own back with a stunning forehand down the line to make it 40-30 and then Federer miscues one for Deuce. The Swiss regains his composure to take the game. First set: Tsitsipas* 3-2 Federer No messing about from Tsitsipas in response as he puts the pressure back on his more esteemed colleague forcing a couple of errors and then taking the game to love with a lovely volley at the net which Federer cannot get to in time. First set: Tsitsipas 2-2 Federer* A decent backhand rally gets Federer\u2019s second service game underway. Both men have superb backhands like they\u2019re using wands. The Swiss wins that challenge and then shows Tsitsipas that he cannot be lobbed as the Greek sends a lob long. In the end Federer takes the game to love to show he is not messing about. He has only conceded a point in his opening two service games. First set: Tsitsipas* 2-1 Federer The Greek seems to be targeting Federer\u2019s forehand as he eases through his second service game by winning with minimal fuss on this occasion. All those nerves are now being lost by Tsitsipas. First set: Tsitsipas 1-1 Federer* Federer\u2019s first service game is a bit of a calmer affair as the Swiss smashes some clinical shots to ensure his opponent knows how ferocious this game is going to be. It was certainly quicker than the first game of the match. First set: Tsitsipas* 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): Tsitsipas gets us going and puts Federer under plenty of early pressure but Federer is unflustered by a couple of big serves. Tsitipas is nervous and gets a time warning at break point but recovers to take Federer to Deuce. Federer almost takes advantage with a superb shot across the court but it is inches out but an error from the Greek levels things up. Tsitsipas double faults because he fails to take his serve in time and then sends it long without option of a second one. On the upside he then has an out call overturned for a serve as it just kissed the line. This is a fascinating opening game, as Federer takes the game back to Deuce with some superb play at the net which Tsitipas cannot cope with. In the end Tsitipas holds the game. More of this, please. Barty got the better of Sharapova earlier ... They are both out on court and are knocking up a bit. Some lovely early backhands to get you in the mood. Good morning! Stefanos Tsitsipas comes into this game hoping that self-belief might be enough to see off Roger Federer but that might a bit of a stretch. The Greek is the 14th seed in Melbourne and is certainly capable of a shock but Federer is still looking superb at the ripe old age of 37 and no one would be surprised if he were to win his seventh Australian Open this time around. Tsitsipas has a potentially wonderful career ahead of him and a win today would certainly be a turning point. Could be a cracking game in store!",

      "body": "<p>The story of malbec is an epic that begins in south-west France, and takes in vine plagues, medieval trade wars and a long struggle for recognition. Then it switches gears into a classic new-world rags-to-riches tale that concludes with the variety finally securing global fame from a lofty perch in vineyards in the Andes in western Argentina.</p> <p>Until relatively recently I wouldn\u2019t have said the wines made from this itinerant grape variety were quite as exciting as their origin story. The initial wave of malbecs to emerge from Argentina were certainly appealing. They had an innate plum and black cherry fleshiness, a mouthfilling plumpness and generosity that made them very easy to drink.</p> <p>But they lacked that extra something \u2013 complexity, longevity, depth \u2013 that would have placed them among the world\u2019s best wines. There was an interchangeability to the rows of malbec lined up in the supermarkets. More expensive bottles tended to over-reach, ladling on the oak and over-ripening the fruit.</p> <p>Argentinian malbec remains the king of soft, reliable and affordable reds \u2013 which is why it is such a success in the UK. What\u2019s changed in the past five years is the wine-making has become more sensitive, playing up what I think are the variety\u2019s claims to greatness: an aromatic prettiness featuring floral and herbal as well as berry-fruited notes, combined with that fleshy mid-palate and a pinot-noir-like silkiness.</p> <p>This is the result of the efforts that leading producers \u2013 from big names such as Catena to rising stars such as the Michelini Brothers \u2013 have put in to understanding the effects of the combination of soil, exposition and different degrees of altitude on these lofty vineyards. This is at its most advanced in what is the country\u2019s most exciting region: the Uco valley in Mendoza, where sub-zones such as Gualtallary, Paraje Altamira and Vista Flores are creating an Andean answer to Burgundy\u2019s famously filigree patchwork of vineyards. But you can see it, too, further north in the even more extreme altitudes of Salta province, and on the lower-lying terrain of Patagonia.</p> <p>There has been similar progress, albeit on a smaller scale, back in the vineyards that follow the bends of the River Lot around Cahors in south-west France, while Chile is increasingly getting the hang of the grape.

      "bodyText": "The story of malbec is an epic that begins in south-west France, and takes in vine plagues, medieval trade wars and a long struggle for recognition. Then it switches gears into a classic new-world rags-to-riches tale that concludes with the variety finally securing global fame from a lofty perch in vineyards in the Andes in western Argentina. Until relatively recently I wouldn\u2019t have said the wines made from this itinerant grape variety were quite as exciting as their origin story. The initial wave of malbecs to emerge from Argentina were certainly appealing. They had an innate plum and black cherry fleshiness, a mouthfilling plumpness and generosity that made them very easy to drink. But they lacked that extra something \u2013 complexity, longevity, depth \u2013 that would have placed them among the world\u2019s best wines. There was an interchangeability to the rows of malbec lined up in the supermarkets. More expensive bottles tended to over-reach, ladling on the oak and over-ripening the fruit. Argentinian malbec remains the king of soft, reliable and affordable reds \u2013 which is why it is such a success in the UK. What\u2019s changed in the past five years is the wine-making has become more sensitive, playing up what I think are the variety\u2019s claims to greatness: an aromatic prettiness featuring floral and herbal as well as berry-fruited notes, combined with that fleshy mid-palate and a pinot-noir-like silkiness. This is the result of the efforts that leading producers \u2013 from big names such as Catena to rising stars such as the Michelini Brothers \u2013 have put in to understanding the effects of the combination of soil, exposition and different degrees of altitude on these lofty vineyards. This is at its most advanced in what is the country\u2019s most exciting region: the Uco valley in Mendoza, where sub-zones such as Gualtallary, Paraje Altamira and Vista Flores are creating an Andean answer to Burgundy\u2019s famously filigree patchwork of vineyards. But you can see it, too, further north in the even more extreme altitudes of Salta province, and on the lower-lying terrain of Patagonia. There has been similar progress, albeit on a smaller scale, back in the vineyards that follow the bends of the River Lot around Cahors in south-west France, while Chile is increasingly getting the hang of the grape. The wilderness years are over, then, but the malbec epic has only really just begun. Six of the best malbecs Ch\u00e2teau du C\u00e8dre Camille Malbec, France 2017 (from \u00a39.85, josephbarneswines.com; bottleapostle.com) One of Cahors\u2019 best and longest-established producers, Ch\u00e2teau du C\u00e8dre here shows off malbec in its most fragrantly attractive, pretty and succulent mode, with an unoaked style that positively sings with pure cherry, plum and violets.

He is, grinning at the prospect of lunch, a somewhat daunting picture of health.</p> <p>I\u2019m eager to see what he is going to order. His well-timed new book, <em>Gene Eating</em>, debunks much of what we might have taken as read about diet and dieting. It presents the evidence to show that any kind of one-size-fits-all regime is likely to be of little value. He has a gift for describing the science of how our bodies take in calories at different rates and respond radically differently to food groups.

Much of the trick is to find what works for you.</p> <p>He scans the menu, aware that I am observing his choices. \u201cI am going for the calves\u2019 liver, because I rarely eat it, and I imagine they do it well here,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I will have the lobster bisque to start. I love a bisque.\u201d Are we allowed a glass of wine in the middle of the day, he wonders. He decides we are, and orders a large glass of malbec.</p> <p>Yeo was born in Singapore and grew up in San Francisco. When he came to Cambridge as a postgraduate, he found the food options \u201ca bit embarrassing\u201d. It\u2019s got better now, he says, not least since this place, a confident neighbourhood French restaurant, opened a decade ago. Still he has been unable to find any decent Chinese food in the city \u2013 he has to go to London for that.</p> <p>When Yeo got into the study of obesity, it wasn\u2019t yet a global growth industry. He started by looking at people with rare genetic disorders, \u201cKids who literally could not stop eating,\u201d he says \u2013 he describes in his book the children who have no off switch to their appetite, and will eat fish fingers from the freezer if left alone.</p> <p>As he and his fellow researchers began to understand more about how the brain failed to control food intake in extreme cases, they started to see how the disruption of those regular pathways was not unique to severely obese people. There was a spectrum. Yeo left pure genetics and became an accidental neuroscientist. His principal interest is now the genetics of how the brain controls food intake.</p> <p>In some senses, his work flips thinking about diet on its head.

Of course, and I think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/29/diabolical-diets-four-in-10-children-consume-sugary-drinks-every-day\" title=\"\">sugary drinks are a particular problem</a>. I just happen to look at potential solutions from the biological perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Part of this, in very practical terms, is taking steps to keep away from the foods we know we cannot control. \u201cTo take a personal, very facetious, example,\u201d Yeo says, \u201cI am not allowed to bring chocolate into the house. I can buy it and have one square, but I will stop at that. If my wife knows there is chocolate around, however, she will eat it all. Now, if there are pork scratchings in the house, for me that is a different story\u2026\u201d</p> <p>So we have to be honest about what we cannot resist and not have it readily available?

You want the fat. Now, if the government says in order to solve obesity we are going to tax chocolate, that might work with people like my wife. But it would not work for me and my pork scratchings.\u201d</p> <p>Yeo tends to lecture without shoes on, which helps his undergraduates remember him, he suggests. \u201cThat barefoot guy with no hair, talking about diabetes.\u201d He has the look of a guru, but resists the idea of gurus. He prefers to be directed by the complexities of the science. A bit of his experimentation is on himself. For a recent series of the BBC\u2019s <em>Trust Me, I\u2019m a Doctor</em> on which he is a presenter, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45409471\" title=\"\">he ate vegan for a month</a>. A couple of things happened: he lost about 10lbs and his blood cholesterol levels dropped dramatically.</p> <p>He believes everyone should at least try it, if only to stop being afraid of eating vegan. With the help of his cycling, Yeo has managed to return to his \u201cvegan weight\u201d. But more importantly he now knows he can eat vegan and cook vegan when he wants. As a result he has reduced his meat intake by about half.</p> <p>He tends to eat vegan lunches now (the bisque and liver are an exception), because he understands his metabolism better. \u201cI realised if I had a coronation chicken sandwich or something with white bread, I would get very wobbly when I cycled the 14 miles home. But if I had a vegan buddha bowl, I didn\u2019t have the wobbles. That was purely because the buddha bowl takes longer to digest. The white bread carbohydrates would have gone in faster and been used up.\u201d</p> <p>Was he not tempted to maintain his vegan regime?</p> <p>He says not. \u201cWhat I missed the most was eggs. But I should write a book called Magic with Miso, because you realise it is all about finding the umami flavour, that richness you get from a meat stock. If you put a tablespoon of miso into a vegetable casserole, that works\u2026\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/vegans-are-coming-millennials-health-climate-change-animal-welfare\">The unstoppable rise of veganism: how a fringe movement went mainstream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Older food cultures understood that principle, he suggests, in the way that they spread meat flavours through their cooking, without relying on the protein itself \u2013 he recalls a staple of his own growing up, which used the liquor of a poached chicken to flavour rice. Fish soups, like the lobster bisque he relishes would be another example.</p> <p>The men in Yeo\u2019s family have always cooked. His grandpa taught him how to kill a chicken when he was six. \u201cHe thought you should always be able to look into the eyes of the animal that you will eat. That is why the Chinese tend to leave the heads on their duck and fish. It reminds you that provenance matters.\u201d</p> <p>Yeo is likeably ruthless in his book in demolishing some of the fad diets that have made their \u201cinventors\u201d rich. \u201cThe idea that you should eat alkaline \u2013 drink pH9 water or whatever \u2013 has absolutely no scientific truth,\u201d he says. \u201cThe detox diet is the one that actually costs a lot of money though. I hear Gwyneth Paltrow is opening a store on Oxford Street. I\u2019m amazed they allowed her in.\u201d</p> <p>He is alarmed by the rise of \u201corthorexia\u201d, the fear of eating badly, which ascribes pious morality to what\u2019s on your plate. \u201cIt narrows your diet and, if you break the rule, leads you into that cycle of depression and despair of other eating disorders.\u201d</p> <p>I ask how much technology will allow us to customise our attempts at weight loss, and if that is a good thing.</p> <p>By way of answer he explains how, for another self-experiment, he was recently fitted with an internal glucose monitor of the kind that type 1 diabetics use. \u201cI had all this data about the way I respond to food. I was surprised to find white rice gave me the highest sugar spike of anything, but bread not so much. Everyone would be different, with those peaks.\u201d He hasn\u2019t stopped eating white rice, but is more aware of the consequences. He suggests that eventually you might take a picture of your food and an algorithm will tell you the likely effect on your heart rate and your waistline. \u201cMore information has to be better,\u201d he insists.</p> <p>How about new year resolutions, I wonder, before he gets back on his bike. What would he advise?</p> <p>\u201cTwo things: if you want to lose weight you need a diet to suit your particular lifestyle and your weaknesses. The other thing is: never fear food. Love it, but don\u2019t eat quite as much of it as you want.\u201d</p> <p><em>Gene Eating </em><em>is out now (</em><em>Seven Dials, \u00a314.99</em><em>).

I just happen to look at potential solutions from the biological perspective.\u201d Part of this, in very practical terms, is taking steps to keep away from the foods we know we cannot control. \u201cTo take a personal, very facetious, example,\u201d Yeo says, \u201cI am not allowed to bring chocolate into the house. I can buy it and have one square, but I will stop at that. If my wife knows there is chocolate around, however, she will eat it all. Now, if there are pork scratchings in the house, for me that is a different story\u2026\u201d So we have to be honest about what we cannot resist and not have it readily available? I feel compelled to confess my cheese habit. \u201cExactly. You want the fat. Now, if the government says in order to solve obesity we are going to tax chocolate, that might work with people like my wife. But it would not work for me and my pork scratchings.\u201d Yeo tends to lecture without shoes on, which helps his undergraduates remember him, he suggests. \u201cThat barefoot guy with no hair, talking about diabetes.\u201d He has the look of a guru, but resists the idea of gurus. He prefers to be directed by the complexities of the science. A bit of his experimentation is on himself. For a recent series of the BBC\u2019s Trust Me, I\u2019m a Doctor on which he is a presenter, he ate vegan for a month. A couple of things happened: he lost about 10lbs and his blood cholesterol levels dropped dramatically. He believes everyone should at least try it, if only to stop being afraid of eating vegan. With the help of his cycling, Yeo has managed to return to his \u201cvegan weight\u201d. But more importantly he now knows he can eat vegan and cook vegan when he wants. As a result he has reduced his meat intake by about half. He tends to eat vegan lunches now (the bisque and liver are an exception), because he understands his metabolism better. \u201cI realised if I had a coronation chicken sandwich or something with white bread, I would get very wobbly when I cycled the 14 miles home. But if I had a vegan buddha bowl, I didn\u2019t have the wobbles. That was purely because the buddha bowl takes longer to digest. The white bread carbohydrates would have gone in faster and been used up.\u201d Was he not tempted to maintain his vegan regime? He says not. \u201cWhat I missed the most was eggs. But I should write a book called Magic with Miso, because you realise it is all about finding the umami flavour, that richness you get from a meat stock. If you put a tablespoon of miso into a vegetable casserole, that works\u2026\u201d Older food cultures understood that principle, he suggests, in the way that they spread meat flavours through their cooking, without relying on the protein itself \u2013 he recalls a staple of his own growing up, which used the liquor of a poached chicken to flavour rice. Fish soups, like the lobster bisque he relishes would be another example. The men in Yeo\u2019s family have always cooked. His grandpa taught him how to kill a chicken when he was six. \u201cHe thought you should always be able to look into the eyes of the animal that you will eat. That is why the Chinese tend to leave the heads on their duck and fish. It reminds you that provenance matters.\u201d Yeo is likeably ruthless in his book in demolishing some of the fad diets that have made their \u201cinventors\u201d rich. \u201cThe idea that you should eat alkaline \u2013 drink pH9 water or whatever \u2013 has absolutely no scientific truth,\u201d he says. \u201cThe detox diet is the one that actually costs a lot of money though. I hear Gwyneth Paltrow is opening a store on Oxford Street. I\u2019m amazed they allowed her in.\u201d He is alarmed by the rise of \u201corthorexia\u201d, the fear of eating badly, which ascribes pious morality to what\u2019s on your plate. \u201cIt narrows your diet and, if you break the rule, leads you into that cycle of depression and despair of other eating disorders.\u201d I ask how much technology will allow us to customise our attempts at weight loss, and if that is a good thing. By way of answer he explains how, for another self-experiment, he was recently fitted with an internal glucose monitor of the kind that type 1 diabetics use. \u201cI had all this data about the way I respond to food. I was surprised to find white rice gave me the highest sugar spike of anything, but bread not so much. Everyone would be different, with those peaks.\u201d He hasn\u2019t stopped eating white rice, but is more aware of the consequences. He suggests that eventually you might take a picture of your food and an algorithm will tell you the likely effect on your heart rate and your waistline. \u201cMore information has to be better,\u201d he insists. How about new year resolutions, I wonder, before he gets back on his bike. What would he advise? \u201cTwo things: if you want to lose weight you need a diet to suit your particular lifestyle and your weaknesses. The other thing is: never fear food. Love it, but don\u2019t eat quite as much of it as you want.\u201d Gene Eating is out now (Seven Dials, \u00a314.99).

However, speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Starmer suggested Labour was open to keeping the terms in the withdrawal agreement as long as other key changes were made \u2013 such as a commitment to a full, permanent customs union and a high alignment with the EU\u2019s single market. \u201cAt this stage any deal probably does require a backstop and we\u2019ve got to recognise that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are problems with this backstop and we have got to recognise that but because we are in this stage of the exercise, nearly two years in, the chances now of a deal that doesn\u2019t have a backstop are very, very slim.\u201d The EU has repeatedly said changes cannot be made to the legally binding withdrawal agreement struck by Theresa May and EU leaders and which contains the terms of the backstop. It is more likely that changes could be made to the non-legally binding political declaration, which sets out the direction for the future relationship between Britain and the EU. A Labour source said it had long been the policy that an insurance option would be needed for Northern Ireland but viewed it as far less likely to be used if the intention was to negotiate a permanent customs union arrangement. The source said Starmer\u2019s view was reflecting the reality of the short time period available and that the majority of changes Labour would be seeking would be to the political declaration, as well as some clarification on the scope of the withdrawal agreement. Starmer said the prime minister must be prepared to shift her red lines in order for constructive discussions with Labour \u2013 but if that was not possible then the party should consider backing a second referendum. \u201cIf she won\u2019t do that, it\u2019s very hard to see where we go from here. That\u2019s why at conference we said, to break the impasse, if we get to an impasse, that\u2019s why you need an option of a public vote,\u201d he said. Starmer denied Labour would automatically seek to block any deal the prime minister proposed. \u201cI have said for two years we will faithfully look at any deal that is brought back which is what we did on Tuesday,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she stood up on Tuesday [after the meaningful vote] and said she was genuinely now open to looking at other options \u2013 but she hasn\u2019t done that. She is the block.\u201d The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said his party will not open discussions with the prime minister until she pledged that she would not take the UK out of the EU with no deal. \u201cIf she moved into that space and said, my red lines have gone, I\u2019m not going to hold a gun to your heads about no deal, that would shift the position incredibly,\u201d Starmer said. The shadow Brexit secretary stressed again that he believed an extension to the article 50 timeline was inevitable. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult to see how the prime minister can achieve what needs to be achieved in 68 days and therefore I think it is inevitable article 50 is going to be extended. And the blame with that lies with the prime minister,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<h2>\u2018If something goes wrong, there\u2019s nowhere to hide\u2019</h2> <p><em>Anna Tobias at P Franco, London</em></p> <p>P Franco is a wine shop and bar in east London which has been home to a series of resident chefs. It\u2019s a small room, just 16 seats, 12 of them around a communal table. At the far end of the table is a sink, and behind it is a tiny bit of workspace. That\u2019s been my kitchen since September, when I started my six-month residency. There\u2019s no oven, no fryer, just three electric induction hobs and two fridges \u2013 it\u2019s quite challenging.</p> <p>It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve cooked completely on my own. Before this, I was the head chef at Rochelle Canteen, running both the restaurant and their catering company, and I do miss the team aspect. There\u2019s something really special about a busy night with everyone working together, feeding off each other\u2019s energy, and when it goes smoothly there\u2019s a real sense of achievement. But it doesn\u2019t always go smoothly and often, as a head chef, you get frustrated when other people aren\u2019t cooking to your standard.</p> <p>I left a year and a half ago to open my own restaurant, but that fell through. Since then I\u2019ve been doing events abroad, and cooking on a freelance basis at the River Caf\u00e9. Then P Franco asked me to do this six-month residency.</p> <p>The first week was quite overwhelming. The kitchen is open Thursday to Sunday, which means I\u2019m working four double shifts in a row \u2013 I\u2019ve never had that sort of lifestyle before. Mentally it\u2019s a new challenge as well, as the responsibility for the food is entirely on me. If something goes wrong, there\u2019s nowhere to hide.</p> <p>The menu is short: just seven or eight dishes. I\u2019ve structured it so that I\u2019ll always have charcuterie, something with toast, a salad, a soup, a stew, one other savoury dish, and then cheese and pudding. My food is quite nostalgic. People say: \u201cOh, I haven\u2019t had goulash in ages,\u201d or, \u201cWhen was the last time I had bananas and custard?\u201d It\u2019s quite simple too, but hopefully I\u2019m doing it better than you could do it at home, and using the best possible produce.</p> <p>There are obvious limitations. I was going to buy in half a pig, but then I thought, what am I going to do with the loin? Trying to cook pork chops to order on induction in a busy wine bar simply wouldn\u2019t work. There just isn\u2019t the time and space, especially when you\u2019re heating soup and doing garnishes \u2013 and washing up as you go.</p> <p>A while ago, in the middle of service, I was making bagna cauda to go with beetroot and the sauce split. Normally in a team you can raise your hand and say: \u201cI need a little help here.\u201d But there was no one to ask, so I was furiously trying to rescue it, and it just wasn\u2019t happening. I had to admit defeat, so I served the beetroot with lemon and olive oil. It was totally fine but I felt a bit silly, as the menu said something else.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t much of a separation between me and the customers, apart from the sink and a small area where the bar staff have their work station. I\u2019ve always quite enjoyed being able to see whether customers are enjoying their food, but this is even more intimate. Sometimes people are chatting to you and you\u2019re thinking: \u201cI\u2019ve got toast on and my soup\u2019s suddenly bubbling quite quickly.\u201d But that\u2019s quite a nice problem to have.</p> <p>One service, I ran out of washed lettuce and I had five Caesar salads on order. Luckily there was someone I knew right by my station, a chef who asked if I needed some help. So I had a customer spinning salad while I was trying to keep up with everything else that was going on.</p> <p>I think my time at P Franco will give me renewed confidence in my cooking. It\u2019s good to get feedback as well. Someone said my goulash was one of the best things they\u2019d ever eaten. When your food is so simple, it\u2019s really satisfying when people respond well.<br><em>107 Lower Clapton Rd, London E5 0NP; <a href=\"http://pfranco.co.uk/\">pfranco.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>\u2018Even the lonely moments have upsides\u2019</h2> <p><em>Simon Bonwick at the Crown, Burchetts Green</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7fb94b712aba731016eb6d21f57ff6443ee28220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fb94b712aba731016eb6d21f57ff6443ee28220/0_99_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Bonwick, The Crown at Burchetts Green Solo Chefs Observer Food Monthly OFM\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Bonwick at the Crown, Burchetts Green.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reason I work by myself in the kitchen is 50% because I want to work on my own and 50% because no one will work with me. I do crazy hours to achieve what I want to achieve and I\u2019d expect other people to do the same.</p> <p>I started off working in big brigades in five-star hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants in London and France. I got kicked around a bit and worked my nuts off and did everything I was told to do. As I rose up the ranks, I would run the larder with an iron fist. I always wanted everything very clean and tidy. I\u2019m very anal, everything had to be in its right box.</p> <p>Then I started working in pubs and went from brigades of 25-50 right down to brigades of three. I always ended up taking over and bossing everybody about. But of course people don\u2019t like it. I had a sous chef who followed me around for 25 years. One day he said: \u201cI love you but I can\u2019t work with you any more. I just cannot meet the demands and the hours and everything you want, I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p> <p>Then I started to think I could run my own pub as a chef-landlord. I got all the numbers wrong and all the working hours wrong and I burned myself out in my naivety. After that, I went into private service for two years, where I learned to organise myself and work completely alone. But I had to travel a lot and it took me away from my wife Deborah and the children for weeks at a time.</p> <p>When Deborah found out I\u2019d bought the Crown, she said: \u201cOK, you\u2019ve got yourself a new pub, but you\u2019re going to do it on your own because you can\u2019t afford to employ anyone, can you?\u201d For two years I ran it on my own and it nearly killed me. Some nights I\u2019d be stood there in the empty pub doing a pretend service with myself. I\u2019d fill glasses with water and wine. I\u2019d imagine people at the tables. I continuously imagined the pub busy. I needed it busy because I had to feed my children.</p> <p>My eldest lad, Dean, was working front of house at the Waterside Inn in Bray for six years, and then at Michel Gu\u00e9rard in Eug\u00e9nie-les-Bains. Mum had to ring him up and say: \u201cDad\u2019s not well and this is what we\u2019re invested in, what are we going to do?\u201d Dean came on board and said: \u201cOK Dad, we\u2019re going to take out 10 of the tables and you\u2019re going to do your real cooking, not a goat\u2019s cheese salad, not steak and chips, because I don\u2019t want to serve that.\u201d Within a year of Dean taking over, the Michelin guide upgraded us to a star and the business took off.</p> <p>Six of our nine kids work at the pub. They\u2019ve all grown up with hospitality, it\u2019s in them, they\u2019ve got no choice. Not that I\u2019m any old Fagin or Scrooge. I have to be careful, because if there\u2019s a temper, which occasionally there is, that\u2019ll go back to Mum and I\u2019ll be in big trouble.</p> <p>Cooking alone is all positives. There\u2019s nothing negative about it whatsoever. Even the lonely moments have upsides, because I\u2019ll be listening to music, which is very important to me. I like that Michael Nyman guy. His strange music resonates with the hard week\u2019s work, the slog, the battle, the arduous task.</p> <p>We\u2019re closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, but we\u2019re busy for about eight hours of those days, administrating the business, getting ready to purchase all the supplies, making sure everything is clean. Wednesday, I\u2019ll go to work around 4am and get all the bread ready. The rest of the week I\u2019ll work from 7am till 1am, and then just die on the bed. By the time we finish on Sunday, I feel like it\u2019s the most beautiful comedown of a knackering week\u2019s work. I\u2019m addicted to it. I\u2019ve really worn myself to a ragged bone. A piece of music comes on and I start bawling. I\u2019m rinsed of emotion, there\u2019s nothing left, and I love that rinsing.</p> <p>The food at the Crown is a mix of the grand palace cooking of Car\u00eame and the bourgeois middle-class French cooking of the 50s, which ends up in the Elizabeth David era. It\u2019s a real amalgamation of French period cooking, all stitched together with Escoffier and his repertoire de cuisine. After five years at the Crown, I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of my culinary estate. And I\u2019m so far down the road now, I don\u2019t think I can ever work for anyone else or with anyone else. I can express my own ideas without restriction. </p> <p>There are huge financial pressures, of course, and you don\u2019t expect to get any money out of it for yourself. But that\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s about spontaneity and munificence, about creating something that\u2019s a legacy. I\u2019d like to leave behind a story of true hospitality. I want people to drive by in 30 years and say: \u201cDo you remember when we had that dinner in there and it was really good?\u201d We leave a story behind. That\u2019s essential. Memorable eating. That\u2019s what I want to give.<br><em>Burchetts Green, Maidenhead SL6 6QZ; <a href=\"http://thecrownburchettsgreen.com/\">thecrownburchettsgreen.com</a></em></p> <h2>\u2018You have times when it gets a bit much, but you just grind it out\u2019</h2> <p><em>Ben Crittenden at Stark, Broadstairs</em></p> <p>Before Stark, I worked six years at the West House, a Michelin-starred place near Ashford in Kent. When I first started it was just me and the owner in the kitchen \u2013 a small team. That\u2019s how I can do what I do now. When we had our first kid, my wife Soph never really saw me. I\u2019d leave at seven in the morning and get back at midnight or later, and I\u2019d see her one day a week. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c70f096c514af9b89d1095b0e691313cebe126c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c70f096c514af9b89d1095b0e691313cebe126c1/0_936_4899_5976/820.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Crittenden, Stark, Broadstairs Solo Chefs Observer Food Monthly OFM\" width=\"820\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Crittenden at Stark, Broadstairs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few years ago, I\u2019d seen the place we have now was for sale. It was a sandwich shop, but I just had a feeling about it. I used to drive past every Friday night, just to see if it was still open. And when it wasn\u2019t, I did some digging. The rent was reasonable, so then and there I agreed to take it.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never earned good money, I\u2019ve always just got by, and I was quite tight. But I was struggling with my mental health, and I was very much in a \u201cfuck it\u201d mode. I got the money by going for a government start-up loan, but I\u2019d agreed to pay rent before I got approved. Business plans, projections\u2026 I was blagging it the whole way through, waiting for someone to say \u201cNo.\u201d But they didn\u2019t. I hadn\u2019t even told Soph that I\u2019d agreed to do it before it was all signed. I wouldn\u2019t have done that before, or now. I\u2019m semi back to where I was: more conscious about money, and a bit more rational. It\u2019s worked out all right.</p> <p>The work-life balance is better. I work pretty much every day \u2013 there\u2019s always something to do \u2013 and it\u2019s hard but not as hard. I actually see the kids and I get three nights guaranteed to not be at work.</p> <p>We\u2019re open Wednesday to Saturday evenings. On Tuesday I do the big jobs: stock, sauces, prep the meat. On service days, I do the nursery run then I come in at 9am and make bread, prep all the garnishes. About 4 o\u2019clock, I see the kids before they go to bed, and I come back around half-five to set up, light the barbecue oven and serve 10 people. Soph comes in during the day to lay the tables and get the wines in the fridge, then will come back with me in the evening [to work front of house].</p> <p>It sounds easy, only 10 people, but it\u2019s not. I do a six-course set menu, so it\u2019s 60 plates of food. After the last dessert, we clean down, do prep list orders. We finish at 11.30pm, midnight sometimes. Because it\u2019s all open plan, people get chatting and we can be here a while. On Sundays I come in and deep clean, and Mondays I try and take off but unless I physically go away, I\u2019ll end up in the restaurant for at least an hour.</p> <p>We opened in December 2016 and did about one table a night for the first month or two. It was a bit of a worry. But people liked it and it was starting to do all right. Then Marina O\u2019Loughlin came, and her review for the <em>Guardian</em> came out in August. We went from having five email enquiries a week to nearly 100 a day. Two weeks later I got a Good Food Guide award. The emails went up to 200 a day, and in two days we filled up for the rest of the year. But with that came the no-shows.</p> <p>In one week we had four tables not turn up, which is 25% of our business. We decided to get an online booking system and take card details. It was a scary time. We charge full price for people who don\u2019t turn up. We get a bit of stick but since last January, I think we\u2019ve only had two no-shows.</p> <p>I cut my finger quite badly in February and had to cancel one night\u2019s booking. And Soph was ill in September, so we had to cancel that night. If I\u2019d worked somewhere else I\u2019d have taken the week off because she needed me. But we were full, so I had to work. The next week, halfway through the meal, we had a power cut. You have times when it gets a bit much but then you realise that you don\u2019t want to work for someone else so you just grind it out. People don\u2019t realise that we are human \u2013 they just want their dinner. <br><em>1 Oscar Rd, Broadstairs CT10 1QJ; <a href=\"https://www.starkfood.co.uk/\">starkfood.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>\u2018If there\u2019s nothing booked, I\u2019ll close and take a day at home\u2019</h2> <p><em>Bruce Rennie at the Shore, Penzance</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7ea28a1419cc7195fb17684abe9a33a86c4f0fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7ea28a1419cc7195fb17684abe9a33a86c4f0fb/0_278_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Rennie, The Shore Restaurant, Penzance Solo Chefs Observer Food Monthly OFM\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce Rennie at the Shore, Penzance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was head chef for Martin Wishart in Edinburgh before I moved down here 10 years ago. I ran a few places but I wanted to do something personal. I\u2019m here for 65 hours plus a week and earn less than my staff who do 50 hours a month, so I need to enjoy it.</p> <p>I\u2019ve just gone into my fourth year here. The place was horrendous when we moved in. Horrible carpet, net curtains, thin tables with plastic chequered tablecloths. The landlord said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so stressed, it\u2019s ready to go.\u201d I put the floor in. The partition, the kitchen, the ceiling, the lighting. Everything. But it\u2019s tiring doing everything yourself. I do the washing, the ordering, all the prep.</p> <p>If there\u2019s nothing booked, I\u2019ll close and take a day at home. It gives me a bit more freedom to not have so many people rely on me. I still need to give enough shifts to the front of house staff, but if I had to carry back of house I couldn\u2019t do it. And what it gives me is ultimate control. I prepare everything from the bread and butter, through to the little fudge that goes out with the coffee.</p> <p>I started with \u00e0 la carte, then introduced the tasting menu. Now I do one menu, all fish. Waste was the biggest problem. The losses I was incurring were down to trying to guess what people were having, and when you\u2019ve got 24 covers and five choices, the variation is huge. Now I know where everything comes from. Last week, most of the red mullet came from the Sprigs of Heather boat. </p> <p>I don\u2019t write a menu in advance. Without trying to sound pretentious, it evolves. I know what vegetables are going to be in from the local farms, so I have an idea of what my mood is for the week. While my training is classical, a lot of my stuff is Asian-influenced.</p> <p>Not everyone is going to like every dish, and that\u2019s what I try and say to people: it\u2019s an experience. Quite a lot of people will come in and have a chat while I\u2019m cooking \u2013 it\u2019s awesome. I want them to know that I care about what their feedback is \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s good for them to realise that it\u2019s just me in there and that it\u2019s only food. </p> <p>The feedback has been amazing. It\u2019s going to take time to build up a core business but at the moment it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s so seasonal here as well.</p> <p>The psychological implications of working alone are huge. I\u2019m alone all day. And I\u2019m an alcoholic and have had issues with depression. I have to keep myself very engaged and very busy, and sometimes take myself out to go and speak to the guys at the cafe down the road. I\u2019d love to have creative discussions with people and that real bouncing of ideas.</p> <p>I\u2019m here five days a week. We\u2019re open four in the winter. I also come in on the Monday to do the bins and the wine orders. I do paperwork at home and I can access the till system at home. And I\u2019m always thinking of new dishes. My mind\u2019s too busy. Even when it\u2019s quiet and there\u2019s nothing I can do, I have to find something or I don\u2019t feel validated. And that\u2019s years of being abused in workplaces, people going: \u201cYou can\u2019t stand around doing nothing.\u201d</p> <p>I used to be quite aggressive, quite full on. I\u2019m a bit ashamed about that. Nothing major, but I think I could have handled things better. Be more proud of who I was, not what I did. What I did was great, brilliant as a job. But was I proud of the person I actually was? No. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m changing. I care about the people who work with me.</p> <p>Work needs to be a happy place. It should be conveyed through everything you do. Same with the staff \u2013 I pick them because they\u2019re lovely people, not because they get the knife and fork in exactly the right place. I like it to feel like a bit of a family, because this is what I\u2019ve got. It\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m three years in and the last year I still made a loss. Fingers crossed for this year; I\u2019m quite hopeful. I didn\u2019t pay myself a decent salary but I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m doing what I love.<br><em>13/14 Alverton St, Penzance TR18 2QP; <a href=\"https://theshorerestaurant.uk/\">theshorerestaurant.uk</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018If something goes wrong, there\u2019s nowhere to hide\u2019 Anna Tobias at P Franco, London P Franco is a wine shop and bar in east London which has been home to a series of resident chefs. It\u2019s a small room, just 16 seats, 12 of them around a communal table. At the far end of the table is a sink, and behind it is a tiny bit of workspace. That\u2019s been my kitchen since September, when I started my six-month residency. There\u2019s no oven, no fryer, just three electric induction hobs and two fridges \u2013 it\u2019s quite challenging. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve cooked completely on my own. Before this, I was the head chef at Rochelle Canteen, running both the restaurant and their catering company, and I do miss the team aspect. There\u2019s something really special about a busy night with everyone working together, feeding off each other\u2019s energy, and when it goes smoothly there\u2019s a real sense of achievement. But it doesn\u2019t always go smoothly and often, as a head chef, you get frustrated when other people aren\u2019t cooking to your standard. I left a year and a half ago to open my own restaurant, but that fell through. Since then I\u2019ve been doing events abroad, and cooking on a freelance basis at the River Caf\u00e9. Then P Franco asked me to do this six-month residency. The first week was quite overwhelming. The kitchen is open Thursday to Sunday, which means I\u2019m working four double shifts in a row \u2013 I\u2019ve never had that sort of lifestyle before. Mentally it\u2019s a new challenge as well, as the responsibility for the food is entirely on me. If something goes wrong, there\u2019s nowhere to hide. The menu is short: just seven or eight dishes. I\u2019ve structured it so that I\u2019ll always have charcuterie, something with toast, a salad, a soup, a stew, one other savoury dish, and then cheese and pudding. My food is quite nostalgic. People say: \u201cOh, I haven\u2019t had goulash in ages,\u201d or, \u201cWhen was the last time I had bananas and custard?\u201d It\u2019s quite simple too, but hopefully I\u2019m doing it better than you could do it at home, and using the best possible produce. There are obvious limitations. I was going to buy in half a pig, but then I thought, what am I going to do with the loin? Trying to cook pork chops to order on induction in a busy wine bar simply wouldn\u2019t work. There just isn\u2019t the time and space, especially when you\u2019re heating soup and doing garnishes \u2013 and washing up as you go. A while ago, in the middle of service, I was making bagna cauda to go with beetroot and the sauce split. Normally in a team you can raise your hand and say: \u201cI need a little help here.\u201d But there was no one to ask, so I was furiously trying to rescue it, and it just wasn\u2019t happening. I had to admit defeat, so I served the beetroot with lemon and olive oil. It was totally fine but I felt a bit silly, as the menu said something else. There isn\u2019t much of a separation between me and the customers, apart from the sink and a small area where the bar staff have their work station. I\u2019ve always quite enjoyed being able to see whether customers are enjoying their food, but this is even more intimate. Sometimes people are chatting to you and you\u2019re thinking: \u201cI\u2019ve got toast on and my soup\u2019s suddenly bubbling quite quickly.\u201d But that\u2019s quite a nice problem to have. One service, I ran out of washed lettuce and I had five Caesar salads on order. Luckily there was someone I knew right by my station, a chef who asked if I needed some help. So I had a customer spinning salad while I was trying to keep up with everything else that was going on. I think my time at P Franco will give me renewed confidence in my cooking. It\u2019s good to get feedback as well. Someone said my goulash was one of the best things they\u2019d ever eaten. When your food is so simple, it\u2019s really satisfying when people respond well. 107 Lower Clapton Rd, London E5 0NP; pfranco.co.uk \u2018Even the lonely moments have upsides\u2019 Simon Bonwick at the Crown, Burchetts Green The reason I work by myself in the kitchen is 50% because I want to work on my own and 50% because no one will work with me. I do crazy hours to achieve what I want to achieve and I\u2019d expect other people to do the same. I started off working in big brigades in five-star hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants in London and France. I got kicked around a bit and worked my nuts off and did everything I was told to do. As I rose up the ranks, I would run the larder with an iron fist. I always wanted everything very clean and tidy. I\u2019m very anal, everything had to be in its right box. Then I started working in pubs and went from brigades of 25-50 right down to brigades of three. I always ended up taking over and bossing everybody about. But of course people don\u2019t like it. I had a sous chef who followed me around for 25 years. One day he said: \u201cI love you but I can\u2019t work with you any more. I just cannot meet the demands and the hours and everything you want, I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d Then I started to think I could run my own pub as a chef-landlord. I got all the numbers wrong and all the working hours wrong and I burned myself out in my naivety. After that, I went into private service for two years, where I learned to organise myself and work completely alone. But I had to travel a lot and it took me away from my wife Deborah and the children for weeks at a time. When Deborah found out I\u2019d bought the Crown, she said: \u201cOK, you\u2019ve got yourself a new pub, but you\u2019re going to do it on your own because you can\u2019t afford to employ anyone, can you?\u201d For two years I ran it on my own and it nearly killed me. Some nights I\u2019d be stood there in the empty pub doing a pretend service with myself. I\u2019d fill glasses with water and wine. I\u2019d imagine people at the tables. I continuously imagined the pub busy. I needed it busy because I had to feed my children. My eldest lad, Dean, was working front of house at the Waterside Inn in Bray for six years, and then at Michel Gu\u00e9rard in Eug\u00e9nie-les-Bains. Mum had to ring him up and say: \u201cDad\u2019s not well and this is what we\u2019re invested in, what are we going to do?\u201d Dean came on board and said: \u201cOK Dad, we\u2019re going to take out 10 of the tables and you\u2019re going to do your real cooking, not a goat\u2019s cheese salad, not steak and chips, because I don\u2019t want to serve that.\u201d Within a year of Dean taking over, the Michelin guide upgraded us to a star and the business took off. Six of our nine kids work at the pub. They\u2019ve all grown up with hospitality, it\u2019s in them, they\u2019ve got no choice. Not that I\u2019m any old Fagin or Scrooge. I have to be careful, because if there\u2019s a temper, which occasionally there is, that\u2019ll go back to Mum and I\u2019ll be in big trouble. Cooking alone is all positives. There\u2019s nothing negative about it whatsoever. Even the lonely moments have upsides, because I\u2019ll be listening to music, which is very important to me. I like that Michael Nyman guy. His strange music resonates with the hard week\u2019s work, the slog, the battle, the arduous task. We\u2019re closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, but we\u2019re busy for about eight hours of those days, administrating the business, getting ready to purchase all the supplies, making sure everything is clean. Wednesday, I\u2019ll go to work around 4am and get all the bread ready. The rest of the week I\u2019ll work from 7am till 1am, and then just die on the bed. By the time we finish on Sunday, I feel like it\u2019s the most beautiful comedown of a knackering week\u2019s work. I\u2019m addicted to it. I\u2019ve really worn myself to a ragged bone. A piece of music comes on and I start bawling. I\u2019m rinsed of emotion, there\u2019s nothing left, and I love that rinsing. The food at the Crown is a mix of the grand palace cooking of Car\u00eame and the bourgeois middle-class French cooking of the 50s, which ends up in the Elizabeth David era. It\u2019s a real amalgamation of French period cooking, all stitched together with Escoffier and his repertoire de cuisine. After five years at the Crown, I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of my culinary estate. And I\u2019m so far down the road now, I don\u2019t think I can ever work for anyone else or with anyone else. I can express my own ideas without restriction. There are huge financial pressures, of course, and you don\u2019t expect to get any money out of it for yourself. But that\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s about spontaneity and munificence, about creating something that\u2019s a legacy. I\u2019d like to leave behind a story of true hospitality. I want people to drive by in 30 years and say: \u201cDo you remember when we had that dinner in there and it was really good?\u201d We leave a story behind. That\u2019s essential. Memorable eating. That\u2019s what I want to give. Burchetts Green, Maidenhead SL6 6QZ; thecrownburchettsgreen.com \u2018You have times when it gets a bit much, but you just grind it out\u2019 Ben Crittenden at Stark, Broadstairs Before Stark, I worked six years at the West House, a Michelin-starred place near Ashford in Kent. When I first started it was just me and the owner in the kitchen \u2013 a small team. That\u2019s how I can do what I do now. When we had our first kid, my wife Soph never really saw me. I\u2019d leave at seven in the morning and get back at midnight or later, and I\u2019d see her one day a week. A few years ago, I\u2019d seen the place we have now was for sale. It was a sandwich shop, but I just had a feeling about it. I used to drive past every Friday night, just to see if it was still open. And when it wasn\u2019t, I did some digging. The rent was reasonable, so then and there I agreed to take it. I\u2019ve never earned good money, I\u2019ve always just got by, and I was quite tight. But I was struggling with my mental health, and I was very much in a \u201cfuck it\u201d mode. I got the money by going for a government start-up loan, but I\u2019d agreed to pay rent before I got approved. Business plans, projections\u2026 I was blagging it the whole way through, waiting for someone to say \u201cNo.\u201d But they didn\u2019t. I hadn\u2019t even told Soph that I\u2019d agreed to do it before it was all signed. I wouldn\u2019t have done that before, or now. I\u2019m semi back to where I was: more conscious about money, and a bit more rational. It\u2019s worked out all right. The work-life balance is better. I work pretty much every day \u2013 there\u2019s always something to do \u2013 and it\u2019s hard but not as hard. I actually see the kids and I get three nights guaranteed to not be at work. We\u2019re open Wednesday to Saturday evenings. On Tuesday I do the big jobs: stock, sauces, prep the meat. On service days, I do the nursery run then I come in at 9am and make bread, prep all the garnishes. About 4 o\u2019clock, I see the kids before they go to bed, and I come back around half-five to set up, light the barbecue oven and serve 10 people. Soph comes in during the day to lay the tables and get the wines in the fridge, then will come back with me in the evening [to work front of house]. It sounds easy, only 10 people, but it\u2019s not. I do a six-course set menu, so it\u2019s 60 plates of food. After the last dessert, we clean down, do prep list orders. We finish at 11.30pm, midnight sometimes. Because it\u2019s all open plan, people get chatting and we can be here a while. On Sundays I come in and deep clean, and Mondays I try and take off but unless I physically go away, I\u2019ll end up in the restaurant for at least an hour. We opened in December 2016 and did about one table a night for the first month or two. It was a bit of a worry. But people liked it and it was starting to do all right. Then Marina O\u2019Loughlin came, and her review for the Guardian came out in August. We went from having five email enquiries a week to nearly 100 a day. Two weeks later I got a Good Food Guide award. The emails went up to 200 a day, and in two days we filled up for the rest of the year. But with that came the no-shows. In one week we had four tables not turn up, which is 25% of our business. We decided to get an online booking system and take card details. It was a scary time. We charge full price for people who don\u2019t turn up. We get a bit of stick but since last January, I think we\u2019ve only had two no-shows. I cut my finger quite badly in February and had to cancel one night\u2019s booking. And Soph was ill in September, so we had to cancel that night. If I\u2019d worked somewhere else I\u2019d have taken the week off because she needed me. But we were full, so I had to work. The next week, halfway through the meal, we had a power cut. You have times when it gets a bit much but then you realise that you don\u2019t want to work for someone else so you just grind it out. People don\u2019t realise that we are human \u2013 they just want their dinner. 1 Oscar Rd, Broadstairs CT10 1QJ; starkfood.co.uk \u2018If there\u2019s nothing booked, I\u2019ll close and take a day at home\u2019 Bruce Rennie at the Shore, Penzance I was head chef for Martin Wishart in Edinburgh before I moved down here 10 years ago. I ran a few places but I wanted to do something personal. I\u2019m here for 65 hours plus a week and earn less than my staff who do 50 hours a month, so I need to enjoy it. I\u2019ve just gone into my fourth year here. The place was horrendous when we moved in. Horrible carpet, net curtains, thin tables with plastic chequered tablecloths. The landlord said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so stressed, it\u2019s ready to go.\u201d I put the floor in. The partition, the kitchen, the ceiling, the lighting. Everything. But it\u2019s tiring doing everything yourself. I do the washing, the ordering, all the prep. If there\u2019s nothing booked, I\u2019ll close and take a day at home. It gives me a bit more freedom to not have so many people rely on me. I still need to give enough shifts to the front of house staff, but if I had to carry back of house I couldn\u2019t do it. And what it gives me is ultimate control. I prepare everything from the bread and butter, through to the little fudge that goes out with the coffee. I started with \u00e0 la carte, then introduced the tasting menu. Now I do one menu, all fish. Waste was the biggest problem. The losses I was incurring were down to trying to guess what people were having, and when you\u2019ve got 24 covers and five choices, the variation is huge. Now I know where everything comes from. Last week, most of the red mullet came from the Sprigs of Heather boat. I don\u2019t write a menu in advance. Without trying to sound pretentious, it evolves. I know what vegetables are going to be in from the local farms, so I have an idea of what my mood is for the week. While my training is classical, a lot of my stuff is Asian-influenced. Not everyone is going to like every dish, and that\u2019s what I try and say to people: it\u2019s an experience. Quite a lot of people will come in and have a chat while I\u2019m cooking \u2013 it\u2019s awesome. I want them to know that I care about what their feedback is \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s good for them to realise that it\u2019s just me in there and that it\u2019s only food. The feedback has been amazing. It\u2019s going to take time to build up a core business but at the moment it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s so seasonal here as well. The psychological implications of working alone are huge. I\u2019m alone all day. And I\u2019m an alcoholic and have had issues with depression. I have to keep myself very engaged and very busy, and sometimes take myself out to go and speak to the guys at the cafe down the road. I\u2019d love to have creative discussions with people and that real bouncing of ideas. I\u2019m here five days a week. We\u2019re open four in the winter. I also come in on the Monday to do the bins and the wine orders. I do paperwork at home and I can access the till system at home. And I\u2019m always thinking of new dishes. My mind\u2019s too busy. Even when it\u2019s quiet and there\u2019s nothing I can do, I have to find something or I don\u2019t feel validated. And that\u2019s years of being abused in workplaces, people going: \u201cYou can\u2019t stand around doing nothing.\u201d I used to be quite aggressive, quite full on. I\u2019m a bit ashamed about that. Nothing major, but I think I could have handled things better. Be more proud of who I was, not what I did. What I did was great, brilliant as a job. But was I proud of the person I actually was? No. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m changing. I care about the people who work with me. Work needs to be a happy place. It should be conveyed through everything you do. Same with the staff \u2013 I pick them because they\u2019re lovely people, not because they get the knife and fork in exactly the right place. I like it to feel like a bit of a family, because this is what I\u2019ve got. It\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m three years in and the last year I still made a loss. Fingers crossed for this year; I\u2019m quite hopeful. I didn\u2019t pay myself a decent salary but I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m doing what I love. 13/14 Alverton St, Penzance TR18 2QP; theshorerestaurant.uk",

      "bodyText": "The plantain at the Nyamming \u201cexplorative dining\u201d experience, held in the belly of TT Liquor in Shoreditch in London, has a lightly fried crust, a starchy bite and is finished with a smear of corn custard and the hot tang of scotch-bonnet chilli jam. It is, as with everything on the four-course menu, evocative of more than just good cooking. Nyamming, which takes its name from Jamaican patois for eating, is investigating Caribbean food and culture beyond jerk chicken and rice and peas; and this first iteration is taking me right back to my roots by combining Caribbean and West African cuisine. Against the backdrop of the Windrush scandal, it feels as though more British people of Caribbean descent are taking pains to learn about their history but, in general, the rich narrative of British-Caribbean food is not as widely known as it ought to be. Twelve years ago, Jamaican food entrepreneur Wade Lyn declared in the Guardian that it was \u201cstill difficult to find a Caribbean restaurant in most of our major cities, let alone some of our smaller towns\u201d. Interest has grown since then, with the expansion of chains such as Cottons and Rum Kitchen, plus the arrival of McDonald\u2019s jerk burger and Jamie Oliver\u2019s jerk rice: Caribbean food is, for better or sometimes worse, part of the mainstream. It\u2019s also moving forwards, propelled by up and coming chefs and an older generation of connoisseurs. From restaurants such as Raggas in Liverpool, Maureen\u2019s in Leeds, Healthy Eaters in Brixton, JB\u2019s Soul Food in Peckham, to new ventures such as Nyamming, most people I know have a favourite Caribbean food outlet that challenges lingering stereotypes. Author Riaz Phillips has done more than most to document British-Caribbean food. His book Belly Full, self-published in 2017, charted his journey around the UK interviewing and photographing chefs and owners of dozens of restaurants from Moss Side in Manchester to Hartley Road in Nottingham. He notes that Caribbean food and drink establishments in the UK date back to the 1920s, with the Caribbean Cafe in Cardiff and Florence Mills Social Parlour at 50 Carnaby Street in London. \u201cI was going to every library I could, looking for social history books, scouring for any mention of food and social events,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cA few mentioned curry and rice and peas.\u201d Later, came restaurants such as the widely loved Mangrove in Notting Hill, which was at the forefront of black activism in the 1970s and 80s (the site is now a branch of Rum Kitchen). Nyamming, conceived by Joseph Pilgrim and chef Marie Mitchell of Island Social Club, represents the voices of many second- and third-generation British people of Caribbean descent like Phillips who are reclaiming a culture and a history they haven\u2019t had full access to. \u201cI felt like my heritage wasn\u2019t just Caribbean, even though it\u2019s enough and it\u2019s rich and it\u2019s brilliant, I still felt like there was something missing,\u201d says Pilgrim. \u201cThis was an opportunity to find out some of those things.\u201d The first Nyamming menu, put together by Mitchell and Nigerian fusion star Lop\u00e8 Ariyo, drew attention to the similarities between the diasporas\u2019 cuisines \u2013 ingredients such as plantain, goat, corn and sorrel are cross-continental \u2013 as well as differences; the tactile nature of using pounded yam to sup up egusi (pounded melon seeds) was less familiar. Projects such as Nyamming offer clues to what Caribbean food in the UK might look like in the near future, as do the current prominence of vegetarian and vegan food, both of which nod to the vast repertoire of Caribbean chefs beyond the familiar meat-based staples. Ital Fresh, a \u201cplant-based\u201d Caribbean pop-up run by two Rastafarians in Liverpool, who \u201cditched meat before it was cool\u201d as part of their spiritual and political beliefs, began as a supper club in 2015.

Visible beyond the doors of her room, a somewhat tense dinner party is taking place, at which the relationships between some of the guests resemble those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mozart\">Mozart</a>\u2019s characters. During a pause in the overture, we hear a man saying grace, whom we we will later identify with Sarastro. A loud bang at the door heralds the arrival of an irate woman, possibly the girl\u2019s mother and clearly an unwanted guest, who will become the Queen of the Night.

      "bodyText": "James Brining\u2019s new production of The Magic Flute for Opera North opens with a young girl sitting on her bed, listening to a recording of the opera we are about to watch. Visible beyond the doors of her room, a somewhat tense dinner party is taking place, at which the relationships between some of the guests resemble those of Mozart\u2019s characters. During a pause in the overture, we hear a man saying grace, whom we we will later identify with Sarastro. A loud bang at the door heralds the arrival of an irate woman, possibly the girl\u2019s mother and clearly an unwanted guest, who will become the Queen of the Night. A second woman, who could be Pamina, brings the girl her supper, and settles her for the night. The opera subsequently plays itself out, we are led to assume, in the girl\u2019s imagination. Or does it?

      "body": "<p>Keith Maxwell, the self-declared \u201ccommodore\u201d of the South African Institute for Maritime Research (SAIMR), liked to dress up on special occasions in the garish costume of a 18th-century admiral, with a three-cornered hat, brass buttons and a cutlass. Ordinary members of his organisation were expected to show up in crisp naval whites.</p> <p>Gathered together in upmarket restaurants, or the quiet of the<a href=\"http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol165as.html\" title=\"\"> Wemmer Pan naval base</a> in south-central Johannesburg, they had the air of eccentric history buffs. Maxwell talked about the group\u2019s roots in a Napoleonic-era treasure-hunting syndicate, and told outsiders it was still focused on deep-sea exploration.</p> <p>But appearances were deceptive. Beneath the bizarre trappings lurked a powerful mercenary outfit that members claim was entwined with the apartheid state and offered soldiers for hire across the continent.</p> <p>\u201cIt was clandestine operations. We were involved in coups, taking over countries for other leaders,\u201d said Alexander Jones, who has detailed his years as an intelligence officer with the group. SAIMR\u2019s leaders described themselves as \u201canti-communist\u201d to him at the time but the group was underpinned by racism, he said. \u201cWe were trying to retain the white supremacy on the African continent.\u201d</p> <p>And among its leaders\u2019 most dramatic claims was that it was behind the mysterious 1961 plane crash that killed UN secretary general <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dag-hammarskjold\" title=\"\">Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld</a> and 15 other people.</p> <p>Last week the <em>Observer</em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/12/raf-veteran-admitted-killing-un-secretary-general-dag-hammarskjold-in-1961\" title=\"\"> revealed evidence linking an RAF veteran, Jan van Risseghem, to the tragedy</a>. Now new documents and eyewitness accounts shed light on the alleged role of SAIMR, which claimed responsibility for the crash in secret papers and its own recruitment drives.</p> <p>It is not clear if Van Risseghem, who told a friend he had shot down Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s plane <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/12/former-raf-pilot-shot-down-un-chief-dag-hammarskjold-1961-plane\" title=\"\">without knowing who was on board</a>, had any ties to the group. Any command could have come through an intermediary.</p> <p>But Jones was clear that SAIMR liked to claim ultimate responsibility for killing the UN chief. Photos of the crash site and wreckage, with purported members of the group standing nearby, featured in a presentation made to potential members when he joined three decades ago, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell us at that point in time that it was Hammarskj\u00f6ld; they just said that they had taken out a very high-profile political opponent,\u201d Jones told filmmakers investigating the crash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b25e5c68877b389a89f80234a539a128bb788e8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b25e5c68877b389a89f80234a539a128bb788e8a/0_0_2770_4096/676.jpg\" alt=\"The only known picture of Keith Maxwell, the \u2018commodore\u2019 of SAIMR.\" width=\"676\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The only known picture of Keith Maxwell, the \u2018commodore\u2019 of SAIMR.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: De Wet Potgieter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maxwell himself apparently also claimed SAIMR had brought down the plane, in a handwritten memoir about the group that ended up with the family of an SAIMR veteran.</p> <p>Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death came amid a post-colonial race for resources in Africa. A champion of decolonisation, he made powerful enemies with his support for newly independent states and opposition to white minority rule.</p> <p>On his final flight, he was heading for a secret meeting to try to broker peace in recently independent Congo. The country was on the brink of collapse after its Katanga province \u2013 key to national wealth because it held most of the country\u2019s rich mineral deposits \u2013 declared independence. Western mining interests backed the rebels.</p> <p>Jones claims he answered a SAIMR advertisement in a South African newspaper three decades ago and served for several years. He decided to speak out because he felt he needed closure and because young South Africans should know the truth.</p> <p>\u201cAnybody that resisted any white form of manipulation on the African continent, SAIMR was prepared to go and quell those for a price,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd that is one thing that Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld was totally against. He wanted every country for the people of that country. He was killed because he was going to change the way that Africa dealt with the rest of the world financially, and he was a threat.\u201d</p> <p>Jones was tracked down by the makers of a new documentary, <em>Cold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld</em>, who were looking into SAIMR because of documents handed to South Africa\u2019s truth and reconciliation commission by the country\u2019s National Intelligence Agency two decades ago.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/trc-releases-documents-revealing-plot-kill-un-secretary\" title=\"\">Unveiled at a press conference by the commission chair, Archbishop Desmond Tutu</a>, they purported to detail how SAIMR had masterminded the crash in coordination with UK and US intelligence services. Investigators were never able to examine the papers, though, because soon after they were returned to the archives, and the South African authorities have been unable or unwilling to retrieve the originals.

      "bodyText": "Keith Maxwell, the self-declared \u201ccommodore\u201d of the South African Institute for Maritime Research (SAIMR), liked to dress up on special occasions in the garish costume of a 18th-century admiral, with a three-cornered hat, brass buttons and a cutlass. Ordinary members of his organisation were expected to show up in crisp naval whites. Gathered together in upmarket restaurants, or the quiet of the Wemmer Pan naval base in south-central Johannesburg, they had the air of eccentric history buffs. Maxwell talked about the group\u2019s roots in a Napoleonic-era treasure-hunting syndicate, and told outsiders it was still focused on deep-sea exploration. But appearances were deceptive. Beneath the bizarre trappings lurked a powerful mercenary outfit that members claim was entwined with the apartheid state and offered soldiers for hire across the continent. \u201cIt was clandestine operations. We were involved in coups, taking over countries for other leaders,\u201d said Alexander Jones, who has detailed his years as an intelligence officer with the group. SAIMR\u2019s leaders described themselves as \u201canti-communist\u201d to him at the time but the group was underpinned by racism, he said. \u201cWe were trying to retain the white supremacy on the African continent.\u201d And among its leaders\u2019 most dramatic claims was that it was behind the mysterious 1961 plane crash that killed UN secretary general Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld and 15 other people. Last week the Observer revealed evidence linking an RAF veteran, Jan van Risseghem, to the tragedy. Now new documents and eyewitness accounts shed light on the alleged role of SAIMR, which claimed responsibility for the crash in secret papers and its own recruitment drives. It is not clear if Van Risseghem, who told a friend he had shot down Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s plane without knowing who was on board, had any ties to the group. Any command could have come through an intermediary. But Jones was clear that SAIMR liked to claim ultimate responsibility for killing the UN chief. Photos of the crash site and wreckage, with purported members of the group standing nearby, featured in a presentation made to potential members when he joined three decades ago, he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell us at that point in time that it was Hammarskj\u00f6ld; they just said that they had taken out a very high-profile political opponent,\u201d Jones told filmmakers investigating the crash. Maxwell himself apparently also claimed SAIMR had brought down the plane, in a handwritten memoir about the group that ended up with the family of an SAIMR veteran. Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death came amid a post-colonial race for resources in Africa. A champion of decolonisation, he made powerful enemies with his support for newly independent states and opposition to white minority rule. On his final flight, he was heading for a secret meeting to try to broker peace in recently independent Congo. The country was on the brink of collapse after its Katanga province \u2013 key to national wealth because it held most of the country\u2019s rich mineral deposits \u2013 declared independence. Western mining interests backed the rebels. Jones claims he answered a SAIMR advertisement in a South African newspaper three decades ago and served for several years. He decided to speak out because he felt he needed closure and because young South Africans should know the truth. \u201cAnybody that resisted any white form of manipulation on the African continent, SAIMR was prepared to go and quell those for a price,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd that is one thing that Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld was totally against. He wanted every country for the people of that country. He was killed because he was going to change the way that Africa dealt with the rest of the world financially, and he was a threat.\u201d Jones was tracked down by the makers of a new documentary, Cold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld, who were looking into SAIMR because of documents handed to South Africa\u2019s truth and reconciliation commission by the country\u2019s National Intelligence Agency two decades ago. Unveiled at a press conference by the commission chair, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, they purported to detail how SAIMR had masterminded the crash in coordination with UK and US intelligence services. Investigators were never able to examine the papers, though, because soon after they were returned to the archives, and the South African authorities have been unable or unwilling to retrieve the originals. The United Nations, which has reopened its investigation into Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death, has criticised South Africa for its lack of cooperation in finding the file. Investigators have been working from poor quality photocopies of just eight documents, and for years there were questions about whether SAIMR even existed. In the UK, the Foreign Office suggested the papers were hoaxes planted by Soviet agents in a disinformation campaign, and added that British spies \u201cdo not go around bumping people off\u201d. But South Africa was a known recruiting ground for mercenaries who fought in coups and conflicts across much of Africa over the second half of the last century, from Congo and Sierra Leone to Angola and Mozambique. And over the years growing evidence of SAIMR as a real, and dangerous, entity has emerged. Investigative journalist De Wet Potgieter interviewed Maxwell for an article in the 1990s. He took the only known picture of the \u201ccommodore\u201d, and also collected a cache of papers from Maxwell. Those papers included a section of his autobiography and purported lists of recruits for several operations, which the filmmakers used to track down former members. They called dozens, but only two agreed to talk. Clive Jansen van Vuuren said he spent two or three months training with the group, which he thought had ties to the security forces. \u201cI know it\u2019s linked to the intelligence bureau of South Africa, but we were never given specifics,\u201d he said. He had kept a certificate that names him as a petty officer and carries the same slightly bizarre emblem as all other SAIMR papers \u2013 the figurehead of the British ship the Cutty Sark. But he said he never went on operations. Jones claims to have had a more senior role, over a much longer period, and describes the group as a powerful militia. \u201cSAIMR was not a Mickey Mouse organisation.

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage is being lined up as leader of a new pro-Brexit party if Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union is delayed beyond 29 March. The former Ukip leader said he had offered his enthusiastic support to the Brexit party after being sounded out as its potential leader. Catherine Blaiklock, Ukip\u2019s former economics spokeswoman, confirmed she had applied to register the party with the Electoral Commission on 11 January and that it would be ready to fight any snap general election or the local elections across England in May. She told the Guardian on Sunday: \u201cI think people feel treason has been committed. It\u2019s democracy. It wouldn\u2019t matter whether leave had won by a single vote \u2013 it\u2019s a first-past-the-post system.\u201d Blaiklock said the party was aiming to attract the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU in June 2016 and to win over defectors from the Conservatives, Labour and Ukip. Ukip has suffered the mass resignation of more than a dozen senior party figures, including Farage, in recent weeks in protest at its anti-Islam focus under its leader, Gerard Batten. Farage told the Sun on Sunday: \u201cThere is huge demand for a party that\u2019s got real clarity on this issue. You can see and hear the frustration welling up out there. It\u2019s clear the political elite want to stop Brexit in its tracks and the prime minister doesn\u2019t have the strength or inclination to see this through. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching events with growing dismay \u2013 I\u2019m not the only one. Now we are putting them on notice that if Brexit doesn\u2019t happen on 29 March we are not prepared to stand by and do nothing.\u201d Farage added: \u201cIf the government goes back on its word and betrays the millions of people who voted for Brexit then we need a party prepared to stand up and fight for it. I\u2019m fully prepared for article 50 to be extended or revoked and if that happens, I will re-enter the fray.\u201d Blaiklock, who quit Ukip a week after Farage in December, declined to say whether the fledgling Brexit party had approached other senior Ukip figures about defecting \u2013 or whether it had lined up any wealthy donors. Arron Banks, the businessman being investigated by the National Crime Agency over his role in the Brexit referendum, has repeatedly expressed support for a \u201cUkip 2.0\u201d with Farage as its leader. The Electoral Commission confirmed the Brexit party had applied to be registered. Its website said it would aim to decide on new political party registrations by 1 April \u2013 weeks before the local elections in England and Northern Ireland. Blaiklock, an Oxford University-educated businesswoman, described Farage as \u201can international superstar\u201d and said that, pending approval by the commission, the new party would be ready to fight elections or a second referendum should article 50 be extended beyond 29 March. \u201cA million more people voted for leave than remain,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is that it doesn\u2019t matter what the majority is, democracy doesn\u2019t count. You\u2019re destroying the system. Never in a general election has anybody ever had a revote. If you take London out, leave won by 11% \u2013 not just a few per cent\u201d.",

The book, published by <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/energy-end-world\" title=\"\">MIT Press</a> next month, tells the intriguing tale of how Orcadians have begun to create their own low-carbon future against incredible odds and with only a little help from the mainland.</p> <p>And that may come as a surprise, says Watts, a senior lecturer at the School of GeoSciences, Edinburgh University. \u201cWhen people think of future technologies or innovation, they assume it has all got to be happening in cities,\u201d Watts told me when we met earlier this month. \u201cBut this revolution \u2013 in renewable energy \u2013 is being done in a place that lies at the very edge of the nation.\u201d</p> <p>The idea that such an intellectual revolution could occur in a place closer to the Arctic Circle than it is to London may seem unexpected. But Orkney turns out to have a long history of generating ideas that are exported to the south. At the <a href=\"http://www.nessofbrodgar.co.uk/about-the-ness-of-brodgar/\" title=\"\">Ness of Brodgar</a>, excavations at a recently discovered neolithic ceremonial complex show there was flourishing culture on the islands long before the construction of Stonehenge, Avebury and other giant edifices in the south. Neolithic grooved pottery and the first henges were conceived in Orkney before they were exported to the rest of ancient Britain. \u201cWe need to turn the map of Britain upside down when we consider the neolithic and shrug off our south-centric attitudes,\u201d says Nick Card, Brodgar\u2019s director of excavations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"18aa15f53c076d3b697af4bd4ef74327bcbea418\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18aa15f53c076d3b697af4bd4ef74327bcbea418/0_73_5200_3121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wind turbines on sanday in orkney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wind turbines on the isle of Sanday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Roper/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This process is now repeating itself, says Watts. Orkney is leading Britain\u2019s drive toward a carbon-free future. And the critical, vital ingredient in this revolution has been the manner in which islanders have turned the energy of the winds into a reliable source of power. Low-lying and exposed to both the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, Orkney is battered by winds and gales throughout the year. Rainstorms sweep the islands with unbridled savagery, tear down sheds, rip slates from roofs, and can take out metres of coastline in a night. You don\u2019t need an umbrella here, you need a riot shield, one islander told Watts, who has been a regular visitor to Orkney for the past decade.</p> <p>\u201cWords such as wind and windy are redefined in Orkney,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThey are no longer mild inconveniences but powerful enough to close schools.\u201d They are also powerful enough to run more than 700 micro wind turbines \u2013 and that has been the crucial factor that has changed life on the islands, though the route to this transformation has been a rather erratic one.</p> <p>In the early 1980s, Britain began experiments aimed at developing turbines that could turn wind power into electricity \u2013 at a test site on Burgar Hill, on Orkney. \u201cHowever, the UK pulled the plug on it and instead the Danes and Germans went ahead and developed wind turbine technology \u2013 because their governments invested in it,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThey put in millions. The British government did not. We could have had a UK wind energy industry but we just did not invest.\u201d</p> <p>The impact of wind turbine technology in Orkney was nevertheless profound and islanders took to its generation in a big way. \u201cOrkney used to import its power but now generates, on average over the year, electricity that fulfils 120% of its own needs,\u201d says Watts. \u201cSo you have all this energy. The question is: what are you going to do with it?\u201d</p> <p>Watts outlines the three options open to islanders: build a new cable so it can export its excess renewable energy to the mainland; use more electricity on the islands; or turn its excess renewable power into another fuel \u2013 such as hydrogen \u2013 and then store it. Finding the right course is likely to have a profound impact on Britain as the nation looks to the example set by Orkney and embraces its low-carbon future.</p> <p>\u201cConsider the issue of laying another cable to link the mainland and Orkney,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThat is something that Orcadians cannot do for themselves. It is too costly. You need government help for that sort of thing and the idea of a new cable has been shunted round and round the houses for years without resolution. The islanders are having to be much more self-reliant as a result.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, new uses for electricity are being found \u2013 by islanders who are driving increasing numbers of electric cars. \u201cYou can either pay \u00a32 a night to charge your car or pay a fortune for a vehicle powered by diesel or petrol. It is a no-brainer. For good measure, electric cars\u2019 main disadvantage \u2013 they need recharging every 100 miles or so \u2013 is not a problem on islands that are mostly only a few miles across.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd56ffe832890473dc93513d76453aad3ab2a020\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd56ffe832890473dc93513d76453aad3ab2a020/0_0_3800_2719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ak1000 turbine on the quayside at invergordon in easter ross\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The AK1000 tidal turbine at Invergordon in Easter Ross on the mainland, awaiting transport to Emec in Orkney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Roper/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That leaves the issue of energy storage, a particular problem when dealing with renewable power. Energy cannot be simply collected from a wind turbine and exploited later when conditions are calm and windless \u2013 because there is as yet no reliable way to store it. It is a basic drawback that Orcadians are now tackling. On the Orkney island of Eday, a device known as an electrolyser \u2013 powered by renewable energy sources \u2013 splits water into its two elemental components: hydrogen and oxygen. The former can be stored and later burnt to generate electricity when needed. Already a fuel cell \u2013 powered by locally derived hydrogen \u2013 is being used to generate electricity for berthed vessels on one Orkney pier.</p> <p>That is just the beginning, however. Plans are now under way to expand the use of hydrogen as a fuel for a new generation of ferries that will replace the nine ageing vessels that currently connect the various islands of the archipelago. By running these on hydrogen, massive reductions in use of diesel fuel could be made in Orkney. The first of these vessels \u2013 the world\u2019s first hydrogen-fuelled seagoing car and passenger ferry \u2013 is scheduled for launch in 2021. \u201cWe realised that if we could use hydrogen to power our ferries, we would put another dent in our carbon addiction,\u201d Neil Kermode, head of the <a href=\"http://www.emec.org.uk/\" title=\"\">European Marine Energy Centre</a> (Emec) told the <em>Financial Times</em> last month.</p> <p>The centre \u2013 based in Stromness, Orkney\u2019s second largest town \u2013 has become one of the key players in the transformation of Orkney as a power provider. Opened in 2003, it acts as a plug-and-play site for testing prototype wave and tide energy generators. A year after its opening, one such device \u2013 a giant 120-metre machine called a Pelamis converter \u2013 became the world\u2019s first wave power generator to put electricity into the National Grid. Since then dozens of other different prototypes have been put through their paces there.</p> <p>Generators that exploit the power of the sea have advantages over wind turbines because the latter exploits a source of energy that is far less predictable than the tides. On the other hand, machines immersed in deep, fast flowing waters are not easily repaired when a fault occurs. \u201cYou cannot buy a book that tells you how to anchor a seabed generator to the sea floor in a 7-knot tide,\u201d says Watts. \u201cYou have to go and do it yourself and people in Orkney have been doing it for 15 years now. Marine energy is an everyday topic of conversation in Orkney.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, they have been doing it on a shoestring and a message needs to be made very clearly. If the UK wants to create a wave and tide industry to make up for the wind industry that it lost 30 years ago then it needs to put its money where its mouth is and invest more heavily.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f0242aa9e03f327af8db4c0ab5a4dc79244e77a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0242aa9e03f327af8db4c0ab5a4dc79244e77a4/592_903_2512_2906/864.jpg\" alt=\"a hydrogen refuelling station at kirkwall\" width=\"864\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hydrogen refuelling station at Kirkwall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ferguson/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other hand, when central agencies do intervene, the outcome is not necessarily plain sailing. In 2009, the Crown Estate \u2013 which owns the seabed around Britain \u2013 decided it would lease out areas around Orkney to companies seeking to develop wave and tide energy. \u201cIt was the first such leasing anywhere in the world,\u201d says Watts.</p> <p>The trouble was that many of the sites it leased were good for placing power generation but also for catching lobster and crab. \u201cNo one talked to the fishermen, nor to anyone else on Orkney,\u201d adds Watts. Instead, without consultation, the Crown Estate closed large areas of inshore fishing grounds. \u201cAreas of sea where Orcadians fish, which is essential to their livelihoods, were threatened without warning, discussion or negotiation.\u201d</p> <p>The Crown Estate has since tried hard to improve the situation and closer discussions are now occurring between its agents and local fishermen. Nevertheless, the episode shows how tricky it can be to merge new technologies with older, but still highly important industries.</p> <p>However, adds Watts, the story of Orkney\u2019s marine energy revolution is important for another reason: it promises to have an encouraging outcome \u2013 and that certainly makes it worth telling. Our vision of the future is currently a very dark one. \u201cWe perhaps don\u2019t feel outright despair but our view is still a pretty bleak one, given the threat that is posed by climate change. The great thing about Orkney is that they are now getting on with doing something about it.

And the critical, vital ingredient in this revolution has been the manner in which islanders have turned the energy of the winds into a reliable source of power. Low-lying and exposed to both the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, Orkney is battered by winds and gales throughout the year. Rainstorms sweep the islands with unbridled savagery, tear down sheds, rip slates from roofs, and can take out metres of coastline in a night. You don\u2019t need an umbrella here, you need a riot shield, one islander told Watts, who has been a regular visitor to Orkney for the past decade. \u201cWords such as wind and windy are redefined in Orkney,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThey are no longer mild inconveniences but powerful enough to close schools.\u201d They are also powerful enough to run more than 700 micro wind turbines \u2013 and that has been the crucial factor that has changed life on the islands, though the route to this transformation has been a rather erratic one. In the early 1980s, Britain began experiments aimed at developing turbines that could turn wind power into electricity \u2013 at a test site on Burgar Hill, on Orkney. \u201cHowever, the UK pulled the plug on it and instead the Danes and Germans went ahead and developed wind turbine technology \u2013 because their governments invested in it,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThey put in millions. The British government did not. We could have had a UK wind energy industry but we just did not invest.\u201d The impact of wind turbine technology in Orkney was nevertheless profound and islanders took to its generation in a big way. \u201cOrkney used to import its power but now generates, on average over the year, electricity that fulfils 120% of its own needs,\u201d says Watts. \u201cSo you have all this energy. The question is: what are you going to do with it?\u201d Watts outlines the three options open to islanders: build a new cable so it can export its excess renewable energy to the mainland; use more electricity on the islands; or turn its excess renewable power into another fuel \u2013 such as hydrogen \u2013 and then store it. Finding the right course is likely to have a profound impact on Britain as the nation looks to the example set by Orkney and embraces its low-carbon future. \u201cConsider the issue of laying another cable to link the mainland and Orkney,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThat is something that Orcadians cannot do for themselves. It is too costly. You need government help for that sort of thing and the idea of a new cable has been shunted round and round the houses for years without resolution. The islanders are having to be much more self-reliant as a result.\u201d On the other hand, new uses for electricity are being found \u2013 by islanders who are driving increasing numbers of electric cars. \u201cYou can either pay \u00a32 a night to charge your car or pay a fortune for a vehicle powered by diesel or petrol. It is a no-brainer. For good measure, electric cars\u2019 main disadvantage \u2013 they need recharging every 100 miles or so \u2013 is not a problem on islands that are mostly only a few miles across.\u201d That leaves the issue of energy storage, a particular problem when dealing with renewable power. Energy cannot be simply collected from a wind turbine and exploited later when conditions are calm and windless \u2013 because there is as yet no reliable way to store it. It is a basic drawback that Orcadians are now tackling. On the Orkney island of Eday, a device known as an electrolyser \u2013 powered by renewable energy sources \u2013 splits water into its two elemental components: hydrogen and oxygen. The former can be stored and later burnt to generate electricity when needed. Already a fuel cell \u2013 powered by locally derived hydrogen \u2013 is being used to generate electricity for berthed vessels on one Orkney pier. That is just the beginning, however. Plans are now under way to expand the use of hydrogen as a fuel for a new generation of ferries that will replace the nine ageing vessels that currently connect the various islands of the archipelago. By running these on hydrogen, massive reductions in use of diesel fuel could be made in Orkney. The first of these vessels \u2013 the world\u2019s first hydrogen-fuelled seagoing car and passenger ferry \u2013 is scheduled for launch in 2021. \u201cWe realised that if we could use hydrogen to power our ferries, we would put another dent in our carbon addiction,\u201d Neil Kermode, head of the European Marine Energy Centre (Emec) told the Financial Times last month. The centre \u2013 based in Stromness, Orkney\u2019s second largest town \u2013 has become one of the key players in the transformation of Orkney as a power provider. Opened in 2003, it acts as a plug-and-play site for testing prototype wave and tide energy generators. A year after its opening, one such device \u2013 a giant 120-metre machine called a Pelamis converter \u2013 became the world\u2019s first wave power generator to put electricity into the National Grid. Since then dozens of other different prototypes have been put through their paces there. Generators that exploit the power of the sea have advantages over wind turbines because the latter exploits a source of energy that is far less predictable than the tides. On the other hand, machines immersed in deep, fast flowing waters are not easily repaired when a fault occurs. \u201cYou cannot buy a book that tells you how to anchor a seabed generator to the sea floor in a 7-knot tide,\u201d says Watts. \u201cYou have to go and do it yourself and people in Orkney have been doing it for 15 years now. Marine energy is an everyday topic of conversation in Orkney. \u201cHowever, they have been doing it on a shoestring and a message needs to be made very clearly. If the UK wants to create a wave and tide industry to make up for the wind industry that it lost 30 years ago then it needs to put its money where its mouth is and invest more heavily.\u201d On the other hand, when central agencies do intervene, the outcome is not necessarily plain sailing. In 2009, the Crown Estate \u2013 which owns the seabed around Britain \u2013 decided it would lease out areas around Orkney to companies seeking to develop wave and tide energy. \u201cIt was the first such leasing anywhere in the world,\u201d says Watts. The trouble was that many of the sites it leased were good for placing power generation but also for catching lobster and crab. \u201cNo one talked to the fishermen, nor to anyone else on Orkney,\u201d adds Watts. Instead, without consultation, the Crown Estate closed large areas of inshore fishing grounds. \u201cAreas of sea where Orcadians fish, which is essential to their livelihoods, were threatened without warning, discussion or negotiation.\u201d The Crown Estate has since tried hard to improve the situation and closer discussions are now occurring between its agents and local fishermen. Nevertheless, the episode shows how tricky it can be to merge new technologies with older, but still highly important industries. However, adds Watts, the story of Orkney\u2019s marine energy revolution is important for another reason: it promises to have an encouraging outcome \u2013 and that certainly makes it worth telling. Our vision of the future is currently a very dark one. \u201cWe perhaps don\u2019t feel outright despair but our view is still a pretty bleak one, given the threat that is posed by climate change. The great thing about Orkney is that they are now getting on with doing something about it. I find that very cheering.\u201d \u2022 Energy at the End of the World: An Orkney Islands Saga by Laura Watts is published by MIT Press (\u00a327).

      "bodyText": "When Iowa representative Steve King questioned how \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d became offensive terms, the nine-term Republican congressman was overwhelmingly rebuked by members of his own party. King, whose longstanding nativist views were well documented, was stripped of his committee assignments in Washington, and swiftly became the target of a Super Pac launched by Iowa Republicans with the goal of unseating him in 2020. But the Republican response to King also exposed uncomfortable truths about the party\u2019s penchant for attracting white nationalists: the individual most championed by the latter\u2019s movement resides in the White House. \u201cIn many respects, Steve King was the easier target to go after. The harder target is Donald Trump,\u201d said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican national committee. \u201cWe have had now three years of Donald Trump, as candidate for president and as president, espousing very similar views,\u201d he added. Trump, much like King, has made sharp anti-immigrant sentiment central to his platform. The president has repeatedly linked immigrants to violent crime, despite studies showing otherwise, and pursued a draconian immigration agenda that has sped up the deportation of undocumented immigrants and separated thousands of migrant children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. As a candidate, Trump infamously declared that most immigrants crossing the southern border were \u201crapists\u201d and criminals, and pledged to ban all Muslims from entering the US. In one of his most controversial moments since taking office, Trump blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d after a white nationalist drove his car into counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one and injuring several on 12 August 2017.

Wilson is the producer and creative consultant for Americans Values Pac, a Super Pac that ran ads against King in the 2018 midterms, and said white supremacist groups claimed Trump as one of their own in the same way they did King. \u201cIt leaves them in a very dark place justifying their support for a president who has many, many beliefs that are very, very racist,\u201d he said. King\u2019s own latest comments were far from the first time he spoke of immigrants and minorities in derogatory terms. The congressman has likened immigrants to \u201cdirt\u201d and \u201cdogs\u201d, claimed most Dreamers were smuggling drugs across the border, and suggested American civilization could not be restored \u201cwith somebody else\u2019s babies\u201d. King also displayed a Confederate flag on his office desk, retweeted Nazis and argued that Somali Muslims should not be allowed to work in meatpacking plants in his district. In some instances, Republicans in Congress condemned King\u2019s rhetoric; but on others occasions, it was implied that he misspoke or was ignored entirely. Tim Scott, the Senate\u2019s lone black Republican, penned an op-ed last week urging his peers to purge King and likeminded voices from the party. \u201cSome in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism \u2013 it is because of our silence when things like this are said,\u201d Scott wrote. At least one Republican congressman, Louie Gohmert of Texas, rose up in King\u2019s defense last week. \u201c[King] was talking about Western civilization, that, \u2018When did Western civilization become a negative?\u2019 and that\u2019s a fair question. When did Western civilization become a negative?\u201d Gohmert told his hometown paper, the Tyler Morning Telegraph. Although he condemned white supremacy, Gohmert insisted King had been treated in a manner that was \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d. And in the same week that King was disavowed by his colleagues, two House Republicans met with Chuck Johnson, a known white nationalist and Holocaust denier. An image of representatives Andy Harris, of Maryland, and Phil Roe, of Tennessee, walking through the corridors of Capitol Hill was widely circulated on social media. A spokesman for Roe said the congressman \u201cwould not have taken the meeting had he been aware of Mr Johnson\u2019s previously expressed views\u201d. Harris\u2019s office similarly claimed they did not know of Johnson\u2019s past statements, which include questioning how many Jews were killed in the Holocaust and raising money for neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Wilson said many Republicans in Congress were reluctant to weed out those associated with white nationalist groups entirely, because they ultimately relied on them for votes. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain degree of winking tolerance that\u2019s been built up with a lot of these Trump guys where they know there\u2019s a crazy, racist uncle in the basement,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to admit it out in public, but they sure know that he\u2019s there.\u201d",

Do all these things \u201ccause\u201d psychosis, or is there another, more likely answer? In our many decades of college teaching, one of the most important things we have tried to impart to our students is the distinction between correlation (two things are statistically associated) and causation (one thing causes another).

Many of these behaviors appear earlier in development, but the fact that one thing occurs before another also is not proof of causation. (One of the standard logical fallacies taught in logic classes: after this, therefore because of this.) It is also worth noting that 10-fold increases in marijuana use in the UK from the 1970s to the 2000s were not associated with an increase in rates of psychosis over this same period, further evidence that changes in cannabis use in the general population are unlikely to contribute to changes in psychosis.</p> <p>Evidence from research tells us that aggression and violence are highly unlikely outcomes of marijuana use.

She has lived at Hacienda since she was three, non-responsive as the result of a near-drowning.</p> <p>And she is a new mother.

Struggling to find other states to use as models for reform, leaders in Arizona are having difficulty assuring families their loved ones are safe.</p> <p>Cesena first heard what had happened when she saw a headline on a television at the <a href=\"https://rmhccnaz.org/\">Ronald McDonald House</a>, where she was staying. Now she leaves her daughter\u2019s side to smoke, to buy cheese and coffee and to talk to as many reporters as she can. At first she wants to trade her story for a link to her GoFundMe page, explaining she\u2019s desperate to get Morris out of Hacienda and needs money to do so. When she hears there\u2019s no guarantee of that, she talks anyhow.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s catch this fucker,\u201d she texts, offering to meet outside the facility.</p> <p>From the street, Hacienda looks shabby but well-kept, a complex of ageing stuccoed buildings with red-shingled roofs and portables added on. This is a rough part of town but a beautiful one, abutting South Mountain, close to Sky Harbor airport.</p> <p>There\u2019s a park across the street and near-constant comings and goings, as staff change shifts and visitors arrive. Cesena says there has definitely been an increase in traffic in the last couple of weeks. She says security was always lax. \u201cI used to walk in, walk out,\u201d she says; they didn\u2019t ask her to wear a badge. Even after the birth, she says, she walked right past police detectives who didn\u2019t ask for ID.</p> <p>Last year, the Arizona legislature defeated a measure that would have required video cameras in facilities like this one. Jon Meyers, executive director of the <a href=\"https://cgarc.org/board-members/jon-meyers/\">ARC of Arizona</a>, a state chapter of a national organization that advocates for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, did not support the measure, citing privacy concerns.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t put a video camera everywhere,\u201d Meyers says. \u201cThis is a little more nuanced than that. We have to be more creative. We have to recognize \u2013 and I hate to say this \u2013 we are never going to 100% prevent these things from happening.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3286f22f59b50037e87e8afa17f85a6d968bfcf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3286f22f59b50037e87e8afa17f85a6d968bfcf9/0_30_720_900/400.jpg\" alt=\"Karina Cesena attends to her daughter, Jazzmyne Morris, who is a resident at the Hacienda HealthCare home in Phoenix, Arizona.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karina Cesena attends to her daughter, Jazzmyne Morris, who is a resident at the Hacienda HealthCare home in Phoenix, Arizona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Karina Cesena</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, he says, Arizona can do much better. Earlier this month, Meyers got in touch with the national office of the ARC, asking for a list of places that keep clients with intellectual and developmental disabilities safe. Ariel Simms, a senior program manager in Washington DC, wrote: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any state that could serve as the model for other states in this area. Many, like Arizona, are in the process of recognizing this as a problem.\u201d</p> <p>New Jersey and Massachusetts have made some strides, she wrote, but issues of abuse and neglect have largely not been addressed.</p> <p>Last year, National Public Radio <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/08/570224090/the-sexual-assault-epidemic-no-one-talks-about\">reported</a> US Department of Justice figures showing that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are seven times more likely to be sexually abused than others. Advocates say that figure is actually much higher.</p> <p>Nora Baladerian, a psychologist and director of the <a href=\"http://disability-abuse.com/\">Disability and Abuse Project</a> of Spectrum Institute in Palm Springs, California, says she wishes the Hacienda incident was isolated.</p> <p>\u201cIt is much more common than people know and we don\u2019t even expect it or suspect that that could happen in a licensed facility that looks so proper. This is a problem nationally \u2026 and in other countries as well.\u201d</p> <p>Arizona has long been known for poor social services, ranking at the bottom when it comes to funding education, <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/issues/2017-state-mental-health-america-ranking-states\">providing for people with mental illness</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aecf.org/where-we-work/location/az/\">helping children in crisis</a>. But the irony is that the state has a reputation for providing top-notch services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Arizona once again ranked No 1 in <a href=\"http://caseforinclusion.org/application/files/1215/4653/0255/UCP_Case_for_Inclusion_Report_2019_Final_Single_Page.pdf\">a national report</a> released by United Cerebral Palsy (this year, the American Network of Community Options and Resources also participated) called <a href=\"http://caseforinclusion.org/application/files/1215/4653/0255/UCP_Case_for_Inclusion_Report_2019_Final_Single_Page.pdf\">The Case for Inclusion</a>, which measures everything from overall health and safety to efforts to keep people with intellectual and developmental disabilities at home.</p> <p>The report bases much of its results on the length of waiting lists in each state. Arizona circumvents this challenge by making it very difficult to qualify for services, advocates say. In any case, the report is often held up by state officials as a blue ribbon.</p> <p>But no one is crowing about the UCP report this year. A new legislative session began this week, and several lawmakers are sponsoring bills designed to begin reforming the system. First up, fix a 1997 law that exempted Hacienda from state regulation.</p> <p>\u201cPredators embed themselves in these facilities because they know they are wolf among the sheep,\u201d says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenlongdon?lang=en\">Democrat Jennifer Longdon</a>, a freshman member of the state House.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a legislative point of view there are a number of things we need to do,\u201d she adds, \u201cincluding requiring comprehensive rape crisis services and appropriate oversight of agencies, as well as awareness training and reporting, things that people assume must be in place. Turns out, they\u2019re really not.\u201d</p> <p>For Karina Cesena, none of this can come fast enough. She is terrified and she says her daughter is too. She describes the process of explaining what happened to Morris.</p> <p>\u201cHer eyes just got so big,\u201d she says. Her daughter\u2019s hands began to tremor, signaling a seizure. She has many seizures a day.</p> <p>She lives a floor above where the woman who gave birth lived, in a different setting because she is making progress, Cesena says.She cannot walk or talk, but she is aware of her surroundings.</p> <p>Cesena lives in Parker, in northern Arizona. She brought Morris to Hacienda because she read good reviews online. At first, she says, she was happy. When staff members left and the level of care declined, she says, she brought her daughter home. But it was too much. Now, she\u2019s not sure what to do.</p> <p>The clouds over Hacienda HealthCare turn to rain, and Cesena pulls her hoodie over her head. It begins to pour. She says goodbye, turns and walks inside.</p>",

Cesena first heard what had happened when she saw a headline on a television at the Ronald McDonald House, where she was staying. Now she leaves her daughter\u2019s side to smoke, to buy cheese and coffee and to talk to as many reporters as she can. At first she wants to trade her story for a link to her GoFundMe page, explaining she\u2019s desperate to get Morris out of Hacienda and needs money to do so. When she hears there\u2019s no guarantee of that, she talks anyhow. \u201cLet\u2019s catch this fucker,\u201d she texts, offering to meet outside the facility. From the street, Hacienda looks shabby but well-kept, a complex of ageing stuccoed buildings with red-shingled roofs and portables added on. This is a rough part of town but a beautiful one, abutting South Mountain, close to Sky Harbor airport. There\u2019s a park across the street and near-constant comings and goings, as staff change shifts and visitors arrive. Cesena says there has definitely been an increase in traffic in the last couple of weeks. She says security was always lax. \u201cI used to walk in, walk out,\u201d she says; they didn\u2019t ask her to wear a badge. Even after the birth, she says, she walked right past police detectives who didn\u2019t ask for ID. Last year, the Arizona legislature defeated a measure that would have required video cameras in facilities like this one. Jon Meyers, executive director of the ARC of Arizona, a state chapter of a national organization that advocates for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, did not support the measure, citing privacy concerns. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a video camera everywhere,\u201d Meyers says. \u201cThis is a little more nuanced than that. We have to be more creative. We have to recognize \u2013 and I hate to say this \u2013 we are never going to 100% prevent these things from happening.\u201d But, he says, Arizona can do much better. Earlier this month, Meyers got in touch with the national office of the ARC, asking for a list of places that keep clients with intellectual and developmental disabilities safe. Ariel Simms, a senior program manager in Washington DC, wrote: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any state that could serve as the model for other states in this area. Many, like Arizona, are in the process of recognizing this as a problem.\u201d New Jersey and Massachusetts have made some strides, she wrote, but issues of abuse and neglect have largely not been addressed. Last year, National Public Radio reported US Department of Justice figures showing that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are seven times more likely to be sexually abused than others. Advocates say that figure is actually much higher. Nora Baladerian, a psychologist and director of the Disability and Abuse Project of Spectrum Institute in Palm Springs, California, says she wishes the Hacienda incident was isolated. \u201cIt is much more common than people know and we don\u2019t even expect it or suspect that that could happen in a licensed facility that looks so proper. This is a problem nationally \u2026 and in other countries as well.\u201d Arizona has long been known for poor social services, ranking at the bottom when it comes to funding education, providing for people with mental illness and helping children in crisis. But the irony is that the state has a reputation for providing top-notch services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Earlier this month, Arizona once again ranked No 1 in a national report released by United Cerebral Palsy (this year, the American Network of Community Options and Resources also participated) called The Case for Inclusion, which measures everything from overall health and safety to efforts to keep people with intellectual and developmental disabilities at home. The report bases much of its results on the length of waiting lists in each state. Arizona circumvents this challenge by making it very difficult to qualify for services, advocates say. In any case, the report is often held up by state officials as a blue ribbon. But no one is crowing about the UCP report this year. A new legislative session began this week, and several lawmakers are sponsoring bills designed to begin reforming the system. First up, fix a 1997 law that exempted Hacienda from state regulation. \u201cPredators embed themselves in these facilities because they know they are wolf among the sheep,\u201d says Democrat Jennifer Longdon, a freshman member of the state House. \u201cFrom a legislative point of view there are a number of things we need to do,\u201d she adds, \u201cincluding requiring comprehensive rape crisis services and appropriate oversight of agencies, as well as awareness training and reporting, things that people assume must be in place. Turns out, they\u2019re really not.\u201d For Karina Cesena, none of this can come fast enough. She is terrified and she says her daughter is too. She describes the process of explaining what happened to Morris. \u201cHer eyes just got so big,\u201d she says. Her daughter\u2019s hands began to tremor, signaling a seizure. She has many seizures a day. She lives a floor above where the woman who gave birth lived, in a different setting because she is making progress, Cesena says.She cannot walk or talk, but she is aware of her surroundings. Cesena lives in Parker, in northern Arizona. She brought Morris to Hacienda because she read good reviews online. At first, she says, she was happy. When staff members left and the level of care declined, she says, she brought her daughter home. But it was too much. Now, she\u2019s not sure what to do. The clouds over Hacienda HealthCare turn to rain, and Cesena pulls her hoodie over her head. It begins to pour. She says goodbye, turns and walks inside.",

      "body": "<p>Every weekday morning at seven o\u2019clock, a dozen or so reporters line up outside the federal courthouse in Brooklyn to assure themselves a seat at the trial of Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, the Sinaloa cartel boss. Articles have touted the many garish revelations that have emerged, including Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s private zoo, his use of a diamond-encrusted pistol, his smuggling tunnels underneath the US\u2013Mexico border, the huge bribes paid to officials, and the murder of a cartel leader\u2019s brother who refused to shake his hand.</p> <p>\u201cHow Many Gory Details Can One Jury Take?\u201d asked a headline in the New York Times, which has supplied its readers a steady stream. Vice News is offering an eight-part podcast, Chapo: Kingpin on Trial, based on years of reporting on the people \u201caffected by El Chapo\u2019s rise and fall\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019ve avoided using that moniker, for it feeds the sense of chummy celebrity that\u2019s arisen around the man. The trial\u2019s coverage recalls the star treatment given Pablo Escobar and the Medell\u00edn cartel three decades ago. The \u201cKings of Cocaine\u201d, they were then called, and their legend has been sustained by such blood-drenched productions as \u201cNarcos\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4162\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_opinion\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such glamorizing not only insults the families of those who were murdered and disappeared by these criminals, but also blurs the fact that the drug war has been a dismal failure. In fact, that war has fed the violence, since removing cartel leaders disrupts the market, creating a vacuum that gangs fight to fill. It was the DEA\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d in shutting down the cocaine transportation routes long used by the Colombians through the Caribbean that led them to redirect their trade through Mexico, giving rise to the national nightmare that over the last decade has claimed an estimated 150,000 lives. If the Guzm\u00e1n trial has had one salutary effect, it\u2019s been to show the impossibility of trying to keep drugs from entering the United States.

      "bodyText": "Every weekday morning at seven o\u2019clock, a dozen or so reporters line up outside the federal courthouse in Brooklyn to assure themselves a seat at the trial of Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, the Sinaloa cartel boss. Articles have touted the many garish revelations that have emerged, including Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s private zoo, his use of a diamond-encrusted pistol, his smuggling tunnels underneath the US\u2013Mexico border, the huge bribes paid to officials, and the murder of a cartel leader\u2019s brother who refused to shake his hand. \u201cHow Many Gory Details Can One Jury Take?\u201d asked a headline in the New York Times, which has supplied its readers a steady stream. Vice News is offering an eight-part podcast, Chapo: Kingpin on Trial, based on years of reporting on the people \u201caffected by El Chapo\u2019s rise and fall\u201d. I\u2019ve avoided using that moniker, for it feeds the sense of chummy celebrity that\u2019s arisen around the man. The trial\u2019s coverage recalls the star treatment given Pablo Escobar and the Medell\u00edn cartel three decades ago. The \u201cKings of Cocaine\u201d, they were then called, and their legend has been sustained by such blood-drenched productions as \u201cNarcos\u201d. Such glamorizing not only insults the families of those who were murdered and disappeared by these criminals, but also blurs the fact that the drug war has been a dismal failure. In fact, that war has fed the violence, since removing cartel leaders disrupts the market, creating a vacuum that gangs fight to fill. It was the DEA\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d in shutting down the cocaine transportation routes long used by the Colombians through the Caribbean that led them to redirect their trade through Mexico, giving rise to the national nightmare that over the last decade has claimed an estimated 150,000 lives. If the Guzm\u00e1n trial has had one salutary effect, it\u2019s been to show the impossibility of trying to keep drugs from entering the United States. By plane, train, truck and submarine they continue to arrive, drawn by Americans\u2019 insatiable demand for illicit intoxicants. The coverage of the Guzm\u00e1n trial reflects a deeper problem, too. For most western journalists, Mexico means kingpins, cartels, murders, military abuses, corrupt cops and migrants. They pay far less attention to another, even more significant feature of Mexican life: its extreme poverty and inequality. With a GDP approaching $1.15tn, Mexico\u2019s economy is now the 15th largest in the world, but its per-capita income of about $9,000 ranks just 70th. According to the Gini scale of income inequality, Mexico is the world\u2019s 19th most unequal country \u2013 more so than even Nicaragua, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, and Chad. A shocking 43.6% of Mexicans are considered poor. That destitution is the root cause of many of Mexico\u2019s other ills. Drug trafficking, violence, corruption, impunity, migration \u2013 all are outgrowths of the country\u2019s high unemployment, low wages, poor schools, inadequate healthcare, farmers without land, youths without jobs.

Sharapova went down screaming, of course, but was less vocal later when stonewalling difficult questions about her history here with Meldonium, which cost her 15 months of her career after she failed a drugs test at this event years ago. The silent death stare that greeted the inquiry about how she was coping without the banned substance would have unsettled a trained spy. Asked about what she thought when the crowd booed her after she took a toilet break before the start of the third set, she said, \u201cWhat do you want me to say to that question?\u201d The truth, her inquisitor responded. \u201cI think that\u2019s a silly question to ask,\u201d she said. If Maria says it\u2019s silly, it gets parked. From there the exchange went slowly downhill. It seems she will always be admired, respected and even feared, but not widely loved. It is her decision that it is like that. She attributed some of her 10 double-faults to serving from the end where the sun was shining directly into her eyes, which was a fair point. Barty kept hers to a manageable four. Sharapova did hit the target with one observation, one that suggests she will soldier on, despite four barren years since she won her seventh slam at Roland Garros. \u201cI think it would be tough for me to be doing all the work and putting in all the effort if I didn\u2019t really believe that [she could win again]. I think I\u2019d be kidding myself.\u201d Overall, it was a performance - uptight, anxious, dogged - theatrically at odds with Barty\u2019s smiling acceptance of how the shots fell and the points ebbed. There was one genuine shock on Sunday: The 25-year-old American, Danielle Collins, with a game honed in college tennis, hit 29 winners in 56 minutes to put former champion Angelique Kerber out, winning 6-0, 6-2. The Floridian, more used to the backwaters of her sport but up to No 35 in the world rankings after a breakthrough year in 2018, described her run to the quarter-finals as \u201can incredible experience\u201d, having never previously won a singles grand-slam match before arriving in Melbourne.",

She reported: \u201cThere was a general feeling among customers that Welsh-language services were deteriorating. Many said that it was impossible to do any online banking in Welsh. Several said the closure of branches had a negative impact on their ability to discuss their money in Welsh. Others said Welsh-language telephone banking services were inconsistent and that the service was not being promoted adequately.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Sometimes I think I\u2019m the perfect person to analyse the cultural impact of music. I\u2019m pretty sure no one else has ever thought that about me, though. And actually, even I don\u2019t think it very often.</p> <p>My weakness in the role would undoubtedly be my ignorance of music. Not complete ignorance: it\u2019s impossible, it turns out, no matter how little interest you show, to remain alive for 44 years in modern Britain without having heard of Mozart and Rihanna \u2013 though I had to check the spelling of the latter. And, come to think of it, I\u2019m quite partial to Magic FM on a car journey and also I watched that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/29/welcome-rebirth-for-bros-the-brothers-pop-forgot\" title=\"\">Bros documentary</a> everyone\u2019s going on about.</p> <p>But I admit I don\u2019t know much about music. Is that really such a problem though? The more I think about it, the more I reckon that\u2019s actually what might make me amazing at analysing its cultural impact. I don\u2019t have any musical tastes that could skew my judgment and confuse the analysis with thoughts of whether this bit of music, or type of music, is \u201cbetter\u201d than that bit or type. I can see what\u2019s really going on, unencumbered by strong views on Coldplay or David Bowie or clapping at the end of movements (which Elvis Presley\u2019s entourage were reduced to at the end). I don\u2019t have a dog in the fight, which makes me ideal as an analyst of dog fighting.</p> <p>Someone who does have a dog in the fight is Mark Wigglesworth. He\u2019s the former music director of the English National Opera so must be massively keen on music. He\u2019s probably got all of Rihanna\u2019s albums and a poster of Mozart in his bedroom. So I was worried, when I saw he was dabbling in some analysis of the cultural impact of music, that he might be out of his depth. Well, you be the judge. Unless you\u2019re into music at all, in which case perhaps you\u2019d better stay out of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not about music, it\u2019s about a group defining itself around something from which it derives a sense of superiority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was about the ENO\u2019s policy of performing operas in English \u2013 which means, in the majority of cases, in translation (though I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll change after Brexit when homegrown opera is freed from its Euro\u2011shackles). This is an issue in the opera world: should operas be sung with the words they were composed for or those the audience can understand? Writing on the music website <a href=\"https://bachtrack.com/opinion-gained-in-translation-defence-eno-opera-in-english-policy-january-2019\" title=\"\">Bachtrack</a>, Wigglesworth stoutly defended the latter policy.</p> <p>If you\u2019re currently struggling to care because this is a discussion of something that happens in rooms you have no intention of entering, then let me try to grab your attention by mentioning the slagging off. Alongside some reasoned argument asserting that \u201copera is drama first and foremost\u201d and \u201cbeauty is not as powerful a medium as meaning\u201d (that\u2019s worth a fridge magnet), Wigglesworth had a tentative dig at his opponents\u2019 motives: \u201cA more unspoken view is one that thinks singing in a foreign language \u2018keeps the riff-raff away\u2019,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI do believe a certain pleasure in cultural elitism exists, even if only by a few.\u201d</p> <p>You can feel the nervousness as he wrote that. \u201cI don\u2019t mean you!\u201d he\u2019s reassuring any specific opponent of translated opera who might take offence. \u201cYou think what you think purely on artistic grounds and I respectfully disagree! It\u2019s some other guys, who happen to have the same opinion as you but for much less wholesome reasons, who are the snobs.\u201d</p> <p>This is much more interesting, because it\u2019s not about music, it\u2019s about \u201criff-raff\u201d. Wigglesworth wants to make \u201copera accessible to all\u201d and \u201call\u201d, by definition, includes riff-raff. He sees this as the ENO\u2019s mission. \u201cAccessibility,\u201d he writes, \u201cis not really about the price of a ticket. For accessibility to be meaningful and long lasting it has to come from the work itself\u2026 When Mozart wanted to write for \u2018the people\u2019 he did so in their native German. He trusted that if more people understood the piece, more would enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>This makes sense, but I can\u2019t help wondering how much riff-raff the ENO currently attracts, even with its populist policy of singing words the audience can actually understand. Obviously I don\u2019t know \u2013 I\u2019ve never been there because of my irrational fear of hours and hours of boredom \u2013 but I find it hard to believe that, if I did go, I\u2019d think: \u201cLook at the riff-raff in here! The sooner they start doing operas in Italian and get the carpets steam cleaned, the better. This English translation of <em>La traviata</em> they\u2019ve put on is an absolute scum-magnet.\u201d</p> <p>But I think Wigglesworth is basically right. He\u2019s just slightly confused matters with the term \u201criff-raff\u201d, because this isn\u2019t about class, it\u2019s about tribalism. The riff-raff here are people who see themselves as opera buffs but whom the anti\u2011translation opera buffs would say aren\u2019t proper buffs because they don\u2019t like opera enough to sit through it when the words are gobbledygook \u2013 or aren\u2019t proper buffs because they haven\u2019t troubled to learn Italian and German.</p> <p>It\u2019s like hardcore fans of an indie band despising newer fans who only got into them once they became successful. It\u2019s not about music, it\u2019s not about class, it\u2019s about a group defining itself around something from which it derives a sense of moral superiority. In the middle ages, people like that founded monastic orders.</p> <p>And, to be honest, most of us are a bit like that. We all need someone to look down on. The pro-accessibility opera fans are looking down on the linguistic purists \u2013 for being elitist snobs, but also for being ignorant of opera\u2019s history as a popular art form \u2013 just as much as the purists are looking down on them. They\u2019re all having a lovely time feeling like they\u2019re better than other people \u2013 just as people who believe passionately in egalitarianism instinctively feel like they\u2019re better than those who don\u2019t believe passionately in egalitarianism.</p> <p>Which means that the ENO\u2019s policy on singing opera in English must not change. The bitching it engenders is vital to both sides of the opera community\u2019s sense of self. Disagreeing about it is enjoyable and, without it, all that\u2019s left to entertain them is opera.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes I think I\u2019m the perfect person to analyse the cultural impact of music. I\u2019m pretty sure no one else has ever thought that about me, though. And actually, even I don\u2019t think it very often. My weakness in the role would undoubtedly be my ignorance of music. Not complete ignorance: it\u2019s impossible, it turns out, no matter how little interest you show, to remain alive for 44 years in modern Britain without having heard of Mozart and Rihanna \u2013 though I had to check the spelling of the latter. And, come to think of it, I\u2019m quite partial to Magic FM on a car journey and also I watched that Bros documentary everyone\u2019s going on about. But I admit I don\u2019t know much about music. Is that really such a problem though? The more I think about it, the more I reckon that\u2019s actually what might make me amazing at analysing its cultural impact. I don\u2019t have any musical tastes that could skew my judgment and confuse the analysis with thoughts of whether this bit of music, or type of music, is \u201cbetter\u201d than that bit or type. I can see what\u2019s really going on, unencumbered by strong views on Coldplay or David Bowie or clapping at the end of movements (which Elvis Presley\u2019s entourage were reduced to at the end). I don\u2019t have a dog in the fight, which makes me ideal as an analyst of dog fighting. Someone who does have a dog in the fight is Mark Wigglesworth. He\u2019s the former music director of the English National Opera so must be massively keen on music. He\u2019s probably got all of Rihanna\u2019s albums and a poster of Mozart in his bedroom. So I was worried, when I saw he was dabbling in some analysis of the cultural impact of music, that he might be out of his depth. Well, you be the judge. Unless you\u2019re into music at all, in which case perhaps you\u2019d better stay out of it. It was about the ENO\u2019s policy of performing operas in English \u2013 which means, in the majority of cases, in translation (though I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll change after Brexit when homegrown opera is freed from its Euro\u2011shackles). This is an issue in the opera world: should operas be sung with the words they were composed for or those the audience can understand? Writing on the music website Bachtrack, Wigglesworth stoutly defended the latter policy. If you\u2019re currently struggling to care because this is a discussion of something that happens in rooms you have no intention of entering, then let me try to grab your attention by mentioning the slagging off. Alongside some reasoned argument asserting that \u201copera is drama first and foremost\u201d and \u201cbeauty is not as powerful a medium as meaning\u201d (that\u2019s worth a fridge magnet), Wigglesworth had a tentative dig at his opponents\u2019 motives: \u201cA more unspoken view is one that thinks singing in a foreign language \u2018keeps the riff-raff away\u2019,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI do believe a certain pleasure in cultural elitism exists, even if only by a few.\u201d You can feel the nervousness as he wrote that. \u201cI don\u2019t mean you!\u201d he\u2019s reassuring any specific opponent of translated opera who might take offence. \u201cYou think what you think purely on artistic grounds and I respectfully disagree! It\u2019s some other guys, who happen to have the same opinion as you but for much less wholesome reasons, who are the snobs.\u201d This is much more interesting, because it\u2019s not about music, it\u2019s about \u201criff-raff\u201d. Wigglesworth wants to make \u201copera accessible to all\u201d and \u201call\u201d, by definition, includes riff-raff. He sees this as the ENO\u2019s mission. \u201cAccessibility,\u201d he writes, \u201cis not really about the price of a ticket. For accessibility to be meaningful and long lasting it has to come from the work itself\u2026 When Mozart wanted to write for \u2018the people\u2019 he did so in their native German. He trusted that if more people understood the piece, more would enjoy it.\u201d This makes sense, but I can\u2019t help wondering how much riff-raff the ENO currently attracts, even with its populist policy of singing words the audience can actually understand. Obviously I don\u2019t know \u2013 I\u2019ve never been there because of my irrational fear of hours and hours of boredom \u2013 but I find it hard to believe that, if I did go, I\u2019d think: \u201cLook at the riff-raff in here! The sooner they start doing operas in Italian and get the carpets steam cleaned, the better. This English translation of La traviata they\u2019ve put on is an absolute scum-magnet.\u201d But I think Wigglesworth is basically right. He\u2019s just slightly confused matters with the term \u201criff-raff\u201d, because this isn\u2019t about class, it\u2019s about tribalism. The riff-raff here are people who see themselves as opera buffs but whom the anti\u2011translation opera buffs would say aren\u2019t proper buffs because they don\u2019t like opera enough to sit through it when the words are gobbledygook \u2013 or aren\u2019t proper buffs because they haven\u2019t troubled to learn Italian and German. It\u2019s like hardcore fans of an indie band despising newer fans who only got into them once they became successful. It\u2019s not about music, it\u2019s not about class, it\u2019s about a group defining itself around something from which it derives a sense of moral superiority. In the middle ages, people like that founded monastic orders. And, to be honest, most of us are a bit like that. We all need someone to look down on. The pro-accessibility opera fans are looking down on the linguistic purists \u2013 for being elitist snobs, but also for being ignorant of opera\u2019s history as a popular art form \u2013 just as much as the purists are looking down on them. They\u2019re all having a lovely time feeling like they\u2019re better than other people \u2013 just as people who believe passionately in egalitarianism instinctively feel like they\u2019re better than those who don\u2019t believe passionately in egalitarianism. Which means that the ENO\u2019s policy on singing opera in English must not change. The bitching it engenders is vital to both sides of the opera community\u2019s sense of self. Disagreeing about it is enjoyable and, without it, all that\u2019s left to entertain them is opera.",

It was captioned by Beckham \u2013 almost as if she knew something terrifying about soap that she is not, alas, at liberty to disclose \u2013 \u201cWe MUST use CLEAN products on our children!!\u201d What kind of message would this send out, Beckham must have considered, particularly to parents cruelly reminded that they are at least a decade too late to extract any value from their own flesh and blood? Try getting anyone interested in a 21-year-old\u2019s pores. True, as growing numbers of mummy bloggers have demonstrated, there can be decent mileage in a confident pubescent \u2013 or even in an unusually tattooed but otherwise unexceptional 19-year-old. But youthful compliance with extreme parental exhibitionism, as much as it may look easy, probably depends, like deference to religious fanaticism, on undeviating inculcation, best started before the child knows anything else. In utero, if not in Clearblue. Of course, as with escapees from Saudi Arabia, there will be exceptions, heartbreaking for the parents, where a carefully raised child refuses to perform. Some cases of suspected apostasy \u2013 a now rarely exhibited son, a recently invisible celebrity teen \u2013 serve as a warning to celebrity families and aspiring mummy bloggers of what can happen if the observances due to a brand are even fleetingly relaxed or interrupted. Just a few days of missed Instagrams or incomplete group hugs could swiftly lead to childish withdrawal, to divergent concepts of internet safety, a fatally damaged brand. Ideally, no more than a few days should separate the Instagramming of a seven-year-old\u2019s facial from the reveal of her new \u2019do.

Have we stigmatised fat to the point that it\u2019s more acceptable to describe my child like one of those big crane machines they use to build aircraft carriers, than imply for one second that he might be a little tubby? In Ireland, of course, people are more frank. \u2018Jesus, he\u2019s half-reared,\u2019 was one particularly delightful exclamation from my auntie Moyra. \u2018The wind wouldn\u2019t blow him away, anyway,\u2019 exclaimed a family friend. Insulting a child\u2019s appearance is a ritual in Irish households. It\u2019s why most UK workplaces have at least two Irish staff members; should their colleagues ever show baby pics, each will have a partner with whom they can then discreetly discuss the ugliness of said child shortly afterward. For our son, however, his days as a buttery wee spud could soon be at an end. Next week we begin weaning him on to solids, a process that, when combined with increased activity, has usually precipitated weight loss among other kids we know. We\u2019ll be sad to say goodbye to his knuckle dimples and thigh rolls, but we may, at least, get a bit more use out of those bibs. Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

Prof <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/arts/design/a-belated-retrospective-for-a-bauhaus-artist.html\" title=\"\">Hannes Beckmann</a>, for example, who taught me colour theory and design, was a Bauhaus-taught painter and photographer, and was teaching us from the notes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kandinsky\" title=\"\">Wassily Kandinsky</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/klee\" title=\"\">Paul Klee</a>. Can you believe it? He showed me their notes with the comments by these amazing artists on them.</p> <p>So I had the exact course that was taught at the Bauhaus and I learned the beauty and profundity of its ideas. Sometimes Beckmann would correct us using the words of Kandinsky, which I learned later reading his books. I think I was lucky to have been given an extended Bauhaus education through the refugees in New York. I would never have done what I do without that.</p> <p>Also, when I moved from Poland to Israel in the 1950s, Tel Aviv was a Bauhaus city, made by architects who came [from Germany] to Palestine and so that gave me a sense of the Bauhaus intellectually and in terms of city planning. It was beautiful living there; the ideas work perfectly. The city was low rise at that time, nothing more than four storeys high; buildings were raised above the ground to make way for car entry and they had little gardens. It was the ideal city, but cities grow and Tel Aviv today is very different.</p> <p>Bauhaus, at its core, is about understanding the world and its wonder. It\u2019s the fact that everything to do with design \u2013 from the small to the large to the horizon \u2013 is something beautiful and worthy of the word wonder.</p> <p>I think Bauhaus has a strong ethical and political dimension \u2013 it strives for equality. It was only later on that it became minimalist and reductivist in its ideas. The true, original Bauhaus was about the eternal human spirit. I think the Bauhaus has a global impact \u2013 in Russia, the United States, Japan \u2013 because of what it sought to do \u2013 to illuminate the world of design with powerful concepts and the notion of beauty. It was to get rid of the junk, the accretions of time, to clear up the environment and see how it could be designed in a way that was not just functional but created a community.</p> <p>For the centenary, I would invite people to think that Bauhaus hasn\u2019t ended, to think about its architects and designers and what they might be doing today. Certainly not the work they did in the 20s. It\u2019s a style for the future; its lessons are to do with transformation of form \u2013 transformation of status and design to become socially important in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fe65ad6c49eaeefdc5d72da213438a432f72ef9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe65ad6c49eaeefdc5d72da213438a432f72ef9d/827_299_1266_1583/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Craig-Martin\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Michael Craig-Martin: \u2018It\u2019s only half joking to say that Ikea is the realisation of the Bauhaus dream\u2019</h2> <p><em>Artist and influential teacher of the YBA generation in the 1980s</em></p> <p>In a sense, the Bauhaus represents the 20th century \u2013 it defined our whole idea of what it is to be modern. What a radical idea it was for a school: this relationship between art and design, architecture, between furniture, graphics, painting, sculpture. Bauhaus tried to bring them all together and, in a true modernist sense, create a utopia. It\u2019s interesting that many of the things they designed were very difficult for them to actually produce. So much of what they did really only became available to people in the 50s and 60s when the techniques for fabrication made it possible \u2013 they were so ahead of their time that although these things were meant to be mass-produced, they were unable to at the time.</p> <p>I became particularly interested in the Bauhaus [when I was studying] at Yale because of Josef Albers, who taught there for 10 years. I was struck by Albers\u2019s very intelligent use of the visual. Sometimes people talk about the intellect and emotion as though the two are separate \u2013 it was very much a Bauhaus idea to bring them together. Everything they did was to maximise a kind of directness, economy, clarity. These are the things I see in my own work that I would trace directly back to Bauhaus ideas. And also the idea of the elevation of ordinary life, that it\u2019s worth taking seriously how an object looks, in order to make it efficient and at the same time beautiful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73987831674b26a3fbba12c4ea61747ae8bdc765\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73987831674b26a3fbba12c4ea61747ae8bdc765/0_0_5141_3427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detail of the staircase at Haus Feininger, one of the four surviving Meisterh\u00e4user in Dessau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail of the staircase at Haus Feininger, one of the four surviving Meisterh\u00e4user in Dessau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So I was carrying something of the Bauhaus with me when I started teaching at Goldsmiths. I think the idea that there is some kind of connectedness between these traditions of art schools is very touching. Albers always thought that when it came to what an artist did in the studio, the most important relationship was between artists and their work: the artist and their individual sense, and what it is that they produced through their own sensibility. That\u2019s something you see reflected in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/apr/30/yba-25-years-damien-hirst\" title=\"\">YBAs</a>.</p> <p>The way things are going, it could be that even in another 100 years people will still think of Bauhaus as representing the modern. It\u2019s only half-joking to say that Ikea is the realisation of the Bauhaus dream: good, simple design, available at very modest prices to everybody. Perhaps more today than in the immediate past, there\u2019s a conjunction between ideas in architecture, furniture design, art \u2013 the boundaries between different disciplines have softened a great deal. The things that the Bauhaus hit on and developed through the years went right to the heart of the design of things, the nature of things. They got it so accurately that it has never been truly displaced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7da6634e107227f8cc0d06490aa1a220f1e52a3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7da6634e107227f8cc0d06490aa1a220f1e52a3b/881_1249_1623_2028/800.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Foster\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Norman Foster: \u2018The lasting influence of Bauhaus is not stylistic, but the attitude of mind it cultivated\u2019</h2> <p><em>Prize-winning architect whose buildings include the Gherkin and the Reichstag</em></p> <p>Very often, inspiration arrives subliminally, lying hidden to be discovered many years later, or perhaps never. Other influences are more direct; we can acknowledge them at the time and see clearly the impression they leave on our lives. Working in Manchester from the age of 16 to 18, I spent most lunch breaks wandering around buildings in the city. I wasn\u2019t aware that some day I might be an architect. I was just drawn to buildings. Some buildings and parts of that city were particularly inspirational \u2013 the cast-iron structure of the Barton Arcade, the Victorian architecture of Manchester town hall, the modernism of the <em>Daily Express </em>building. There is another, more modest building which changed my life forever. This was my local lending library, built in 1903, in one of Manchester\u2019s working-class suburbs. There, as a youth, I discovered books by Le Corbusier and the work of other modern architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright as well as the Bauhaus. So I discovered Bauhaus through my local library before becoming a student at Manchester University. When I moved to Yale as a postgraduate, I was taught by Paul Rudolph, who had studied under Walter Gropius at Harvard, so for me there is a direct lineage.</p> <p>I have a passionate interest in the links between architecture, design and art, which were at the core of the Bauhaus philosophy. There is also my driving curiosity about how things are made, which is mirrored in the term \u201cBauhaus\u201d when it is taken in the sense of \u201cthe School of Building\u201d, which it was at the time.</p> <p>The Bauhaus was one of the birthplaces of the modern world. It provided a utopian vision and a forward-looking worldview. Gropius envisioned a time when buildings would be mass-produced in factories and their component parts assembled on site \u2013 he designed cars, trains and, with Konrad Wachsmann, experimented with modular systems for housing.</p> <p>As technology and materials have advanced, this thinking is even more relevant. From the beginning of my career, I have encouraged the use of prefabricated components and we have worked at the scale of prefabricating entire buildings. The potential for three-dimensionally printing a building is arguably an extension of the Bauhaus philosophy. I am particularly interested in how these methods could be used to improve the quality of life in some of the world\u2019s poorest communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f23d211f080574ea64ef39a876fa2575e642c080\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f23d211f080574ea64ef39a876fa2575e642c080/0_0_4950_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bauhaus director Walter Gropius\u2019s students poke fun at his minimalist design for living ideas in this 1927 photograph by Edward Curtis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bauhaus director Walter Gropius\u2019s students poke fun at his minimalist design for living ideas in this 1927 photograph by Edward Curtis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Hoppen Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I recently had the pleasure of visiting a work by the founder of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius \u2013 his house in Lincoln, Massachusetts. Gropius\u2019s tenure at Harvard was arguably a transformative force in contemporary American architecture and changed the face of Boston and nearby Cambridge with a new wave of modernism. His house, completed in 1942, is a fusion of the Bauhaus ideals and is a masterpiece.</p> <p>The lasting influence of Bauhaus is not stylistic, but the attitude of mind it cultivated. In fact, perhaps the worst thing about Bauhaus are the bad copies of design classics from that period \u2013 fashion over substance. Bauhaus at its best was a revolution in the relationship between arts and crafts, aesthetics and functions, conceiving and making.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ff0d9e9d99737a15d8e2fa5dbd96dbf68bbf006c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff0d9e9d99737a15d8e2fa5dbd96dbf68bbf006c/764_634_949_1186/800.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Howell\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.margarethowell.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Margaret Howell</a>: \u2018The practice of combining design with manufacturing was inspirational\u2019</h2> <p><em>Fashion designer with a minimalist clothing line using British materials</em></p> <p>Probably the Bauhaus had the biggest influence on me in my first year of art school. The coming together of different disciplines and the practice of combining design with manufacturing was inspirational, imaginative, experimental and, above all, a break with the past. Lucky were the students to have practising teachers such as Walter Gropius, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/sep/17/marcel-breuer-design-exhibition-france\" title=\"\">Marcel Breuer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/10/bauhaus-josef-anni-albers-art\" title=\"\">Josef Albers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/klee\" title=\"\">Paul Klee</a>.</p> <p>A wealth of black-and-white photographs exists that capture the energy and spirit of those students \u2013 they are alive with creativity. Often shot with unconventional angles, girls with short haircuts and casual clothes, the look and mood of these photographs inspired me when designing clothes. They embodied a style that reflects an active working life and an equality of outlook.</p> <p>I recently visited <a href=\"https://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/en/architecture/bauhaus-building.html\" title=\"\">the Bauhaus in Dessau</a> as it was being renovated. A heap of chrome, cantilever chairs sat outside; inside, there were empty studios, corridors and staircases in the process of being repainted white with areas of selected colour. It was exciting to see the building empty and to imagine the life and creativity that went on there. Posters of past exhibitions were lying in an open chest \u2013 bold graphics that still looked fresh. I bought a couple and now wish I had bought them all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e43f14859d9781feaec29ce32938f5d8ca4e1de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e43f14859d9781feaec29ce32938f5d8ca4e1de/1435_738_2139_2673/800.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Mawe\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Simon Mawer: \u2018Bauhaus was very much about internationalism\u2019</h2> <p><em>Author of the 2009 Booker prize-nominated novel of architecture The Glass Room</em></p> <p>I first visited Mies van der Rohe\u2019s <a href=\"https://franks-travelbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/tschechien-brno-brucc88nn-die-villa-tugendhat-in-brucc88nn-tschechien-ist-das-berucc88hmteste-bauwerk-der-moderne-daniel-fiser-cc-by-sa3-0-wiki.jpg\" title=\"\">Villa Tugendhat</a> in the Czech city of Brno in the 1990s. In those days it was very difficult to get into it as a tourist: the iron curtain had only just come down and the mentality hadn\u2019t. There was a slightly run-down air to it back then, but walking down the staircase into the living room was literally breathtaking \u2013 at least for me. I gasped. It was like walking into a work of art.</p> <p>That visit, and a second one 10 years later, made me think, \u201cThere\u2019s a novel here.\u201d Not the story of the family who actually lived there, but the story of my family, a family that I would eventually create in my novel <em>The Glass Room</em>.</p> <p>I love the aesthetic, but Bauhaus was also very much making a statement about internationalism. Of course, knowing the history, one knew how ghastly it was going to be in less than 20 years. To build something like Villa Tugendhat in 1928 in the centre of Europe was a wonderful symbol of light and breaking down barriers. And the world all around them was at that moment extinguishing light and building up barriers. So it became very much a source of inspiration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"72649ea8d0a316de661e0d6ef5ea7ad857a64a00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72649ea8d0a316de661e0d6ef5ea7ad857a64a00/861_53_1801_2250/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Barnbrook\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Jonathan Barnbrook: \u2018My work became a crusade against everything that was functional\u2019</h2> <p><em>British graphic designer and typographer best known for his work with David Bowie and Damien Hirst</em></p> <p>The Bauhaus has always dominated my design thinking. Initially, I was absolutely against everything it stood for. As you do when you\u2019re young, my work became a crusade against everything that was \u201cfunctional\u201d. I immersed myself in postmodernist theorists such as <a href=\"https://www.iep.utm.edu/lyotard/\" title=\"\">Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard</a> and playful design groups such as <a href=\"https://designmuseum.org/memphis\" title=\"\">Memphis</a>, creating layouts that were intentionally illegible and full of decoration for the sake of it.</p> <p>Then, as I got older, something happened. Tired of excess and decoration being used to sell the same old stuff, I started to do the opposite: strip everything down to the basic form, let an idea come through. I understood that within the framework of the Bauhaus there was still space for humanity \u2013 I had just chosen to ignore it when I was younger.</p> <p>The cover I designed for <a href=\"https://www.davidbowie.com/the-next-day/\" title=\"\">Bowie\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.davidbowie.com/the-next-day/\" title=\"\">The Next Day</a> </em>was probably the most extreme example of this newfound appreciation. A simple obscuring of an old cover with a white square, but something that caused argument and debate when it came out. </p> <p>The Bauhaus is as important to me now as it was when I first started. I retain the spirit that the world would be a very boring place if everything was well designed, but In a world where most things are badly designed, everybody should learn the theories of Bauhaus before they are allowed to touch a computer.</p> <p>As for the legacy, I do think that the most prominent expression we have nowadays is not in art schools or rarefied museums \u2013 it is Ikea. Furniture made with simple production methods that is accessible to all affordable and has a simple, clean aesthetic. I am pretty sure <a href=\"https://www.theartstory.org/artist-gropius-walter.htm\" title=\"\">Gropius</a> et al would be rather happy about that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6a5964c45208ee9c3a53728f5ba5aacb0a3c86f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5964c45208ee9c3a53728f5ba5aacb0a3c86f7/410_139_927_1158/801.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Grant\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Linda Grant: \u2018The city of Tel Aviv was a political metaphor\u2019</h2> <p><em>British novelist, journalist and writer fascinated by Bauhaus</em></p> <p>Twenty years ago, in 1998, I went to Tel Aviv to write an article for the <em>Guardian</em> on the 50th anniversary of the state of Israel. The place was very run-down in the late 1990s, before it was designated a Unesco world heritage site. At first I thought it was made up of a lot of decaying 60s buildings. Then, looking closer, I recognised the curved lines and clean, geometric shapes and realised the entire fabric of the city was Bauhaus. I discovered that the architects who had designed and built the city were refugees who had trained at the Bauhaus in Germany and fled from Nazi persecution in the 30s to what was then British Mandatory Palestine. Once there, they found such a huge demand for housing from others fleeing Europe that they built an entire Bauhaus city in less than a decade. I found that extraordinary and deeply moving. It seemed to me that the whole architecture of the city was a political metaphor, which was a jolt to the heart as well as the brain. I started wondering about the individuals who had financed and built the buildings, people fleeing for their lives and bringing with them the best of Europe to help them begin again in the supposedly backward Middle East. As well as previously unheard-of fitted kitchens, they created wonderful communal areas in their buildings, restaurants and nurseries, where people could share their lives. There was a heartbreaking idealism about it all.</p> <p>The trip inspired my book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/23/digestedread.johncrace\" title=\"\">When I Lived in Modern Times</a></em>, which is set in Tel Aviv in the 1940s.

He wrote: \u201cBauhaus got rid of the tasteless knick-knackery of the 19th century and streamlined design for the 20th century\u201d, which I really liked. Then, I only thought about it in terms of modern architecture rather than painting. What I like about it now is the radical, intellectual seriousness and commitment to art education. For my work, the Bauhaus was influential in the developement of modern art and modern thought. I\u2019m not into it as the hardcore root of modern abstractionism, but it was vital for the idea of looking as an intellectual pursuit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bff84402bc48ed81a4cbdf1d4166edb72c71106b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff84402bc48ed81a4cbdf1d4166edb72c71106b/0_0_3861_5398/715.jpg\" alt=\"A dancer from the Triadic Ballet, developed in 1922 by Bauhaus teacher Oskar Schlemmer, who also designed the costumes.\" width=\"715\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dancer from the Triadic Ballet, developed in 1922 by Bauhaus teacher Oskar Schlemmer, who also designed the costumes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I really like Marcel Breuer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2018/04/26/brutalist-marcel-breuer-pirelli-tire-building-new-haven-connecticut-hotel-ikea/\" title=\"\">Pirelli Tire Building in New Haven</a> and Naum Gabo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gabo-linear-construction-no-2-t01105\" title=\"\">Linear Construction No 2</a>, but one of my favourite Bauhaus paintings is by Oskar Schlemmer, <em><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80049i\" title=\"\">Bauhaus Stairway </a></em><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80049i\" title=\"\">(1932)</a>.

Bauhaus\u2019s legacy isn\u2019t set, though, its reputation has changed with art history revisionism in a good way.

It ran from February to April in 1983 and I went to see it 41 times. It was part of my inspiration to work in the arts and become a curator. It was a non-didactic attempt to create, as Szeemann said, \u201cpoems in space\u201d. That was, somehow, the moment that art became a passion, something more intense. I also visited the <a href=\"http://www.weissenhof2002.de/english/weissenhof.html\" title=\"\">Weissenhofsiedlung</a> in Stuttgart at that time. It\u2019s a housing estate conceived as an international showcase of what became the international style of modern architecture. It was built for an exhibition in 1927 and the 33 buildings include 63 living units designed by 17 architects. It made me want to curate architecture. I also took away the idea that while it\u2019s good to visit exhibitions, it\u2019s interesting to look at buildings. I would love to live in the Weissenhofsiedlung \u2013 what an experience that would be.</p> <p>The centenary is now, but which Bauhaus are you celebrating? As Eric Hobsbawm said, we need a protest against forgetting. It\u2019s important to celebrate its achievements, but it\u2019s also important, as the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/20/on-my-radar-alice-rawsthorn-cultural-highlights-maggie-nelson-irma-boom-jordan-wolfson-dobie-gray\" title=\"\">Alice Rawsthorn</a> points out in her extraordinary Instagram account, to paint a truer picture of the Bauhaus within the brutal and tragic politics of its time, to address the misogyny of the early years and the accusations of Nazi collusion in the later years. Although we have a mine of information in the digital age, that doesn\u2019t mean we remember more.

The Architectural Association, like the Bauhaus, is a place where daring, creative thinking and risk-taking are basic attitudes towards learning and making. Both schools aim to answer one simple, yet large, question: how do we want to live together?</p> <p>Answering this goes beyond studios, workshops and seminars and includes a creative life of talks, discussions, parties and events.

      "bodyText": "Daniel Libeskind: \u2018My professor was Bauhaus-taught, so I had the real thing\u2019 Polish-American architect best known for the Jewish Museum in Berlin I went to school in New York, to the Cooper Union, and many of my teachers were Bauhaus refugees. Prof Hannes Beckmann, for example, who taught me colour theory and design, was a Bauhaus-taught painter and photographer, and was teaching us from the notes of Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee. Can you believe it? He showed me their notes with the comments by these amazing artists on them. So I had the exact course that was taught at the Bauhaus and I learned the beauty and profundity of its ideas. Sometimes Beckmann would correct us using the words of Kandinsky, which I learned later reading his books. I think I was lucky to have been given an extended Bauhaus education through the refugees in New York. I would never have done what I do without that. Also, when I moved from Poland to Israel in the 1950s, Tel Aviv was a Bauhaus city, made by architects who came [from Germany] to Palestine and so that gave me a sense of the Bauhaus intellectually and in terms of city planning. It was beautiful living there; the ideas work perfectly. The city was low rise at that time, nothing more than four storeys high; buildings were raised above the ground to make way for car entry and they had little gardens. It was the ideal city, but cities grow and Tel Aviv today is very different. Bauhaus, at its core, is about understanding the world and its wonder. It\u2019s the fact that everything to do with design \u2013 from the small to the large to the horizon \u2013 is something beautiful and worthy of the word wonder. I think Bauhaus has a strong ethical and political dimension \u2013 it strives for equality. It was only later on that it became minimalist and reductivist in its ideas. The true, original Bauhaus was about the eternal human spirit. I think the Bauhaus has a global impact \u2013 in Russia, the United States, Japan \u2013 because of what it sought to do \u2013 to illuminate the world of design with powerful concepts and the notion of beauty. It was to get rid of the junk, the accretions of time, to clear up the environment and see how it could be designed in a way that was not just functional but created a community. For the centenary, I would invite people to think that Bauhaus hasn\u2019t ended, to think about its architects and designers and what they might be doing today. Certainly not the work they did in the 20s. It\u2019s a style for the future; its lessons are to do with transformation of form \u2013 transformation of status and design to become socially important in the world. Michael Craig-Martin: \u2018It\u2019s only half joking to say that Ikea is the realisation of the Bauhaus dream\u2019 Artist and influential teacher of the YBA generation in the 1980s In a sense, the Bauhaus represents the 20th century \u2013 it defined our whole idea of what it is to be modern. What a radical idea it was for a school: this relationship between art and design, architecture, between furniture, graphics, painting, sculpture. Bauhaus tried to bring them all together and, in a true modernist sense, create a utopia. It\u2019s interesting that many of the things they designed were very difficult for them to actually produce. So much of what they did really only became available to people in the 50s and 60s when the techniques for fabrication made it possible \u2013 they were so ahead of their time that although these things were meant to be mass-produced, they were unable to at the time. I became particularly interested in the Bauhaus [when I was studying] at Yale because of Josef Albers, who taught there for 10 years. I was struck by Albers\u2019s very intelligent use of the visual. Sometimes people talk about the intellect and emotion as though the two are separate \u2013 it was very much a Bauhaus idea to bring them together. Everything they did was to maximise a kind of directness, economy, clarity. These are the things I see in my own work that I would trace directly back to Bauhaus ideas. And also the idea of the elevation of ordinary life, that it\u2019s worth taking seriously how an object looks, in order to make it efficient and at the same time beautiful. So I was carrying something of the Bauhaus with me when I started teaching at Goldsmiths. I think the idea that there is some kind of connectedness between these traditions of art schools is very touching. Albers always thought that when it came to what an artist did in the studio, the most important relationship was between artists and their work: the artist and their individual sense, and what it is that they produced through their own sensibility. That\u2019s something you see reflected in the YBAs. The way things are going, it could be that even in another 100 years people will still think of Bauhaus as representing the modern. It\u2019s only half-joking to say that Ikea is the realisation of the Bauhaus dream: good, simple design, available at very modest prices to everybody. Perhaps more today than in the immediate past, there\u2019s a conjunction between ideas in architecture, furniture design, art \u2013 the boundaries between different disciplines have softened a great deal. The things that the Bauhaus hit on and developed through the years went right to the heart of the design of things, the nature of things. They got it so accurately that it has never been truly displaced. Norman Foster: \u2018The lasting influence of Bauhaus is not stylistic, but the attitude of mind it cultivated\u2019 Prize-winning architect whose buildings include the Gherkin and the Reichstag Very often, inspiration arrives subliminally, lying hidden to be discovered many years later, or perhaps never. Other influences are more direct; we can acknowledge them at the time and see clearly the impression they leave on our lives. Working in Manchester from the age of 16 to 18, I spent most lunch breaks wandering around buildings in the city. I wasn\u2019t aware that some day I might be an architect. I was just drawn to buildings. Some buildings and parts of that city were particularly inspirational \u2013 the cast-iron structure of the Barton Arcade, the Victorian architecture of Manchester town hall, the modernism of the Daily Express building. There is another, more modest building which changed my life forever. This was my local lending library, built in 1903, in one of Manchester\u2019s working-class suburbs. There, as a youth, I discovered books by Le Corbusier and the work of other modern architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright as well as the Bauhaus. So I discovered Bauhaus through my local library before becoming a student at Manchester University. When I moved to Yale as a postgraduate, I was taught by Paul Rudolph, who had studied under Walter Gropius at Harvard, so for me there is a direct lineage. I have a passionate interest in the links between architecture, design and art, which were at the core of the Bauhaus philosophy. There is also my driving curiosity about how things are made, which is mirrored in the term \u201cBauhaus\u201d when it is taken in the sense of \u201cthe School of Building\u201d, which it was at the time. The Bauhaus was one of the birthplaces of the modern world. It provided a utopian vision and a forward-looking worldview. Gropius envisioned a time when buildings would be mass-produced in factories and their component parts assembled on site \u2013 he designed cars, trains and, with Konrad Wachsmann, experimented with modular systems for housing. As technology and materials have advanced, this thinking is even more relevant. From the beginning of my career, I have encouraged the use of prefabricated components and we have worked at the scale of prefabricating entire buildings. The potential for three-dimensionally printing a building is arguably an extension of the Bauhaus philosophy. I am particularly interested in how these methods could be used to improve the quality of life in some of the world\u2019s poorest communities. I recently had the pleasure of visiting a work by the founder of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius \u2013 his house in Lincoln, Massachusetts. Gropius\u2019s tenure at Harvard was arguably a transformative force in contemporary American architecture and changed the face of Boston and nearby Cambridge with a new wave of modernism. His house, completed in 1942, is a fusion of the Bauhaus ideals and is a masterpiece. The lasting influence of Bauhaus is not stylistic, but the attitude of mind it cultivated. In fact, perhaps the worst thing about Bauhaus are the bad copies of design classics from that period \u2013 fashion over substance. Bauhaus at its best was a revolution in the relationship between arts and crafts, aesthetics and functions, conceiving and making. Margaret Howell: \u2018The practice of combining design with manufacturing was inspirational\u2019 Fashion designer with a minimalist clothing line using British materials Probably the Bauhaus had the biggest influence on me in my first year of art school. The coming together of different disciplines and the practice of combining design with manufacturing was inspirational, imaginative, experimental and, above all, a break with the past. Lucky were the students to have practising teachers such as Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Josef Albers and Paul Klee. A wealth of black-and-white photographs exists that capture the energy and spirit of those students \u2013 they are alive with creativity. Often shot with unconventional angles, girls with short haircuts and casual clothes, the look and mood of these photographs inspired me when designing clothes. They embodied a style that reflects an active working life and an equality of outlook. I recently visited the Bauhaus in Dessau as it was being renovated. A heap of chrome, cantilever chairs sat outside; inside, there were empty studios, corridors and staircases in the process of being repainted white with areas of selected colour. It was exciting to see the building empty and to imagine the life and creativity that went on there. Posters of past exhibitions were lying in an open chest \u2013 bold graphics that still looked fresh. I bought a couple and now wish I had bought them all. Simon Mawer: \u2018Bauhaus was very much about internationalism\u2019 Author of the 2009 Booker prize-nominated novel of architecture The Glass Room I first visited Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Villa Tugendhat in the Czech city of Brno in the 1990s. In those days it was very difficult to get into it as a tourist: the iron curtain had only just come down and the mentality hadn\u2019t. There was a slightly run-down air to it back then, but walking down the staircase into the living room was literally breathtaking \u2013 at least for me. I gasped. It was like walking into a work of art. That visit, and a second one 10 years later, made me think, \u201cThere\u2019s a novel here.\u201d Not the story of the family who actually lived there, but the story of my family, a family that I would eventually create in my novel The Glass Room. I love the aesthetic, but Bauhaus was also very much making a statement about internationalism. Of course, knowing the history, one knew how ghastly it was going to be in less than 20 years. To build something like Villa Tugendhat in 1928 in the centre of Europe was a wonderful symbol of light and breaking down barriers. And the world all around them was at that moment extinguishing light and building up barriers. So it became very much a source of inspiration. Jonathan Barnbrook: \u2018My work became a crusade against everything that was functional\u2019 British graphic designer and typographer best known for his work with David Bowie and Damien Hirst The Bauhaus has always dominated my design thinking. Initially, I was absolutely against everything it stood for. As you do when you\u2019re young, my work became a crusade against everything that was \u201cfunctional\u201d. I immersed myself in postmodernist theorists such as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard and playful design groups such as Memphis, creating layouts that were intentionally illegible and full of decoration for the sake of it. Then, as I got older, something happened. Tired of excess and decoration being used to sell the same old stuff, I started to do the opposite: strip everything down to the basic form, let an idea come through. I understood that within the framework of the Bauhaus there was still space for humanity \u2013 I had just chosen to ignore it when I was younger. The cover I designed for Bowie\u2019s The Next Day was probably the most extreme example of this newfound appreciation. A simple obscuring of an old cover with a white square, but something that caused argument and debate when it came out. The Bauhaus is as important to me now as it was when I first started. I retain the spirit that the world would be a very boring place if everything was well designed, but In a world where most things are badly designed, everybody should learn the theories of Bauhaus before they are allowed to touch a computer. As for the legacy, I do think that the most prominent expression we have nowadays is not in art schools or rarefied museums \u2013 it is Ikea. Furniture made with simple production methods that is accessible to all affordable and has a simple, clean aesthetic. I am pretty sure Gropius et al would be rather happy about that. Linda Grant: \u2018The city of Tel Aviv was a political metaphor\u2019 British novelist, journalist and writer fascinated by Bauhaus Twenty years ago, in 1998, I went to Tel Aviv to write an article for the Guardian on the 50th anniversary of the state of Israel. The place was very run-down in the late 1990s, before it was designated a Unesco world heritage site. At first I thought it was made up of a lot of decaying 60s buildings. Then, looking closer, I recognised the curved lines and clean, geometric shapes and realised the entire fabric of the city was Bauhaus. I discovered that the architects who had designed and built the city were refugees who had trained at the Bauhaus in Germany and fled from Nazi persecution in the 30s to what was then British Mandatory Palestine. Once there, they found such a huge demand for housing from others fleeing Europe that they built an entire Bauhaus city in less than a decade. I found that extraordinary and deeply moving. It seemed to me that the whole architecture of the city was a political metaphor, which was a jolt to the heart as well as the brain. I started wondering about the individuals who had financed and built the buildings, people fleeing for their lives and bringing with them the best of Europe to help them begin again in the supposedly backward Middle East. As well as previously unheard-of fitted kitchens, they created wonderful communal areas in their buildings, restaurants and nurseries, where people could share their lives. There was a heartbreaking idealism about it all. The trip inspired my book When I Lived in Modern Times, which is set in Tel Aviv in the 1940s. The fascination has stayed with me. My most recent book, The Dark Circle, is set in a sanatorium built by a German \u00e9migr\u00e9, so I am still creating fictional Bauhaus settings for my novels. Samuel Ross: \u2018The Bauhaus carved out a new dialogue across design theory and aesthetics\u2019 Designer of A-Cold-Wall* menswear label and the winner of the 2018 fashion award for British emerging menswear designer The Bauhaus school of thought has had much influence in shaping 20th-century architecture and, in turn, sculpting our individual interactions. I first encountered Bauhaus design aged 14, at an open day for my father\u2019s MA course at Central Saint Martins. I remember the faculty archive had a selection of Bauhaus-inspired objects \u2013 teapots, cups, objects of that nature. Now, my favourite work is Josef Albers\u2019s study into colour theory. Albers\u2019s art works and furniture live in the space between design and art. The Bauhaus\u2019s focus on multifaceted ideation and execution carved out a new dialogue across design theory and aesthetics that became the blueprint for my generation\u2019s newfound freedom. Designers, artists and sculptors who I believe embody this notion (more so in their philosophy and theory than their aesthetic) include Noirwave artist Rharha [Rochelle Nembhard], fashion designer Virgil Abloh, designer Jobe Burns, musician Petite Noir, furniture designer Dozie Kanu and the painter Reginald Sylvester II. It\u2019s the tone, physicality and voice of this generation. Dexter Dalwood: \u2018Yamamoto could never have created the Ziggy Stardust costumes without Oskar Schlemmer\u2019 British artist whose collages and painting have been exhibited at the Tate and Saatchi. He was a Turner prize nominee in 2010 and his next show is at Simon Lee Gallery in February My introduction to Bauhaus was at school, through The Story of Art by EH Gombrich. He wrote: \u201cBauhaus got rid of the tasteless knick-knackery of the 19th century and streamlined design for the 20th century\u201d, which I really liked. Then, I only thought about it in terms of modern architecture rather than painting. What I like about it now is the radical, intellectual seriousness and commitment to art education. For my work, the Bauhaus was influential in the developement of modern art and modern thought. I\u2019m not into it as the hardcore root of modern abstractionism, but it was vital for the idea of looking as an intellectual pursuit. I really like Marcel Breuer\u2019s Pirelli Tire Building in New Haven and Naum Gabo\u2019s Linear Construction No 2, but one of my favourite Bauhaus paintings is by Oskar Schlemmer, Bauhaus Stairway (1932). I love how wacky his designs were. Kansai Yamamoto would never have created the Ziggy Stardust costumes for David Bowie without Schlemmer. Bauhaus\u2019s legacy isn\u2019t set, though, its reputation has changed with art history revisionism in a good way. We\u2019re revising who the most important mid-century artists are, now that those who were famous are less respected. just look at Anni Albers at Tate Modern. It\u2019s good that it has endured; after all, as Keats said, \u201cA thing of beauty is a joy forever\u201d. Hans Ulrich Obrist: \u2018It\u2019s important to paint a truer picture of the Bauhaus within the brutal politics of its time\u2019 Swiss curator, critic and artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries, London When I was a teenager in Zurich, there was an exhibition called The Tendency Towards the Total Work of Art curated by Harald Szeemann. It ran from February to April in 1983 and I went to see it 41 times. It was part of my inspiration to work in the arts and become a curator. It was a non-didactic attempt to create, as Szeemann said, \u201cpoems in space\u201d. That was, somehow, the moment that art became a passion, something more intense. I also visited the Weissenhofsiedlung in Stuttgart at that time. It\u2019s a housing estate conceived as an international showcase of what became the international style of modern architecture. It was built for an exhibition in 1927 and the 33 buildings include 63 living units designed by 17 architects. It made me want to curate architecture. I also took away the idea that while it\u2019s good to visit exhibitions, it\u2019s interesting to look at buildings. I would love to live in the Weissenhofsiedlung \u2013 what an experience that would be. The centenary is now, but which Bauhaus are you celebrating? As Eric Hobsbawm said, we need a protest against forgetting. It\u2019s important to celebrate its achievements, but it\u2019s also important, as the writer Alice Rawsthorn points out in her extraordinary Instagram account, to paint a truer picture of the Bauhaus within the brutal and tragic politics of its time, to address the misogyny of the early years and the accusations of Nazi collusion in the later years. Although we have a mine of information in the digital age, that doesn\u2019t mean we remember more. I hope that we can focus on the more forgotten aspects of the school. Hannes Meyer, the school\u2019s second director, deserves wider recognition. He was very interested in collective architecture, and if you look at the architecture world now, there are so many collectives. Johannes Itten is better known, but there\u2019s such a current interest in technology and spirituality, revisiting him would be interesting. Lotte Stam-Beese and other women of the Bauhaus have not been remembered as they should. Stam-Beese was extraordinary \u2013 an urbanist, she planned whole cities in Ukraine and Holland. The Bauhaus was much more than a design school and, although it wasn\u2019t open long, it was during an intense moment of history and that intensity has resonated through the generations. Eva Franch i Gilabert: \u2018Both schools ask how do we want to live together?\u2019 Spanish architect and first permanent female director of the prestigious Architectural Association school in London The Bauhaus did in the early 20s what many schools and institutions are unable to do today: consider every single act of life as a space of design and creative action. Over the years, I\u2019ve organised many projects that resonated with the spirit of Bauhaus. The Architectural Association, like the Bauhaus, is a place where daring, creative thinking and risk-taking are basic attitudes towards learning and making. Both schools aim to answer one simple, yet large, question: how do we want to live together? Answering this goes beyond studios, workshops and seminars and includes a creative life of talks, discussions, parties and events. While the musician Andor Weininger created the \u201cfun department\u201d in the Bauhaus in the 20s, the AA today has its \u201cparty committee\u201d [to help] push the school community to explore, discuss and debate beyond boundaries. The Bauhaus dealt with issues of housing, affordability and global aesthetics; the AA today faces the same issues with an added set of complex challenges including sustainability, technology and inequality in a local but also in a global context. I hope that a renewed interest in the Bauhaus and its methods will inspire us all. We all need more rigour \u2013 and more fun. Willo Perron: \u2018It\u2019s the closest I know to an art and design utopia\u2019 Designer, founder of Willo Perron &amp; Associates design studio, who works as creative director for St Vincent, Drake and Kanye West Bauhaus is complete. It\u2019s the closest version I know of an art and design utopia, never negating any creative field. From architecture to theatre, dance to scenic design, costuming to typography, everything was built around a community and around the idea of sharing thoughts and information. There isn\u2019t a single piece of work that I could pick as a favourite; the idea I love about Bauhaus is the inclusiveness of all mediums. Amin Taha: \u2018Its legacy should be taught at all schools\u2019 Architect who worked with Zaha Hadid before setting up his own studio. Creator of the RIBA-award-winning 15 Clerkenwell Close The Bauhaus, for me, is characterised by its seminal Dessau period where modernism aligned with Walter Gropius\u2019s and Henry van der Velde\u2019s original plan to bring together art and technical colleges under William Morris\u2019s socialist and design ideals. The move to Dessau happened after the school was compelled for political reasons to leave Weimar, where it was seen as a hotbed of communists and it lost its funding. Dessau is where the Bauhaus became self-sufficient under the new head Hannes Meyer, by creating products and practising architecture in the town \u2013 including Dessau\u2019s iconic buildings. Nazi elections saw it evacuate to Berlin, but the capital was soon loyal to the party. The school\u2019s final head, Mies van der Rohe, called the students and tutors together and, over bottles of champagne, he told all to leave the country. Van der Rohe and others went to America, changing it and architecture for ever \u2013 leaving Tom Wolfe forlorn enough to write From Our House to Bauhaus. The legacy of the school\u2019s short but remarkable 14 years of existence is its liberal and plural teaching of determination to follow through and develop ideas. It\u2019s a legacy that should be taught at all schools, to all students and to practising architects.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Kermode, Observer film critic Best picture \u2013 my shortlist (my favourite first) \u2022 Leave No Trace \u2022 BlacKkKlansman \u2022 Cold War \u2022 If Beale Street Could Talk \u2022 You Were Never Really Here As always, several of the best films that played here in 2018 (Andrew K\u00f6tting\u2019s brilliant oddity Lek and the Dogs, L\u00e9onor Serraille\u2019s Jeune Femme) aren\u2019t among the 347 titles eligible at the 91st Oscars. Yet my favourite film is up for consideration, although it may well end up being overlooked \u2013 Debra Granik\u2019s quietly overwhelming Leave No Trace, a perfect example of \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d film-making. Best director \u2022 Debra Granik (Leave No Trace) \u2022 Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski (Cold War) \u2022 Steve McQueen (Widows) \u2022 Lynne Ramsay (You Were Never Really Here) \u2022 Spike Lee (BlacKkKlansman) The Oscars now allow up to 10 nominees in this category, and if our lists did too I\u2019d have included Widows in my best film selection. Instead, I\u2019ve opted to nominate its director, Steve McQueen, for his vibrant adaptation of Lynda La Plante\u2019s TV series. Lynne Ramsay\u2019s You Were Never Really Here is similarly poetic, while Debra Granik\u2019s Leave No Trace cements the promise of 2010\u2019s Winter\u2019s Bone. Best actor \u2022 Tomasz Kot (Cold War) \u2022 Ben Foster (Leave No Trace) \u2022 Stephan James (If Beale Street Could Talk) \u2022 Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody) \u2022 John David Washington (BlacKkKlansman) Tomasz Kot was Danny Boyle\u2019s choice for the next Bond villain, and it\u2019s easy to see why \u2013 his performance in Cold War blends charisma with vulnerability, subtlety and strength. John David Washington gets the balance between humour and horror just right in BlacKkKlansman, while Rami Malek is uncanny as Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. Best actress \u2022 Viola Davis (Widows) \u2022 Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie (Leave No Trace) \u2022 Yalitza Aparicio (Roma) \u2022 Olivia Colman (The Favourite) \u2022 KiKi Layne (If Beale Street Could Talk) An astonishing field this year, from Oscar hopefuls Glenn Close (The Wife) and Lady Gaga (A Star Is Born) to personal favourites such as Jessie Buckley (Beast), Joanna Kulig (Cold War), Keira Knightley (Colette) and Toni Collette (Hereditary). I\u2019d also include Yalitza Aparicio, who makes an amazingly natural debut in Roma, while Viola Davis is the lightning rod at the centre of Widows. Best supporting actor \u2022 Mahershala Ali (Green Book) \u2022 Adam Driver (BlacKkKlansman) \u2022 Richard E Grant (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) \u2022 Jason Isaacs (The Death of Stalin) \u2022 Tom Waits (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs) Mahershala Ali, an Oscar-winner for Moonlight, looks set to repeat that victory as pianist Dr Don Shirley in Peter Farrelly\u2019s Green Book. He and Viggo Mortensen make a marvellous double act in a film that rests squarely upon their shoulders. And it\u2019s great to see musician turned underrated actor Tom Waits excelling in the Coen brothers\u2019 western portmanteau. Best supporting actress \u2022 Regina King (If Beale Street Could Talk) \u2022 Salura And\u00f4 (Shoplifters) \u2022 Cynthia Erivo (Bad Times at the El Royale) \u2022 Michelle Rodriguez (Widows) \u2022 Millicent Simmonds (A Quiet Place) 2018 was a good year for Cynthia Erivo, who stole Bad Times at the El Royale and co-starred in Widows. Millicent Simmonds was dynamite in A Quiet Place. Honourable mentions to Jennifer Ehle (The Miseducation of Cameron Post), Rachel Weisz (The Favourite) and Claire Foy (First Man), but Regina King is hard to beat in If Beale Street Could Talk. Best score \u2022 Nicholas Britell (If Beale Street Could Talk) \u2022 Anna Meredith (Eighth Grade) \u2022 J\u00f3han J\u00f3hannsson (Mandy) \u2022 Terence Blanchard (BlacKkKlansman) \u2022 Justin Hurwitz (First Man) I\u2019d like to include Max Richter(Mary Queen of Scots), Jonny Greenwood (You Were Never Really Here) and Ludwig G\u00f6ransson (Black Panther), all worthy contenders. But Britell once again proves the perfect musical foil for Barry Jenkins\u2019s cinematic vision, with his superbly counterintuitive score for If Beale Street Could Talk. Wendy Ide, Observer film writer Best picture \u2013 my shortlist (favourite first) \u2022 Roma \u2022 The Favourite \u2022 You Were Never Really Here \u2022 Cold War \u2022 Leave No Trace With the big flashing neon caveat that the Academy voters almost always conspire to annoy me, I see cause for cautious optimism this year. There\u2019s a decent intersection between awards contenders and films that are rather good. But what thrills me is the very real possibility that the best picture prize might go to Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s masterly Roma, a Spanish-language film from Mexico. What a message that would send: cinema builds bridges, not walls. Best director \u2022 Lynne Ramsay (You Were Never Really Here) \u2022 Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Roma) \u2022 Debra Granik (Leave No Trace) \u2022 Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski (Cold War) \u2022 Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (The Rider) I was blown away by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s direction of The Rider \u2013 her deft blend of real-life and fiction excited me anew for the possibilities of hybrid cinema. But I would hand the statuette to Lynne Ramsay for You Were Never Really Here, a film that immerses us so thoroughly in the mind of her troubled protagonist that you almost fear you won\u2019t escape. Best actor \u2022 Jakob Cedergren (The Guilty) \u2022 Paul Giamatti (Private Life) \u2022 Ben Foster (Leave No Trace) \u2022 Daveed Diggs (Blindspotting) \u2022 Ethan Hawke (First Reformed) It\u2019s unlikely the Academy will even nominate Jakob Cedergren for Danish thriller The Guilty (although watch this space when Jake Gyllenhaal stars in the English remake). But he\u2019d get my vote because he is the film, which plays out almost entirely in his face. While the voters tend to favour impersonations, Cedergren not only creates his character, he forges our journey through the story. Best actress \u2022 Olivia Colman (The Favourite) \u2022 Melissa McCarthy (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) \u2022 Joanna Kulig (Cold War) \u2022 Viola Davis (Widows) \u2022 Julia Roberts (Ben Is Back) I could have filled this list three times over, such was the quality of female lead performances this year. Joanna Kulig\u2019s magnetic turn in Cold War burns phosphorus bright. Julia Roberts, every fibre tense with hope as the mother of an addict in Ben Is Back, has been curiously overlooked. But Olivia Colman gets the crown this year for The Favourite and a performance effortlessly ranging from riotous comedy to aching pathos. Best supporting actor \u2022 Daniel Kaluuya (Widows) \u2022 Richard E Grant (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) \u2022 Simon Russell Beale (The Death of Stalin) \u2022 Mamoudou Athie (The Front Runner) \u2022 Tom Waits (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs) The supporting performances are often where we discover the talents of the future \u2013 and I would hazard a guess that Mamoudou Athie, so quietly impressive in The Front Runner, is one such name. But I would hand the prize to the always impressive Daniel Kaluuya for a forceful, fearsome performance which chilled me to the core in Widows. Best supporting actress \u2022 Zoe Kazan (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs) \u2022 Rachel Weisz (The Favourite) \u2022 Claire Foy (First Man) \u2022 Elizabeth Debicki (Widows) \u2022 Letitia Wright (Black Panther) I loved Letitia Wright in Black Panther \u2013 it was a scene-stealing, irreverent turn full of zest and mischief. And the malevolent charm of Rachel Weisz in The Favourite is hard to resist. But my choice for supporting actress would be Zoe Kazan, who crammed a whole feature\u2019s worth of gauche, cautious dreams into a perfectly crafted short segment in the Coens\u2019 The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Best foreign language film \u2022 Cold War (Poland) \u2022 Roma (Mexico) \u2022 Birds of Passage (Colombia) \u2022 The Guilty (Denmark) \u2022 Burning (South Korea) Since I have already handed out best picture to Roma in my fantasy film awards, I\u2019ll spread the love and award best foreign language film to another intensely personal period piece shot in black and white. I adored the elegance and economy of Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s Cold War \u2013 there is not a frame in the film that seems wasted. The exquisite cinematography is a crystalline miracle; the performances superb throughout. Simran Hans, Observer film writer Best picture \u2013 my shortlist (favourite first) \u2022 A Star Is Born \u2022 Leave No Trace \u2022 First Reformed \u2022 The Rider \u2022 Sorry to Bother You Either the Academy Awards are cursed, or I am. If I deem a film my secret winner, it will be fated to lose (my previous upsets include Phantom Thread (2017), Selma (2014), The Social Network (2010) and Brokeback Mountain (2005), but I\u2019m hoping A Star Is Born breaks the spell. It\u2019s a big, ballsy, crowd-pleasing melodrama; old-fashioned, serious, designed to provoke an emotional reaction \u2013 it\u2019s Oscar bait. Best director \u2022 Debra Granik (Leave No Trace) \u2022 Marielle Heller (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) \u2022 Sandi Tan (Shirkers) \u2022 Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (The Rider) \u2022 Lynne Ramsay (You Were Never Really Here) Judging by the Academy\u2019s track record, we\u2019ll be lucky if even one woman receives a best director nomination. Still, precedent aside, I see no reason why there shouldn\u2019t be an all-female shortlist. All five of the above display fierce assurance, authority and originality of vision, and none more than Granik, whose exquisite mystery-thriller has the rare confidence to show its story rather than tell. Best actor \u2022 Brady Jandreau (The Rider) \u2022 Stephan James (If Beale Street Could Talk) \u2022 Ethan Hawke (First Reformed) \u2022 Joaquin Phoenix (You Were Never Really Here) \u2022 Lakeith Stanfield (Sorry to Bother You) A cowboy grapples with his identity following a serious trauma? The story of Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s innovative real-life/fiction blend could make it an \u201cOscar\u201d film. Zhao turns non-professional actor Brady Jandreau into a movie star; if she\u2019s the magician, he\u2019s the trick worth applauding. The transformation is subtle but precise; sadly the Academy usually rewards the opposite. Best actress \u2022 Olivia Colman (The Favourite) \u2022 Lady Gaga (A Star Is Born) \u2022 Regina Hall (Support the Girls) \u2022 Helena Howard (Madeline\u2019s Madeline) \u2022 Elsie Fisher (Eighth Grade) I loved Regina Hall\u2019s fraying optimism as the beleaguered manager of a sports bar; Elsie Fisher\u2019s awkward wannabe YouTuber Kayla in Eighth Grade, Helena Howard\u2019s performance artist with mental health issues in Madeline\u2019s Madeline, that a pop star could make me believe she waited tables in A Star Is Born. Best of all, though, is Olivia Colman\u2019s hilarious turn as a selfish, ribald, grumbling Queen Anne. Best supporting actor \u2022 Richard E Grant (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) \u2022 Adam Driver (BlacKkKlansman) \u2022 Daniel Kaluuya (Widows) \u2022 Alessandro Nivola (Disobedience) \u2022 Steven Yeun (Burning) Worryingly, I found myself racking my brains to come up with five memorable supporting performances from men this year. Then I remembered Richard E Grant, whose witty turn as the prankish accomplice to writer Lee Israel in Marielle Heller\u2019s Can You Ever Forgive Me? threatens to to steal the show from Melissa McCarthy\u2019s fraudster. Optimistic to hope that the Academy will agree. Best supporting actress \u2022 Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie (Leave No Trace) \u2022 Regina King (If Beale Street Could Talk) \u2022 Cynthia Erivo (Bad Times at the El Royale) \u2022 Rachel Weisz (The Favourite) \u2022 Elizabeth Debicki (Widows) It seems unfair to put McKenzie in this category \u2013 her role in Debra Granik\u2019s two-hander is more like a lead. Granik\u2019s Winter\u2019s Bone was Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s breakout role and she provides similar conditions for the 18-year-old New Zealander to shine. Her performance (inquiring, liquid eyes, soft-spoken intelligence) remain lodged in my brain. Best original song \u2022 Shallow (A Star Is Born) \u2022 When A Cowboy Trades His Spurs For Wings (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs) \u2022 Treasure (Beautiful Boy) \u2022 Girl in the Movies (Dumplin\u2019) \u2022 Suspirium (Suspiria) There hasn\u2019t been a contender of Shallow\u2019s calibre in this category in decades. The soaring power ballad is a proper pop song \u2013 and a proper earworm \u2013 written by a proper songwriter, plus at least half of it is sung by a proper pop star. With time I\u2019ve no doubt Gaga\u2019s hallowed warble will become as iconic as the flute that opens Celine Dion\u2019s 1999 winner, My Heart Will Go On. Guy Lodge, Observer film writer Best picture \u2013 my shortlist (favourite first) \u2022 Zama \u2022 Leave No Trace \u2022 If Beale Street Could Talk \u2022 Vox Lux \u2022 You Were Never Really Here It looks increasingly likely that history will be made at the Oscars this year, with Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s gorgeous Mexico City memory piece Roma becoming the first non-English-language film ever to win the best picture prize. After 91 years, it\u2019s an embarrassment it hasn\u2019t happened already. So I\u2019ll be cheering if it does, but a different Spanish-language film, Lucrecia Martel\u2019s fevered, ingenious, no-chance-in-hell colonial nightmare Zama, takes my top vote. Best director \u2022 Lynne Ramsay (You Were Never Really Here) \u2022 Lee Chang-dong (Burning) \u2022 Debra Granik (Leave No Trace) \u2022 Lucrecia Martel (Zama) \u2022 Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (The Rider) After Greta Gerwig\u2019s Oscar run with Lady Bird, the odds suggest we\u2019re back to the status quo of an all-male best director race \u2013 despite a wealth of exciting options from established and up-and-coming female auteurs. Chlo\u00e9 Zhao won best film from the National Society of Film Critics, while Debra Granik took best director from the LA Film Critics Association: there\u2019s no excuse for them to be frozen out. Best actor \u2022 Yoo Ah-in (Burning) \u2022 Joaquin Phoenix (You Were Never Really Here) \u2022 Zain Al-Rafeea (Capernaum) \u2022 Bradley Cooper (A Star Is Born) \u2022 Matthieu Lucci (The Workshop) Rami Malek\u2019s Freddie Mercury impression undeservedly won the Globe, but I suspect Bradley Cooper\u2019s portrayal of an emotionally ravaged rock star will take the Oscar \u2013 on the strength of the performance and as a reward for his achievement in writing, directing and producing A Star Is Born. I\u2019d be happy with that, but Korean star Yoo Ah-in gave the year\u2019s most complex, mystery-riven male performance. Best actress \u2022 Toni Collette (Hereditary) \u2022 Juliette Binoche (Let the Sunshine In) \u2022 Olivia Colman (The Favourite) \u2022 Regina Hall (Support the Girls) \u2022 Ruth Wilson (The Little Stranger) It may be cold comfort in the face of a woman-free best director lineup, but at least there\u2019s broad agreement that this year\u2019s best actress field is infinitely deeper and richer than its male counterpart. I struggled to pick a winner: Olivia Colman\u2019s astonishing tragicomic Queen Anne has many critics\u2019 vote, but Toni Collette was ferocious and emotionally wrenching in a genre \u2013 horror \u2013 that Oscar voters rarely touch. Best supporting actor \u2022 Brian Tyree Henry (If Beale Street Could Talk) \u2022 Daniel Kaluuya (Widows) \u2022 Alex Wolff (Hereditary) \u2022 Michael B Jordan (Black Panther) \u2022 Hugh Grant (Paddington 2) The Academy will avoid the #OscarsSoWhite trap this year with BlacKkKlansman, Black Panther and If Beale Street Could Talk all in the best picture frame. Mahershala Ali is widely tipped to take this prize again for elevating the civil rights drama Green Book, but it should be Henry\u2019s turn: with stunning work in Beale Street, Widows and TV\u2019s Atlanta, he was one of 2018\u2019s hardest-working actors. Best supporting actress \u2022 Dolly Wells (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) \u2022 Sakura Ando (Shoplifters) \u2022 Nina Arianda (Stan &amp; Ollie) \u2022 Elizabeth Debicki (Widows) \u2022 Jennifer Garner (Love, Simon) Add Marielle Heller\u2019s wry, lovely literary biopic Can You Ever Forgive Me? to the list of female-directed films that have received less than their due this season \u2013 though Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant are set to score Oscar nominations for their work (both came close to my ballot).Yet my favourite performance in the film, Dolly Wells\u2019s subtle study in bookish loneliness, has gone entirely uncelebrated. Best cinematography \u2022 Bradford Young (Where Is Kyra?) \u2022 Rui Pocas (Zama) \u2022 \u0141ukasz \u017bal (Cold War) \u2022 James Laxton (If Beale Street Could Talk) \u2022 Warwick Thornton (Sweet Country) If you haven\u2019t heard of Where Is Kyra? don\u2019t blame yourself. Andrew Dosunmu\u2019s striking poverty-line drama, featuring Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s best performance in aeons, took long enough to reach US screens; it\u2019s still awaiting a UK distributor. Here\u2019s hoping we eventually get to see Bradford Young\u2019s ingenious games of light and shadow on a big screen here.",

      "body": "<p>The Bauhaus, simply put, was a German school of art and design that opened in 1919 and closed in 1933. It was also very much more than that.

The name has become an adjective as well as a noun \u2013 Bauhaus style, Bauhaus look.

So (with greater or lesser degrees of bastardisation) do buildings without number around the world, countless domestic objects, road signs, the lettering on a tube of toothpaste or the design of a car.

It is perhaps these ambient feelings of dread that have sent me for solace, again and again, to a video of an American university student doing a gymnastics floor routine. The two-minute clip of 21-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/18/katelyn-ohashis-perfect-10-reminded-america-life-could-be-fun-again-gymmastics\" title=\"\">Katelyn Ohashi tumbling, flipping and pretzeling to cheesy, nightclub staples </a>has had more than 60 million views this week. It\u2019s a blast of concentrated positivity and good vibes that is the time-poor equivalent of days spent under a Sad lamp.</p> <p>Analysis has already been done on why the world has fallen so hard for the diminutive Ohashi. And the story is a heartwarming one. Ohashi was a junior star \u2013 winning four golds at the US nationals aged 14, then beating Simone Biles two years later \u2013 but lost her passion for gymnastics. She was injured and put on weight. \u201cI hated myself,\u201d she admitted last year. \u201cI was broken.\u201d A perfect-10 routine is a thing of beauty any time, but it means even more for someone who was written off when she was still a teenager.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/18/katelyn-ohashis-perfect-10-reminded-america-life-could-be-fun-again-gymmastics\">Katelyn Ohashi's perfect 10 reminded America life could be fun again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But many millions of us did not watch Ohashi for her agility and nailed landings. People who know gymnastics will tell you that her moves were amazing, but not outrageous. We watched because she was smiling. Beaming with unfakeable joy, her curls swishing around her face. She was simply having fun, showing off in the best way. Biles can keep her four Olympic golds. Then, when the scoreboard goes up, she shares the moment with her UCLA teammates, who have been mirroring her dance moves from the sidelines, and seem almost as deliriously happy as she is.</p> <p>Smiling does not really have a place in professional sport.

      "bodyText": "Between Brexit and Blue Monday \u2013 the most depressing day of the year, aka this Monday\u2013 it\u2019s not always been easy of late to sustain the self-satisfied, privileged-white-male grin that greets you in my byline picture. It is perhaps these ambient feelings of dread that have sent me for solace, again and again, to a video of an American university student doing a gymnastics floor routine. The two-minute clip of 21-year-old Katelyn Ohashi tumbling, flipping and pretzeling to cheesy, nightclub staples has had more than 60 million views this week. It\u2019s a blast of concentrated positivity and good vibes that is the time-poor equivalent of days spent under a Sad lamp. Analysis has already been done on why the world has fallen so hard for the diminutive Ohashi. And the story is a heartwarming one. Ohashi was a junior star \u2013 winning four golds at the US nationals aged 14, then beating Simone Biles two years later \u2013 but lost her passion for gymnastics. She was injured and put on weight. \u201cI hated myself,\u201d she admitted last year. \u201cI was broken.\u201d A perfect-10 routine is a thing of beauty any time, but it means even more for someone who was written off when she was still a teenager. But many millions of us did not watch Ohashi for her agility and nailed landings. People who know gymnastics will tell you that her moves were amazing, but not outrageous. We watched because she was smiling. Beaming with unfakeable joy, her curls swishing around her face. She was simply having fun, showing off in the best way. Biles can keep her four Olympic golds. Then, when the scoreboard goes up, she shares the moment with her UCLA teammates, who have been mirroring her dance moves from the sidelines, and seem almost as deliriously happy as she is. Smiling does not really have a place in professional sport. It is a sign of weakness, or at least a lack of focus or concentration. That\u2019s why we talk about a \u201cgame face\u201d: noun, a facial expression that suggests a strong determination to succeed. In his playing career, John McEnroe was often asked why he always had a perpetual scowl on court and he was bemused by the question. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way, I don\u2019t care if I don\u2019t smile on court,\u201d he replied in the late 1970s. \u201cI make faces.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.dhhliteraryagency.com/luke-turner.html\" title=\"\">Luke Turner</a>\u2019s memoir begins, his relationship of five years has just ended. He\u2019s unhappy in all the usual ways about this, not least because it has effectively left him homeless. But the break-up is also a reverberation: a sadness that loops back to other hurts and fissures in his life in a way that fills him with fear for his emotional future. What is needed, at least in the short term, is a means of soothing himself, and so it is that he sets out to explore <a href=\"http://www.visiteppingforest.org/\" title=\"\">Epping Forest</a>, on the eastern edge of London, a place he has known since childhood. Nature, he understands, is both a calmer of nerves \u2013 all that dappled light and frothing greenery \u2013 and a realm in which a person might find a sense of perspective. Oblivious to our woes, it reminds us of our tiny place in the scheme of things, and thus makes us stronger, more easeful. Like the seasons, all things pass in the end.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the surprise: in its depths, he finds no peace. Even as Turner is fascinated by Epping, his mind unravels, anxiety and loneliness his closest companions. The forest is a place of \u201cvulgar chaos\u201d, its pollarded trees quite grotesque; at moments, the ancient trunks seem to be moving, \u201cboiling up out of the ground like lava\u201d. He visits at night, wondering (bizarrely) if this will help, but things only darken, the grim stories he has read of its history causing his mind to \u201cslip\u201d. A thrush sounds \u201cderanged\u201d. A muntjac deer peers at him from beneath \u201ctiny devil horns\u201d. He breathes in, not fresh air, but so much \u201cmuck\u201d. You would think him a boy in a particularly malevolent fairytale were it not for his regular, and somewhat bathetic, references to his other constant companion, his trusty mobile phone.</p> <p>Why is he so unhappy? Why does his mind resist the balm that has worked for so many others? Bit by bit, we find out. Turner, who is bisexual, has long struggled \u201cagainst the binary rules of heteronormative love\u201d, and thanks to experiences in his childhood, he is also prey to \u201chardwired\u201d sexual compulsions: \u201crisky sex\u201d is a part of him. He finds it difficult to form long-lasting relationships, and is frequently worn out by the nagging weight of these desires, their endless itch. Such impulses \u2013 the most insignificant trigger can set the \u201csourness\u201d coursing through his body \u2013 are the opposite of liberation. Afterwards, he sinks into self-hatred, \u201crotten with emptiness and disgust\u201d. This has nothing to do with sin, for all that he is the son of a Methodist minister. Casual sex is not, for him, cold because of \u201cthe gaze of holy judgment\u201d. Rather, it is because when he looks in the mirror, he sees only an \u201cicy ghost\u201d staring back.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The feeling grows that he doesn\u2019t know where his narrative is going, or precisely what it is that he wants to say</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this cultural moment, it comes as something of a relief to read a book that is nuanced about what we might loosely term bad sexual behaviour. If Turner regards himself as a victim of abuse \u2013 his second sexual experience, with a much older man, took place in a public lavatory when he was just 14 \u2013 he is also brave enough, or honest enough, to want to explore the role played by his nascent desires in what happened to him (\u201cI had wanted it,\u201d he writes). Even in the grip of his compulsions, his body, lusted after by men he meets on the internet, makes him feel powerful. In what he calls \u201cfurtive queer worlds\u201d, he finds sexual agency, something he writes about with bracing frankness.</p> <p>And he\u2019s engaging on religious faith, too. As I read, I assumed that he would, with utmost predictability, come to reject his family\u2019s devout Methodism (his mother spoke in tongues when he was a boy). But no. His love for churches and hymns and what he regards as his parents\u2019 exceptional grace is abiding. Methodism is, for him, countercultural \u2013 a radical, inclusive force for good \u2013 and he won\u2019t allow what it once taught him about sin to make him blind to this.</p> <p>Set against these things, however, are his book\u2019s flaws, which are not small, and which made me wonder about some of the lavish advance praise <em>Out of the Woods</em> has received. Turner\u2019s obvious sincerity is surely no excuse either for the badness of some of his sentences (\u201cMy detachment from naive ideas of countryside as a place of sylvan respite and the romantic pastoral versus an embrace of the urban was rather wonderfully reflected in Bruce Robinson\u2019s homoerotic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/withnail-and-i-review\" title=\"\"><em>Withnail and I</em>,</a>\u201d he writes at one point), or their undergraduate earnestness. There is, to take one example, something wearying about the way that he uses the word \u201cgender\u201d as a verb. I don\u2019t only mean that it is unpoetic to the point of ugliness; in context, it\u2019s facile, too. Nor should his emotional turmoil be allowed to exonerate him from the charge that his book often feels so contingent, even haphazard. It is, for instance, not at all clear which of the many forest excursions he describes were made only in the service of writing his memoir (several, I think), and as a result, the feeling grows that he doesn\u2019t know where his narrative is going, or precisely what it is that he wants to say.</p> <p>Above all, it\u2019s not enough for a writer, having revealed that they Googled something on the spot (as he does the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/aug/17/top-10-outdoor-activity-berlin\" title=\"\">Teufelsberg</a>, a hill in another forest he visits, the Grunewald in Berlin), then to repeat, seemingly almost verbatim, what they found online. This hasn\u2019t only to do with laziness, or even with the appearance of laziness. It\u2019s to do with the breaking of a spell. More than once Turner would almost have me in his grasp, only to lose me entirely with something just like this. At these moments, his book would seem so put together: a mere assemblage of parts where there should have been a living, breathing, unified whole. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Out of the Woods </em>by Luke Turner is published by W&amp;N (\u00a316.99).

If Turner regards himself as a victim of abuse \u2013 his second sexual experience, with a much older man, took place in a public lavatory when he was just 14 \u2013 he is also brave enough, or honest enough, to want to explore the role played by his nascent desires in what happened to him (\u201cI had wanted it,\u201d he writes). Even in the grip of his compulsions, his body, lusted after by men he meets on the internet, makes him feel powerful. In what he calls \u201cfurtive queer worlds\u201d, he finds sexual agency, something he writes about with bracing frankness. And he\u2019s engaging on religious faith, too. As I read, I assumed that he would, with utmost predictability, come to reject his family\u2019s devout Methodism (his mother spoke in tongues when he was a boy). But no. His love for churches and hymns and what he regards as his parents\u2019 exceptional grace is abiding. Methodism is, for him, countercultural \u2013 a radical, inclusive force for good \u2013 and he won\u2019t allow what it once taught him about sin to make him blind to this. Set against these things, however, are his book\u2019s flaws, which are not small, and which made me wonder about some of the lavish advance praise Out of the Woods has received. Turner\u2019s obvious sincerity is surely no excuse either for the badness of some of his sentences (\u201cMy detachment from naive ideas of countryside as a place of sylvan respite and the romantic pastoral versus an embrace of the urban was rather wonderfully reflected in Bruce Robinson\u2019s homoerotic Withnail and I,\u201d he writes at one point), or their undergraduate earnestness. There is, to take one example, something wearying about the way that he uses the word \u201cgender\u201d as a verb. I don\u2019t only mean that it is unpoetic to the point of ugliness; in context, it\u2019s facile, too. Nor should his emotional turmoil be allowed to exonerate him from the charge that his book often feels so contingent, even haphazard. It is, for instance, not at all clear which of the many forest excursions he describes were made only in the service of writing his memoir (several, I think), and as a result, the feeling grows that he doesn\u2019t know where his narrative is going, or precisely what it is that he wants to say. Above all, it\u2019s not enough for a writer, having revealed that they Googled something on the spot (as he does the Teufelsberg, a hill in another forest he visits, the Grunewald in Berlin), then to repeat, seemingly almost verbatim, what they found online. This hasn\u2019t only to do with laziness, or even with the appearance of laziness. It\u2019s to do with the breaking of a spell. More than once Turner would almost have me in his grasp, only to lose me entirely with something just like this. At these moments, his book would seem so put together: a mere assemblage of parts where there should have been a living, breathing, unified whole. \u2022 Out of the Woods by Luke Turner is published by W&amp;N (\u00a316.99).

Two of Labour\u2019s biggest target seats are in Edinburgh, held narrowly by the people\u2019s vote-backing SNP. Andrew Wilson, the chair of Edinburgh Labour Students, is coordinating the demo there. \u201cJeremy Corbyn has a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can enable a Tory Brexit or back a public vote. If he allows any form of Tory Brexit to pass, he could lose the young, and could lose Scotland for good.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to enabling the Tories, the Liberal Democrats might serve as a cautionary tale for Corbyn. They won 53 seats in 2010 as Nick Clegg\u2019s popularity surged among younger voters in the run-up to the election. But almost immediately after entering government, Clegg reneged on his promise not to raise tuition fees \u2013 and his party has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/12/nick-clegg-university-tuition-fees-norman-lamb\" title=\"\">not yet recovered </a>from the effects of his decision.</p> <p>In an open letter to Corbyn, another Labour activist, Cathleen Clarke, who joined the party to back Corbyn in the second leadership race and has campaigned for him in Plymouth, where Labour has recently made gains, said: \u201cIf you can\u2019t agree with the arguments, at least appreciate the numbers. The large majority of Labour members want a public vote, with 88% saying they would vote to stay in the EU if there was a public vote.\u201d Imagine the proportion of young Labour members who want to stay \u2013 90, 95%?</p> <p>\u201cYoung people are the generation most in favour of a public vote, and most desperate to stay. Of the 1.6 million young people who have joined the electorate since 2016, who say they are certain to vote in a future EU referendum, 87% would vote to stay in the EU.</p> <p>\u201cWe beat the expectations of the establishment in 2017 because they didn\u2019t pick up my generation\u2019s appetite and enthusiasm for change. Fed up of being beaten down and beaten on, you gave us hope of a better tomorrow. We achieved historic victories in Canterbury, Bristol, Leeds, Sheffield, and Brighton. Yes, we voted for a manifesto that said we would deliver Brexit, and many of us didn\u2019t oppose that then. But that was when a better Brexit deal was possible, and two years before exit day.</p> <p>She added: \u201cTheresa May is wrong: things have changed. The choice the prime minister thinks she has left us with is her awful deal, or a slightly amended version of it, or no deal. Both of these options sell out our future and must be rejected.</p> <p>\u201cWe must resort to our own backstop we created at Labour party conference \u2013 a public vote.\u201d</p>",

More young activists were out demonstrating in areas including Bristol, Leicester, Warwick, York and Edinburgh. Two of Labour\u2019s biggest target seats are in Edinburgh, held narrowly by the people\u2019s vote-backing SNP. Andrew Wilson, the chair of Edinburgh Labour Students, is coordinating the demo there. \u201cJeremy Corbyn has a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can enable a Tory Brexit or back a public vote. If he allows any form of Tory Brexit to pass, he could lose the young, and could lose Scotland for good.\u201d When it comes to enabling the Tories, the Liberal Democrats might serve as a cautionary tale for Corbyn. They won 53 seats in 2010 as Nick Clegg\u2019s popularity surged among younger voters in the run-up to the election. But almost immediately after entering government, Clegg reneged on his promise not to raise tuition fees \u2013 and his party has not yet recovered from the effects of his decision. In an open letter to Corbyn, another Labour activist, Cathleen Clarke, who joined the party to back Corbyn in the second leadership race and has campaigned for him in Plymouth, where Labour has recently made gains, said: \u201cIf you can\u2019t agree with the arguments, at least appreciate the numbers. The large majority of Labour members want a public vote, with 88% saying they would vote to stay in the EU if there was a public vote.\u201d Imagine the proportion of young Labour members who want to stay \u2013 90, 95%? \u201cYoung people are the generation most in favour of a public vote, and most desperate to stay. Of the 1.6 million young people who have joined the electorate since 2016, who say they are certain to vote in a future EU referendum, 87% would vote to stay in the EU. \u201cWe beat the expectations of the establishment in 2017 because they didn\u2019t pick up my generation\u2019s appetite and enthusiasm for change. Fed up of being beaten down and beaten on, you gave us hope of a better tomorrow. We achieved historic victories in Canterbury, Bristol, Leeds, Sheffield, and Brighton. Yes, we voted for a manifesto that said we would deliver Brexit, and many of us didn\u2019t oppose that then. But that was when a better Brexit deal was possible, and two years before exit day. She added: \u201cTheresa May is wrong: things have changed. The choice the prime minister thinks she has left us with is her awful deal, or a slightly amended version of it, or no deal. Both of these options sell out our future and must be rejected. \u201cWe must resort to our own backstop we created at Labour party conference \u2013 a public vote.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The people who used to work with Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson tell a story about the former England manager, going back to the European Championship in 2004, when he did something that was totally out of character. He almost lost his temper.</p> <p>England had just been knocked out by Portugal. Inside the dressing room was a scene of desolation and the Football Association\u2019s staff saw something in his face that day they had never seen before: fury. A bad refereeing decision had denied Sol Campbell a late winner and Eriksson wanted to know where the official was. He was puce with anger. He left the dressing room to rap on the referee\u2019s door and, when it swung open, there were a few interminable moments when nobody could quite be sure how far he was willing to take it. At which point Sven, once again, reverted to being Sven. \u201cMr referee,\u201d he said, holding out his hand. \u201cI wanted to say thank you for a good game.\u201d</p> <p>It is a great story, classic Sven, and probably a reminder to all of us that, once you reach a certain point of your life, it is difficult to switch personalities, to adjust to new settings and, in Eriksson\u2019s case, reinvent himself as a shouter. Of course, people can change. It just does not tend to happen \u2013 unless, of course, that person actually wants to change.</p> <p>More fool me, then, for wondering whether Jos\u00e9 Mourinho might have emerged from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/18/jose-mourinho-exits-old-trafford-manchester-united-sack-manager\" title=\"\">breakdown of his Manchester United reign</a> with even a shade more humility. It was only a passing thought but I must confess I was foolish enough to wonder if he might understand the old saying that you learn the most from failure. Would we see a more soft-focus Mourinho? Better and humbler for the experience?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/17/jose-mourinho-rejects-criticism-of-manchester-united-tenure\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho says Manchester United not ready for modern football</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The answer should probably have come as no surprise and was delivered in that television interview, as a pundit at the Asian Cup, when all the good points he made about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/17/jose-mourinho-rejects-criticism-of-manchester-united-tenure\" title=\"\">United needing to modernise behind the scenes</a> were accompanied by so much buck-passing that one half-expected him to complain about the half-time oranges at Old Trafford being too sour or the pillows in the Special Suite, c/o the Lowry hotel, not being plump enough for his liking. Of everything Mourinho had to say, there was not a single line to indicate there was one part of the job that he, the manager, might have done better. No words of personal regret about his own performance. No acknowledgment that what is happening now, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r leading a renascent team to seven straight victories, is an indictment of Mourinho\u2019s own work. Nothing to explain why the same players who have excelled in the last month looked so unhappy and restricted under the previous manager. Or why, metaphorically speaking, the skies above Old Trafford are suddenly not quite so slate-grey.</p> <p>Mourinho clearly does not possess the quality of being able to acknowledge his own errors. It was everybody and everything else: the players, the structure, the lack of a sporting director (ignoring the fact he strongly resisted having anyone above him dictating transfer policy at Real Madrid) and, true to form, all accompanied with various reminders of his greatness \u2013 at the expense of some of those he appears to consider way beneath him.</p> <p>It was probably naive to expect anything else but wearying, all the same, to be reminded that Mourinho still leaves the impression he thinks he should be on a banknote and, to borrow the old Henry James quote, that he is still the same old sausage, fizzing and sputtering in his own grease. \u201cIf you speak about [Pep] Guardiola, about [Carlo] Ancelotti, about the ones in which I belong, which have a career of victories for a long, long period, where are the young ones in terms of a real impact of results?\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWhere are they? One thing is image, another thing is communication, another is a good structure behind and another thing is to win and get good results. It\u2019s very easy to play \u2018well\u2019 and not win. It\u2019s very easy to be behind a certain idea of a certain football without results.\u201d</p> <p>Any ideas whom he could possibly mean? Mourinho has had a strange fixation with J\u00fcrgen Klopp for some time and, if we know anything about the Portuguese, it is safe to assume he will not appreciate the way Mauricio Pochettino, one of the candidates to take over at Old Trafford, has been touted as a potential upgrade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mourinho did not mention either man by name but, then again, that is what he does. He wants you to read between the lines and work it out for yourself without anyone being able to say he has deliberately belittled another manager. It is similar to the way he used to get Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s name wrong and call him \u201cPellegrino\u201d for all those years, accidentally on purpose, or that time in Italy when it was the Roma coach, Zdenek Zeman, who did not show him enough respect. \u201cZeman?\u201d Mourinho asked. \u201cI do not know him. Where does he play? Is he a coach? Sorry, I did not know that. But now that I am on holiday I will look him up on Google to find out who he is and what he has won.\u201d</p> <p>Mourinho, like Sir Alex Ferguson, can be an accomplished actor. Hand that man an Oscar, and don\u2019t be surprised, in the event of Pochettino ending up at Old Trafford, if Mourinho starts referring to him as \u201cManuel\u201d. The managerial equivalent of playground hair-pulling.</p> <p>For someone with the ego of a small planet, is it possible Mourinho might be riddled with insecurity? Mourinho\u2019s default setting is to remind everyone of his trophy count and, sure enough, he managed to crowbar in that one, too. And, however strange it is that he feels the need to point it out, what he says is essentially true. Mourinho is a trophy machine. There are 25 in total if, as he does, you count the Community Shield. That is greatness \u2013 even if he did not show it at Old Trafford.</p> <p>It is just a shame, perhaps, that Mourinho lacks the humility to understand that people should learn the most about themselves from failure. What he conveniently ignores is that United\u2019s renaissance is a damning indictment of his own shortcomings, a reminder that even the greatest managers can lose form and the hard evidence that he is not actually quite as brilliant as he tells everyone he is.</p> <p>If Mourinho was capable of self-reflection, he would look at the improvement in Marcus Rashford, among others, and there would be a surge of professional embarrassment. He would see Paul Pogba playing, once again, at the point of maximum expression and realise how self-defeating it was to fall out with such a player. A man with humility would understand. That man, however, is not Mourinho.</p> <p>Even the small things. The fact Solskj\u00e6r is moving into a house would not, in ordinary circumstances, be newsworthy. Except Mourinho, of course, remained in a hotel for two and a half years \u2013 something, I am told, that troubled Sir Alex Ferguson, among others \u2013 without ever seeming to realise, or care, how unsettling it was for the club that he would not put down roots.</p> <p>Mourinho now complains that, in Ferguson\u2019s day, the club would have given the manager carte blanche to move out any player. \u201cI think it was when Manchester United sold David Beckham to Real Madrid, if I\u2019m not wrong, and the phrase I kept with me from the biggest one in the Premier League \u2013 Sir Alex Ferguson \u2013 was, \u2018The day a player is more important than the club, goodbye\u2019. Not any more. Not any more. Because there are many things behind [the scenes] now that mean it is difficult to create a situation as linear as this one.\u201d</p> <p>What he fails to see is that Ferguson was there 26 years, meaning he tended to outlast the players and had the full trust of the people at the top of the club. Mourinho, on the other hand, is infamous for the way he never lasts long anywhere and United figured Pogba \u2013 and, for that matter, Anthony Martial \u2013 could conceivably play for another decade after the manager was gone.</p> <p>If Mourinho feels undermined, it is because he was \u2013 very much so. But perhaps he should think a little harder about the reasons why, or how spectacularly short-sighted it would have been, knowing what we do now, if he had been allowed to get his way.</p> <p>Will Mourinho ever see it that way? Not a hope. \u201cI am Jos\u00e9 Mourinho,\u201d he said, when he took the job at Real Madrid in 2010, \u201cI don\u2019t change, I arrive with all my qualities and all my defects.\u201d He will be back soon, possibly at Madrid, as mulish as ever, still refusing to bend for anyone. And the saddest, most bizarre thing of all: the Premier League feels a better place without him.</p> <h2>Sinclair\u2019s spy tip was no laughing matter for Keegan</h2> <p>Amid all this talk about spying on opponents it is worth remembering that the best way for managers to get inside information is actually through the players themselves. There will always be someone who has a mate in the opposition dressing room, possibly a disaffected player, who will be happy to spill the beans when it comes to who is in the team, who is out of favour, who might be carrying a knock and various other titbits.</p> <p>All of which reminds me of a story Kevin Keegan tells in his autobiography about his time as Manchester City manager, on the way to an FA Cup tie at Leicester City, when Trevor Sinclair wandered down the team coach and, winking, pushed a folded piece of paper into the manager\u2019s hand.</p> <p>When Keegan unfolded it, he was taken aback to find the 11 names of the Leicester players in their team formation \u2013 just confirmed from a dressing-room mole in the east Midlands. \u201cCrikey,\u201d Keegan joked. \u201cI take it you\u2019ve given them ours as well.\u201d At which point Sinclair decided to come clean. \u201cYeah, I have actually, gaffer.\u201d</p> <p>Keegan could laugh about it later \u2013 his team won 3-1 \u2013 but it is fair to say he did not find it too amusing at the time that one of his players was leaking the line-up to the opposition.</p> <h2>Believe in Burton</h2> <p>Memo to Burton Albion: don\u2019t despair.

      "bodyText": "The people who used to work with Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson tell a story about the former England manager, going back to the European Championship in 2004, when he did something that was totally out of character. He almost lost his temper. England had just been knocked out by Portugal. Inside the dressing room was a scene of desolation and the Football Association\u2019s staff saw something in his face that day they had never seen before: fury. A bad refereeing decision had denied Sol Campbell a late winner and Eriksson wanted to know where the official was. He was puce with anger. He left the dressing room to rap on the referee\u2019s door and, when it swung open, there were a few interminable moments when nobody could quite be sure how far he was willing to take it. At which point Sven, once again, reverted to being Sven. \u201cMr referee,\u201d he said, holding out his hand. \u201cI wanted to say thank you for a good game.\u201d It is a great story, classic Sven, and probably a reminder to all of us that, once you reach a certain point of your life, it is difficult to switch personalities, to adjust to new settings and, in Eriksson\u2019s case, reinvent himself as a shouter. Of course, people can change. It just does not tend to happen \u2013 unless, of course, that person actually wants to change. More fool me, then, for wondering whether Jos\u00e9 Mourinho might have emerged from the breakdown of his Manchester United reign with even a shade more humility. It was only a passing thought but I must confess I was foolish enough to wonder if he might understand the old saying that you learn the most from failure. Would we see a more soft-focus Mourinho? Better and humbler for the experience? The answer should probably have come as no surprise and was delivered in that television interview, as a pundit at the Asian Cup, when all the good points he made about United needing to modernise behind the scenes were accompanied by so much buck-passing that one half-expected him to complain about the half-time oranges at Old Trafford being too sour or the pillows in the Special Suite, c/o the Lowry hotel, not being plump enough for his liking. Of everything Mourinho had to say, there was not a single line to indicate there was one part of the job that he, the manager, might have done better. No words of personal regret about his own performance. No acknowledgment that what is happening now, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r leading a renascent team to seven straight victories, is an indictment of Mourinho\u2019s own work. Nothing to explain why the same players who have excelled in the last month looked so unhappy and restricted under the previous manager. Or why, metaphorically speaking, the skies above Old Trafford are suddenly not quite so slate-grey. Mourinho clearly does not possess the quality of being able to acknowledge his own errors. It was everybody and everything else: the players, the structure, the lack of a sporting director (ignoring the fact he strongly resisted having anyone above him dictating transfer policy at Real Madrid) and, true to form, all accompanied with various reminders of his greatness \u2013 at the expense of some of those he appears to consider way beneath him. It was probably naive to expect anything else but wearying, all the same, to be reminded that Mourinho still leaves the impression he thinks he should be on a banknote and, to borrow the old Henry James quote, that he is still the same old sausage, fizzing and sputtering in his own grease. \u201cIf you speak about [Pep] Guardiola, about [Carlo] Ancelotti, about the ones in which I belong, which have a career of victories for a long, long period, where are the young ones in terms of a real impact of results?\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWhere are they?

I can travel around peacefully, eat by myself, stand for as long as I want in front of a painting \u2013 and be ignored. I\u2019ve never been pretty, but I have been young and thin, and I\u2019ve always been female, and in that pie chart the central shape inevitably invites interest when seated alone. Walking near Central Park I remembered being on this street as a teenager, when a stranger pointed at my jeans and whispered: \u201cNice pussy.\u201d No more.</p> <p>Which is why I basked in 50-year-old French author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/07/french-author-yann-moix-sparks-row-with-comments-about-women-over-50\" title=\"\">Yann Moix\u2019s </a>comments about how women stop being attractive after the age of 25. Questioned after his initial <em>Marie Claire</em> interview came out, where he said it wasn\u2019t possible to love a woman over the age of 50 \u2013 \u201cToo, too old. The body of a 25-year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of 50 is not extraordinary at all\u201d \u2013 he decided to double down, further explaining he was only attracted to Asian women, because they offer an \u201cextraordinary link with another cosmos\u201d.

Because why should anybody attempt to change his mind? Not only should we laugh at the arrogance of his bumptious racist sexism, but we should celebrate his point \u2013 that a moment comes in woman\u2019s lives when they no longer have to engage with men like Moix.</p> <p>Until you are invisible to men like this, your body is theirs.

Up to 25, you are looked at \u2013 after that, you must not be too loud or too quiet, or smile too much or too little, or be too thin or too fat, or be good at dancing or be bad at dancing. It\u2019s no wonder so many women are put off jobs in power; it\u2019s some wonder so many of us continue to internalise the sour taste we get of such exposure simply from walking down the street.</p> <p>I look at my body differently now that it is no longer being looked at. There is a dehumanising effect to being seen by men like Moix, as you stand outside yourself, considering their view. And while I understand the shock of women being ignored upon turning 50, 60, having lost the sexual capital they\u2019d leaned into for years, surely there is a great deal of comfort for them in becoming invisible, too. Especially on hearing the limits of the alternative spelled out in French, an author saying books should be judged by their covers.</p> <p>Such dense bliss, this realisation that I can be invisible in a crowd, whether in this shop, where my face will be blurred in the background of two girls\u2019 selfies, or in the street, where it should be possible to journey forward without the suspicion you\u2019re trespassing in a stranger\u2019s playground. Such relief to be the one looking, the one walking unseen, the person in the body that is no longer 25. It\u2019s mine again.</p> <h2>And another thing\u2026</h2> <p>I have spent some time watching the video of the 64m <strong>fatberg</strong> discovered beneath the Esplanade in Sidmouth, Devon.

Up to 25, you are looked at \u2013 after that, you must not be too loud or too quiet, or smile too much or too little, or be too thin or too fat, or be good at dancing or be bad at dancing. It\u2019s no wonder so many women are put off jobs in power; it\u2019s some wonder so many of us continue to internalise the sour taste we get of such exposure simply from walking down the street. I look at my body differently now that it is no longer being looked at. There is a dehumanising effect to being seen by men like Moix, as you stand outside yourself, considering their view. And while I understand the shock of women being ignored upon turning 50, 60, having lost the sexual capital they\u2019d leaned into for years, surely there is a great deal of comfort for them in becoming invisible, too. Especially on hearing the limits of the alternative spelled out in French, an author saying books should be judged by their covers. Such dense bliss, this realisation that I can be invisible in a crowd, whether in this shop, where my face will be blurred in the background of two girls\u2019 selfies, or in the street, where it should be possible to journey forward without the suspicion you\u2019re trespassing in a stranger\u2019s playground. Such relief to be the one looking, the one walking unseen, the person in the body that is no longer 25. It\u2019s mine again. And another thing\u2026 I have spent some time watching the video of the 64m fatberg discovered beneath the Esplanade in Sidmouth, Devon. It is grey and tripe-like with ominous holes as if it\u2019s been burrowed into by a fellow monster. If you look closely, I swear you see eyes. Fellow Lindsay Lohan consumers will be excited to hear her explanation for the fascinating accent she\u2019s been using for the past few years. It\u2019s tha of a person for whom English is a second language. She revealed this week that she\u2019s been speaking \u2018Lilohan\u2019. I saw The Favourite this week, a beautiful and hilarious film \u2013 the natural lighting of which made me understand pearls for the first time. Lines from it keep returning to me like bubbles of joy. \u2018I\u2019ve sent for some lobsters. I thought we could race them and eat them.\u2019 And: \u2018Your carriage awaits, and my maid is on her way up with something called a pineapple.\u2019 Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter@EvaWiseman",

Like Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/30/the-favourite-review-olivia-colman-emma-stone-rachel-weisz-yorgos-lanthimos\" title=\"\">The Favourite</a></em>, which inventively revisits the court of Queen Anne (albeit with a very different tone), the setting may be historical but the core concerns are utterly contemporary: a tale of two \u201csisters\u201d \u2013 Elizabeth I (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/margot-robbie\" title=\"\">Margot Robbie</a>) and Mary Stuart (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/30/saoirse-ronan-mary-queen-of-scots-interview\" title=\"\">Saoirse Ronan</a>) \u2013 caught in the middle of a power struggle between England and Scotland, Protestants and Catholics, men and women.</p> <p>We begin at the end, in 1587, with a candle being snuffed out as the Catholic Mary is led to the executioner\u2019s block.

      "bodyText": "Director Josie Rourke makes a very assured move from the theatre to the cinema screen in her feature debut, a full-blooded tale of personal and political rivalries told with wit, flair and passion. Like Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s The Favourite, which inventively revisits the court of Queen Anne (albeit with a very different tone), the setting may be historical but the core concerns are utterly contemporary: a tale of two \u201csisters\u201d \u2013 Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie) and Mary Stuart (Saoirse Ronan) \u2013 caught in the middle of a power struggle between England and Scotland, Protestants and Catholics, men and women. We begin at the end, in 1587, with a candle being snuffed out as the Catholic Mary is led to the executioner\u2019s block. From here we flash back to 1561, and Mary\u2019s return to Scotland following the death of her husband. Her arrival, and claim to Elizabeth\u2019s throne, alarms her heirless cousin, and sets warring factions in motion on both sides of the border. On one level these women are polar opposites: while Mary is young, beautiful and forthright, Elizabeth oozes world-weariness, her face painted a frightening white, a clown mask that covers the ravages of the pox. \u201cI will be the woman she is not,\u201d declares Mary, proudly asserting: \u201cI shall produce an heir, unlike her barren self.\u201d As for Elizabeth, she chooses to be neither wife nor mother, preferring \u201cto be a man\u201d, calling her confidant Sir William Cecil (Guy Pearce) \u201cthe closest thing I shall ever have to a wife\u201d. Yet despite such differences, both queens are subject to the vicissitudes of men who see their gender as a threat. When Lord Randolph (Adrian Lester, nicely underplayed) asks: \u201cHow did the world come to this?\u201d, Ian Hart\u2019s conspiratorial Lord Maitland replies: \u201cWise men servicing the whims of women.\u201d Elsewhere, a seething John Knox (David Tennant, as excellent as he is unrecognisable) brands Mary \u201ca murderous harlot\u2026 Queen Strumpet\u201d, while Elizabeth muses upon \u201chow cruel men are\u201d. Taking its lead from John Guy\u2019s book Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart, Beau (House of Cards) Willimon\u2019s wry script cleverly intertwines history and conjecture, positing Mary as a wily tactician who outsmarts her opponents while seeking an alliance with Elizabeth \u2013 on her own terms. As for Rourke, she has cited films such as Thelma &amp; Louise and noted the bond between Batman and the Joker when describing the female drive and \u201cintense psychological relationship\u201d at the heart of this narrative.

While Ronan is terrific, Robbie has arguably the more difficult role, conjuring an engaging portrait of someone whose position has made her \u201cmore man than woman\u201d. It\u2019s a credit to Robbie that Elizabeth\u2019s anguish shines through the stony visage behind which she is increasingly forced to hide. The supporting roles are well cast too, with particular plaudits due to Hart, who remains one of the UK\u2019s most reliably riveting stage and screen presences.

It looks forward and back, containing both echoes of Khan\u2019s earliest experience as a performer for Peter Brook and the first stirrings of his collaboration with the composer Vincenzo Lamagna, who provides the resonant, evocative score.</p> <p><em>Until the Lions </em>takes its title and its inspiration from Karthika Na\u00efr\u2019s poetic reimagining of some tales from the <em>Mahabharata</em>, focusing on the women whose narratives peep around the epic\u2019s corners. These are the lions, the hunted whose stories are lost because the hunters write the history. Here, they take the shape of Amba, a betrayed princess, abducted for obscure reasons by Bheeshma, who then will not marry her because he has taken a vow of celibacy. She swears revenge, undergoes suffering that unbalances the universe, then takes her own life in order to emerge as a warrior in male form, ready to kill the man who destroyed her life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb71541c390e76451d18e2ce19619c8e9a19a338\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb71541c390e76451d18e2ce19619c8e9a19a338/0_0_5095_3879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ching-Ying Chien and Akram Khan in  Until the Lions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Transfixing\u2019: Ching-Ying Chien and Akram Khan in <br> Until the Lions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s knotty stuff, and Khan\u2019s achievement is to transform it into a series of powerful images.

      "bodyText": "Akram Khan made Until the Lions to be performed in the magical, circular space of London\u2019s Roundhouse some three years ago. It shone then, and after worldwide success in different arenas has returned home to cast its illuminating spell for a final time. Strikingly beautiful, poised somewhere between narrative and metaphor, it features only three dancers \u2013 Ching-Ying Chien, Joy Alpuerto Ritter and Khan himself \u2013 but is epic in conception, a myth transfigured for modern times. Seeing it now, you realise how much it is a transitional work, carrying Khan from the intricate solos and duets that made his name to the larger-scale vision of works such as Giselle for English National Ballet, which emphasises his choreographic importance in a future where he plans to dance less. It looks forward and back, containing both echoes of Khan\u2019s earliest experience as a performer for Peter Brook and the first stirrings of his collaboration with the composer Vincenzo Lamagna, who provides the resonant, evocative score. Until the Lions takes its title and its inspiration from Karthika Na\u00efr\u2019s poetic reimagining of some tales from the Mahabharata, focusing on the women whose narratives peep around the epic\u2019s corners. These are the lions, the hunted whose stories are lost because the hunters write the history. Here, they take the shape of Amba, a betrayed princess, abducted for obscure reasons by Bheeshma, who then will not marry her because he has taken a vow of celibacy. She swears revenge, undergoes suffering that unbalances the universe, then takes her own life in order to emerge as a warrior in male form, ready to kill the man who destroyed her life. It\u2019s knotty stuff, and Khan\u2019s achievement is to transform it into a series of powerful images. You might not understand every detail of the plot without reading the programme, but as he runs in circles with Ching-Ying\u2019s prone body over his shoulder, you sense the outrage. Her despair, as she tries to make him marry her, is conveyed in a remarkable duet where they never quite embrace; his arms encircle her without touching. Finally, she locks her legs around his waist and they move like a double-jointed creature, joined by a bond that can be torn apart but never broken.

      "body": "<p>First-time buyers and homeowners remortgaging their properties have been given some good news at the start of the year as a number of lenders have cut their rates in an increasingly competitive market.</p> <p>Last week HSBC dropped rates on 31 different mortgages while the market-leading product for a 10-year fixed-rate loan also went down.</p> <p>The cuts come at a time when the outlook for property sales is at the lowest level for two decades. A report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that the looming threat of Brexit had dragged down the UK property market further, with prices falling at the fastest rate in six years.</p> <p>HSBC said it was reducing fixed and tracker rates. A two-year fixed rate for a loan 95% of the value of the home was cut by 0.1% to 2.99%. A five-year fixed rate was also down 0.1% to 2.29% on a home with 90% loan to value. Both of these moves will help first-time buyers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Coventry building society dropped the interest rate on its 10-year fixed mortgage \u2013 one of the most competitive \u2013 from 2.35% to 2.25%. However, this only applies where there is a 50% loan to value, so may have a limited number of customers. Atom Bank, Accord Mortgages, NatWest and RBS are among the others that have cut rates.</p> <p>Commentators have said that the new rates are a response to increased competition in the market.</p> <p>\u201cWe are aware from published mortgage approval numbers that there is a limited amount of mortgage business that banks and building societies are able to compete for, so it is likely that recent rate activity in the fixed-rate sector demonstrates that competition for business is indeed rife,\u201d says Darren Cook of the financial data provider Moneyfacts.</p> <p>\u201cOur research shows that mortgage providers have generally left their ranges unchanged during the second half of December, but it seems that some providers have been quick out of the stalls early in January to make sure that they take a competitive advantage into the new year.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Sykes, mortgage consultant at Private Finance, says there is a suggestion that some banks missed their targets last year and want to \u201ccome out strong in 2019\u201d. But he says that not all lenders have followed the downward trend.</p> <p>\u201cCoventry was not alone in reducing rates to kick-start 2019.

      "bodyText": "First-time buyers and homeowners remortgaging their properties have been given some good news at the start of the year as a number of lenders have cut their rates in an increasingly competitive market. Last week HSBC dropped rates on 31 different mortgages while the market-leading product for a 10-year fixed-rate loan also went down. The cuts come at a time when the outlook for property sales is at the lowest level for two decades. A report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that the looming threat of Brexit had dragged down the UK property market further, with prices falling at the fastest rate in six years. HSBC said it was reducing fixed and tracker rates. A two-year fixed rate for a loan 95% of the value of the home was cut by 0.1% to 2.99%. A five-year fixed rate was also down 0.1% to 2.29% on a home with 90% loan to value. Both of these moves will help first-time buyers. Meanwhile, Coventry building society dropped the interest rate on its 10-year fixed mortgage \u2013 one of the most competitive \u2013 from 2.35% to 2.25%. However, this only applies where there is a 50% loan to value, so may have a limited number of customers. Atom Bank, Accord Mortgages, NatWest and RBS are among the others that have cut rates. Commentators have said that the new rates are a response to increased competition in the market. \u201cWe are aware from published mortgage approval numbers that there is a limited amount of mortgage business that banks and building societies are able to compete for, so it is likely that recent rate activity in the fixed-rate sector demonstrates that competition for business is indeed rife,\u201d says Darren Cook of the financial data provider Moneyfacts. \u201cOur research shows that mortgage providers have generally left their ranges unchanged during the second half of December, but it seems that some providers have been quick out of the stalls early in January to make sure that they take a competitive advantage into the new year.\u201d Chris Sykes, mortgage consultant at Private Finance, says there is a suggestion that some banks missed their targets last year and want to \u201ccome out strong in 2019\u201d. But he says that not all lenders have followed the downward trend. \u201cCoventry was not alone in reducing rates to kick-start 2019. So far January has seen falling rates from HSBC, Furness building society and Accord Mortgages, with the latter making significant cuts in some cases, as well as increasing cashback amounts and decreasing fees on selected products. Virgin Money and Barclays have followed suit, reducing some fees and rates,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, some specialist lenders like Paragon have decided to follow an opposite trend, with increased rates and decreased cashback amounts. Buy-to-let lender the Mortgage Works is also looking to increase rates.\u201d Sykes says it is difficult to see further drops in the near future as the margins that banks are operating on are tight. The Rics report released last week showed sales expectations for the next three months were the lowest since the survey began in 1999, with a balance of -28% \u2013 the difference between the number of respondents anticipating increases and the number expecting decreases. Sales expectations were either flat or negative in every region of the UK for the period from January to March, when the UK is scheduled to leave the EU.",

Crucial to Akhmedov\u2019s defence was the claim that an earlier divorce between the couple \u2013 in Moscow 19 years ago \u2013 supersedes the UK judgment, making his ex-wife\u2019s attempts to seize his assets a fraudulent act.</p> <p>However, handing down his judgment in 2016, Justice Haddon-Cave said he had found no evidence of the earlier divorce. \u201cThe inference to be drawn \u2026 is that the 2000 Moscow divorce documents \u2026 were, at all material times, forged,\u201d Haddon-Cave concluded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e72990b23284047a93a634bbb882d15b9ae194bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e72990b23284047a93a634bbb882d15b9ae194bf/5_196_5630_3378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luna, the \u00a3230m yacht bought from Roman Abramovich, on the French Riviera.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luna, the \u00a3230m yacht bought from Roman Abramovich, on the French Riviera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Action Press/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Haddon-Cave ordered that a raft of Akhmedov\u2019s assets should be frozen.

In his libretto, the composer\u2019s brother, Modest, added layers to the terse original. Herheim constructs an entirely new fiction. Prince Yeletsky takes on the persona of Tchaikovsky himself, directing the action to baleful end.

The Royal Opera House orchestra blazes and caresses: agitated string attacks on the \u201cthree cards\u201d motif; ferocious pizzicatos; woodwind curdling, yowling, seducing; brass sour and menacing.

      "body": "<p>In 1981 in Kibeho, Rwanda, three young women at a convent school begin to see the Virgin Mary. They go into ecstatic fits, with fixed eyes, broad grins, juddering limbs. They report that Mary is very beautiful and has given them messages to be delivered to the president of their country. They are bullied \u2013 \u201cpinch her\u201d, urges the envious mother superior \u2013 by fellow students; later they become local holy celebrities: the \u201cTrinity\u201d. An emissary from Rome arrives to test their authenticity: he plunges a blade into one girl\u2019s chest to see if she feels pain when in a trance. This divine \u2013 performed with exquisite urbanity by Michael Mears \u2013 also compares the girls to the Supremes: the trio are baffled by the reference.</p> <p>As dramatised by Katori Hall, the real-life story of <strong><a href=\"https://www.royalandderngate.co.uk/whats-on/our-lady-of-kibeho/\" title=\"\">Our Lady of Kibeho</a></strong>, receiving its UK premiere, has obvious parallels with Arthur Miller\u2019s <em>The Crucible</em>: the cloistered girls, the wrap-around religious fervour, the presence of a man targeted by adolescent affection (here, a priest with \u201cchestnut brown eyes\u201d) and \u2013 in its glancing blows at colonial powers in Africa \u2013 with Danai Gurira\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/23/sweat-donmar-review-lynn-nottage-the-convert-young-vic-richard-second-ii-almeida-simon-russel-beale\" title=\"\">The Convert</a></em>, still beautifully running at the Young Vic. But it has particular qualities.</p> <p>The seers described a vision of imminent devastation and horror: they did so some 13 years before the Rwandan genocide. It seemed specific. And Katori is generous \u2013 you might say indulgent \u2013 to this idea. Scepticism is presented, and not altogether demonised.

      "bodyText": "In 1981 in Kibeho, Rwanda, three young women at a convent school begin to see the Virgin Mary. They go into ecstatic fits, with fixed eyes, broad grins, juddering limbs. They report that Mary is very beautiful and has given them messages to be delivered to the president of their country. They are bullied \u2013 \u201cpinch her\u201d, urges the envious mother superior \u2013 by fellow students; later they become local holy celebrities: the \u201cTrinity\u201d. An emissary from Rome arrives to test their authenticity: he plunges a blade into one girl\u2019s chest to see if she feels pain when in a trance. This divine \u2013 performed with exquisite urbanity by Michael Mears \u2013 also compares the girls to the Supremes: the trio are baffled by the reference. As dramatised by Katori Hall, the real-life story of Our Lady of Kibeho, receiving its UK premiere, has obvious parallels with Arthur Miller\u2019s The Crucible: the cloistered girls, the wrap-around religious fervour, the presence of a man targeted by adolescent affection (here, a priest with \u201cchestnut brown eyes\u201d) and \u2013 in its glancing blows at colonial powers in Africa \u2013 with Danai Gurira\u2019s The Convert, still beautifully running at the Young Vic. But it has particular qualities. The seers described a vision of imminent devastation and horror: they did so some 13 years before the Rwandan genocide. It seemed specific. And Katori is generous \u2013 you might say indulgent \u2013 to this idea. Scepticism is presented, and not altogether demonised. But the play does not try to explain \u2013 or explain away \u2013 the visitations. \u201cThere are no psychologists in Rwanda,\u201d a priest announces. The girls may be skittish, snippy and frisky \u2013 they can dance with delicious abandon in a kicking ring. But they are also radiant. When the excellent three \u2013 Pepter Lunkuse, Yasmin Mwanza and the rapidly rising Gabrielle Brooks \u2013 look out towards the audience, arms stretched heavenwards, they are rapt, but they are also transmitting. James Dacre \u2013 who directed Hall\u2019s 2009 hit The Mountaintop \u2013 surrounds them with power. Magic tricks allow objects to hover in the air. Charles Balfour\u2019s lighting floods Jonathan Fensom\u2019s design \u2013 a battered building perched in front of wide horizons \u2013 with golden light.

      "body": "<p>At 7.57pm last Tuesday, as MPs, their advisers and journalists began to file out of the House of Commons after the biggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-loses-brexit-deal-vote-by-majority-of-230\" title=\"\">parliamentary defeat </a>for a government in modern history, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, tapped Jeremy Corbyn on the arm and signalled to him to look up into the press gallery above the Speaker\u2019s chair.</p> <p>There Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s director of strategy and communications, had stopped on his way out of the chamber to brief the press and was trying to catch the Labour leader\u2019s eye. As the two men \u2013 the most powerful double act in Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition \u2013 met each other\u2019s gaze, wide, triumphant smiles lit up their faces.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/20/norway-plus-uk-brexit-not-silver-bullet\">Norway Plus is not a silver bullet to resolve Brexit impasse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Theresa May had been crushed and humiliated. Her Brexit deal had been rejected by 432 votes to 202 \u2013 a margin far greater that even her most pessimistic supporters had envisaged. The prime minister had left her seat pale and shell-shocked. Asked for his reaction 10 minutes after leaving the chamber, a cabinet minister and May loyalist had nothing to say except \u201cwe came second\u201d. He could offer no thought on what would happen next.</p> <p>Corbyn had called the result \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for May and quickly tabled a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/mays-government-survives-no-confidence-vote-after-brexit-defeat\" title=\"\">vote of confidence</a> in the government \u2013 to be held the next day. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s governing principle of delay and denial has reached the end of the line,\u201d he had told the Commons, to ironic laughter from some on the Tory side who believed Labour\u2019s approach to Brexit was exactly that. \u201cShe cannot seriously believe that, after two years of failure, she is capable of negotiating a good deal for the people of this country,\u201d Corbyn added. His message was that a general election, delivering a Labour government, was the only answer.</p> <p>But if Corbyn and Milne really thought this was a defining moment that would lead inexorably to the end of May\u2019s government, a general election, and a solution to Brexit under a Labour administration, their hopes were profoundly misplaced. Just 24 hours later it was the Tory benches that were in raptures as Michael Gove wound up the confidence debate by tearing into Corbyn as a threat to national security and the national interest, who could never lead the country on Brexit \u2013 or anything else. The chamber was a cauldron of Tory cheers and near hysterical Labour screams of \u201cshame\u201d.</p> <p>When Gove sat down, May could hardly contain her excitement, repeatedy slapping the environment, food and rural affairs secretary on the back as Conservative MPs roared. Minutes later the Speaker, John Bercow, called the result in the government\u2019s favour by 325 votes to 306. It was Labour\u2019s turn to go down to defeat. Parliament, albeit narrowly, had declared its confidence in May\u2019s terribly weakened, divided ministerial team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0dd68c5b44e1a3a810efa643a5866b1a2bb30002\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd68c5b44e1a3a810efa643a5866b1a2bb30002/1131_73_1626_976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn (right) and Seumas Milne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn (right) and Seumas Milne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result and the theatrics of the confidence debate had been predictable, as the house had divided on party lines. But what happened in its immediate aftermath was less so.</p> <p>May responded to the results of both votes on Wednesday evening with a dramatic offer to open <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat\" title=\"\">cross-party talks </a>with opposition leaders as a way to break the Brexit deadlock and ease the parliamentary paralysis. For a few moments MPs tried to digest the notion that their parties might now embrace a consensual approach, that the national interest might take precedence over party politics. \u201cI should like to invite the leaders of parliamentary parties to meet me individually, and I should like to start those meetings tonight,\u201d May said.</p> <p>But no sooner had she thrown open Downing Street\u2019s doors to her political opponents than Corbyn rose to say he would not take part unless and until the prime minister took the possibility of a no-deal Brexit off the table. Outside the chamber, Downing Street officials made clear that she would most certainly not do so \u2013 and suggested that all her red lines remained in place and not negotiable. Milne then briefed journalists that May was trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d MPs to accept her deal by threatening them with the chaos of no deal on the one hand, or something based on her already emphatically defeated deal on the other, which he said was an unacceptable choice. The idea of talks was a sham.</p> <p>Both main parties were digging deeper into their trenches, recoiling from what compromise might mean only minutes after cross-party diaogue had been offered. After all the drama and mood swings over the previous 48 hours, the entire Brexit process seemed more hopelessly gridlocked than ever.</p> <p>Five days after the Brexit deal she had spent two-and-a-half years painstakingly negotiating was rejected so comprehensively by the House of Commons, Theresa May is today holed up at Chequers desperately trying to find a way forward. Yesterday she was calling cabinet ministers and contacting European leaders seeking inspiration and help. She may go on a tour of European capitals again this week, but the EU, while sympathetic, has little idea as to what it can do other than delay Brexit, a prospect which the prime minister has so far refused to entertain.</p> <p>Yesterday the German chancellor Angela Merkel insisted she would do her best to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal. \u201cI will work until the very last day to get a solution with a deal for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, and I will work towards having the best relationship,\u201d she said at an event in the northern city of Rostock.</p> <p>But back home even loyalists doubt that May is the one to find a solution. One senior Tory MP who voted for May\u2019s deal on Tuesday said: \u201cWe are now in serious, serious trouble. I admire her determination. But we don\u2019t need determination now. We need imagination.\u201d</p> <p>The challenge for May has switched since last weekend from how to promote the merits of her deal to how to forge some consensus across parliament., now that it is effectively dead. But the very idea of cross-party agreement relies on the governing party, the Tories, being united on where that compromise might be allowed to happen. Yet they are utterly divided.</p> <p>Another of Labour\u2019s key demands is that she embraces a permanent customs union, something some of May\u2019s Remain-minded colleagues in cabinet would be happy to endorse if only they could. But if she did embrace the customs union plan, others in cabinet, the likes of Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mourdant and Liam Fox, would see it as a Brexit betrayal and probably resign, as would dozens of other ministers. \u201cThere would be a walkout,\u201d said an aide to a cabinet minister. The Tory grassroots would also implode.</p> <p>On Wednesday in the Commons, the Labour MP Seema Malhotra said May seemed to want to carry on trying to sell the essence of her deal to MPs from other parties as if it had not been thrown out by parliament the day before: \u201cThe prime minister said that the government would approach meetings with parliamentarians in a constructive spirit, but it appears that holding cross-party talks means inviting people in to tell her why her deal is best or to see whether they have any ideas about how to get her deal through.\u201d</p> <p>Divisions inside Labour have added to the sense that parliament has no way out of the Brexit conundrum. On Thursday, Corbyn instructed all his MPs to steer clear of cross-party talks, but many trooped into Downing Street nonetheless, believing he was wrong to have vetoed the discussions point blank with the country in such a desperate plight. But those who did enter dialogue in Downing Street reported little give. One senior Labour backencher who met the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, on Thursday to propose a second referendum found the whole exercise to have been completely pointless. \u201cYou can imagine how that went: nowhere,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn, both chairs of select committees, emerged from long meetings with Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, to ask for no deal to be taken off the table, only to meet a stone wall and report that Lidington did not mention any new ideas or ways forward.</p> <p>Tomorrow May will deliver statements to parliament on what happens next. There was little sign from Downing Street or from ministers, however, that anyone has any clear idea what she will say. Rumours that May and No 10 are so desperate they are preparing for a general election as a way out were dismissed as \u201cutter bollocks\u201d by a source at No 10.</p> <p>But with the prime minister unsure where to turn next for fear of further splitting her party, other ideas are emerging among Tory and Labour MPs, operating separately from the executive or from the party leaderships.

      "bodyText": "At 7.57pm last Tuesday, as MPs, their advisers and journalists began to file out of the House of Commons after the biggest parliamentary defeat for a government in modern history, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, tapped Jeremy Corbyn on the arm and signalled to him to look up into the press gallery above the Speaker\u2019s chair. There Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s director of strategy and communications, had stopped on his way out of the chamber to brief the press and was trying to catch the Labour leader\u2019s eye. As the two men \u2013 the most powerful double act in Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition \u2013 met each other\u2019s gaze, wide, triumphant smiles lit up their faces. Theresa May had been crushed and humiliated. Her Brexit deal had been rejected by 432 votes to 202 \u2013 a margin far greater that even her most pessimistic supporters had envisaged. The prime minister had left her seat pale and shell-shocked. Asked for his reaction 10 minutes after leaving the chamber, a cabinet minister and May loyalist had nothing to say except \u201cwe came second\u201d. He could offer no thought on what would happen next. Corbyn had called the result \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for May and quickly tabled a vote of confidence in the government \u2013 to be held the next day. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s governing principle of delay and denial has reached the end of the line,\u201d he had told the Commons, to ironic laughter from some on the Tory side who believed Labour\u2019s approach to Brexit was exactly that. \u201cShe cannot seriously believe that, after two years of failure, she is capable of negotiating a good deal for the people of this country,\u201d Corbyn added. His message was that a general election, delivering a Labour government, was the only answer. But if Corbyn and Milne really thought this was a defining moment that would lead inexorably to the end of May\u2019s government, a general election, and a solution to Brexit under a Labour administration, their hopes were profoundly misplaced. Just 24 hours later it was the Tory benches that were in raptures as Michael Gove wound up the confidence debate by tearing into Corbyn as a threat to national security and the national interest, who could never lead the country on Brexit \u2013 or anything else. The chamber was a cauldron of Tory cheers and near hysterical Labour screams of \u201cshame\u201d. When Gove sat down, May could hardly contain her excitement, repeatedy slapping the environment, food and rural affairs secretary on the back as Conservative MPs roared. Minutes later the Speaker, John Bercow, called the result in the government\u2019s favour by 325 votes to 306. It was Labour\u2019s turn to go down to defeat. Parliament, albeit narrowly, had declared its confidence in May\u2019s terribly weakened, divided ministerial team. The result and the theatrics of the confidence debate had been predictable, as the house had divided on party lines. But what happened in its immediate aftermath was less so. May responded to the results of both votes on Wednesday evening with a dramatic offer to open cross-party talks with opposition leaders as a way to break the Brexit deadlock and ease the parliamentary paralysis. For a few moments MPs tried to digest the notion that their parties might now embrace a consensual approach, that the national interest might take precedence over party politics. \u201cI should like to invite the leaders of parliamentary parties to meet me individually, and I should like to start those meetings tonight,\u201d May said. But no sooner had she thrown open Downing Street\u2019s doors to her political opponents than Corbyn rose to say he would not take part unless and until the prime minister took the possibility of a no-deal Brexit off the table. Outside the chamber, Downing Street officials made clear that she would most certainly not do so \u2013 and suggested that all her red lines remained in place and not negotiable. Milne then briefed journalists that May was trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d MPs to accept her deal by threatening them with the chaos of no deal on the one hand, or something based on her already emphatically defeated deal on the other, which he said was an unacceptable choice. The idea of talks was a sham. Both main parties were digging deeper into their trenches, recoiling from what compromise might mean only minutes after cross-party diaogue had been offered. After all the drama and mood swings over the previous 48 hours, the entire Brexit process seemed more hopelessly gridlocked than ever. Five days after the Brexit deal she had spent two-and-a-half years painstakingly negotiating was rejected so comprehensively by the House of Commons, Theresa May is today holed up at Chequers desperately trying to find a way forward. Yesterday she was calling cabinet ministers and contacting European leaders seeking inspiration and help. She may go on a tour of European capitals again this week, but the EU, while sympathetic, has little idea as to what it can do other than delay Brexit, a prospect which the prime minister has so far refused to entertain. Yesterday the German chancellor Angela Merkel insisted she would do her best to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal. \u201cI will work until the very last day to get a solution with a deal for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, and I will work towards having the best relationship,\u201d she said at an event in the northern city of Rostock. But back home even loyalists doubt that May is the one to find a solution. One senior Tory MP who voted for May\u2019s deal on Tuesday said: \u201cWe are now in serious, serious trouble. I admire her determination. But we don\u2019t need determination now. We need imagination.\u201d The challenge for May has switched since last weekend from how to promote the merits of her deal to how to forge some consensus across parliament., now that it is effectively dead. But the very idea of cross-party agreement relies on the governing party, the Tories, being united on where that compromise might be allowed to happen. Yet they are utterly divided. Another of Labour\u2019s key demands is that she embraces a permanent customs union, something some of May\u2019s Remain-minded colleagues in cabinet would be happy to endorse if only they could. But if she did embrace the customs union plan, others in cabinet, the likes of Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mourdant and Liam Fox, would see it as a Brexit betrayal and probably resign, as would dozens of other ministers. \u201cThere would be a walkout,\u201d said an aide to a cabinet minister. The Tory grassroots would also implode. On Wednesday in the Commons, the Labour MP Seema Malhotra said May seemed to want to carry on trying to sell the essence of her deal to MPs from other parties as if it had not been thrown out by parliament the day before: \u201cThe prime minister said that the government would approach meetings with parliamentarians in a constructive spirit, but it appears that holding cross-party talks means inviting people in to tell her why her deal is best or to see whether they have any ideas about how to get her deal through.\u201d Divisions inside Labour have added to the sense that parliament has no way out of the Brexit conundrum. On Thursday, Corbyn instructed all his MPs to steer clear of cross-party talks, but many trooped into Downing Street nonetheless, believing he was wrong to have vetoed the discussions point blank with the country in such a desperate plight. But those who did enter dialogue in Downing Street reported little give. One senior Labour backencher who met the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, on Thursday to propose a second referendum found the whole exercise to have been completely pointless. \u201cYou can imagine how that went: nowhere,\u201d he said. On Thursday afternoon Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn, both chairs of select committees, emerged from long meetings with Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, to ask for no deal to be taken off the table, only to meet a stone wall and report that Lidington did not mention any new ideas or ways forward. Tomorrow May will deliver statements to parliament on what happens next. There was little sign from Downing Street or from ministers, however, that anyone has any clear idea what she will say. Rumours that May and No 10 are so desperate they are preparing for a general election as a way out were dismissed as \u201cutter bollocks\u201d by a source at No 10. But with the prime minister unsure where to turn next for fear of further splitting her party, other ideas are emerging among Tory and Labour MPs, operating separately from the executive or from the party leaderships. Groups of MPs are devising plans to table motions that would suspend parliament\u2019s rules so they can draw up and pass Brexit legislation. Yvette Cooper is ready to push a plan that would require May to delay article 50 should no deal have been agreed by the start of March. Crucially, the government also has to table a \u201cneutral motion\u201d on the way forward on Brexit tomorrow, following last week\u2019s defeat. This motion can be amended by MPs. The MP Frank Field will table an amendment to it that calls for MPs to be given a free vote on a range of options to show which garners most support. The amendment says these should include a \u201creformed Northern Irish backstop, leaving the European Union with no deal, extending article 50, entering into a future Canada-style relationship with the European Union, entering into a future Norway-style relationship with the European Union, holding a new referendum, and being in a customs union with the European Union\u201d. With May\u2019s deal defeated, the Tories divided and cross-party talks led by No 10 going nowhere, it may just be that parliament can wrestle power from the executive and offer some hope of progress. \u201cIf we don\u2019t somehow take control,\u201d Field said \u201cI don\u2019t see what we talk about in parliament in the coming days \u2013 we will simply fall off the precipice.\u201d",

Britain will crash out of the EU without a withdrawal agreement or a transition period. This will mean the overnight termination of decades of legal and trading agreements with both our continent and the rest of the world, an outcome that will deal severe reputational damage to this country and unleash disruption for which it is not at all prepared. Or Britain\u2019s politicians will have to collectively confess that they cannot find a solution and seek to prolong or revoke the withdrawal process, damning us to sail on without landfall in sight unless this is accompanied by the promise of another referendum to resolve the deadlock.

This may not be a safe harbour, but the approval of a withdrawal agreement would be a port of sorts until the beginning of the next stage of the negotiations covering future relations.</p> <p>Securing a deal to remove Britain from the EU in an orderly fashion has been the defining challenge of Mrs May\u2019s premiership and parliament pronounced her an abject failure on Tuesday night.

Yet though her compass is smashed, she remains lashed to her broken helm.

Anna Soubry and the most ardent Tory Europhiles made temporary common cause with Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Brextremists. The Labour leader marched his party into the same No lobby as Boris Johnson, who rubbed shoulders there with Vince Cable and the Scottish Nationalists, each with very different and often completely contradictory motives for killing Mrs May\u2019s deal. When news reached the crowds in Parliament Square, the humiliation of the prime minister was cheered both by the gang from Leave Means Leave and by the throng who had come to clamour for a people\u2019s vote. Both those who want to reverse Brexit and those who yearn for the starkest of Brexits think that Mrs May\u2019s defeat paves the way to ultimate victory for their cause. Both cannot be correct.

One possible way forward is for her to cut her losses with the ultras on her side and try to find a majority in parliament by reaching across the aisle to MPs from opposition parties. This would require a dramatic tack to a softer version of Brexit and the erasure of some of her red lines. There is a Remainer wing of the cabinet who favour that approach; they have always tried to push their leader in the direction of a less abrupt Brexit. Mrs May has been trying to keep them happy and present herself as a reasonable woman by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat?page=with:block-5c3f8b21e4b058cfe6d915fd\" title=\"\">inviting opposition MPs</a> in for talks, but I don\u2019t think she is pursuing this avenue with any conviction. To broker a compromise that would attract support from other parties, she would have to display high levels of creativity and suppleness when these qualities have been entirely absent from her character. It is not exactly likely that a prime minister who has trumpeted obduracy as a virtue can suddenly become the emollient consensus-seeker. Even if she could change into a different person, it is desperately late. Too much poison has flowed, divisions have become too entrenched, too many of the other actors have painted themselves into irreconcilable positions.</p> <p>There are versions of a softer Brexit, such as embracing permanent membership of a customs union, which might attract some support from opposition MPs, but the numbers willing to do so would be lower than might once have been the case. Remainer MPs who could have embraced that sort of compromise a year ago will no longer do so, because they now think they have a chance of reversing Brexit altogether. At the same time, the inflammation of the passions on her own side has escalated the chances of the Tory party reacting to a softer Brexit by imploding. Another slew of resignations from the cabinet would be the least of it. \u201cThe Conservative party might well split in half,\u201d says one senior minister.</p> <p>To consider the destruction of her party and her government a risk worth taking, Mrs May would have to be really confident that Labour would deliver enough of its MPs to get a new Brexit deal through parliament. That would require a prime minister who trusts virtually no one in her own party to place her trust in Jeremy Corbyn, a man whose career and image are all about disdaining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/may-will-stick-to-brexit-principles-in-cross-party-talks-says-no-10\" title=\"\">flexibility</a> and compromise. The two of them cannot even agree on the terms of talks just as they previously could not even agree on a format for a TV debate. The working assumption in Number 10 is this: even if Mrs May were prepared to shift towards a softer withdrawal, the Labour leader will always find a fresh reason to reject whatever she comes up with because he wants this to be branded as a \u201cTory Brexit\u201d. It is hard to argue that this reading of Mr Corbyn is wrong.</p> <p>Absent Mrs May being capable of reaching a cross-party agreement, her plan B is to revert to plan A. Incredible as this might seem in the wake of such a crushing defeat, the prime minister thinks her least worst option is to try to breathe life back into the deal that parliament has pronounced dead. I am told by someone very familiar with her thinking that bringing back a tweaked version of her deal is the prime minister\u2019s preferred plan of action \u201cby a mile\u201d. To be successful, this would require 117 MPs to change their minds.</p> <p>Achieving that relies on two heroically optimistic assumptions. One is that the EU will make sufficient concessions, especially around the Northern Ireland backstop, to meet the demands of the Brexit fundamentalists. The second assumption is that these people will ever be content. Even if the EU were to say yes to what they currently say they want, on past form, the insatiable ultras are not people who can be trusted to take yes for an answer.</p> <p>Some MPs are working to effectively relieve the prime minister of command by taking control of the process away from her and handing it to parliament as a collective. Others would then get the responsibility for trying to locate a solution capable of assembling majority support \u2013 and then finding someone to go and try to negotiate it with the EU.</p> <p>If there is no majority for anything, then the choices become stark. Britain will career out of the EU with no deal or Brexit will have to be postponed pending another referendum to ask the people to deliver a verdict on this ocean of tears. The phantom ship and its spectral crew sail deeper into uncharted waters.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist</p>",

Another slew of resignations from the cabinet would be the least of it. \u201cThe Conservative party might well split in half,\u201d says one senior minister. To consider the destruction of her party and her government a risk worth taking, Mrs May would have to be really confident that Labour would deliver enough of its MPs to get a new Brexit deal through parliament. That would require a prime minister who trusts virtually no one in her own party to place her trust in Jeremy Corbyn, a man whose career and image are all about disdaining flexibility and compromise. The two of them cannot even agree on the terms of talks just as they previously could not even agree on a format for a TV debate. The working assumption in Number 10 is this: even if Mrs May were prepared to shift towards a softer withdrawal, the Labour leader will always find a fresh reason to reject whatever she comes up with because he wants this to be branded as a \u201cTory Brexit\u201d. It is hard to argue that this reading of Mr Corbyn is wrong. Absent Mrs May being capable of reaching a cross-party agreement, her plan B is to revert to plan A. Incredible as this might seem in the wake of such a crushing defeat, the prime minister thinks her least worst option is to try to breathe life back into the deal that parliament has pronounced dead. I am told by someone very familiar with her thinking that bringing back a tweaked version of her deal is the prime minister\u2019s preferred plan of action \u201cby a mile\u201d. To be successful, this would require 117 MPs to change their minds. Achieving that relies on two heroically optimistic assumptions. One is that the EU will make sufficient concessions, especially around the Northern Ireland backstop, to meet the demands of the Brexit fundamentalists. The second assumption is that these people will ever be content. Even if the EU were to say yes to what they currently say they want, on past form, the insatiable ultras are not people who can be trusted to take yes for an answer. Some MPs are working to effectively relieve the prime minister of command by taking control of the process away from her and handing it to parliament as a collective. Others would then get the responsibility for trying to locate a solution capable of assembling majority support \u2013 and then finding someone to go and try to negotiate it with the EU. If there is no majority for anything, then the choices become stark. Britain will career out of the EU with no deal or Brexit will have to be postponed pending another referendum to ask the people to deliver a verdict on this ocean of tears. The phantom ship and its spectral crew sail deeper into uncharted waters. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist",

Apart from discouraging brilliant young scientists from outside the UK, a hard Brexit could cripple the institute\u2019s economic underpinning, De Strooper believes. Britain has a first-class record in attracting research funds from the European Union; the money it pulls in greatly exceeds the cash it invests in research budgets for the EU. For example, in the period 2007-13 Britain paid a total of \u20ac5.4bn towards research, development and innovation activities in the EU.

Then with about a minute to go Pacquiao detonates a weapons-grade left hand flush on Broner\u2019s chin that sends the American reeling backwards. Broner is in trouble against the ropes and is doing anything to stem the tide, even grabbing Pacquiao\u2019s left leg. That\u2019s some beard on Broner. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 89-82 Broner)</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4412fee4b0197a614f6875\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T06:20:37.454Z\">6.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 8</strong></p> <p>Broner lands a few counter lefts early on, but mostly takes the eighth off as he recovers from that savage onslaught at the end of the seventh. Meanwhile, the inactive Pacquiao is letting his opponent off the hook by not pressing the action, but perhaps smart to not be reckless. Pacquiao wins the round easily. It\u2019s a simple case of inactivity on the American\u2019s part.</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 79-73 Broner)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c44123ae4b00173154a7b4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T06:16:47.363Z\">6.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 7</strong></p> <p>Pacquiao continues to throw and land more entering the second half of the fight. Broner lands the occasional counter but it\u2019s Pacquiao controlling the run of play. Then Pacquiao connects with massive left cross with Broner up against the ropes and Broner is hurt! His knees buckle and Broner is in trouble! He looks gassed. And Pacquiao is opening up as the crowd goes wild! Can Broner make it to the bell?

Man-ny!\u201d cascade down from the mezzanine, but Broner is picking up the pace in the fifth. Broner seems to have Pacquiao\u2019s timing down and is fighting with more confidence, but the work rate is simply not enough. He is warned a second time for putting the heel of his glove in Pacquiao\u2019s face during a clinch. Pacquiao throwing punches from all kinds of unorthodox angles and landing enough to win the round. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 50-45 Broner)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c440f2ce4b00173154a7b3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T06:03:29.907Z\">6.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 4</strong></p> <p>An excellent start to the fourth by Broner, who lands a hard counter right and a left hook. His best moments of the fight so far. Pacquiao connects with a straight left and a right hook that stuns Broner. Pacquiao simply throwing more and landing more. Broner lands a sharp right late in the round. It could go either way, but I\u2019ll give Pacquiao the edge as he\u2019s the guy pushing the fight. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 40-36 Broner)</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c440e4fe4b0197a614f685c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T05:59:48.557Z\">5.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 3</strong></p> <p>Pacquiao lands a left upstairs then opens up on Broner against the ropes until the American can wrap him up in a clinch. Pacquiao scoring with the left, showing vintage hand speed. He lands a flush shot to the body and he\u2019s doing so much with the left. Right now Pacquiao is overwhelming Broner with volume. It\u2019s three rounds to none, but Broner has not given up on setting up the counter.</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 30-27 Broner)</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c440d28e4b00173154a7b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-20T05:54:54.575Z\">5.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 2</strong></p> <p>Broner probing with the jab, but having trouble establishing it. Broner warned for shoving a forearm into Pacquiao\u2019s face. Pacquiao lands a right hook that sends Broner backwards and the crowd to their feet. Pacquaio, jabbing well, the clear aggressor here as Broner sits back waiting to counter. Broner is able to connect with a clean counter right as Pacquiao darts in.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks as always for following along and be sure to check out the full fight report. Adrien Broner\u2019s post-fight interview was ... something. Presented without comment. Pacquiao answers a handful of perfunctory questions from Showtime\u2019s Jim Gray about a fight that wasn\u2019t particularly interesting, either on paper or in how it played out. Then, inevitably, the conversation inevitably turns to a rematch with Floyd Mayweather Jr, the specter of which has loomed over this promotion from jump street. Does Manny want it? \u201cTell (Floyd) to come back to the ring and then we will fight,\u201d Pacquiao says. \u201cI\u2019m willing to fight him again, to fight Floyd Mayweather.\u201d Showtime\u2019s Gray then asks Mayweather if he will accept the challenge as a camera films him in the first row: \u201cA simple nod will do on the monitor.\u201d Mayweather looks away from the camera. This is pure WWE camp and it\u2019s a bit depressing to be honest. I can\u2019t imagine there was anything Floyd saw in Manny\u2019s performance tonight that suggests a rematch would play out any different than their first fight. But maybe that\u2019s the point. Pacquiao has defended his secondary welterweight title by a unanimous decision. The judges handed down scores of 117-111, 116-112 and 116-112. All three were closer than the Guardian\u2019s 119-109, but the outcome is no less correct. Round 12 No surprises in the 12th. Pacquiao continues to press the fight but Broner is on his bicycle with an eye on the clock like school is almost out. After the final bell, Broner throws his hands aloft in triumph and climbs a turnbuckle as boos rain down from the crowd. A troll till the last. This fight ended when Pacquiao landed that left cross in the seventh: it\u2019s when Broner stopped trying to win. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 119-109 Broner) Round 11 Pacquiao is moving forward and looking for the knockout but Broner, who appears more than content to run out the clock, is an unaccommodating dance partner. A smattering of boos from the crowd. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 109-100 Broner) Round 10 A slow round but Pacquiao doesn\u2019t need to do a whole lot to outwork Broner at this point. The American is no longer taking risks and is in full survival mode. Pacquiao still moving forward and peppering his opponent with jabs to the head and body. Easy round to score. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 99-91 Broner) Round 9 It\u2019s a familiar pattern for the first two minutes: Broner not throwing nearly enough punches as Pacquiao\u2019s steady work rate is more than enough to carry it. Then with about a minute to go Pacquiao detonates a weapons-grade left hand flush on Broner\u2019s chin that sends the American reeling backwards. Broner is in trouble against the ropes and is doing anything to stem the tide, even grabbing Pacquiao\u2019s left leg. That\u2019s some beard on Broner. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 89-82 Broner) Round 8 Broner lands a few counter lefts early on, but mostly takes the eighth off as he recovers from that savage onslaught at the end of the seventh. Meanwhile, the inactive Pacquiao is letting his opponent off the hook by not pressing the action, but perhaps smart to not be reckless. Pacquiao wins the round easily. It\u2019s a simple case of inactivity on the American\u2019s part. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 79-73 Broner) Round 7 Pacquiao continues to throw and land more entering the second half of the fight. Broner lands the occasional counter but it\u2019s Pacquiao controlling the run of play. Then Pacquiao connects with massive left cross with Broner up against the ropes and Broner is hurt! His knees buckle and Broner is in trouble! He looks gassed. And Pacquiao is opening up as the crowd goes wild! Can Broner make it to the bell? He makes it out of the round but what a round! Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 69-64 Broner) Round 6 More of the same in the sixth. But Broner catches Pacquiao lunging in with a sharp left hook followed by an uppercut in the final seconds of the round that might be enough to steal it. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Broner (Pacquiao 59-55 Broner) Round 5 Chants of \u201cMan-ny! Man-ny!\u201d cascade down from the mezzanine, but Broner is picking up the pace in the fifth. Broner seems to have Pacquiao\u2019s timing down and is fighting with more confidence, but the work rate is simply not enough. He is warned a second time for putting the heel of his glove in Pacquiao\u2019s face during a clinch. Pacquiao throwing punches from all kinds of unorthodox angles and landing enough to win the round. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 50-45 Broner) Round 4 An excellent start to the fourth by Broner, who lands a hard counter right and a left hook. His best moments of the fight so far. Pacquiao connects with a straight left and a right hook that stuns Broner. Pacquiao simply throwing more and landing more. Broner lands a sharp right late in the round. It could go either way, but I\u2019ll give Pacquiao the edge as he\u2019s the guy pushing the fight. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 40-36 Broner) Round 3 Pacquiao lands a left upstairs then opens up on Broner against the ropes until the American can wrap him up in a clinch. Pacquiao scoring with the left, showing vintage hand speed. He lands a flush shot to the body and he\u2019s doing so much with the left. Right now Pacquiao is overwhelming Broner with volume. It\u2019s three rounds to none, but Broner has not given up on setting up the counter. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 30-27 Broner) Round 2 Broner probing with the jab, but having trouble establishing it. Broner warned for shoving a forearm into Pacquiao\u2019s face. Pacquiao lands a right hook that sends Broner backwards and the crowd to their feet. Pacquaio, jabbing well, the clear aggressor here as Broner sits back waiting to counter. Broner is able to connect with a clean counter right as Pacquiao darts in. A bit closer than the first round but another one to Pacquiao. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 20-18 Broner) Round 1 Pacquiao, in the black trunks, probes with the left before he bursts forward throwing punches as Broner, wearing purple, white and gold, wraps him up. Pacquiao throwing punches in bunches early and lands a combination, but he\u2019s missing more than he\u2019s connecting. A good straight left hand by Pacquiao. Broner having trouble getting off, frustrated by his opponent\u2019s volume. The American finally lands a counter uppercut, but he\u2019s been badly outthrown and outlanded. Good body shot by Pacquiao. Clear round to the Filipino. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Broner (Pacquiao 10-9 Broner) The anthems have been performed and the fighters are making their entrances. First it\u2019s Broner, who enters to a medley of songs accompanied by dancers and pyrotechnics. He\u2019s joined for the final leg by the rapper G Herbo. Now here comes Manny to Survivor\u2019s Eye of the Tiger, his longtime ringwalk song when he was fighting here on the regular. We\u2019re told tonight\u2019s attendance at the MGM Grand Garden Arena is a sellout: 13,025. Marcus Browne has won a unanimous decision over Badou Jack. Scores were 117-110, 116-111 and 119-108. With the win, the Staten Island native has captured the vacant WBA interim light heavyweight title. (And before you ask: yes, they do make these up as they go along.) Next up: the main event between Manny Pacquiao and Adrien Broner. The 12-round co-main event between Badou Jack and Marcus Browne is into the championship rounds. Browne was already opening up a lead on the scorecards before Jack suffered a nasty cut above the bridge of his nose from an accidental clash of heads in the seventh round. Since then, Browne has teed off and the cut is only getting worse. Jack can\u2019t see and they\u2019ll have to think about stopping this one soon. Pacquiao and Broner will make their ringwalks after the conclusion of this one. Hello and welcome to the MGM Grand Garden Arena for tonight\u2019s welterweight showdown between Manny Pacquiao and Adrien Broner.

      "body": "<p>Think of Milan and you think of fashion. The first time I spent more than a few hours in the city, I roamed the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II \u2013 Italy\u2019s oldest shopping arcade, built in the 1860s and still home to the original Prada store, which was opened by the designer\u2019s grandfather Mario in 1913 \u2013 wishing that I was rich (or at least, not quite so broke). What on earth is a girl with an overdraft and a fierce lust for buttery leather supposed to do in a place where everyone is so enviably well-dressed? In Milan, even the nuns look chic. In the end, I bought only one thing: an ice-cold negroni in the Camparino, the lovely, high-ceilinged bar that has been in the Galleria almost as long as Prada (Davide Campari first threw open its doors in 1915).</p> <p>I still love the Galleria \u2013 wander through it as you walk from La Scala to the Duomo, which it conveniently connects \u2013 and I would tell anyone to have their evening aperitif at the Camparino, where the people-watching is unparalleled. But since my most recent visit, I\u2019m able to see Milan not only with the eyes of someone hell bent on giving their credit card a bashing, but with those of an art lover, too. If you like painting and sculpture \u2013 in particular, if you have any interest at all in Leonardo, the city\u2019s most famous adopted son \u2013 it is just the place, and one without the crowds and queues you can expect in, say, Florence or Venice.</p> <p>At the extraordinary Chiesa di San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore \u2013 a church where almost every surface is covered with frescos, some of them by Leonardo\u2019s pupil, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/06/leonardo-da-vinci-scholar-challenges-attribution-salvator-mundi-bernardino-luini\" title=\"\">Bernardino Luini</a> \u2013 I was amazed to find myself almost entirely alone. Secreted away deep in its interior, I might have been one of the nuns who, long ago, received the Eucharist through a tiny door in its altar, the better that no man see any part of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe467f49d11a42c6d5bca2303b43b883a0bc30f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe467f49d11a42c6d5bca2303b43b883a0bc30f8/0_134_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The heavily frescoed interior of church San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">High art \u2026 San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore church.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Schickert/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A good thing to do, if you\u2019ve only a weekend to spare, is to hire a specialist guide. Mine, Veronica Azimonti, was booked through my hotel, the Baglioni Carlton in Via Senato, from where we were able to walk to all the places I wanted to visit (and to a few of which I knew nothing until she mentioned them). She was wonderful: brisk, in the sense that she knew exactly where we had to be and when. But indulgent, too: happy to let me stare for a few long moments at the cakes in the window of <a href=\"https://www.pasticceriamarchesi.com/en/history.html\" title=\"\">Marchesi</a>, Milan\u2019s oldest pasticceria (perched on their old-fashioned stands, in shades of pink and green, they\u2019re straight out of a painting by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jun/04/wayne-thiebaud-1962-to-2017-white-cube-review-milton-avery-victoria-miro\" title=\"\">Wayne Thiebaud</a>).</p> <p>Where, I asked Veronica, is a good place for a lunchtime panini?

      "bodyText": "Think of Milan and you think of fashion. The first time I spent more than a few hours in the city, I roamed the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II \u2013 Italy\u2019s oldest shopping arcade, built in the 1860s and still home to the original Prada store, which was opened by the designer\u2019s grandfather Mario in 1913 \u2013 wishing that I was rich (or at least, not quite so broke). What on earth is a girl with an overdraft and a fierce lust for buttery leather supposed to do in a place where everyone is so enviably well-dressed? In Milan, even the nuns look chic. In the end, I bought only one thing: an ice-cold negroni in the Camparino, the lovely, high-ceilinged bar that has been in the Galleria almost as long as Prada (Davide Campari first threw open its doors in 1915). I still love the Galleria \u2013 wander through it as you walk from La Scala to the Duomo, which it conveniently connects \u2013 and I would tell anyone to have their evening aperitif at the Camparino, where the people-watching is unparalleled. But since my most recent visit, I\u2019m able to see Milan not only with the eyes of someone hell bent on giving their credit card a bashing, but with those of an art lover, too. If you like painting and sculpture \u2013 in particular, if you have any interest at all in Leonardo, the city\u2019s most famous adopted son \u2013 it is just the place, and one without the crowds and queues you can expect in, say, Florence or Venice. At the extraordinary Chiesa di San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore \u2013 a church where almost every surface is covered with frescos, some of them by Leonardo\u2019s pupil, Bernardino Luini \u2013 I was amazed to find myself almost entirely alone. Secreted away deep in its interior, I might have been one of the nuns who, long ago, received the Eucharist through a tiny door in its altar, the better that no man see any part of them. A good thing to do, if you\u2019ve only a weekend to spare, is to hire a specialist guide. Mine, Veronica Azimonti, was booked through my hotel, the Baglioni Carlton in Via Senato, from where we were able to walk to all the places I wanted to visit (and to a few of which I knew nothing until she mentioned them). She was wonderful: brisk, in the sense that she knew exactly where we had to be and when. But indulgent, too: happy to let me stare for a few long moments at the cakes in the window of Marchesi, Milan\u2019s oldest pasticceria (perched on their old-fashioned stands, in shades of pink and green, they\u2019re straight out of a painting by Wayne Thiebaud). Where, I asked Veronica, is a good place for a lunchtime panini? Quick as a flash, the answer came back: De Santis. It has two branches: one in the Corso Magenta, tiny and old school; and one on the top floor of La Rinascente, the chi-chi department store that stands right by the Duomo. But, anyway: art. What to see? I went first to the Pinacoteca di Brera, the city\u2019s main public gallery, now all the more gorgeous thanks to a refurbishment masterminded by its charismatic British-Canadian director, James Bradburne. There I saw, at last, Mantegna\u2019s astonishing Lamentation of Christ (1480), a painting notable as much for its weirdness as for its realism (the artist\u2019s composition, you notice, unnervingly draws all of your attention to the groin of Our Lord\u2019s dramatically foreshortened body). Also in the Palazzo di Brera is the Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense, a public library that sometimes doubles as a very special concert venue. That evening, I returned and saw the cellist Robert Cohen and pianist Clive Britton play a programme of Beethoven and Brahms, a treat that was only the more pleasurable for the chance it gave me to gawp at the Milanese intellectuals who made up the audience. I also recommend the Brera\u2019s majestic new cafe, where the espressos are strong, the pastries are sweet, and you may just feel \u2013 wear your grandmother\u2019s best silk scarf, should you be in possession of such a thing \u2013 that you\u2019re in a movie directed by Vittorio De Sica.

      "body": "<p>It must be tough being Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple. Well, perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be too sympathetic: in 2018 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/08/apple-ceo-tim-cook-2018-salary/\" title=\"\">he took home $15,682,219</a>, and his <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/08/30/tim-cook-apple-compensation/\" title=\"\">earnings since 2011</a> are estimated to be not far south of three quarters of a billion dollars. For that he has to run the world\u2019s most successful tech company. But that\u2019s probably a doddle compared with trying to manage the expectations of Wall Street and the world\u2019s media, both of which have an obsession with Apple that sometimes borders on psychosis.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that long, for example, since the fevered speculation about whether Apple would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\" title=\"\">the first trillion-dollar company</a> reached a climax on 2 August last year when it finally scaled that particular greasy pole. But since October its shares have dropped 20% and it\u2019s been overtaken by Microsoft \u2013 yes, ye olde Microsoft! \u2013 as the world\u2019s most valuable company. And then on 2 January, in a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/\" title=\"\">letter to investors</a>, Tim Cook revealed that he expected revenues for the final quarter of 2018 to be lower than originally forecast.</p> <p>Given that most of Apple\u2019s revenues come from its iPhone, this <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-stock-falls-after-earnings-as-investors-grapple-with-houdini-like-move-2018-11-02\" title=\"\">sent the tech commentariat into overdrive</a> \u2013 to the point where one level-headed observer had to point out that the sky hadn\u2019t fallen: all that had happened was that Apple shares were down a bit. And all this despite the fact that the other bits of the company\u2019s businesses (especially the watch, AirPods, services and its retail arm) were continuing to do nicely. Calmer analyses showed that the expected fall in revenues could be accounted for by two factors: the slowdown in the Chinese economy (together with some significant innovations by the Chinese internet giant WeChat); and the fact that consumers seem to be hanging on to their iPhones for longer, thereby slowing the steep upgrade path that had propelled Apple to its trillion-dollar valuation.</p> <p>What was most striking, though, was that the slowdown in iPhone sales should have taken journalists and analysts by surprise. Everyday experience should have told them that the iPhone picture was changing. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of friends, colleagues and acquaintances who are happily still using their four- or five-year-old iPhones. The devices still work perfectly for their purposes. Sure, the camera isn\u2019t as good as the one on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/04/apple-iphone-xs-review-battery-life-camera-design-performance\" title=\"\">iPhone XS</a>, but it\u2019s still good enough for everyday use. My trusty old iPhone 6 is still more than adequate for my needs. In fact, since the last couple of iOS updates and a replacement battery, it\u2019s as good as it ever was. And one of the things that would stop me upgrading is that I find its fingerprint recognition much more convenient for secure online activities than the much-touted face recognition in the newer iPhones would be. I\u2019ve been an early adopter and a gadget freak for as long as I can remember, so if I\u2019m not upgrading, there must be lots more like me.</p> <p>Besides, way back in August Bloomberg\u2019s Tim Culpan had published <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-08-28/tech-inventories-are-near-pre-crisis-levels-as-growth-is-slowing\" title=\"\">a very perceptive piece</a> under the headline \u201cDark clouds gather as tech stockpiles hit pre-crisis levels\u201d, which made it crystal clear that there was a slowdown coming. Mr Culpan, who takes an interest in unfashionable topics like supply chains, had spotted that inventories were uncharacteristically high in the companies that supply parts to smartphone manufacturers. So it followed as the night the day that those same manufacturers were expecting to sell fewer phones.</p> <p>The significance of this, as pointed out by <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com\" title=\"\">Benedict Evans</a> \u2013 an acute observer of these things who produces an unmissable weekly newsletter \u2013 is that we\u2019re approaching \u201cpeak smartphone\u201d. There are 5.5 billion adults on Earth, of whom 5 billion have a mobile phone and between 3.5 billion and 4 billion have a smartphone, of which between 800 and 900m are iPhones. \u201cThe mobile market is reaching saturation,\u201d writes Evans, \u201cand so is the smartphone market, and Apple has won the high end of the smartphone market.

      "bodyText": "It must be tough being Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple. Well, perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be too sympathetic: in 2018 he took home $15,682,219, and his earnings since 2011 are estimated to be not far south of three quarters of a billion dollars. For that he has to run the world\u2019s most successful tech company. But that\u2019s probably a doddle compared with trying to manage the expectations of Wall Street and the world\u2019s media, both of which have an obsession with Apple that sometimes borders on psychosis. It\u2019s not that long, for example, since the fevered speculation about whether Apple would be the first trillion-dollar company reached a climax on 2 August last year when it finally scaled that particular greasy pole. But since October its shares have dropped 20% and it\u2019s been overtaken by Microsoft \u2013 yes, ye olde Microsoft! \u2013 as the world\u2019s most valuable company. And then on 2 January, in a letter to investors, Tim Cook revealed that he expected revenues for the final quarter of 2018 to be lower than originally forecast. Given that most of Apple\u2019s revenues come from its iPhone, this sent the tech commentariat into overdrive \u2013 to the point where one level-headed observer had to point out that the sky hadn\u2019t fallen: all that had happened was that Apple shares were down a bit. And all this despite the fact that the other bits of the company\u2019s businesses (especially the watch, AirPods, services and its retail arm) were continuing to do nicely. Calmer analyses showed that the expected fall in revenues could be accounted for by two factors: the slowdown in the Chinese economy (together with some significant innovations by the Chinese internet giant WeChat); and the fact that consumers seem to be hanging on to their iPhones for longer, thereby slowing the steep upgrade path that had propelled Apple to its trillion-dollar valuation. What was most striking, though, was that the slowdown in iPhone sales should have taken journalists and analysts by surprise. Everyday experience should have told them that the iPhone picture was changing. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of friends, colleagues and acquaintances who are happily still using their four- or five-year-old iPhones. The devices still work perfectly for their purposes. Sure, the camera isn\u2019t as good as the one on the iPhone XS, but it\u2019s still good enough for everyday use. My trusty old iPhone 6 is still more than adequate for my needs. In fact, since the last couple of iOS updates and a replacement battery, it\u2019s as good as it ever was. And one of the things that would stop me upgrading is that I find its fingerprint recognition much more convenient for secure online activities than the much-touted face recognition in the newer iPhones would be. I\u2019ve been an early adopter and a gadget freak for as long as I can remember, so if I\u2019m not upgrading, there must be lots more like me. Besides, way back in August Bloomberg\u2019s Tim Culpan had published a very perceptive piece under the headline \u201cDark clouds gather as tech stockpiles hit pre-crisis levels\u201d, which made it crystal clear that there was a slowdown coming. Mr Culpan, who takes an interest in unfashionable topics like supply chains, had spotted that inventories were uncharacteristically high in the companies that supply parts to smartphone manufacturers. So it followed as the night the day that those same manufacturers were expecting to sell fewer phones. The significance of this, as pointed out by Benedict Evans \u2013 an acute observer of these things who produces an unmissable weekly newsletter \u2013 is that we\u2019re approaching \u201cpeak smartphone\u201d. There are 5.5 billion adults on Earth, of whom 5 billion have a mobile phone and between 3.5 billion and 4 billion have a smartphone, of which between 800 and 900m are iPhones. \u201cThe mobile market is reaching saturation,\u201d writes Evans, \u201cand so is the smartphone market, and Apple has won the high end of the smartphone market. This is not \u2018the fall of Apple\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s just the shift of smartphones to boring maturity, as we look for what\u2019s next.\u201d Which of course is what those wretches who made the trek to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas recently were trying to find out. What\u2019s going to be the New New Thing? And the heartening thing \u2013 at least for this columnist \u2013 is that nobody has a clue. Plus \u00e7a change.

Crucially, one part of the draft wording of the Declaration of Independence \u2013 \u201cthe rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people\u201d \u2013 was shot down as too pro-slave.

But did anyone see coming that first smidgen of a hint of something more\u2026 between Adam and Karen? Honestly? Really? True Detective began its belated third season, after a very dubious second, with an absolutely winning double bill, gone back to its premise. A crime. A cop or two cops, possibly compromised. This series is immensely unafraid to ramp up the tension \u2013 bass music getting into your bones, cops picking through childish raffia wicca dolls in a cloying, dripping cave \u2013 then suddenly fizzle out. Just fizzle. As in life. This is brilliant, and the timeshifts entirely understandable, and Mahershala Ali simply hooks the eye throughout. It\u2019s slow but mesmeric and draws you utterly in for hours. I\u2019m hooked, again. I thought it great that Is This Sexual Harassment? had migrated from BBC Three, where some people can\u2019t watch it, to BBC One, albeit shown at an insultingly late hour. Which was wrong, because some older people could have learned a lot. They brought young people in to debate, over three days, a film, along the lines of a dire corporate video (as if there\u2019s any other kind) of alleged sexual harassment and the eventual tribunal. The young opened this old\u2019s eyes. They were wrong, at first \u2013 too quick to judge; then right; then wrong. Ultimately, right. Crucially, they allowed the new information to muscle out their own prejudices. They changed their minds. Which so, so many can\u2019t.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s not surprising that the 12 short stories in Mazen Maarouf\u2019s first collection, <em>Jokes for the Gunmen</em>, largely take place in nameless, dream-like cities. Maarouf\u2019s life has taken an unconventional path: he was born in Beirut to Palestinian parents who had fled the Lebanese war, then worked as a teacher of chemistry and physics before moving to Reykjavik, where he has become the foremost translator of Icelandic literature into Arabic. He has also written three books of poetry and two collections of short stories (the second has yet to appear in English). <em>Jokes for the Gunmen</em> won the AlMultaqa prize in 2016, a $20,000 pan-Arab award for the short story.</p> <p>Maarouf\u2019s unplaceable cities serve the same purpose as the locations of many of Mohsin Hamid\u2019s novels: the reader can imagine these dark and violent places as San Salvador or Sana\u2019a, as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez or Bangui. The first, titular story, which is by some distance the longest in the collection, is told from the perspective of a young man who attempts to negotiate the arbitrary and capricious rules of life in a city where bombs rain down indiscriminately and the \u201cgunmen\u201d maintain an uneasy hold on power. The boy\u2019s father, who runs a laundry, is \u201cso weak\u2026 so cowardly\u201d.</p> <p>The unnamed boy sees a street-vendor with a glass eye who doesn\u2019t appear to be harassed by the gunmen; he surmises that the glass eye must be some form of enchantment and sets about attempting to procure one for his father. He tries to auction off his twin brother\u2019s organs; arranges for a \u201chippopotamus\u201d (one of the tough guys at school) to guard his father; waters a pepper plant in the hope that the peppers contain the souls of his family.</p> <p>These are a selection of typically bizarre ideas in a book that is full of visionary strangeness. There\u2019s a couple who keep a blood clot named Munir in an aquarium and attempt to raise it as a child; an elderly abattoir worker who insists on dressing as a matador and each day must \u201cchoose the largest cow, pounce on it and strangle it with his bare hands\u201d; there\u2019s a man whose arms are blown off when a vacuum bomb falls on the bar in which he DJs and only regrow \u201clike mushrooms\u201d through the operation of a magical music box. The final story, Juan and Ausa, is about a pair of lovers who enter an uneasy menage a quatre with a young girl and a bull.</p> <p>Sitting behind Maarouf\u2019s work is the clear influence of one of the masters of the short form, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/oct/19/short-story-julio-cortazar\" title=\"\">Julio Cort\u00e1zar</a>. Like Maarouf, Cort\u00e1zar grew up in a world in which the threat of violence was everywhere, where the rules governing who lived and who died appeared bafflingly unpredictable. The only response to such a monstrous existence is the kind of dark laughter that we find in Cort\u00e1zar, in Beckett, in Kafka and in Brecht.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not surprising that the 12 short stories in Mazen Maarouf\u2019s first collection, Jokes for the Gunmen, largely take place in nameless, dream-like cities. Maarouf\u2019s life has taken an unconventional path: he was born in Beirut to Palestinian parents who had fled the Lebanese war, then worked as a teacher of chemistry and physics before moving to Reykjavik, where he has become the foremost translator of Icelandic literature into Arabic. He has also written three books of poetry and two collections of short stories (the second has yet to appear in English). Jokes for the Gunmen won the AlMultaqa prize in 2016, a $20,000 pan-Arab award for the short story. Maarouf\u2019s unplaceable cities serve the same purpose as the locations of many of Mohsin Hamid\u2019s novels: the reader can imagine these dark and violent places as San Salvador or Sana\u2019a, as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez or Bangui. The first, titular story, which is by some distance the longest in the collection, is told from the perspective of a young man who attempts to negotiate the arbitrary and capricious rules of life in a city where bombs rain down indiscriminately and the \u201cgunmen\u201d maintain an uneasy hold on power. The boy\u2019s father, who runs a laundry, is \u201cso weak\u2026 so cowardly\u201d. The unnamed boy sees a street-vendor with a glass eye who doesn\u2019t appear to be harassed by the gunmen; he surmises that the glass eye must be some form of enchantment and sets about attempting to procure one for his father. He tries to auction off his twin brother\u2019s organs; arranges for a \u201chippopotamus\u201d (one of the tough guys at school) to guard his father; waters a pepper plant in the hope that the peppers contain the souls of his family. These are a selection of typically bizarre ideas in a book that is full of visionary strangeness. There\u2019s a couple who keep a blood clot named Munir in an aquarium and attempt to raise it as a child; an elderly abattoir worker who insists on dressing as a matador and each day must \u201cchoose the largest cow, pounce on it and strangle it with his bare hands\u201d; there\u2019s a man whose arms are blown off when a vacuum bomb falls on the bar in which he DJs and only regrow \u201clike mushrooms\u201d through the operation of a magical music box. The final story, Juan and Ausa, is about a pair of lovers who enter an uneasy menage a quatre with a young girl and a bull. Sitting behind Maarouf\u2019s work is the clear influence of one of the masters of the short form, Julio Cort\u00e1zar. Like Maarouf, Cort\u00e1zar grew up in a world in which the threat of violence was everywhere, where the rules governing who lived and who died appeared bafflingly unpredictable. The only response to such a monstrous existence is the kind of dark laughter that we find in Cort\u00e1zar, in Beckett, in Kafka and in Brecht. Maarouf\u2019s stories are deeply peculiar, occasionally touching and often very funny. They are also beautifully translated by Jonathan Wright, who renders Maarouf\u2019s language in sprightly, elegant prose. \u2022 Jokes for the Gunmen by Mazen Maarouf is published by Granta (\u00a310.99).

      "body": "<p>We\u2019re living through the most profound transformation in our information environment since Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s invention of printing in circa 1439. And the problem with living through a revolution is that it\u2019s impossible to take the long view of what\u2019s happening. Hindsight is the only exact science in this business, and in that long run we\u2019re all dead. Printing shaped and transformed societies over the next four centuries, but nobody in Mainz (Gutenberg\u2019s home town) in, say, 1495 could have known that his technology would (among other things): fuel the Reformation and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/29/why-we-need-a-21st-century-martin-luther-to-challenge-church-of-technology-95-theses\" title=\"\">undermine the authority of the mighty Catholic church</a>; enable the rise of what we now recognise as modern science; create unheard-of professions and industries; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Rt1k13\" title=\"\">change the shape of our brains</a>; and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SAYZhS\" title=\"\">even recalibrate</a> our conceptions of childhood. And yet printing did all this and more.</p> <p>Why choose 1495? Because we\u2019re about the same distance into our revolution, the one kicked off by digital technology and networking. And although it\u2019s now gradually dawning on us that this really is a big deal and that epochal social and economic changes are under way, we\u2019re as clueless about where it\u2019s heading and what\u2019s driving it as the citizens of Mainz were in 1495.</p> <p>That\u2019s not for want of trying, mind. Library shelves groan under the weight of books about what digital technology is doing to us and our world. Lots of scholars are thinking, researching and writing about this stuff. But they\u2019re like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant\" title=\"\">blind men trying to describe the elephant</a> in the old fable: everyone has only a partial view, and nobody has the whole picture. So our contemporary state of awareness is \u2013 as Manuel Castells, the great scholar of cyberspace once put it \u2013 one of \u201cinformed bewilderment\u201d.</p> <p>Which is why the arrival of Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s new book is such a big event. Many years ago \u2013 in 1988, to be precise \u2013 as one of the first female professors at Harvard Business School to hold an endowed chair she published a landmark book, <em>The Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power</em>, which changed the way we thought about the impact of computerisation on organisations and on work. It provided the most insightful account up to that time of how digital technology was changing the work of both managers and workers. And then Zuboff appeared to go quiet, though she was clearly incubating something bigger. The first hint of what was to come was a pair of startling essays \u2013 <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754\" title=\"\">one in an academic journal</a> in 2015, the <a href=\"https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616.html\" title=\"\">other in a German newspaper</a> in 2016. What these revealed was that she had come up with a new lens through which to view what Google, Facebook et al were doing \u2013 nothing less than spawning a new variant of capitalism. Those essays promised a more comprehensive expansion of this Big Idea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"51e78ded-2ab7-43ca-b893-f92514d7b683\"         data-atom-type=\"profile\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>And now it has arrived \u2013 the most ambitious attempt yet to paint the bigger picture and to explain how the effects of digitisation that we are now experiencing as individuals and citizens have come about.</p> <p>The headline story is that it\u2019s not so much about the nature of digital technology as about a new mutant form of capitalism that has found a way to use tech for its purposes. The name Zuboff has given to the new variant is \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d. It works by providing free services that billions of people cheerfully use, enabling the providers of those services to monitor the behaviour of those users in astonishing detail \u2013 often without their explicit consent.</p> <p>\u201cSurveillance capitalism,\u201d she writes, \u201cunilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioural data. Although some of these data are applied to service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary <em>behavioural surplus</em>, fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as \u2018machine intelligence\u2019, and fabricated into <em>prediction products</em> that anticipate what you will do now, soon, and later. Finally, these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace that I call <em>behavioural futures markets</em>. Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are willing to lay bets on our future behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>While the general modus operandi of Google, Facebook et al has been known and understood (at least by some people) for a while, what has been missing \u2013 and what Zuboff provides \u2013 is the insight and scholarship to situate them in a wider context. She points out that while most of us think that we are dealing merely with algorithmic inscrutability, in fact what confronts us is the latest phase in capitalism\u2019s long evolution \u2013 from the making of products, to mass production, to managerial capitalism, to services, to financial capitalism, and now to the exploitation of behavioural predictions covertly derived from the surveillance of users. In that sense, her vast (660-page) book is a continuation of a tradition that includes Adam Smith, Max Weber, Karl Polanyi and \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 Karl Marx.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Digital technology is separating the citizens in all societies into two groups: the watchers and the watched</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Viewed from this perspective, the behaviour of the digital giants looks rather different from the roseate hallucinations of <em>Wired</em> magazine. What one sees instead is a colonising ruthlessness of which John D Rockefeller would have been proud. First of all there was the arrogant appropriation of users\u2019 behavioural data \u2013 viewed as a free resource, there for the taking. Then the use of patented methods to extract or infer data even when users had explicitly denied permission, followed by the use of technologies that were opaque by design and fostered user ignorance.</p> <p>And, of course, there is also the fact that the entire project was conducted in what was effectively lawless \u2013 or at any rate law-free \u2013 territory. Thus Google decided that it would digitise and store every book ever printed, regardless of copyright issues. Or that it would photograph every street and house on the planet without asking anyone\u2019s permission. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Beacon\" title=\"\">Facebook launched its infamous \u201cbeacons\u201d,</a> which reported a user\u2019s online activities and published them to others\u2019 news feeds without the knowledge of the user. And so on, in accordance with the disrupter\u2019s mantra that \u201cit is easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission\u201d.</p> <p>When the security expert Bruce Schneier wrote that \u201csurveillance is the business model of the internet\u201d he was really only hinting at the reality that Zuboff has now illuminated. The combination of state surveillance and its capitalist counterpart means that digital technology is separating the citizens in all societies into two groups: the watchers (invisible, unknown and unaccountable) and the watched. This has profound consequences for democracy because asymmetry of knowledge translates into asymmetries of power. But whereas most democratic societies have at least some degree of oversight of state surveillance, we currently have almost no regulatory oversight of its privatised counterpart. This is intolerable.</p> <p>And it won\u2019t be easy to fix because it requires us to tackle the essence of the problem \u2013 the logic of accumulation implicit in surveillance capitalism. That means that self-regulation is a nonstarter. \u201cDemanding privacy from surveillance capitalists,\u201d says Zuboff, \u201cor lobbying for an end to commercial surveillance on the internet is like asking old Henry Ford to make each Model T by hand. It\u2019s like asking a giraffe to shorten its neck, or a cow to give up chewing. These demands are existential threats that violate the basic mechanisms of the entity\u2019s survival.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Age of Surveillance Capital</em> is a striking and illuminating book. A fellow reader remarked to me that it reminded him of Thomas Piketty\u2019s magnum opus, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DhkOhz\" title=\"\">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</a></em>, in that it opens one\u2019s eyes to things we ought to have noticed, but hadn\u2019t. And if we fail to tame the new capitalist mutant rampaging through our societies then we will only have ourselves to blame, for we can no longer plead ignorance.</p> <h2>Ten questions for Shoshana Zuboff: \u2018Larry Page saw that human experience could be Google\u2019s virgin wood\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc0c279795e8739a24dde733f69207419870daba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc0c279795e8739a24dde733f69207419870daba/0_415_4724_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Continuing a tradition that includes Adam Smith, Max Weber, Karl Polanyi, Marx\u2026 Shoshana Zuboff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Continuing a tradition that includes Adam Smith, Max Weber, Karl Polanyi, Marx\u2026 Shoshana Zuboff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Paige Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>John Naughton: At the moment, the world is obsessed with Facebook. But as you tell it, Google was the prime mover.</strong></p> <p><strong>Shoshana Zuboff: </strong>Surveillance capitalism is a human creation. It lives in history, not in technological inevitability. It was pioneered and elaborated through trial and error at Google in much the same way that the Ford Motor Company discovered the new economics of mass production or General Motors discovered the logic of managerial capitalism.</p> <p>Surveillance capitalism was invented around 2001 as the solution to financial emergency in the teeth of the dotcom bust when the fledgling company faced the loss of investor confidence. As investor pressure mounted, Google\u2019s leaders abandoned their declared antipathy toward advertising. Instead they decided to boost ad revenue by using their exclusive access to user data logs (once known as \u201cdata exhaust\u201d) in combination with their already substantial analytical capabilities and computational power, to generate predictions of user click-through rates, taken as a signal of an ad\u2019s relevance.</p> <p>Operationally this meant that Google would both repurpose its growing cache of behavioural data, now put to work as a behavioural data surplus, and develop methods to aggressively seek new sources of this surplus.</p> <p>The company developed new methods of secret surplus capture that could uncover data that users intentionally opted to keep private, as well as to infer extensive personal information that users did not or would not provide. And this surplus would then be analysed for hidden meanings that could predict click-through behaviour. The surplus data became the basis for new predictions markets called targeted advertising.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b40e3c77e4675b2552a537b90481b003f6f87e78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b40e3c77e4675b2552a537b90481b003f6f87e78/0_0_6132_8176/750.jpg\" alt=\"Sheryl Sandberg, says Zuboff, played the role of Typhoid Mary, bringing surveillance capitalism from Google to Facebook.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheryl Sandberg, says Zuboff, played the role of Typhoid Mary, bringing surveillance capitalism from Google to Facebook.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here was the origin of surveillance capitalism in an unprecedented and lucrative brew: behavioural surplus, data science, material infrastructure, computational power, algorithmic systems, and automated platforms. As click-through rates skyrocketed, advertising quickly became as important as search. Eventually it became the cornerstone of a new kind of commerce that depended upon online surveillance at scale.</p> <p>The success of these new mechanisms only became visible when Google went public in 2004. That\u2019s when it finally revealed that between 2001 and its 2004 IPO, revenues increased by 3,590%.</p> <p><strong>JN:</strong> <strong>So surveillance capitalism started with advertising, but then became more general?</strong></p> <p><strong>SZ:</strong> Surveillance capitalism is no more limited to advertising than mass production was limited to the fabrication of the Ford Model T. It quickly became the default model for capital accumulation in Silicon Valley, embraced by nearly every startup and app. And it was a Google executive \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sheryl-sandberg\" title=\"\">Sheryl Sandberg</a> \u2013 who played the role of Typhoid Mary, bringing surveillance capitalism from Google to Facebook, when she signed on as Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s number two in 2008. By now it\u2019s no longer restricted to individual companies or even to the internet sector. It has spread across a wide range of products, services, and economic sectors, including insurance, retail, healthcare, finance, entertainment, education, transportation, and more, birthing whole new ecosystems of suppliers, producers, customers, market-makers, and market players. Nearly every product or service that begins with the word \u201csmart\u201d or \u201cpersonalised\u201d, every internet-enabled device, every \u201cdigital assistant\u201d, is simply a supply-chain interface for the unobstructed flow of behavioural data on its way to predicting our futures in a surveillance economy.</p> <p><strong>JN:</strong> <strong>In this story of conquest and appropriation, the term \u201cdigital natives\u201d takes on a new meaning\u2026</strong></p> <p><strong>SZ:</strong> Yes, \u201cdigital natives\u201d is a tragically ironic phrase. I am fascinated by the structure of colonial conquest, especially the first Spaniards who stumbled into the Caribbean islands. Historians call it the \u201cconquest pattern\u201d, which unfolds in three phases: legalistic measures to provide the invasion with a gloss of justification, a declaration of territorial claims, and the founding of a town to legitimate the declaration. Back then Columbus simply declared the islands as the territory of the Spanish monarchy and the pope.</p> <p>The sailors could not have imagined that they were writing the first draft of a pattern that would echo across space and time to a digital 21st century. The first surveillance capitalists also conquered by declaration. They simply declared our private experience to be theirs for the taking, for translation into data for their private ownership and their proprietary knowledge. They relied on misdirection and rhetorical camouflage, with secret declarations that we could neither understand nor contest.</p> <p>Google began by unilaterally declaring that the world wide web was its to take for its search engine. Surveillance capitalism originated in a second declaration that claimed our private experience for its revenues that flow from telling and selling our fortunes to other businesses. In both cases, it took without asking. Page [Larry, Google co-founder] foresaw that surplus operations would move beyond the online milieu to the real world, where data on human experience would be free for the taking. As it turns out his vision perfectly reflected the history of capitalism, marked by taking things that live outside the market sphere and declaring their new life as market commodities. </p> <p>We were caught off guard by surveillance capitalism because there was no way that we could have imagined its action, any more than the early peoples of the Caribbean could have foreseen the rivers of blood that would flow from their hospitality toward the sailors who appeared out of thin air waving the banner of the Spanish monarchs. Like the Caribbean people, we faced something truly unprecedented.</p> <p>Once we searched Google, but now Google searches us. Once we thought of digital services as free, but now surveillance capitalists think of us as free.</p> <p><strong>JN:</strong> <strong>Then there\u2019s the \u201cinevitability\u201d narrative \u2013 technological determinism on steroids.</strong></p> <p><strong>SZ:</strong> In my early fieldwork in the computerising offices and factories of the late 1970s and 80s, I discovered the duality of information technology: its capacity to automate but also to \u201cinformate\u201d, which I use to mean to translate things, processes, behaviours, and so forth into information. This duality set information technology apart from earlier generations of technology: information technology produces new knowledge territories by virtue of its informating capability, always turning the world into information. The result is that these new knowledge territories become the subject of political conflict. The first conflict is over the distribution of knowledge: \u201cWho knows?\u201d The second is about authority: \u201cWho decides who knows?\u201d The third is about power: \u201cWho decides who decides who knows?\u201d</p> <p>Now the same dilemmas of knowledge, authority and power have surged over the walls of our offices, shops and factories to flood each one of us\u2026 and our societies. Surveillance capitalists were the first movers in this new world. They declared their right to know, to decide who knows, and to decide who decides. In this way they have come to dominate what I call \u201cthe division of learning in society\u201d, which is now the central organising principle of the 21st-century social order, just as the division of labour was the key organising principle of society in the industrial age.</p> <p><strong>JN: So the big story is not really the technology per se but the fact that it has spawned a new variant of capitalism that is enabled by the </strong><strong>technology?</strong></p> <p><strong>SZ: </strong>Larry Page grasped that human experience could be Google\u2019s virgin wood, that it could be extracted at no extra cost online and at very low cost out in the real world. For today\u2019s owners of surveillance capital the experiential realities of bodies, thoughts and feelings are as virgin and blameless as nature\u2019s once-plentiful meadows, rivers, oceans and forests before they fell to the market dynamic. We have no formal control over these processes because we are not essential to the new market action. Instead we are exiles from our own behaviour, denied access to or control over knowledge derived from its dispossession by others for others. Knowledge, authority and power rest with surveillance capital, for which we are merely \u201chuman natural resources\u201d. We are the native peoples now whose claims to self-determination have vanished from the maps of our own experience.</p> <p>While it is impossible to imagine surveillance capitalism without the digital, it is easy to imagine the digital without surveillance capitalism. The point cannot be emphasised enough: surveillance capitalism is not technology. Digital technologies can take many forms and have many effects, depending upon the social and economic logics that bring them to life. Surveillance capitalism relies on algorithms and sensors, machine intelligence and platforms, but it is not the same as any of those.</p> <p><strong>JN: Where does surveillance capitalism go from here?</strong></p> <p><strong>SZ:</strong> Surveillance capitalism moves from a focus on individual users to a focus on populations, like cities, and eventually on society as a whole. Think of the capital that can be attracted to futures markets in which population predictions evolve to approximate certainty.</p> <p>This has been a learning curve for surveillance capitalists, driven by competition over prediction products. First they learned that the more surplus the better the prediction, which led to economies of scale in supply efforts. Then they learned that the more varied the surplus the higher its predictive value. This new drive toward economies of scope sent them from the desktop to mobile, out into the world: your drive, run, shopping, search for a parking space, your blood and face, and always\u2026 location, location, location.</p> <p>The evolution did not stop there. Ultimately they understood that the most predictive behavioural data comes from what I call \u201ceconomies of action\u201d, as systems are designed to intervene in the state of play and actually modify behaviour, shaping it toward desired commercial outcomes. We saw the experimental development of this new \u201cmeans of behavioural modification\u201d in <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full\" title=\"\">Facebook\u2019s contagion experiments</a> and the Google-incubated augmented reality game <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Democracy has slept, while surveillance capitalists amassed unprecedented concentrations of knowledge and power</p> <footer> <cite>Shoshana Zuboff</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is no longer enough to automate information flows about us; the goal now is to automate us. These processes are meticulously designed to produce ignorance by circumventing individual awareness and thus eliminate any possibility of self-determination. As one data scientist explained to me, \u201cWe can engineer the context around a particular behaviour and force change that way\u2026 We are learning how to write the music, and then we let the music make them dance.\u201d</p> <p>This power to shape behaviour for others\u2019 profit or power is entirely self-authorising. It has no foundation in democratic or moral legitimacy, as it usurps decision rights and erodes the processes of individual autonomy that are essential to the function of a democratic society. The message here is simple: Once I was mine. Now I am theirs.</p> <p><strong>JN:</strong> <strong>What are the implications for democracy?</strong></p> <p><strong>SZ:</strong> During the past two decades surveillance capitalists have had a pretty free run, with hardly any interference from laws and regulations. Democracy has slept while surveillance capitalists amassed unprecedented concentrations of knowledge and power. These dangerous asymmetries are institutionalised in their monopolies of data science, their dominance of machine intelligence, which is surveillance capitalism\u2019s \u201cmeans of production\u201d, their ecosystems of suppliers and customers, their lucrative prediction markets, their ability to shape the behaviour of individuals and populations, their ownership and control of our channels for social participation, and their vast capital reserves. We enter the 21st century marked by this stark inequality in the division of learning: they know more about us than we know about ourselves or than we know about them. These new forms of social inequality are inherently antidemocratic.</p> <p>At the same time, surveillance capitalism diverges from the history of market capitalism in key ways, and this has inhibited democracy\u2019s normal response mechanisms. One of these is that surveillance capitalism abandons the organic reciprocities with people that in the past have helped to embed capitalism in society and tether it, however imperfectly, to society\u2019s interests. First, surveillance capitalists no longer rely on people as consumers. Instead, supply and demand orients the surveillance capitalist firm to businesses intent on anticipating the behaviour of populations, groups and individuals. Second, by historical standards the large surveillance capitalists employ relatively few people compared with their unprecedented computational resources. General Motors employed more people during the height of the Great Depression than either Google or Facebook employs at their heights of market capitalisation. Finally, surveillance capitalism depends upon undermining individual self-determination, autonomy and decision rights for the sake of an unobstructed flow of behavioural data to feed markets that are about us but not for us.</p> <p>This antidemocratic and anti-egalitarian juggernaut is best described as a market-driven coup from above: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse of digital technology. On the strength of its annexation of human experience, this coup achieves exclusive concentrations of knowledge and power that sustain privileged influence over the division of learning in society. It is a form of tyranny that feeds on people but is not of the people. Paradoxically, this coup is celebrated as \u201cpersonalisation\u201d, although it defiles, ignores, overrides, and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6019c0d6a3736314ec72c7686dc78e26082f3851\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6019c0d6a3736314ec72c7686dc78e26082f3851/0_0_2075_2632/788.jpg\" alt=\"surveillance capitalism illustration\" width=\"788\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The power to shape behaviour for others\u2019 profit or power is entirely self-authorising,\u2019 says Zuboff. \u2018It has no foundation in democratic or moral legitimacy.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Lynsey Irvine/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>JN:</strong> <strong>Our societies seem transfixed by all this: we are like rabbits paralysed in the headlights of an oncoming car.</strong></p> <p><strong>SZ:</strong> Despite surveillance capitalism\u2019s domination of the digital milieu and its illegitimate power to take private experience and to shape human behaviour, most people find it difficult to withdraw, and many ponder if it is even possible. This does not mean, however, that we are foolish, lazy, or hapless. On the contrary, in my book I explore numerous reasons that explain how surveillance capitalists got away with creating the strategies that keep us paralysed. These include the historical, political and economic conditions that allowed them to succeed. And we\u2019ve already discussed some of the other key reasons, including the nature of the unprecedented, conquest by declaration. Other significant reasons are the need for inclusion, identification with tech leaders and their projects, social persuasion dynamics, and a sense of inevitability, helplessness and resignation. </p> <p>We are trapped in an involuntary merger of personal necessity and economic extraction, as the same channels that we rely upon for daily logistics, social interaction, work, education, healthcare, access to products and services, and much more, now double as supply chain operations for surveillance capitalism\u2019s surplus flows. The result is that the choice mechanisms we have traditionally associated with the private realm are eroded or vitiated. There can be no exit from processes that are intentionally designed to bypass individual awareness and produce ignorance, especially when these are the very same processes upon which we must depend for effective daily life. So our participation is best explained in terms of necessity, dependency, the foreclosure of alternatives, and enforced ignorance.</p> <p><strong>JN:</strong> <strong>Doesn\u2019t all this mean that regulation that just focuses on the technology is misguided and doomed to fail? What should we be doing to get a grip on this before it\u2019s too late?</strong></p> <p><strong>SZ:</strong> The tech leaders desperately want us to believe that technology is the inevitable force here, and their hands are tied. But there is a rich history of digital applications before surveillance capitalism that really were empowering and consistent with democratic values. Technology is the puppet, but surveillance capitalism is the puppet master.</p> <p>Surveillance capitalism is a human-made phenomenon and it is in the realm of politics that it must be confronted. The resources of our democratic institutions must be mobilised, including our elected officials. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\" title=\"\">GDPR</a> [a recent EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU] is a good start, and time will tell if we can build on that sufficiently to help found and enforce a new paradigm of information capitalism. Our societies have tamed the dangerous excesses of raw capitalism before, and we must do it again.</p> <p>While there is no simple five-year action plan, much as we yearn for that, there are some things we know. Despite existing economic, legal and collective-action models such as antitrust, privacy laws and trade unions, surveillance capitalism has had a relatively unimpeded two decades to root and flourish. We need new paradigms born of a close understanding of surveillance capitalism\u2019s economic imperatives and foundational mechanisms.\u201d</p> <p>For example, the idea of \u201cdata ownership\u201d is often championed as a solution. But what is the point of owning data that should not exist in the first place? All that does is further institutionalise and legitimate data capture. It\u2019s like negotiating how many hours a day a seven-year-old should be allowed to work, rather than contesting the fundamental legitimacy of child labour. Data ownership also fails to reckon with the realities of behavioural surplus. Surveillance capitalists extract predictive value from the exclamation points in your post, not merely the content of what you write, or from how you walk and not merely where you walk. Users might get \u201cownership\u201d of the data that they give to surveillance capitalists in the first place, but they will not get ownership of the surplus or the predictions gleaned from it \u2013 not without new legal concepts built on an understanding of these operations.</p> <p>Another example: there may be sound antitrust reasons to break up the largest tech firms, but this alone will not eliminate surveillance capitalism. Instead it will produce smaller surveillance capitalist firms and open the field for more surveillance capitalist competitors.</p> <p>So what is to be done? In any confrontation with the unprecedented, the first work begins with naming. Speaking for myself, this is why I\u2019ve devoted the past seven years to this work\u2026 to move forward the project of naming as the first necessary step toward taming. My hope is that careful naming will give us all a better understanding of the true nature of this rogue mutation of capitalism and contribute to a sea change in public opinion, most of all among the young.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> by Shoshana Zuboff is published by Profile (\u00a325).

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re living through the most profound transformation in our information environment since Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s invention of printing in circa 1439. And the problem with living through a revolution is that it\u2019s impossible to take the long view of what\u2019s happening. Hindsight is the only exact science in this business, and in that long run we\u2019re all dead. Printing shaped and transformed societies over the next four centuries, but nobody in Mainz (Gutenberg\u2019s home town) in, say, 1495 could have known that his technology would (among other things): fuel the Reformation and undermine the authority of the mighty Catholic church; enable the rise of what we now recognise as modern science; create unheard-of professions and industries; change the shape of our brains; and even recalibrate our conceptions of childhood. And yet printing did all this and more. Why choose 1495? Because we\u2019re about the same distance into our revolution, the one kicked off by digital technology and networking. And although it\u2019s now gradually dawning on us that this really is a big deal and that epochal social and economic changes are under way, we\u2019re as clueless about where it\u2019s heading and what\u2019s driving it as the citizens of Mainz were in 1495. That\u2019s not for want of trying, mind. Library shelves groan under the weight of books about what digital technology is doing to us and our world. Lots of scholars are thinking, researching and writing about this stuff. But they\u2019re like the blind men trying to describe the elephant in the old fable: everyone has only a partial view, and nobody has the whole picture. So our contemporary state of awareness is \u2013 as Manuel Castells, the great scholar of cyberspace once put it \u2013 one of \u201cinformed bewilderment\u201d. Which is why the arrival of Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s new book is such a big event. Many years ago \u2013 in 1988, to be precise \u2013 as one of the first female professors at Harvard Business School to hold an endowed chair she published a landmark book, The Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power, which changed the way we thought about the impact of computerisation on organisations and on work. It provided the most insightful account up to that time of how digital technology was changing the work of both managers and workers. And then Zuboff appeared to go quiet, though she was clearly incubating something bigger. The first hint of what was to come was a pair of startling essays \u2013 one in an academic journal in 2015, the other in a German newspaper in 2016. What these revealed was that she had come up with a new lens through which to view what Google, Facebook et al were doing \u2013 nothing less than spawning a new variant of capitalism. Those essays promised a more comprehensive expansion of this Big Idea. And now it has arrived \u2013 the most ambitious attempt yet to paint the bigger picture and to explain how the effects of digitisation that we are now experiencing as individuals and citizens have come about. The headline story is that it\u2019s not so much about the nature of digital technology as about a new mutant form of capitalism that has found a way to use tech for its purposes. The name Zuboff has given to the new variant is \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d. It works by providing free services that billions of people cheerfully use, enabling the providers of those services to monitor the behaviour of those users in astonishing detail \u2013 often without their explicit consent. \u201cSurveillance capitalism,\u201d she writes, \u201cunilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioural data. Although some of these data are applied to service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioural surplus, fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as \u2018machine intelligence\u2019, and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon, and later. Finally, these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace that I call behavioural futures markets. Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are willing to lay bets on our future behaviour.\u201d While the general modus operandi of Google, Facebook et al has been known and understood (at least by some people) for a while, what has been missing \u2013 and what Zuboff provides \u2013 is the insight and scholarship to situate them in a wider context. She points out that while most of us think that we are dealing merely with algorithmic inscrutability, in fact what confronts us is the latest phase in capitalism\u2019s long evolution \u2013 from the making of products, to mass production, to managerial capitalism, to services, to financial capitalism, and now to the exploitation of behavioural predictions covertly derived from the surveillance of users. In that sense, her vast (660-page) book is a continuation of a tradition that includes Adam Smith, Max Weber, Karl Polanyi and \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 Karl Marx. Viewed from this perspective, the behaviour of the digital giants looks rather different from the roseate hallucinations of Wired magazine. What one sees instead is a colonising ruthlessness of which John D Rockefeller would have been proud. First of all there was the arrogant appropriation of users\u2019 behavioural data \u2013 viewed as a free resource, there for the taking. Then the use of patented methods to extract or infer data even when users had explicitly denied permission, followed by the use of technologies that were opaque by design and fostered user ignorance. And, of course, there is also the fact that the entire project was conducted in what was effectively lawless \u2013 or at any rate law-free \u2013 territory. Thus Google decided that it would digitise and store every book ever printed, regardless of copyright issues. Or that it would photograph every street and house on the planet without asking anyone\u2019s permission. Facebook launched its infamous \u201cbeacons\u201d, which reported a user\u2019s online activities and published them to others\u2019 news feeds without the knowledge of the user. And so on, in accordance with the disrupter\u2019s mantra that \u201cit is easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission\u201d. When the security expert Bruce Schneier wrote that \u201csurveillance is the business model of the internet\u201d he was really only hinting at the reality that Zuboff has now illuminated. The combination of state surveillance and its capitalist counterpart means that digital technology is separating the citizens in all societies into two groups: the watchers (invisible, unknown and unaccountable) and the watched. This has profound consequences for democracy because asymmetry of knowledge translates into asymmetries of power. But whereas most democratic societies have at least some degree of oversight of state surveillance, we currently have almost no regulatory oversight of its privatised counterpart. This is intolerable. And it won\u2019t be easy to fix because it requires us to tackle the essence of the problem \u2013 the logic of accumulation implicit in surveillance capitalism. That means that self-regulation is a nonstarter. \u201cDemanding privacy from surveillance capitalists,\u201d says Zuboff, \u201cor lobbying for an end to commercial surveillance on the internet is like asking old Henry Ford to make each Model T by hand. It\u2019s like asking a giraffe to shorten its neck, or a cow to give up chewing. These demands are existential threats that violate the basic mechanisms of the entity\u2019s survival.\u201d The Age of Surveillance Capital is a striking and illuminating book. A fellow reader remarked to me that it reminded him of Thomas Piketty\u2019s magnum opus, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, in that it opens one\u2019s eyes to things we ought to have noticed, but hadn\u2019t. And if we fail to tame the new capitalist mutant rampaging through our societies then we will only have ourselves to blame, for we can no longer plead ignorance. Ten questions for Shoshana Zuboff: \u2018Larry Page saw that human experience could be Google\u2019s virgin wood\u2019 John Naughton: At the moment, the world is obsessed with Facebook. But as you tell it, Google was the prime mover. Shoshana Zuboff: Surveillance capitalism is a human creation. It lives in history, not in technological inevitability. It was pioneered and elaborated through trial and error at Google in much the same way that the Ford Motor Company discovered the new economics of mass production or General Motors discovered the logic of managerial capitalism. Surveillance capitalism was invented around 2001 as the solution to financial emergency in the teeth of the dotcom bust when the fledgling company faced the loss of investor confidence. As investor pressure mounted, Google\u2019s leaders abandoned their declared antipathy toward advertising. Instead they decided to boost ad revenue by using their exclusive access to user data logs (once known as \u201cdata exhaust\u201d) in combination with their already substantial analytical capabilities and computational power, to generate predictions of user click-through rates, taken as a signal of an ad\u2019s relevance. Operationally this meant that Google would both repurpose its growing cache of behavioural data, now put to work as a behavioural data surplus, and develop methods to aggressively seek new sources of this surplus. The company developed new methods of secret surplus capture that could uncover data that users intentionally opted to keep private, as well as to infer extensive personal information that users did not or would not provide. And this surplus would then be analysed for hidden meanings that could predict click-through behaviour. The surplus data became the basis for new predictions markets called targeted advertising. Here was the origin of surveillance capitalism in an unprecedented and lucrative brew: behavioural surplus, data science, material infrastructure, computational power, algorithmic systems, and automated platforms. As click-through rates skyrocketed, advertising quickly became as important as search. Eventually it became the cornerstone of a new kind of commerce that depended upon online surveillance at scale. The success of these new mechanisms only became visible when Google went public in 2004. That\u2019s when it finally revealed that between 2001 and its 2004 IPO, revenues increased by 3,590%. JN: So surveillance capitalism started with advertising, but then became more general? SZ: Surveillance capitalism is no more limited to advertising than mass production was limited to the fabrication of the Ford Model T. It quickly became the default model for capital accumulation in Silicon Valley, embraced by nearly every startup and app. And it was a Google executive \u2013 Sheryl Sandberg \u2013 who played the role of Typhoid Mary, bringing surveillance capitalism from Google to Facebook, when she signed on as Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s number two in 2008. By now it\u2019s no longer restricted to individual companies or even to the internet sector. It has spread across a wide range of products, services, and economic sectors, including insurance, retail, healthcare, finance, entertainment, education, transportation, and more, birthing whole new ecosystems of suppliers, producers, customers, market-makers, and market players. Nearly every product or service that begins with the word \u201csmart\u201d or \u201cpersonalised\u201d, every internet-enabled device, every \u201cdigital assistant\u201d, is simply a supply-chain interface for the unobstructed flow of behavioural data on its way to predicting our futures in a surveillance economy. JN: In this story of conquest and appropriation, the term \u201cdigital natives\u201d takes on a new meaning\u2026 SZ: Yes, \u201cdigital natives\u201d is a tragically ironic phrase. I am fascinated by the structure of colonial conquest, especially the first Spaniards who stumbled into the Caribbean islands. Historians call it the \u201cconquest pattern\u201d, which unfolds in three phases: legalistic measures to provide the invasion with a gloss of justification, a declaration of territorial claims, and the founding of a town to legitimate the declaration. Back then Columbus simply declared the islands as the territory of the Spanish monarchy and the pope. The sailors could not have imagined that they were writing the first draft of a pattern that would echo across space and time to a digital 21st century. The first surveillance capitalists also conquered by declaration. They simply declared our private experience to be theirs for the taking, for translation into data for their private ownership and their proprietary knowledge. They relied on misdirection and rhetorical camouflage, with secret declarations that we could neither understand nor contest. Google began by unilaterally declaring that the world wide web was its to take for its search engine. Surveillance capitalism originated in a second declaration that claimed our private experience for its revenues that flow from telling and selling our fortunes to other businesses. In both cases, it took without asking. Page [Larry, Google co-founder] foresaw that surplus operations would move beyond the online milieu to the real world, where data on human experience would be free for the taking. As it turns out his vision perfectly reflected the history of capitalism, marked by taking things that live outside the market sphere and declaring their new life as market commodities. We were caught off guard by surveillance capitalism because there was no way that we could have imagined its action, any more than the early peoples of the Caribbean could have foreseen the rivers of blood that would flow from their hospitality toward the sailors who appeared out of thin air waving the banner of the Spanish monarchs. Like the Caribbean people, we faced something truly unprecedented. Once we searched Google, but now Google searches us. Once we thought of digital services as free, but now surveillance capitalists think of us as free. JN: Then there\u2019s the \u201cinevitability\u201d narrative \u2013 technological determinism on steroids. SZ: In my early fieldwork in the computerising offices and factories of the late 1970s and 80s, I discovered the duality of information technology: its capacity to automate but also to \u201cinformate\u201d, which I use to mean to translate things, processes, behaviours, and so forth into information. This duality set information technology apart from earlier generations of technology: information technology produces new knowledge territories by virtue of its informating capability, always turning the world into information. The result is that these new knowledge territories become the subject of political conflict. The first conflict is over the distribution of knowledge: \u201cWho knows?\u201d The second is about authority: \u201cWho decides who knows?\u201d The third is about power: \u201cWho decides who decides who knows?\u201d Now the same dilemmas of knowledge, authority and power have surged over the walls of our offices, shops and factories to flood each one of us\u2026 and our societies. Surveillance capitalists were the first movers in this new world. They declared their right to know, to decide who knows, and to decide who decides. In this way they have come to dominate what I call \u201cthe division of learning in society\u201d, which is now the central organising principle of the 21st-century social order, just as the division of labour was the key organising principle of society in the industrial age. JN: So the big story is not really the technology per se but the fact that it has spawned a new variant of capitalism that is enabled by the technology? SZ: Larry Page grasped that human experience could be Google\u2019s virgin wood, that it could be extracted at no extra cost online and at very low cost out in the real world. For today\u2019s owners of surveillance capital the experiential realities of bodies, thoughts and feelings are as virgin and blameless as nature\u2019s once-plentiful meadows, rivers, oceans and forests before they fell to the market dynamic. We have no formal control over these processes because we are not essential to the new market action. Instead we are exiles from our own behaviour, denied access to or control over knowledge derived from its dispossession by others for others. Knowledge, authority and power rest with surveillance capital, for which we are merely \u201chuman natural resources\u201d. We are the native peoples now whose claims to self-determination have vanished from the maps of our own experience. While it is impossible to imagine surveillance capitalism without the digital, it is easy to imagine the digital without surveillance capitalism. The point cannot be emphasised enough: surveillance capitalism is not technology. Digital technologies can take many forms and have many effects, depending upon the social and economic logics that bring them to life. Surveillance capitalism relies on algorithms and sensors, machine intelligence and platforms, but it is not the same as any of those. JN: Where does surveillance capitalism go from here? SZ: Surveillance capitalism moves from a focus on individual users to a focus on populations, like cities, and eventually on society as a whole. Think of the capital that can be attracted to futures markets in which population predictions evolve to approximate certainty. This has been a learning curve for surveillance capitalists, driven by competition over prediction products. First they learned that the more surplus the better the prediction, which led to economies of scale in supply efforts. Then they learned that the more varied the surplus the higher its predictive value. This new drive toward economies of scope sent them from the desktop to mobile, out into the world: your drive, run, shopping, search for a parking space, your blood and face, and always\u2026 location, location, location. The evolution did not stop there. Ultimately they understood that the most predictive behavioural data comes from what I call \u201ceconomies of action\u201d, as systems are designed to intervene in the state of play and actually modify behaviour, shaping it toward desired commercial outcomes. We saw the experimental development of this new \u201cmeans of behavioural modification\u201d in Facebook\u2019s contagion experiments and the Google-incubated augmented reality game Pok\u00e9mon Go. It is no longer enough to automate information flows about us; the goal now is to automate us. These processes are meticulously designed to produce ignorance by circumventing individual awareness and thus eliminate any possibility of self-determination. As one data scientist explained to me, \u201cWe can engineer the context around a particular behaviour and force change that way\u2026 We are learning how to write the music, and then we let the music make them dance.\u201d This power to shape behaviour for others\u2019 profit or power is entirely self-authorising. It has no foundation in democratic or moral legitimacy, as it usurps decision rights and erodes the processes of individual autonomy that are essential to the function of a democratic society. The message here is simple: Once I was mine. Now I am theirs. JN: What are the implications for democracy? SZ: During the past two decades surveillance capitalists have had a pretty free run, with hardly any interference from laws and regulations. Democracy has slept while surveillance capitalists amassed unprecedented concentrations of knowledge and power. These dangerous asymmetries are institutionalised in their monopolies of data science, their dominance of machine intelligence, which is surveillance capitalism\u2019s \u201cmeans of production\u201d, their ecosystems of suppliers and customers, their lucrative prediction markets, their ability to shape the behaviour of individuals and populations, their ownership and control of our channels for social participation, and their vast capital reserves. We enter the 21st century marked by this stark inequality in the division of learning: they know more about us than we know about ourselves or than we know about them. These new forms of social inequality are inherently antidemocratic. At the same time, surveillance capitalism diverges from the history of market capitalism in key ways, and this has inhibited democracy\u2019s normal response mechanisms. One of these is that surveillance capitalism abandons the organic reciprocities with people that in the past have helped to embed capitalism in society and tether it, however imperfectly, to society\u2019s interests. First, surveillance capitalists no longer rely on people as consumers. Instead, supply and demand orients the surveillance capitalist firm to businesses intent on anticipating the behaviour of populations, groups and individuals. Second, by historical standards the large surveillance capitalists employ relatively few people compared with their unprecedented computational resources. General Motors employed more people during the height of the Great Depression than either Google or Facebook employs at their heights of market capitalisation. Finally, surveillance capitalism depends upon undermining individual self-determination, autonomy and decision rights for the sake of an unobstructed flow of behavioural data to feed markets that are about us but not for us. This antidemocratic and anti-egalitarian juggernaut is best described as a market-driven coup from above: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse of digital technology. On the strength of its annexation of human experience, this coup achieves exclusive concentrations of knowledge and power that sustain privileged influence over the division of learning in society. It is a form of tyranny that feeds on people but is not of the people. Paradoxically, this coup is celebrated as \u201cpersonalisation\u201d, although it defiles, ignores, overrides, and displaces everything about you and me that is personal. JN: Our societies seem transfixed by all this: we are like rabbits paralysed in the headlights of an oncoming car. SZ: Despite surveillance capitalism\u2019s domination of the digital milieu and its illegitimate power to take private experience and to shape human behaviour, most people find it difficult to withdraw, and many ponder if it is even possible. This does not mean, however, that we are foolish, lazy, or hapless. On the contrary, in my book I explore numerous reasons that explain how surveillance capitalists got away with creating the strategies that keep us paralysed. These include the historical, political and economic conditions that allowed them to succeed. And we\u2019ve already discussed some of the other key reasons, including the nature of the unprecedented, conquest by declaration. Other significant reasons are the need for inclusion, identification with tech leaders and their projects, social persuasion dynamics, and a sense of inevitability, helplessness and resignation. We are trapped in an involuntary merger of personal necessity and economic extraction, as the same channels that we rely upon for daily logistics, social interaction, work, education, healthcare, access to products and services, and much more, now double as supply chain operations for surveillance capitalism\u2019s surplus flows. The result is that the choice mechanisms we have traditionally associated with the private realm are eroded or vitiated. There can be no exit from processes that are intentionally designed to bypass individual awareness and produce ignorance, especially when these are the very same processes upon which we must depend for effective daily life. So our participation is best explained in terms of necessity, dependency, the foreclosure of alternatives, and enforced ignorance. JN: Doesn\u2019t all this mean that regulation that just focuses on the technology is misguided and doomed to fail? What should we be doing to get a grip on this before it\u2019s too late? SZ: The tech leaders desperately want us to believe that technology is the inevitable force here, and their hands are tied. But there is a rich history of digital applications before surveillance capitalism that really were empowering and consistent with democratic values. Technology is the puppet, but surveillance capitalism is the puppet master. Surveillance capitalism is a human-made phenomenon and it is in the realm of politics that it must be confronted. The resources of our democratic institutions must be mobilised, including our elected officials. GDPR [a recent EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU] is a good start, and time will tell if we can build on that sufficiently to help found and enforce a new paradigm of information capitalism. Our societies have tamed the dangerous excesses of raw capitalism before, and we must do it again. While there is no simple five-year action plan, much as we yearn for that, there are some things we know. Despite existing economic, legal and collective-action models such as antitrust, privacy laws and trade unions, surveillance capitalism has had a relatively unimpeded two decades to root and flourish. We need new paradigms born of a close understanding of surveillance capitalism\u2019s economic imperatives and foundational mechanisms.\u201d For example, the idea of \u201cdata ownership\u201d is often championed as a solution. But what is the point of owning data that should not exist in the first place? All that does is further institutionalise and legitimate data capture. It\u2019s like negotiating how many hours a day a seven-year-old should be allowed to work, rather than contesting the fundamental legitimacy of child labour. Data ownership also fails to reckon with the realities of behavioural surplus. Surveillance capitalists extract predictive value from the exclamation points in your post, not merely the content of what you write, or from how you walk and not merely where you walk. Users might get \u201cownership\u201d of the data that they give to surveillance capitalists in the first place, but they will not get ownership of the surplus or the predictions gleaned from it \u2013 not without new legal concepts built on an understanding of these operations. Another example: there may be sound antitrust reasons to break up the largest tech firms, but this alone will not eliminate surveillance capitalism. Instead it will produce smaller surveillance capitalist firms and open the field for more surveillance capitalist competitors. So what is to be done? In any confrontation with the unprecedented, the first work begins with naming. Speaking for myself, this is why I\u2019ve devoted the past seven years to this work\u2026 to move forward the project of naming as the first necessary step toward taming. My hope is that careful naming will give us all a better understanding of the true nature of this rogue mutation of capitalism and contribute to a sea change in public opinion, most of all among the young. \u2022 The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff is published by Profile (\u00a325).

      "body": "<p>Ellen Page was standing in a car park in Brazil as a masked man explained why he murders gay people. It was 2015, and she was filming <em>Gaycation</em>, the documentary series she made with her best friend Ian Daniel after coming out on Valentine\u2019s Day a year earlier. \u201cI\u2019m here today because I am gay and because maybe I can make a difference,\u201d she\u2019d said in a speech at a <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/\" title=\"\">Human Rights Campaign</a> conference that has since been shared many millions of times. \u201cI suffered for years because I was scared to be out\u2026 And I\u2019m standing here today, with all of you, on the other side of all that pain.\u201d</p> <p>In the car park, the only sign that she\u2019s disturbed by this ex-cop and his promise to kill again is a familiar crinkling between her eyebrows. This is a technique she deployed effectively when explaining why she was going to keep the baby in <em>Juno</em> (for which she received an Academy Award nomination), and talking an abuser through his castration in her breakout role in <em>Hard Candy</em>, and then in <em>Inception</em>, as the world exploded around her. Page shields her mouth from the murderer as she asks her producer whether she\u2019ll be safe if she tells him she\u2019s gay. \u201cI want to,\u201d she says, firmly. So she does.</p> <p>I arrive at our New York restaurant as evening settles, but the place is empty. \u201cAre you here to meet, uh, Alan?\u201d the waitress beams, walking me to a seemingly unoccupied booth. And there she is, slouched on a banquette, 5ft 1in under four layers of shirt, looking at her phone beneath a wide-brimmed cap. Not an inch of flesh is showing between her knuckles and chin \u2013 none of her eight homemade tattoos (including nicknames of her friends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/26/catherine-keener-genova\" title=\"\">Catherine Keener</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/kristen-wiig\" title=\"\">Kristen Wiig</a>) are visible, and the light is such that her face remains in shadow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5139ec8c7b30db4209cec596492b1c0c3869c7c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5139ec8c7b30db4209cec596492b1c0c3869c7c3/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taking cover: Page stars in the Umbrella Academy as the only non-powerful sibling in a dysfunctional family with superpowers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taking cover: Page stars in the Umbrella Academy as the only non-powerful sibling in a dysfunctional family with superpowers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christos Kalohoridis/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She orders me a tequila cocktail and explains why she chose this restaurant \u2013 it\u2019s on the doorstep of her new home \u2013 in an apologetic tone. She never thought she\u2019d live somewhere like this fancy apartment block, \u201cbut they have a composting system so\u2026\u201d Now 31, she has just moved to the city, in part because she loves to walk, and LA resents walkers, and in part for her wife\u2019s work \u2013 Emma Portner, 24 and a dancer, was the youngest woman to choreograph a West End musical. Page first saw her dancing on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/emmaportner/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>; they married soon after.</p> <p>When our allotted hour is up, Portner will lope into the empty restaurant in an oversized black hoodie, her face barely visible, and slide into the homely crook of Page\u2019s arm \u2013 \u201cHi sweetie\u201d \u2013 and Page will relax for the first time. Portner will fold herself on to the seat shyly, rest her head on the table and wait for me to leave, so I will.</p> <p>Growing up in Nova Scotia, Page got her first acting job at 10, but found uncomfortable fame in 2007 with <em>Juno</em>, an indie film that eventually catapulted her into roles in huge blockbusters such as <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Inception</em>. It had such an impact that when, a year later, 17 students became pregnant at a school in Massachusetts at the same time as Sarah Palin\u2019s 17-year-old daughter, <em>Time</em> magazine called it \u201cthe Juno Effect\u201d. At which point, Page decided to disappear.

In 2014 she didn\u2019t just come out, she came \u201cout-out\u201d as if making up for lost time. She appeared at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz\" title=\"\">Ted Cruz</a>\u2019s barbecue with a microphone and challenged him through a cloud of pork smoke; on Twitter she mourned the death of nine-year-old <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45323933\" title=\"\">Jamel Myles</a> who took his own life as a result of homophobic bullying; her <em>Gaycation</em> series, travelling around the world meeting the most marginalised LGBTQ communities, was more than just a travel show. Like all her interventions since that Valentine\u2019s Day speech, it was a statement of intent. The day before we meet, she posts a tearful photo on her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ellenpage/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>, marking her first anniversary of marriage to Portner. \u201cBeyond grateful to all those who fought to allow us to be wife &amp; wife.\u201d Her outness is not incidental: it\u2019s pointed and political, and it reads as something between liberation and apology, the apology being for not coming out sooner.</p> <p>She has just wrapped on Netflix\u2019s new series of <em>Tales of the City</em>, the most recent adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/armisteadmaupin\" title=\"\">Armistead Maupin</a>\u2019s groundbreaking novels that chart the lives of a group of friends in San Francisco. Maupin first found a mainstream sort of fame upon posthumously outing his friend Rock Hudson, and more than 30 years later he maintains the moral obligation he feels to lift the stigma of homo sexuality by being truthful.</p> <p>I wonder if Page, out-out as she is today, feels a similar pull? \u201cI have a responsibility to be out now, because I have these resources. I can access therapists and security and support. But the reality is a lot of people can be in severely grave danger. I think, for instance, it would have been very harmful for me if someone had outed me earlier. When I was 20, someone wrote an article with the headline: \u2018The Ellen Page Sexuality Sweepstakes\u2019 in the <em>Village Voice</em>. \u2018Is Juno a you know?\u2019\u201d it concluded. She shudders, remembering the effect it had on her to have her sexuality debated in the press before she had come to terms with it herself. \u201cI never even touched a woman outside until I was 27. I was very depressed, and very anxious. I was not well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bec75390c75f32a201bdfb9c726185f31de678e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bec75390c75f32a201bdfb9c726185f31de678e3/66_182_2506_1504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Is Juno a you know?\u2019 asked the Village Voice: Ellen Page with Olivia Thirlby in Juno, 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Is Juno a you know?\u2019 asked the Village Voice: Ellen Page with Olivia Thirlby in Juno, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Juno\u2019s success and the inevitable graduation to red-carpet star (with recurring appearances on <em>FHM</em>\u2019s Sexiest 100 list), she needed to escape. She enrolled on a permaculture course in an eco-village in Oregon where, building giant composts and peeing in buckets, she met Ian Daniel, seemingly the only person in America that year to have no idea who she was. \u201cI know Hollywood can be an overwhelming and toxic system at times,\u201d he emails from India, explaining the \u201cgrace\u201d of his friend. \u201cShe pushed back to be herself in a place that wanted her to be a more conventional feminine ideal. She wasn\u2019t interested in that. I think she sees that the world needs to see more mainstream representations of the multitude of ways we really are. She risked a lot by coming out when she did, but she had the insight to know she could help make it easier for others in the future \u2013 and that she would be happier, too. She\u2019s helped create a new path for LGBTQ people in Hollywood. For someone so small,\u201d he adds, \u201cshe has huge force.\u201d</p> <p>Together they embarked on <em>Gaycation</em>, leading with their own queerness. Page\u2019s public coming out began with the speech, but continued through this exploration of communities. Continues, even. \u201cFilming, I felt sadness and anger, but mixed with the most powerful inspiring moments of absolute joy, and gratitude, to be in the presence not only of activists but individuals who are brave because they are themselves every day.\u201d</p> <p>Interviewing anti-gay men like Brazil\u2019s president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro\" title=\"\">Jair Bolsonaro</a> and a Rastafarian leader in Jamaica, did they feel like they changed any minds? She purses her lips. \u201cThere were a couple of moments where you\u2019d see a little spark. But I\u2019m sad to say that that was rare. I want to be like: \u2018Yeah, Ted Cruz came over afterwards and we had a longer convo and he gets it now!\u2019 But no, I mean, when you\u2019re talking to the head of a neo-Nazi group in the Ukraine, you\u2019re probably not going to end up hugging. But, you\u2019re at least going to have a conversation and some kind of representation.\u201d She takes a deep breath, resigned. This is her job now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2952b28f305153f065de4ba0feabf2ae1a3eaa81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2952b28f305153f065de4ba0feabf2ae1a3eaa81/115_52_1638_983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I felt inspiring moments of absolute joy\u2019: Ellen Page shoots Vacation with Michael Moore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I felt inspiring moments of absolute joy\u2019: Ellen Page shoots Gaycation with Michael Moore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Page has been working since she was 10 and, in a certain light, she could still pass for a kid. In the show she\u2019s promoting today, <em>The Umbrella Academy</em>, she plays the only non-powerful sibling in a dysfunctional family with superpowers and, even when in dialogue with a monkey butler (long story), she moves with the haunted delicacy of a child that\u2019s seen too much.</p> <p>How does her appearance affect the way she\u2019s treated? \u201cPeople are condescending. Though, it\u2019s hard to know if it\u2019s because I look young or because I\u2019m a woman? It\u2019s definitely affected how I\u2019ve learned to express my opinion, though. I\u2019ve become more direct in a way that\u2019s really positive. It\u2019s a lot to do with coming out, and the time spent figuring that out.

She sucks up the last of her drink through a tiny straw. \u201cAfter I wrote that, a producer sent me an email, like: \u2018Oh, I had no idea!\u2019 But that person had come to my trailer and told me I couldn\u2019t talk to the director like that. I struggle with this industry because the changes don\u2019t seem to be happening. When I was promoting <em>Hard Candy</em> [in 2005], I was asked the exact same questions I get asked today. \u2018How do you play so many strong female roles?\u2019 As if they would ever ask that to\u2026 I don\u2019t know, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesmcavoy\" title=\"\">James McAvoy</a>!\u201d</p> <p>So if she doesn\u2019t see change happening in the industry, why does she stay? \u201cHow can I hold two things in my head at the same time?

I love working with brilliant actors, so I\u2019m making movies. But it\u2019s a\u2026 strange time.\u201d</p> <p>One thing we need to do, she says, is change the language. \u201cWe need to stop claiming the political activists are \u2018radical\u2019. The people who are fucking radical are the people who want to keep destroying our water and our top soil and our air in order to give a few people billions more dollars.\u201d They\u2019re the extremists, she insists, not the people who want Americans to have universal health care. \u201cIt\u2019s not a debate, whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> is racist or not. Gay marriage is not a debate. And the media needs to stop claiming it is.\u201d</p> <p>What does she do about this, day to day? \u201cWe just have to try and educate ourselves. And really speak up. I\u2019m learning to worry less about what people think, and not to be afraid to say the truth. Which is: \u2018What\u2019s happening right now is wrong.\u2019\u201d Those \u201cfeelings of reluctance\u201d that she wrote about on Facebook, about her future in the industry, seem to have been resolved, not by quitting, but by refocusing her lens.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xA5-SY4WRI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3xA5-SY4WRI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Here is the biggest public change since Page came out \u2013 the product of her acting is not the film, but instead the activism.

They\u2019re the ones who should be listened to.\u201d In her Facebook post about sexual abuse in Hollywood she listed people who had led the fight, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/05/death-life-marsha-p-johnson-review-documentary\" title=\"\">Marsha P Johnson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\" title=\"\">Audre Lorde</a>. \u201cIf I can amplify their voices,\u201d she says, \u201cthen that\u2019s my aim.\u201d</p> <p>In Brazil, which has one of the highest murder rates of gay and transgender people in the world, Page coming out to the serial killer after enquiring after her safety caused him to pause, uncomfortable beneath his mask, before he walked out.

      "bodyText": "Ellen Page was standing in a car park in Brazil as a masked man explained why he murders gay people. It was 2015, and she was filming Gaycation, the documentary series she made with her best friend Ian Daniel after coming out on Valentine\u2019s Day a year earlier. \u201cI\u2019m here today because I am gay and because maybe I can make a difference,\u201d she\u2019d said in a speech at a Human Rights Campaign conference that has since been shared many millions of times. \u201cI suffered for years because I was scared to be out\u2026 And I\u2019m standing here today, with all of you, on the other side of all that pain.\u201d In the car park, the only sign that she\u2019s disturbed by this ex-cop and his promise to kill again is a familiar crinkling between her eyebrows. This is a technique she deployed effectively when explaining why she was going to keep the baby in Juno (for which she received an Academy Award nomination), and talking an abuser through his castration in her breakout role in Hard Candy, and then in Inception, as the world exploded around her. Page shields her mouth from the murderer as she asks her producer whether she\u2019ll be safe if she tells him she\u2019s gay. \u201cI want to,\u201d she says, firmly. So she does. I arrive at our New York restaurant as evening settles, but the place is empty. \u201cAre you here to meet, uh, Alan?\u201d the waitress beams, walking me to a seemingly unoccupied booth. And there she is, slouched on a banquette, 5ft 1in under four layers of shirt, looking at her phone beneath a wide-brimmed cap. Not an inch of flesh is showing between her knuckles and chin \u2013 none of her eight homemade tattoos (including nicknames of her friends Catherine Keener and Kristen Wiig) are visible, and the light is such that her face remains in shadow. She orders me a tequila cocktail and explains why she chose this restaurant \u2013 it\u2019s on the doorstep of her new home \u2013 in an apologetic tone. She never thought she\u2019d live somewhere like this fancy apartment block, \u201cbut they have a composting system so\u2026\u201d Now 31, she has just moved to the city, in part because she loves to walk, and LA resents walkers, and in part for her wife\u2019s work \u2013 Emma Portner, 24 and a dancer, was the youngest woman to choreograph a West End musical. Page first saw her dancing on Instagram; they married soon after. When our allotted hour is up, Portner will lope into the empty restaurant in an oversized black hoodie, her face barely visible, and slide into the homely crook of Page\u2019s arm \u2013 \u201cHi sweetie\u201d \u2013 and Page will relax for the first time. Portner will fold herself on to the seat shyly, rest her head on the table and wait for me to leave, so I will. Growing up in Nova Scotia, Page got her first acting job at 10, but found uncomfortable fame in 2007 with Juno, an indie film that eventually catapulted her into roles in huge blockbusters such as X-Men and Inception. It had such an impact that when, a year later, 17 students became pregnant at a school in Massachusetts at the same time as Sarah Palin\u2019s 17-year-old daughter, Time magazine called it \u201cthe Juno Effect\u201d. At which point, Page decided to disappear. For a while at least. There\u2019s a phrase that makes distinct the difference between going for a drink after work and a plan to throw yourself into a night of parties whatever the absolute hell might happen, and it\u2019s this that I think of when looking at the decisions Page made after an entire career avoiding questions about her sexuality. In 2014 she didn\u2019t just come out, she came \u201cout-out\u201d as if making up for lost time. She appeared at Ted Cruz\u2019s barbecue with a microphone and challenged him through a cloud of pork smoke; on Twitter she mourned the death of nine-year-old Jamel Myles who took his own life as a result of homophobic bullying; her Gaycation series, travelling around the world meeting the most marginalised LGBTQ communities, was more than just a travel show. Like all her interventions since that Valentine\u2019s Day speech, it was a statement of intent. The day before we meet, she posts a tearful photo on her Instagram, marking her first anniversary of marriage to Portner. \u201cBeyond grateful to all those who fought to allow us to be wife &amp; wife.\u201d Her outness is not incidental: it\u2019s pointed and political, and it reads as something between liberation and apology, the apology being for not coming out sooner. She has just wrapped on Netflix\u2019s new series of Tales of the City, the most recent adaptation of Armistead Maupin\u2019s groundbreaking novels that chart the lives of a group of friends in San Francisco. Maupin first found a mainstream sort of fame upon posthumously outing his friend Rock Hudson, and more than 30 years later he maintains the moral obligation he feels to lift the stigma of homo sexuality by being truthful. I wonder if Page, out-out as she is today, feels a similar pull? \u201cI have a responsibility to be out now, because I have these resources. I can access therapists and security and support. But the reality is a lot of people can be in severely grave danger. I think, for instance, it would have been very harmful for me if someone had outed me earlier. When I was 20, someone wrote an article with the headline: \u2018The Ellen Page Sexuality Sweepstakes\u2019 in the Village Voice. \u2018Is Juno a you know?\u2019\u201d it concluded. She shudders, remembering the effect it had on her to have her sexuality debated in the press before she had come to terms with it herself. \u201cI never even touched a woman outside until I was 27. I was very depressed, and very anxious. I was not well.\u201d After Juno\u2019s success and the inevitable graduation to red-carpet star (with recurring appearances on FHM\u2019s Sexiest 100 list), she needed to escape. She enrolled on a permaculture course in an eco-village in Oregon where, building giant composts and peeing in buckets, she met Ian Daniel, seemingly the only person in America that year to have no idea who she was. \u201cI know Hollywood can be an overwhelming and toxic system at times,\u201d he emails from India, explaining the \u201cgrace\u201d of his friend. \u201cShe pushed back to be herself in a place that wanted her to be a more conventional feminine ideal. She wasn\u2019t interested in that. I think she sees that the world needs to see more mainstream representations of the multitude of ways we really are. She risked a lot by coming out when she did, but she had the insight to know she could help make it easier for others in the future \u2013 and that she would be happier, too. She\u2019s helped create a new path for LGBTQ people in Hollywood. For someone so small,\u201d he adds, \u201cshe has huge force.\u201d Together they embarked on Gaycation, leading with their own queerness. Page\u2019s public coming out began with the speech, but continued through this exploration of communities. Continues, even. \u201cFilming, I felt sadness and anger, but mixed with the most powerful inspiring moments of absolute joy, and gratitude, to be in the presence not only of activists but individuals who are brave because they are themselves every day.\u201d Interviewing anti-gay men like Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro and a Rastafarian leader in Jamaica, did they feel like they changed any minds? She purses her lips. \u201cThere were a couple of moments where you\u2019d see a little spark. But I\u2019m sad to say that that was rare. I want to be like: \u2018Yeah, Ted Cruz came over afterwards and we had a longer convo and he gets it now!\u2019 But no, I mean, when you\u2019re talking to the head of a neo-Nazi group in the Ukraine, you\u2019re probably not going to end up hugging. But, you\u2019re at least going to have a conversation and some kind of representation.\u201d She takes a deep breath, resigned. This is her job now. Page has been working since she was 10 and, in a certain light, she could still pass for a kid. In the show she\u2019s promoting today, The Umbrella Academy, she plays the only non-powerful sibling in a dysfunctional family with superpowers and, even when in dialogue with a monkey butler (long story), she moves with the haunted delicacy of a child that\u2019s seen too much. How does her appearance affect the way she\u2019s treated? \u201cPeople are condescending. Though, it\u2019s hard to know if it\u2019s because I look young or because I\u2019m a woman? It\u2019s definitely affected how I\u2019ve learned to express my opinion, though. I\u2019ve become more direct in a way that\u2019s really positive. It\u2019s a lot to do with coming out, and the time spent figuring that out. I\u2019m more\u2026 in my body?\u201d In 2017 she published a long post on Facebook about her experiences of harassment at work, including a story about one of Hollywood\u2019s most successful directors Brett Ratner. It began: \u201c\u2018You should fuck her to make her realise she\u2019s gay.\u2019 He said this about me during a cast and crew meet and greet before we began filming X-Men: The Last Stand. I was 18.\u201d Writing this, she found her voice: \u201cRatner\u2019s comment replayed in my mind many times over the years as I encountered homophobia and coped with feelings of reluctance and uncertainty about the industry and my future in it. \u201cSomething had switched,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI wanted to talk about the shittiness I\u2019d seen. I\u2019ve dealt with these difficult things, whether it\u2019s directors trying to sleep with me when I was 16, or stalkers. But there are people in society who deal with far, far worse and cannot access the resources I have.\u201d She does this often \u2013 catches herself in a moment of pity, and then quickly reminds herself of her immense privilege, something she wears heavily, like another shirt, a sort of feel-bad feminism that means even when she is describing something objectively terrible that happened to her, she must contextualise it within a continent of greater suffering.

But that\u2019s what\u2019s letting us all connect and have the conversations, about intersectional feminism, etc.\u201d Page is constantly working to educate herself, from reading Rebecca Solnit\u2019s The Mother of All Questions (\u201cWhich is super\u201d) to learning geography from an app. \u201cI\u2019m always learning, I\u2019m always humble, but trying to be open and grow, and also to remind myself of the times when I didn\u2019t know all this. In order to remember not to jump on people for getting stuff wrong, you know?\u201d Has she seen much change in the industry since sharing her #MeToo moment?

      "bodyText": "A sharp decline in household spending on the never-never, and especially spending on credit cards, is a trend that must surely be welcomed. The Bank of England said last week in its quarterly credit health check that high street banks were about to witness the biggest decline in such borrowing since records began 12 years ago. Threadneedle Street said its index of demand for credit card lending over the three months to the end of March had dropped to -20.7 from -7.2. That is a far cry from the summer of 2017, when consumer borrowing soared above \u00a3200bn and MPs across the political spectrum became alarmed at the return of binge buying on plastic. At that time, with wages flat or at least not rising by more than inflation, policymakers feared that households were supplementing their incomes with borrowing to the degree that they had in the run-up to the 2008 financial crash. Regulators reacted to the rise by telling banks to tighten up their lending criteria. Most institutions obeyed, as anyone tracking the trend for borrowing across 2018 can see. So far, so good. That, after all, was supposed to be how the regulators looked after the interests of the country and its economy, and kept individual households from borrowing more than they could afford to repay. However, it also seems clear that another force was at play \u2013 the Brexit effect, which began to have an impact once it became clear that Theresa May\u2019s government was struggling to find a formula that could win over a majority in the House of Commons. The fall in sentiment since last summer has proved to be dramatic \u2013 far sharper than the banks would ever have expected from a few little tweaks to their lending rules. And the lack of consumer borrowing has been felt in few places more than it has in the car industry. Since 2010, cars have increasingly been sold through complex lease deals that fall under the credit figures. By 2017, nine out of 10 cars were being sold this way. Then came the diesel emissions scandal and a confused government reaction, which discouraged sales. Brexit made the situation worse. Consumers were already reluctant to make major purchases such as a new home, or big-ticket household items like furniture. Next on the list of things not to buy was a car. Figures from the industry show that car sales in the UK declined by almost 7% in 2018. With a major slice of credit no longer in demand, the borrowing figures were bound to tumble. The shocking element of the story is how much harm a fall in personal lending can cause to the British economy, which has already suffered a lopsided expansion since the financial crash. A long recovery since 2008 has depended on an expanded workforce prepared to run down its savings and borrow extra funds in a desperate effort to maintain some semblance of pre-crash living standards. Meanwhile, productivity-inducing business investment has remained flat. Clearly, the economy needs business investment to step in where consumer borrowing has fallen away.

We\u2019re reviewing it all now.\u201d Ofsted has been accused by the Haredi community of being \u201cunduly obsessed\u201d with its schools and of being driven by a \u201csecularist agenda\u201d. According to Geoffrey Alderman, a prominent member of the Orthodox community, \u201cit\u2019s now a badge of honour for Orthodox Jewish schools to be failed by Ofsted on the grounds they are not teaching about alternative lifestyles. As Jewish parents are searching around for schools, they\u2019re particularly interested in ones that have been criticised by Ofsted.\u201d Last July, Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, said that relations between Ofsted and the community \u201curgently need to be repaired\u201d. According to Pinter, there has been a \u201cmore conciliatory\u201d approach in recent months. An Ofsted spokesperson said the vast majority of faith schools provided a good or outstanding education, including 87% of Jewish state faith schools. \u201cMost faith schools \u2013 state and independent \u2013 see no contradiction between teaching the tenets of their faith and the legal requirement to promote British values, including respect for democracy and the rule of law or to encourage respect for people with different characteristics such as those of a different faith, sexual orientation or race. \u201cHowever, for the small minority who will not comply with the law, it is Ofsted\u2019s duty to report those failings so that action can be taken to improve or close these schools.\u201d The DfE said a consultation on the draft advice had now closed and it was considering responses. Stern said he was \u201cconfident that the government understands [its advice] is a red line that will never be crossed. Something will be worked out.\u201d",

I turn it all over carefully before burning for fear of disturbing a home. Calendula is budding by the sheltered wall. I bring some inside to flower. Temperatures lurk around 6C, sea mist, sullen cloud, low treetop sun.</p> <p>We fill the bird feeders with sunflower seeds, scatter more on the ground. The blue tits are alive to it first. but within a day they are overrun. Clouds of sparrows and finches in almost every shade, all bossed on the ground by blackbirds. They are joined by a red squirrel, fat tail edged with orange.</p> <p>Our neighbours gave us an oil barrel, maybe the best-ever gardening gift. Open lidded, holed at the base, like the one my mother burned my patched Levi\u2019s in long ago. There\u2019s a thing about fire, the anxious moment when you wonder whether damp branches will take. The key, of course, is to build slowly with small sticks, something I am mostly too impatient to do.</p> <p>Henri rakes acorns and leaves, I stand in shrunken despair. Suddenly, flames shoot through the top. We add broken-down branches, prune the rugosa, the sun comes out, the lazy smoke lifts. For the next few hours we are in gardening heaven, burning, trimming, tidying.</p> <p>We stack the wet leaves, worry about the early crocus coming through (I lightly cover them with trimmings from the Christmas tree). I top up the feeders and scatter more kilos of seed. We startle a deer at the door and say goodbye to the land as we drive away. The bramble can wait until we\u2019re back for Ina\u2019s birthday in February.</p> <p><em>Allan Jenkins\u2019s Plot 29 (4th Estate, \u00a39.99) is out now.

My mother-in-law is nearing 94, our weeks ever more precious together. There are piles of prunings from late autumn, left to dry in the wet. I turn it all over carefully before burning for fear of disturbing a home. Calendula is budding by the sheltered wall. I bring some inside to flower. Temperatures lurk around 6C, sea mist, sullen cloud, low treetop sun. We fill the bird feeders with sunflower seeds, scatter more on the ground. The blue tits are alive to it first. but within a day they are overrun. Clouds of sparrows and finches in almost every shade, all bossed on the ground by blackbirds. They are joined by a red squirrel, fat tail edged with orange. Our neighbours gave us an oil barrel, maybe the best-ever gardening gift. Open lidded, holed at the base, like the one my mother burned my patched Levi\u2019s in long ago. There\u2019s a thing about fire, the anxious moment when you wonder whether damp branches will take. The key, of course, is to build slowly with small sticks, something I am mostly too impatient to do. Henri rakes acorns and leaves, I stand in shrunken despair. Suddenly, flames shoot through the top. We add broken-down branches, prune the rugosa, the sun comes out, the lazy smoke lifts. For the next few hours we are in gardening heaven, burning, trimming, tidying. We stack the wet leaves, worry about the early crocus coming through (I lightly cover them with trimmings from the Christmas tree). I top up the feeders and scatter more kilos of seed. We startle a deer at the door and say goodbye to the land as we drive away. The bramble can wait until we\u2019re back for Ina\u2019s birthday in February.

      "body": "<p><strong>Domaines Schlumberger Pinot Blanc Les Princes, Abb\u00e9s, Alsace, France 2016 (</strong><em>\u00a311, <a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/\">Co-op</a>) </em>Post-Christmas, I haven\u2019t gone on a diet exactly. But the food I\u2019ve found myself craving has acted as a kind of extended palate-cleanser after December\u2019s weeks of heaviness and excess: lots of crunchy brassica greens and kitchen-pot herbs; vegetable stews, soups and stir fries zested-up with citrus and spices. And so the wines I\u2019ve been drinking have had a similar appeal, dovetailing with those fresh flavours, and providing plenty of cleansing perkiness, but with more cold-weather-fortifying substance and weight than the kind of light, crisp whites I\u2019d be likely to have in the spring or summer. I\u2019m basically describing many of the often-gorgeous but still rather under-appreciated white wines of Alsace, which draw on influences from both Germany to the east and Burgundy to the west, but which have their own luminous and varied appeal, with Schlumberger\u2019s pinot blanc a pristine hit of blossom, apple and lemon.</p> <p><strong>Hugel Riesling Estate, Alsace, France 2015 (</strong><em>\u00a318.49, <a href=\"https://www.oxfordwine.co.uk/\">Oxford Wine</a>) </em>A big part of Alsace\u2019s appeal is that it has a range of grape varieties to choose from, each of which are generally (if not always) made into single-varietal wines to fit mood or food. These range from the almost decadent, billowing, rose, lychees and ginger fullness of a dry gew\u00fcrztraminer, such as Josmeyer Les Folastries, Alsace 2016 (\u00a321, <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/\" title=\"\">The Wine Society</a>), which positively glides alongside ginger-inflected pork dishes as well as pongy cheeses; to spring-garden aromatic, pretty and polished Muscat, such as Domaine Bruno Sorg Muscat, Alsace 2016 (\u00a316.95, <a href=\"http://blackdogwines.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Blackdog Wines</a><a href=\"http://www.highburyvintners.co.uk/\" title=\"\">highburyvintners.co.uk</a>), which fits in with dishes big on wilted or fresh greens with or without spice.

      "bodyText": "Domaines Schlumberger Pinot Blanc Les Princes, Abb\u00e9s, Alsace, France 2016 (\u00a311, Co-op) Post-Christmas, I haven\u2019t gone on a diet exactly. But the food I\u2019ve found myself craving has acted as a kind of extended palate-cleanser after December\u2019s weeks of heaviness and excess: lots of crunchy brassica greens and kitchen-pot herbs; vegetable stews, soups and stir fries zested-up with citrus and spices. And so the wines I\u2019ve been drinking have had a similar appeal, dovetailing with those fresh flavours, and providing plenty of cleansing perkiness, but with more cold-weather-fortifying substance and weight than the kind of light, crisp whites I\u2019d be likely to have in the spring or summer. I\u2019m basically describing many of the often-gorgeous but still rather under-appreciated white wines of Alsace, which draw on influences from both Germany to the east and Burgundy to the west, but which have their own luminous and varied appeal, with Schlumberger\u2019s pinot blanc a pristine hit of blossom, apple and lemon. Hugel Riesling Estate, Alsace, France 2015 (\u00a318.49, Oxford Wine) A big part of Alsace\u2019s appeal is that it has a range of grape varieties to choose from, each of which are generally (if not always) made into single-varietal wines to fit mood or food. These range from the almost decadent, billowing, rose, lychees and ginger fullness of a dry gew\u00fcrztraminer, such as Josmeyer Les Folastries, Alsace 2016 (\u00a321, The Wine Society), which positively glides alongside ginger-inflected pork dishes as well as pongy cheeses; to spring-garden aromatic, pretty and polished Muscat, such as Domaine Bruno Sorg Muscat, Alsace 2016 (\u00a316.95, Blackdog Wineshighburyvintners.co.uk), which fits in with dishes big on wilted or fresh greens with or without spice. The region is also one of the world\u2019s great centres for riesling, which it makes in a style marked by the variety\u2019s typical quivering steeliness and minerals but, as in Hugel\u2019s textbook example, boosted with orchard fruit succulence, blossom and spice.

When that spigot is turned halfway off, as it is now, demand for goods and services necessarily drops. The result is less investment and slower growth.</p> <p>Right now some 800,000 government employees aren\u2019t collecting paychecks. Nor are hundreds of thousands of government contractors being paid. None of them can buy as much as before.</p> <p>It\u2019s just another aspect of Trumponomics, which stands for the highly dubious proposition that prosperity comes from cutting taxes on corporations and the wealthy, while squeezing American workers \u2013 the people who do most of the buying.</p> <p>A year ago, Trump and congressional Republicans predicted that their corporate tax cut would cause business investment to soar, which would lead to faster economic growth and higher wages.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The tax-cut steroid wore off within six months of its passage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was classic supply side rubbish. Rather than invest more, American corporations have been scaling back their investment plans.</p> <p>The tax-cut steroid wore off within six months of its passage. Corporate investment rose at a 10% annual rate in the first half of 2018 but then slowed to 2.5% in the third quarter. According to the Institute for Supply Management, new orders for manufacturing equipment <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bad-omen-for-economy-manufacturers-grow-at-slowest-pace-in-two-years-ism-finds-2019-01-03\">plunged 11 points</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bad-omen-for-economy-manufacturers-grow-at-slowest-pace-in-two-years-ism-finds-2019-01-03\"> </a></strong>in December.</p> <p>The logical explanation is that corporations won\u2019t invest unless they expect an adequate return on such investments. That return depends on there being enough buyers for the goods and services they produce.</p> <p>But there aren\u2019t enough. Besides all the government workers and contractors who aren\u2019t being paid, American consumers as a whole have seen little if any rise in their paychecks, adjusted for inflation. Jobs are plentiful but typical pay is still in the dumps.</p> <p>When Trump slashed taxes on corporations he promised everyone else a wage boost of $4,000. It never happened. Instead, the benefits of the giant corporate tax cut went largely into the pockets of top executives and big investors.</p> <p>Corporate stock buybacks fueled a temporary stock market boom, but its benefits didn\u2019t trickle down because more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/business/economy/stocks-economy.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">80%</a> of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans.</p> <p>Unlike typical workers, the wealthy spend only a tiny fraction of what they earn. So when money flows to the top, total demand falls behind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trumponomics is an abject failure because its premises are flawed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, American employers have continued to cut pension and healthcare benefits. Jobs are less secure than ever. One in five is now held by a worker under contract, without any unemployment insurance, sick leave or retirement savings.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s response? Allow employers to do more outsourcing. Make it harder for workers to form unions. Don\u2019t even enforce labor laws on the books.</p> <p>Trump continues to undermine what\u2019s left of the Affordable Care Act. Over the past two years, some 4 million people have lost health insurance coverage, according to the Commonwealth Fund. This undermines their capacity to buy anything else.</p> <p>Trump and his fellow Republicans refuse to raise the federal minimum wage, which would put money into the pockets of people who\u2019d spend it. At $7.25 an hour, the minimum wage is now more than 25% below where it was in real terms half a century ago.</p> <p>The Economic Policy Institute estimates that raising it to $15 an hour would directly or indirectly lift the wages of 41.5 million people. That\u2019s almost 30% of the wage-earning workforce.</p> <p>This would generate $144bn in additional income for families who need it most, including 23.1 million women and 4.5 million single parents.

Infrastructure remains near the end of the legislative line.</p> <p>So where will demand for goods and services come from? Don\u2019t count on exports. The global economy is slowing.

      "bodyText": "One of the least talked-about consequences of the partial shutdown of the US government \u2013 courtesy of Donald \u201cI\u2019m proud to shut down the government\u201d Trump \u2013 is its negative effect on the US economy. Federal spending accounts for just over 20% of the total economy. When that spigot is turned halfway off, as it is now, demand for goods and services necessarily drops. The result is less investment and slower growth. Right now some 800,000 government employees aren\u2019t collecting paychecks. Nor are hundreds of thousands of government contractors being paid. None of them can buy as much as before. It\u2019s just another aspect of Trumponomics, which stands for the highly dubious proposition that prosperity comes from cutting taxes on corporations and the wealthy, while squeezing American workers \u2013 the people who do most of the buying. A year ago, Trump and congressional Republicans predicted that their corporate tax cut would cause business investment to soar, which would lead to faster economic growth and higher wages. It was classic supply side rubbish. Rather than invest more, American corporations have been scaling back their investment plans. The tax-cut steroid wore off within six months of its passage. Corporate investment rose at a 10% annual rate in the first half of 2018 but then slowed to 2.5% in the third quarter. According to the Institute for Supply Management, new orders for manufacturing equipment plunged 11 points in December. The logical explanation is that corporations won\u2019t invest unless they expect an adequate return on such investments. That return depends on there being enough buyers for the goods and services they produce. But there aren\u2019t enough. Besides all the government workers and contractors who aren\u2019t being paid, American consumers as a whole have seen little if any rise in their paychecks, adjusted for inflation. Jobs are plentiful but typical pay is still in the dumps. When Trump slashed taxes on corporations he promised everyone else a wage boost of $4,000. It never happened. Instead, the benefits of the giant corporate tax cut went largely into the pockets of top executives and big investors. Corporate stock buybacks fueled a temporary stock market boom, but its benefits didn\u2019t trickle down because more than 80% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans. Unlike typical workers, the wealthy spend only a tiny fraction of what they earn. So when money flows to the top, total demand falls behind. Meanwhile, American employers have continued to cut pension and healthcare benefits. Jobs are less secure than ever. One in five is now held by a worker under contract, without any unemployment insurance, sick leave or retirement savings. Trump\u2019s response? Allow employers to do more outsourcing. Make it harder for workers to form unions. Don\u2019t even enforce labor laws on the books. Trump continues to undermine what\u2019s left of the Affordable Care Act. Over the past two years, some 4 million people have lost health insurance coverage, according to the Commonwealth Fund. This undermines their capacity to buy anything else. Trump and his fellow Republicans refuse to raise the federal minimum wage, which would put money into the pockets of people who\u2019d spend it. At $7.25 an hour, the minimum wage is now more than 25% below where it was in real terms half a century ago. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that raising it to $15 an hour would directly or indirectly lift the wages of 41.5 million people. That\u2019s almost 30% of the wage-earning workforce. This would generate $144bn in additional income for families who need it most, including 23.1 million women and 4.5 million single parents. Talk about buying power. Nor has Trump moved an inch toward his campaign pledge to spend $1tn to reconstruct the nation\u2019s roadways, waterworks and bridges. Infrastructure remains near the end of the legislative line. So where will demand for goods and services come from? Don\u2019t count on exports. The global economy is slowing. And the Chinese aren\u2019t buying lots of things produced in America these days. That\u2019s the fallout from Trump\u2019s trade war. Trumponomics is an abject failure because its premises are flawed. Cutting taxes on big corporations and the wealthy doesn\u2019t stimulate investment. It only creates a bigger national debt that has to be paid off somehow, sometime. And who\u2019s going to have to pay it off, either in higher taxes or fewer government services? You guessed it. Average Americans, who are already being shafted by Trump\u2019s policies.

      "bodyText": "Briana Libby is not a federal employee, and she is not into politics. She lives 2,500 miles from the US border with Mexico, where Donald Trump has demanded funds for a wall in exchange for ending the partial government shutdown. Nonetheless, the shutdown has hit Libby, 26, with devastating force. A mother of two daughters aged four and six, she was on the verge of buying her first home in southern Maine when the shutdown happened. A $200,000 mortgage Libby had negotiated with the support of the US department of agriculture was supposed to close on Friday. But with the shutdown, the loan program has ground to a halt. Meanwhile her landlord has found a new tenant, and Libby, a payroll specialist at a healthcare organization, fears becoming homeless. \u201cMy loan officer is pretty confident that at this point, closing in January is not an option at all, and we need to be out of our home at the end of the month,\u201d Libby said. \u201cSo my option is packing up all of my stuff, finding a storage unit and sleeping on my mom\u2019s living room floor until I can get into my home. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult, especially for my kids.\u201d As the longest shutdown in US history enters its fifth week, the waves of havoc it has created are crashing ever further outward, threatening essential government functions and introducing unexpected hardships in the lives of millions of Americans. Crucial climate change monitoring and research has halted. Unpaid Coast Guard enlistees have had to turn to food banks to feed their families. Asylum seekers who have already waited years for an immigration court hearing now have to wait years longer. Theater workers and stage actors are threatened by an interruption in arts funding. Corrections officers can\u2019t buy gas to get to work. Inmates say basic services are falling apart. Some federal employees have had to tap into their retirement plans. For those employees required to work without a paycheck because their roles are deemed essential, the pressure is intense, said Clifton Buchanan, a bureau of prisons corrections officer and union executive from Houston, Texas. \u201cLast night I got a disturbing call that one of my officers attempted suicide,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cNot having gas, not having food \u2013 I have staff that are contemplating quitting to go find another job. We\u2019re already short-staffed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke that we\u2019re working for free.\u201d Inside Washington, the shutdown has in part played out as a political circus: Trump serving 300 hamburgers on silver platters to a visiting college football team; members of Congress stuck on a tour bus after Trump, at the last minute, canceled their overseas trip; the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, telling Trump to delay his planned State of the Union Address; angry letters sent back and forth between the White House and Capitol Hill. But each day, terrible new costs of the political deadlock emerge. Federal employees claiming unemployment benefits jumped to 10,000 in the first week of the year, according to labor department figures \u2013 double the number from the previous week. Economists in Trump\u2019s own White House estimate that for each week it lasts, the shutdown cuts 0.1 % from economic growth projections. The vice-president of the air traffic controllers union told CNN about air travel, \u201cI would say it is less safe today than it was a month ago, absolutely.\u201d According to a Syracuse University data tracking program, the shutdown has derailed more than 60,000 immigration cases and counting, said federal judge Amiena Khan, speaking in her capacity as executive vice-president of the National Association of Immigration Judges union. Because immigration courts are already over-scheduled, delayed cases probably get bumped to the \u201cend of the line\u201d \u2013 which probably means the end of 2021, almost three years away. \u201cThese are human beings that we deal with in immigration court on a daily basis,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThese are life-and-death decisions for many individuals.\u201d Ironically, given that Trump\u2019s desire to eject and ban immigrants is driving the shutdown, some immigrants whose claims of asylum are without merit have been in effect granted a years-long reprieve by the shutdown. \u201cIt shows a high level of dysfunction,\u201d Khan said. The shutdown has threatened to weaken the country\u2019s immigration system in other ways. Border officers are among those working without pay, as are enlistees in the US Coast Guard, an essential part of immigration enforcement that last year recorded an almost fivefold increase in the number of migrants it intercepted off the coast of southern California. Yet some Coast Guard families have faced food emergencies and other crises because of the shutdown, said Katie Walvatne, 34, president of the south-east Connecticut Coast Guard Spouses Association. Walvatne, whose husband has served in the Coast Guard for more than 15 years, recently helped to open a food bank for enlisted families and other federal workers at the US Coast Guard academy in New London, Connecticut. \u201cWe just realized that families are going to need something so that they can put groceries in their pantries,\u201d Walvatne said. \u201cI have been there each day, and there\u2019s always a steady stream of people coming in. And it\u2019s everybody. It\u2019s not just active duty.\u201d Walvatne said the community\u2019s sense of solidarity had ameliorated some of the difficulty of the situation. \u201cFor as much anxiety and stress as we\u2019re having right now with this whole shutdown, the community \u2013 both active duty and not \u2013 has just been amazing,\u201d she said. Elsewhere, the shutdown has interrupted basic government functions, such as processing tax returns, providing food assistance and supporting low-income housing. Arts organizations dependent on grants from the National Endowment for the Arts aren\u2019t receiving promised funds for 2019 \u2013 and any grant submissions for 2020 cannot be processed, according to the Actors\u2019 Equity Association union. The shutdown also has severely impeded scientists\u2019 ability to monitor and research climate change data, said Paul Shearon, president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers union, whose members work at the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Nasa and elsewhere. \u201cEven all the way down to weather satellites, a lot of that information is just not being \u2013 is not available because those people are out,\u201d Shearon said. Some important field work, such as identifying toxins and conducting cleanup in the wake of last November\u2019s fatal wildfires in California, has been suspended or slowed \u2013 or employees are conducting the dangerous job without pay. \u201cPeople are starting to go into their 401(k) plans to pay for rent, to pay regular bills.\u201d Shearon said. \u201cThere are huge penalties that are involved in touching that 401(k) plan \u2013 that\u2019s pretty dramatic.\u201d Back in southern Maine, Briana Libby reflected on how close she had come to securing a piece of the American dream, which she hopes might still be hers. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a happy, exciting thing \u2013 but we are in fear of being homeless,\u201d she said. Asked whether the experience had affected her political views, Libby said, \u201cI don\u2019t really pay too much attention to politics, to be honest. I never was a Trump supporter, but I also don\u2019t really put my nose into it too much because, I just don\u2019t. \u201cBut I think he\u2019s making a fool of our country by doing this.

She is \u201ccertainly no Mrs Tiggy-Winkle,\u201d Guy warns us, but \u201ca woman of passion, anger and determination. She still relished revenge and had many scores to settle.\u201d He thinks one of the scores might be with him and that she is plotting to get him busted for heroin.</p> <p>Then Stanley dies, of natural causes, and Susie is left alone. She seems to have forgotten the idea of killing herself, though Guy notices she is stockpiling tramadol. He and his sister visit her as often as possible and he fills the time by writing a book about her. Naturally she demands to read it, and is hideously upset when she does. She quite wants to sue him, but also thinks it would be fun to come to the launch party, give interviews denouncing him, go on <em>Woman\u2019s Hour</em> running rings around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/08/70-years-of-womans-hour-radio-4-jenni-murray-jane-garvey-interview\" title=\"\">Jane Garvey</a>, perhaps make a film\u2026 As the book ends, she is still undecided.</p> <p>So I dashed down to Somerset to ask Guy what is happening \u2013 will his mother come to the launch party? He met me off the train and drove me to his home in Pilton, but wouldn\u2019t be bounced into answering questions \u2013 nothing so vulgar. He spent the whole drive ranting about how this part of Somerset has been gentrified \u2013 he found sushi for sale in the local garage! And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/21/hauser-and-wirth-somerset-art-gallery-next-guggenheim\" title=\"\">Hauser &amp; Wirth</a> has opened a gallery in nearby Bruton \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019ve come with their flash, international culture and smeared it all over Somerset. Our culture was fine: cider-drinking, drug-taking, lazy, and now we have to know who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/30/thomas-scheibitz-painter-wrestle-baltic\" title=\"\">Thomas Scheibitz</a> is!\u201d</p> <p>This rant keeps him going all the way to Pilton, where he switches to praise for Michael Eavis, who gives all the locals free tickets to Glastonbury. We drive down a steep farm track to a clutter of outbuildings which look most unpromising until we go round to the front, which reveals his home to be a beautiful three-gabled stone manor house, with a lawn stretching down to the river. Inside there are more surprises \u2013 several book-lined sitting rooms and a big, bright modern kitchen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When he finally cured his psoriasis \u2013 by sunbathing naked beside the Dead Sea \u2013 he became a sex addict instead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He says he hopes I like lamb because: \u201cI killed some lambs for you \u2013 took them to the abattoir, said goodbye to them, and brought them home in boxes.\u201d He pours wine, checks the Aga, chats about books, chats about art, and finally, when I\u2019m almost screaming with impatience, sits down to answer questions.</p> <p>So what made him decide to write <em>Time </em><em>To Go</em>? \u201cWell, I had that conversation with my mother. She said, \u2018I\u2019ve had a really interesting life, much more interesting than yours, but I\u2019m planning to leave the party and I want you to get me some heroin.\u2019 And I wrote it that day in my diary and thought afterwards: \u2018That\u2019s the best paragraph I\u2019ve written in years. So maybe I should try to write about her, instead of plodding away at some silly novel. More fun.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So how is his mother now? Not well, it turns out. She spent New Year in hospital after a fall, in exactly the helpless situation she wanted to avoid. And he thinks maybe his book is to blame. \u201cTo be honest, when she first read the book, she was so shocked that I saw a real decline. And my sister rang me and said: \u2018Well done Guy, you killed Mummy!\u2019 and I felt really guilty. I mean, I wanted to write the book, but I didn\u2019t really want to kill her! She said: \u2018Why can\u2019t you write only the nice things about me?\u2019 I said: \u2018Because then we\u2019d only have a four-page book, Mummy.\u2019\u2019\u2019 Anyway, it seems pretty doubtful that she\u2019ll come to his launch party.</p> <p><em><strong>Guy Kennaway lives</strong></em> in considerable style. He has the house in Somerset, a flat in London and a house in Jamaica. So does he make lots of money from writing? \u201cGod no,\u201d he laughs, \u201chardly any.\u201d But his parents were quite well off. His father, James Kennaway, was a novelist and screenwriter who wrote <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054412/\" title=\"\">Tunes of Glory</a></em> but died in a car crash when Guy was only 11. Then his mother married another rich man, Brian Young, who was a successful advertising mogul, and then Stanley, who was a showbiz accountant. Also, Guy married a rich wife, Portia, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jun/28/10\" title=\"\">Moores</a> family who founded Littlewoods Pools, and she bought him this house when she divorced him in 2008. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about Portia,\u201d he says, \u201cbut she\u2019s a really generous and kind person.\u201d So one way or another there was quite a bit of family money sloshing around. But also: \u201cI make my living from buying old houses, doing them up and selling them at a profit. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to live at a time [he is 61] when it was almost impossible not to make money out of property, however stupid, lazy and idiotic you were. I\u2019ve always got a building site on the go. At present I\u2019m turning that garage at the back into a barn conversion.\u201d</p> <p>The house is stuffed with books and he\u2019s obviously a great reader, but he didn\u2019t go to university until he was 24. His mother\u2019s second husband, Brian, told him university was a waste of time and he should come and work with him in advertising, so he did. \u201cAs with so much of my life, I was totally in the right place at the right time, but I was the wrong person. I was coining it and had a flat in London people would die for, and I was taking clients out, getting drunk on expenses. Those were definitely the glory days. But I didn\u2019t really like the people \u2013 advertising just seemed a bit flimsy to me \u2013 so I thought I ought to go to university after all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8de1678d4e12f16595e9738fe25d3367fcb5f77d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8de1678d4e12f16595e9738fe25d3367fcb5f77d/0_363_1080_1334/810.jpg\" alt=\"Old photo of Susie, Guy and James Kennaway when Guy was a boy\" width=\"810\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She said: Why can\u2019t you write only nice things about me?

Unfortunately I became quite pretentious and basically wrote shit. I had a lot of books rejected \u2013 rightly so.

And when he <em>did</em> finally get cured \u2013 by sunbathing naked beside the Dead Sea \u2013 he became a sex addict instead and had to go on a cure for that. His last book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/28/bird-brain-guy-kennaway-review\" title=\"\">Bird Brain</a></em> (2011), was a very funny novel about a keen sportsman who dies in a shooting accident and is reincarnated as a pheasant. You do go in for dangerous subjects, I tell him. \u201cYes. If I was a brilliant writer, I wouldn\u2019t need to.\u201d</p> <p>A propos <em>Sunbathing Naked</em>, he says his psoriasis still comes back occasionally and, \u201cIt\u2019s bound to turn up for my book launch \u2013 it likes to make the big engagements in my life.\u201d But meeting other, much worse-afflicted \u201cflakeys\u201d by the Dead Sea taught him to stop worrying about it. But then he started worrying about being a sex addict. He thinks his father was one, too, but in those days it was just called shagging around. But it became obsessive \u2013 he masturbated constantly and couldn\u2019t look at a petrol nozzle without imagining a penis. \u201cThere was something going on that was quite scary and uncontrollable, and it had to get really bad before I put my hands up and said \u2018I need help.\u2019 I remember crying and just feeling absolutely sick of myself and sick of the bullshit I had to create in order to weave this crazy lifestyle.\u201d</p> <p>Finally he \u2019fessed up to his wife and she arranged for him to go on a sex addiction rehab course in Arizona, which worked. He also got God \u2013 I noticed a well-worn Bible on his bookshelf \u2013 and he says yes, he doesn\u2019t go to church because it\u2019s boring, \u201cbut I was on my knees this morning, asking God to tell me: \u2018Just simmer down.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Is he addicted to anything now? \u201cFood! I wish I could get addicted to work, but I can\u2019t unfortunately. But food is quite a friendly sort of addiction and not harmful to other people. Like now I think: \u2018Oh my book is coming out. I might be shamed in the national press. I know what I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll go and buy four pork pies, two scotch eggs, a jar of mustard and eat the lot and that will solve the problem. But that\u2019s the worst that happens now: I head for the fridge. I don\u2019t even head for the bottle.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I feel most alive when I\u2019m enraging people at a boring dinner party</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is his basic problem that he\u2019s had life too easy, so he has to sort of invent complications? \u201cYes.

But actually he doesn\u2019t really care what other people think. I remarked at one point that he must be much in demand as the spare man at dinner parties, but he said on the contrary, he is never asked because he\u2019s so rude. \u201cI feel most alive when I\u2019m enraging people at a boring dinner party. I feel the evening has not been wasted.\u201d</p> <p><em>Time </em><em>To Go</em> will probably enrage many people because it dares to make jokes about self-euthanasia. As he says on the book jacket: \u201cSome things in life are too serious to joke about. Assisted suicide is not one of them.\u201d Unfortunately, Ipso, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, disagrees and has made the subject of assisted dying almost taboo for journalists, so I can\u2019t quote any of his jokes. All I can say is read the book \u2013 but, be warned, you need a robust sense of humour. Guy Kennaway is not for the faint-hearted.</p> <p><em>Time </em><em>To Go </em><em>is published by Mensch at \u00a314.99</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "How can you resist an author who proclaims on his dust jacket: \u201cGuy Kennaway lives for pleasure, producing books only when all else has failed\u201d? He\u2019s someone I\u2019ve been running into at parties for years (he is friends with Jay Jopling of White Cube and the artist Mat Collishaw), but I never once suspected he was a writer. I thought maybe he was an art dealer of some sort, or possibly a collector \u2013 he was too well-dressed and socially assured to be an artist, still less a writer. That\u2019s fine, he says; he doesn\u2019t hang out with writers, because he thinks they are rather dreary, bitter people \u2013 he prefers artists because \u201cthey know how to have a good time and they\u2019ve got money.\u201d But it turns out he has published five books, and his new book, Time To Go, is a corker which should keep book clubs arguing for years. It is both a serious discussion of self-euthanasia \u2013 which is how the publishers seem to be billing it \u2013 and a darkly hilarious account of his tricky relationship with his mother, Susie. It starts with her asking him to get her some heroin because she wants to be able to kill herself when the time comes. She is 88 and her husband, Stanley, is even older. They are both getting frail and she fears they might end up in some ghastly care home. Also, they live in France and are worried Brexit might mean an end to free healthcare. So it would be nice if she and Stanley could die together, in their double bed, at a time of their own choosing. How sweet, you might think, how sensible. But then you don\u2019t yet know Susie. She is \u201ccertainly no Mrs Tiggy-Winkle,\u201d Guy warns us, but \u201ca woman of passion, anger and determination. She still relished revenge and had many scores to settle.\u201d He thinks one of the scores might be with him and that she is plotting to get him busted for heroin. Then Stanley dies, of natural causes, and Susie is left alone. She seems to have forgotten the idea of killing herself, though Guy notices she is stockpiling tramadol. He and his sister visit her as often as possible and he fills the time by writing a book about her. Naturally she demands to read it, and is hideously upset when she does. She quite wants to sue him, but also thinks it would be fun to come to the launch party, give interviews denouncing him, go on Woman\u2019s Hour running rings around Jane Garvey, perhaps make a film\u2026 As the book ends, she is still undecided. So I dashed down to Somerset to ask Guy what is happening \u2013 will his mother come to the launch party? He met me off the train and drove me to his home in Pilton, but wouldn\u2019t be bounced into answering questions \u2013 nothing so vulgar. He spent the whole drive ranting about how this part of Somerset has been gentrified \u2013 he found sushi for sale in the local garage!

But actually he doesn\u2019t really care what other people think. I remarked at one point that he must be much in demand as the spare man at dinner parties, but he said on the contrary, he is never asked because he\u2019s so rude. \u201cI feel most alive when I\u2019m enraging people at a boring dinner party. I feel the evening has not been wasted.\u201d Time To Go will probably enrage many people because it dares to make jokes about self-euthanasia. As he says on the book jacket: \u201cSome things in life are too serious to joke about. Assisted suicide is not one of them.\u201d Unfortunately, Ipso, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, disagrees and has made the subject of assisted dying almost taboo for journalists, so I can\u2019t quote any of his jokes. All I can say is read the book \u2013 but, be warned, you need a robust sense of humour. Guy Kennaway is not for the faint-hearted. Time To Go is published by Mensch at \u00a314.99",

Pelosi\u2019s favorability rating, meanwhile, is up 13% among Democrats since the midterms (59% to 72%) in Civiqs polls, with virtually no shift among Republicans. It is tempting to see the duel through the prisms of age, gender, party or personal wealth \u2013 both Pelosi and Trump are rich. But for the speaker, it is not necessarily personal so much as devotion to the institution she has served for more than three decades. Cindy Simon Rosenthal, author of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the New American Politics, published in 2007, says: \u201cThere are people who see it as power politics, a back and forth between a Republican president and Democratic speaker, but you can also see it as the re-emergence of one half of the legislative branch showing it\u2019s not going to be rolled in deference to the White House. \u201cNancy Pelosi is trying to send a clear message that they\u2019re going to reassert themselves. And he\u2019s not sure how to handle that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In their piece about Britain\u2019s private school problem, David Kynaston and Francis Green start, thankfully, by owning up to their own privileged education and that of their children (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/13/public-schools-david-kynaston-francis-green-engines-of-privilege\" title=\"\">If private schools are the engines of privilege, isn\u2019t reform long overdue?</a>\u201d New Review).</p> <p>Their brilliant article then takes us through the contemporary reality of our \u201cnot fair\u201d system (as ascribed to Alan Bennett), using compelling arguments supported by mind-blowing statistics. So it\u2019s very disappointing, if, alas, not altogether surprising, to see their favoured fix is to open up these bastions of unfairness by having 33% of the private school places accessible to \u201cstate-subsidised\u201d pupils. Earlier, they point out that private school places account for \u201conly about 6% of the UK\u2019s school population\u201d. So how does a proposal that applies to under 2% get to be their preferred solution? <br><strong>Dominic Cullinan</strong><br>London N16<br></p> <p>I am from Germany, having been educated here until the age of 16 at state schools, but was fortunate enough to complete my A-levels at a boarding school in Cambridge, going on to study at the London School of Economics.</p> <p>You mention Germany as a positive example of how to do it differently. The German state system groups children at the age of 10 into a three-tier system, hugely dependent on your social background. Generally, only the top-tier (Gymnasium) allows you to go on to university \u2013 and even this top tier has many shortcomings. The school I attended was in an affluent area and saw a third of my year group move to British boarding schools to complete sixth form. If you try to curtail the advantages of private education, a mobile elite in our global times will always find ways to counteract this.</p> <p>This, however, has been a great advantage to the UK\u2019s education sector. British boarding schools admit thousands of international students every year, bringing vast sums of money into the country. Most children go on to complete their university education in Britain, further contributing to the economy.</p> <p>The huge economic and cultural benefits of being the educator of the world should not be forgotten when debating the private school sector; neither should the downsides of alternative systems.<br><strong>Lorenz Kost</strong><br>D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany<br></p> <p>Good diagnosis of private schools; disappointing prescription. Providing state-subsidised places allocated on academic merit would entrench the pernicious effects of such schools by adding a veneer of legitimacy. It would cream-skim talent from state schools. It would also reproduce all the problems of grammar school premature selection. Instead, private schools should be squeezed by removing their charitable status and requiring them to pay full business rates. This would leave them as the marginal preserve of the ultra-rich and foreign plutocrats. With most of our decision-makers having to use state schools, we would then at last invest seriously in the state schools on which the vast majority of our young people depend for a good start in life.<br><strong>Professor Tony Watts</strong><br>Cambridge</p> <p>I am greatly looking forward to Kynaston\u2019s book. As a first step to thinking clearly about the schools, might we stop using euphemisms and refer to public and private schools simply as \u201cfee-paying\u201d? <br><strong>Susannah Clapp</strong><br>London WC1</p> <p><br></p> <h2>The EU is too valuable to risk<br></h2> <p>There is very little time left and we must not miss the opportunity to build a constructive relationship with our largest trading partner, the EU, that assures our security and stability at a time of global threat.</p> <p>It is not only our continent that would suffer from the collapse of the EU. The world suffers the possibility, even the likelihood, of environmental catastrophe. The customs union, the single market and the political declaration should be submitted to a people\u2019s vote to ensure democratic approval for the proposals.</p> <p>The first step in an agreement has to be to make more time available, by asking the commission to extend article 50. The second step is to accept the customs union and the single market, which has attracted the support of many MPs and has the strong backing of industry, including in goods and services. The political declaration must also set out the EU\u2019s longer-term aspirations for reform. The EU must become more responsive to its citizens, must work on its wider international responsibilities to the developing world and the scientific and technical co-operation that should be fostered within the union. </p> <p>The EU, when it was born, came from a vision. Fifty years on from that beginning and a century after the end of the First World War, which nearly destroyed Europe, we cannot abandon that vision; if we do, we will also destroy our deepest values.<br><strong>Shirley Williams</strong><br>House of Lords, London SW1<br></p> <h2>Labour must back a new vote<br></h2> <p>Labour exists to be the political expression of the labour movement, of the interests of working-class people. To do this in any meaningful sense, the policy of its leadership must reflect the will of its membership on the key issues of the day. This is the principle for which Jeremy Corbyn and many of those around him have fought their whole lives \u2013 and it is one of the many reasons why we have been proud to support him.</p> <p>By uniting around its conference policy, Labour has inflicted the biggest defeat on any government since the introduction of universal suffrage. Following our conference policy, we have fought to force a general election by tabling a motion of no confidence. Now Labour is bound to support \u201call options on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\u201d.</p> <p>Theresa May has made it clear that she will not consider altering her red lines, which entirely contradict Labour\u2019s policy. Labour will vote against any deal that does not meet its six tests or which threatens the Good Friday agreement. No deal is not an option Labour can consider. A Norway-style deal would leave a Corbyn government with no say over laws that affect us. And the EU has made it clear that it will not offer a substantial renegotiation. The only realistic option now left on the table is a fresh referendum and a campaign to remain.</p> <p>Brexit is a Tory project. It is driven by a rightwing agenda to deregulate the economy and blame immigrants for society\u2019s problems. By uniting against it, and marrying our case against Brexit to a campaign to transform society, we can kick the Tories out of power and turn the tide.In the EU, a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn would be a major player, fighting for a just and humane refugee policy, for a levelling up of wages and conditions across the continent.</p> <p>It is clear to us that Labour\u2019s policy now points towards supporting a public vote on Brexit. If there is doubt as to that mandate, then, in the spirit in which Labour was founded, the labour movement must decide our position in a democratic vote. We therefore call on the Labour party NEC to call a special one-day conference to determine Labour\u2019s position on Brexit in light of recent events.<br></p> <p><strong>Alena Ivanova</strong>, Momentum activist, <strong>Michael Chessum</strong>, Another Europe is Possible, <strong>Cllr Shaista Aziz</strong>, Oxford anti-racist activist, <strong>Michael Mansfield QC</strong>,<br><strong>Julie Ward</strong>, Labour MEP for the North West, <strong>Dr Mike Galsworthy</strong>, Scientists for the EU and Labour activist<br><strong>Alex Fernandes</strong>, Tooting CLP;

      "bodyText": "In their piece about Britain\u2019s private school problem, David Kynaston and Francis Green start, thankfully, by owning up to their own privileged education and that of their children (\u201cIf private schools are the engines of privilege, isn\u2019t reform long overdue?\u201d New Review). Their brilliant article then takes us through the contemporary reality of our \u201cnot fair\u201d system (as ascribed to Alan Bennett), using compelling arguments supported by mind-blowing statistics. So it\u2019s very disappointing, if, alas, not altogether surprising, to see their favoured fix is to open up these bastions of unfairness by having 33% of the private school places accessible to \u201cstate-subsidised\u201d pupils. Earlier, they point out that private school places account for \u201conly about 6% of the UK\u2019s school population\u201d. So how does a proposal that applies to under 2% get to be their preferred solution? Dominic Cullinan London N16 I am from Germany, having been educated here until the age of 16 at state schools, but was fortunate enough to complete my A-levels at a boarding school in Cambridge, going on to study at the London School of Economics. You mention Germany as a positive example of how to do it differently. The German state system groups children at the age of 10 into a three-tier system, hugely dependent on your social background. Generally, only the top-tier (Gymnasium) allows you to go on to university \u2013 and even this top tier has many shortcomings. The school I attended was in an affluent area and saw a third of my year group move to British boarding schools to complete sixth form. If you try to curtail the advantages of private education, a mobile elite in our global times will always find ways to counteract this. This, however, has been a great advantage to the UK\u2019s education sector. British boarding schools admit thousands of international students every year, bringing vast sums of money into the country. Most children go on to complete their university education in Britain, further contributing to the economy. The huge economic and cultural benefits of being the educator of the world should not be forgotten when debating the private school sector; neither should the downsides of alternative systems. Lorenz Kost D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany Good diagnosis of private schools; disappointing prescription. Providing state-subsidised places allocated on academic merit would entrench the pernicious effects of such schools by adding a veneer of legitimacy. It would cream-skim talent from state schools. It would also reproduce all the problems of grammar school premature selection. Instead, private schools should be squeezed by removing their charitable status and requiring them to pay full business rates. This would leave them as the marginal preserve of the ultra-rich and foreign plutocrats. With most of our decision-makers having to use state schools, we would then at last invest seriously in the state schools on which the vast majority of our young people depend for a good start in life. Professor Tony Watts Cambridge I am greatly looking forward to Kynaston\u2019s book. As a first step to thinking clearly about the schools, might we stop using euphemisms and refer to public and private schools simply as \u201cfee-paying\u201d? Susannah Clapp London WC1 The EU is too valuable to risk There is very little time left and we must not miss the opportunity to build a constructive relationship with our largest trading partner, the EU, that assures our security and stability at a time of global threat. It is not only our continent that would suffer from the collapse of the EU. The world suffers the possibility, even the likelihood, of environmental catastrophe. The customs union, the single market and the political declaration should be submitted to a people\u2019s vote to ensure democratic approval for the proposals. The first step in an agreement has to be to make more time available, by asking the commission to extend article 50. The second step is to accept the customs union and the single market, which has attracted the support of many MPs and has the strong backing of industry, including in goods and services. The political declaration must also set out the EU\u2019s longer-term aspirations for reform. The EU must become more responsive to its citizens, must work on its wider international responsibilities to the developing world and the scientific and technical co-operation that should be fostered within the union. The EU, when it was born, came from a vision. Fifty years on from that beginning and a century after the end of the First World War, which nearly destroyed Europe, we cannot abandon that vision; if we do, we will also destroy our deepest values. Shirley Williams House of Lords, London SW1 Labour must back a new vote Labour exists to be the political expression of the labour movement, of the interests of working-class people. To do this in any meaningful sense, the policy of its leadership must reflect the will of its membership on the key issues of the day. This is the principle for which Jeremy Corbyn and many of those around him have fought their whole lives \u2013 and it is one of the many reasons why we have been proud to support him. By uniting around its conference policy, Labour has inflicted the biggest defeat on any government since the introduction of universal suffrage. Following our conference policy, we have fought to force a general election by tabling a motion of no confidence. Now Labour is bound to support \u201call options on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\u201d. Theresa May has made it clear that she will not consider altering her red lines, which entirely contradict Labour\u2019s policy. Labour will vote against any deal that does not meet its six tests or which threatens the Good Friday agreement. No deal is not an option Labour can consider. A Norway-style deal would leave a Corbyn government with no say over laws that affect us. And the EU has made it clear that it will not offer a substantial renegotiation. The only realistic option now left on the table is a fresh referendum and a campaign to remain. Brexit is a Tory project. It is driven by a rightwing agenda to deregulate the economy and blame immigrants for society\u2019s problems. By uniting against it, and marrying our case against Brexit to a campaign to transform society, we can kick the Tories out of power and turn the tide.In the EU, a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn would be a major player, fighting for a just and humane refugee policy, for a levelling up of wages and conditions across the continent. It is clear to us that Labour\u2019s policy now points towards supporting a public vote on Brexit. If there is doubt as to that mandate, then, in the spirit in which Labour was founded, the labour movement must decide our position in a democratic vote. We therefore call on the Labour party NEC to call a special one-day conference to determine Labour\u2019s position on Brexit in light of recent events.

Just a few examples will suffice: \u201cMay needs to pivot to the middle after Brexit vote defeat\u201d; \u201cMany want the leader to pivot to backing a new referendum\u201d; \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that we are about to see any dramatic pivot from the prime minister, even if the defeat is a resounding one\u201d. No wonder we\u2019re making so little progress if Theresa May is going about in so many directions. \u2022 Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",

The button-back banquettes are in olive green velour. It\u2019s like sitting on a sofa in a front room in Penge, circa 1973. The ceiling has gnarled, thin wooden beams. It\u2019s a wealthy person\u2019s version of a humble farmhouse. The calamari is served in rings, like they always were in that taverna on Mykonos run by that nice English couple called Beryl and Graham who decided to escape the rat race. The music thumps, but it\u2019s good music so we don\u2019t care: Dean Martin bellowing Volare; a winsome Chet Baker sighing out Body and Soul. We even get Louis Armstrong\u2019s Wonderful World, because it\u2019s required under a retro restaurant by-law.</p> <p>When the menu arrives at our table, so does Rufus. He wants to know if we understand the \u201cconcept\u201d. I shudder. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m a very low-concept kind of chap. Happily, so is this place. They have a list of ultra-thin, Roman-style pizzas of the sort they used to do on the King\u2019s Road. Apparently, they\u2019ve been famous since 1977, though this is the first I\u2019ve heard of them. There are also some small sharing plates cooked up by Rufus\u2019s other half, Tilly Turbett. You can have a pizza and then some small plates or the other way round. That\u2019s the concept. I grasp it fully. The website describes Turbett as an ex-Noma and Gordon Ramsay chef, which is obviously impressive. Tilly\u2019s LinkedIn profile says she did an unpaid stint for a few weeks at Noma in Copenhagen, and was a chef de partie at Maze, which is indeed owned by Gordon Ramsay. You have to sweat your assets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9725115d8bc9710ebcf21fd5c68312859386ebb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9725115d8bc9710ebcf21fd5c68312859386ebb/303_453_4974_2985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Really baffling\u2019: calamari rings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Really baffling\u2019: calamari rings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far, I\u2019ve managed to make Pucci Mayfair sound faintly ludicrous, which it is. But it\u2019s ludicrous in an extremely appealing way. It\u2019s the kind of room in which you can have a very good time, though ideally with someone else\u2019s money. You really might need to be a Chelsea refusenik to swallow some of the pricing: \u00a318 for a pizza is enthusiastic; \u00a345 for one under drifts of shaved black truffle looks like a menu item designed for a man who is going to have to overcompensate big time to impress his date (simpler pizzas are just \u00a38).</p> <p>Happily, the essentials of those pizzas are very good indeed. The crisp base is what I dream of being: remarkably thin. The crust is bubbled and singed. We have one with generous amounts of nose-tickling nduja and snowy burrata and a dribble of honey to soften the chilli hit. It\u2019s a fine piece of work. Other things are as well. Beef brisket is long-braised then pulled into tangles and slicked with lip-sticking jus. It is heaped up on a silky mound of hummus with additional chickpeas that have been roasted. It\u2019s good value at \u00a312. A sizable duck breast is crisp-skinned and pink, dribbled with a pomegranate molasses sauce and dropped languorously on a heap of finely mashed sweet potatoes. A salad of baby gem and Treviso with parmesan and anchovy is bitter and salty in all the right places.</p> <p>Not everything is right. The calamari rings really are baffling. I claimed a couple of months ago that salt and pepper squid was now so ubiquitous it had acquired the rank of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/dec/09/the-urchin-hove-does-its-thing-with-gusto-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">British classic</a>, and with good reason. Flat pieces of squid, carefully scored, so that they curl in on each other alongside tentacles, are cheery tender items, and a quiet reminder that the big thick rings of our youth died out for a reason. They are just so many elastic bands. The only reason I can imagine for doing them that way now is because you have an elastic band fetish, you accidentally bought a job lot of geriatric squid or are trying to plug into a nostalgia market. Given the banquettes, the art and Rufus, let\u2019s go with the latter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9db254901df67cd65965ea47782f577dfbd40511\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9db254901df67cd65965ea47782f577dfbd40511/140_274_5286_3172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The other duff note\u2019: courgette fritti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The other duff note\u2019: courgette fritti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other duff note is advertised as courgette fritti. These are turning up on menus all over these days and demand courgettes, sliced into the thinnest of matchsticks, battered and deep fried so that they stop tasting of courgette. It is the perfect way to hide a vegetable\u2019s true nature. Not here. Pucci do them in big beermat-sized slabs. Flick one of these across a room and you could take off a toupee at 20 paces. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Flick one of the courgette fritti across the room and you could take off a toupee at 20 paces</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Order and calm are restored by \u00a39 worth of a truly magnificent Rubensesque pavlova designed for sharing, piled with slices of cardamom-poached pear and lemon verbena. The meringue is crisp and chewy as it should be, the cream a soothing, cooling presence. It\u2019s what come-hither desserts should look like, and a reminder that classic dishes are always such for a good reason.</p> <p>We drink something chilled, white and Italian, fight with the determined waiters to be able to fill our own glasses, sing along to some 1950s bangers and accidentally run up the kind of ton-and-a-half bill that will drive certain people completely nuts. But what can I say? We had a very good time, visiting the past. We revelled in Pucci\u2019s unconscious act of nostalgia. I liked it a lot back there.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Pucci\u2019s \u00a345 black truffle pizza manages to make the offering at <strong>Jean-Georges at the Connaught</strong>, the London outpost of Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s empire, look good value, an achievement of sorts. When I reviewed their black truffle pizza in 2017, it was \u00a329. It was absurd, but I admitted that, were I drunk, I could imagine eating it again, by accident. Currently it\u2019s \u00a335. Inflation, eh? (<em><a href=\"https://www.the-connaught.co.uk/\">the-connaught.co.uk</a></em>)</p> <p>The management of the Carluccio\u2019s chain has offered to pay the settled-status application fees for its 1,550 employees from the EU. Chief executive Mark Jones said the group would not exist were it not for the journey from Italy that <strong>Antonio Carluccio</strong> originally made. \u2018We are passionate about the value they bring to our business and it is something that we are keen to protect. It\u2019s what Antonio would have wanted,\u2019 he said.</p> <p>Both <strong>Cantor\u2019s Food Store</strong> in Chorlton, Manchester and <strong>Restaurant 92</strong> in Harrogate, which were reviewed on these pages immediately before Christmas, have closed. It may be a sign of the tough year to come.</p> <p><em>Email Jay at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p> <p><br></p>",

We even get Louis Armstrong\u2019s Wonderful World, because it\u2019s required under a retro restaurant by-law. When the menu arrives at our table, so does Rufus. He wants to know if we understand the \u201cconcept\u201d. I shudder. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m a very low-concept kind of chap. Happily, so is this place. They have a list of ultra-thin, Roman-style pizzas of the sort they used to do on the King\u2019s Road. Apparently, they\u2019ve been famous since 1977, though this is the first I\u2019ve heard of them. There are also some small sharing plates cooked up by Rufus\u2019s other half, Tilly Turbett. You can have a pizza and then some small plates or the other way round. That\u2019s the concept. I grasp it fully. The website describes Turbett as an ex-Noma and Gordon Ramsay chef, which is obviously impressive. Tilly\u2019s LinkedIn profile says she did an unpaid stint for a few weeks at Noma in Copenhagen, and was a chef de partie at Maze, which is indeed owned by Gordon Ramsay. You have to sweat your assets. So far, I\u2019ve managed to make Pucci Mayfair sound faintly ludicrous, which it is. But it\u2019s ludicrous in an extremely appealing way. It\u2019s the kind of room in which you can have a very good time, though ideally with someone else\u2019s money. You really might need to be a Chelsea refusenik to swallow some of the pricing: \u00a318 for a pizza is enthusiastic; \u00a345 for one under drifts of shaved black truffle looks like a menu item designed for a man who is going to have to overcompensate big time to impress his date (simpler pizzas are just \u00a38). Happily, the essentials of those pizzas are very good indeed. The crisp base is what I dream of being: remarkably thin. The crust is bubbled and singed. We have one with generous amounts of nose-tickling nduja and snowy burrata and a dribble of honey to soften the chilli hit. It\u2019s a fine piece of work. Other things are as well. Beef brisket is long-braised then pulled into tangles and slicked with lip-sticking jus. It is heaped up on a silky mound of hummus with additional chickpeas that have been roasted. It\u2019s good value at \u00a312. A sizable duck breast is crisp-skinned and pink, dribbled with a pomegranate molasses sauce and dropped languorously on a heap of finely mashed sweet potatoes. A salad of baby gem and Treviso with parmesan and anchovy is bitter and salty in all the right places. Not everything is right. The calamari rings really are baffling. I claimed a couple of months ago that salt and pepper squid was now so ubiquitous it had acquired the rank of British classic, and with good reason. Flat pieces of squid, carefully scored, so that they curl in on each other alongside tentacles, are cheery tender items, and a quiet reminder that the big thick rings of our youth died out for a reason. They are just so many elastic bands. The only reason I can imagine for doing them that way now is because you have an elastic band fetish, you accidentally bought a job lot of geriatric squid or are trying to plug into a nostalgia market. Given the banquettes, the art and Rufus, let\u2019s go with the latter. The other duff note is advertised as courgette fritti. These are turning up on menus all over these days and demand courgettes, sliced into the thinnest of matchsticks, battered and deep fried so that they stop tasting of courgette. It is the perfect way to hide a vegetable\u2019s true nature. Not here. Pucci do them in big beermat-sized slabs. Flick one of these across a room and you could take off a toupee at 20 paces. Order and calm are restored by \u00a39 worth of a truly magnificent Rubensesque pavlova designed for sharing, piled with slices of cardamom-poached pear and lemon verbena. The meringue is crisp and chewy as it should be, the cream a soothing, cooling presence. It\u2019s what come-hither desserts should look like, and a reminder that classic dishes are always such for a good reason. We drink something chilled, white and Italian, fight with the determined waiters to be able to fill our own glasses, sing along to some 1950s bangers and accidentally run up the kind of ton-and-a-half bill that will drive certain people completely nuts. But what can I say? We had a very good time, visiting the past. We revelled in Pucci\u2019s unconscious act of nostalgia. I liked it a lot back there. News bites Pucci\u2019s \u00a345 black truffle pizza manages to make the offering at Jean-Georges at the Connaught, the London outpost of Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s empire, look good value, an achievement of sorts. When I reviewed their black truffle pizza in 2017, it was \u00a329. It was absurd, but I admitted that, were I drunk, I could imagine eating it again, by accident. Currently it\u2019s \u00a335. Inflation, eh? (the-connaught.co.uk) The management of the Carluccio\u2019s chain has offered to pay the settled-status application fees for its 1,550 employees from the EU. Chief executive Mark Jones said the group would not exist were it not for the journey from Italy that Antonio Carluccio originally made. \u2018We are passionate about the value they bring to our business and it is something that we are keen to protect. It\u2019s what Antonio would have wanted,\u2019 he said. Both Cantor\u2019s Food Store in Chorlton, Manchester and Restaurant 92 in Harrogate, which were reviewed on these pages immediately before Christmas, have closed. It may be a sign of the tough year to come. Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1",

Five people have now died after attending music festivals, including 23-year-old Joseph Pham and 21-year-old Diana Nguyen, who both died of suspected drug overdoses after attending the Defqon.1 festival in September. Following this festival an expert panel was convened to advise the government on how to keep people safe at music festivals. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Based on the recommendation from the panel, from March organisers will have to apply for a specific liquor licence, similar to those for pubs and clubs, for each music festival they hold which is targeted to the risks of the event. Each application will need to be approved by a panel of experts, envisaged to include NSW Health, NSW Police, NSW Ambulance and Liquor and Gaming NSW, before a licence can be issued. \u201cFestival organisers will need to ensure their events meet high safety standards,\u201d the minister for racing, Paul Toole, said in a statement. The regime will put the onus on organisers to assess and proactively manage safety risks. \u201cEvents with a poor track record and heightened risk will face greater oversight from authorities,\u201d Toole said. While the licensing plans are yet to be finalised, interim measures are already in place including \u201cchill-out zones\u201d staffed with doctors, nurses and paramedics to help festivalgoers who feel unwell. Organisers are also required to provide free water stations to ensure people are properly hydrated. The new scheme will come into force from March 1 with more details to be announced. There have been growing calls for the New South Wales and Victorian premiers Gladys Berejiklian and Daniel Andrews to allow pill testing at music festivals.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe march today and think of Aiia,\u201d the writer Bri Lee told more than 3,000 people at the Sydney Women\u2019s March on Sunday. The coordinated worldwide protests, held in dozens of major cities, sought to highlight an extensive patchwork of women\u2019s rights issues. The Australian event, in Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park, was dominated by demands that women be made safe, following the alleged murder of international student Aiia Maasarwe. Lee, a sexual assault survivor, said women need \u201canger to survive, but hope to strategise\u201d. \u201cIt is so, so hard to keep an olive branch in the palm of your hand when you need your keys between your fingers,\u201d Lee told the crowd. Presenter and campaigner Yumi Stynes said Australia\u2019s culture of violence against women was a crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s rooted in a widespread cultural acceptance that the values, the roles and the rights of women are lesser than those of men,\u201d Stynes told the crowd. \u201cWomen have the right to be safe. To claim our space, to be respected and to have our voices heard.\u201d Several women held homemade signs paying tribute to Maasware, as the crowd chanted for \u201csafe streets\u201d on the march from Hyde Park to Belmore Park. Claire Hocking, who attended the rally with her husband and their two children, said she wanted her two-year-old daughter Maya to know women\u2019s rights were important. This is the third women\u2019s march for Maya, and the first for three-month-old Franklin. \u201cShe\u2019s our future and he\u2019s our future, he\u2019s a man of tomorrow,\u201d Hocking said. Hocking said she marched for equality, \u201cmaking sure [Maya] has every opportunity that my husband did or my son will have\u201d.

Shorten speculated that more government members could \u201cjust [say] they\u2019ve had enough, pulling the rip-cord and getting off the government aeroplane\u201d. The Liberal party is bracing for the possible resignation of its former deputy, Julie Bishop, who quit as foreign affairs minister after she was overlooked for the leadership and has not committed to stay on after the 2019 election. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, who has raised three children while in parliament, said she understood the pressure O\u2019Dwyer was under. But Plibersek said the Liberals had failed to make juggling motherhood and ministerial duties any easier. \u201cOne of the differences the Liberal party could make to make it easier to retain people like Kelly O\u2019Dwyer on the frontbench is increase the number of women in their parliamentary party,\u201d she told reporters on Sunday. \u201cBecause when you get a critical mass, it does change the culture.\u201d Morrison said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d at \u201cchurlish\u201d behaviour from Labor towards O\u2019Dwyer, arguing it was a \u201cdeeply personal\u201d decision for members to retire. \u201cHow about you just give them the benefit of the doubt that they\u2019re [making that decision] for the reasons they\u2019re saying?\u201d On Saturday evening Turnbull thanked O\u2019Dwyer for her service, describing her as \u201ccommitted to fairness and opportunity\u201d while \u201cnever losing [her] passion for economic reform\u201d. Turnbull highlighted her record as the first woman to hold a treasury portfolio in cabinet, and noted she was also a trailblazer to do so with \u201csuch young children\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer \u2013 a protege of the former treasurer Peter Costello and loyal supporter of former prime minister Turnbull \u2013 is a moderate Liberal representing the inner-city Melbourne seat of Higgins, which she holds on a margin of 8%. But what was once a prized safe Liberal seat will be difficult to hold in the 2019 election, after the replacement of Turnbull with Morrison and the Coalition\u2019s landslide defeat in the Victorian state election expanded Labor\u2019s list of target seats in the progressive state. In a crisis meeting following the brutal Victorian election, O\u2019Dwyer reportedly said the Liberal party was struggling because it is viewed as \u201chomophobic, anti-women, climate change deniers\u201d. In December internal Labor polling of 550 voters in Higgins suggested Labor could win the seat with a two-party-preferred vote of 52%. On Sunday the veterans affairs minister, Darren Chester, told ABC News Breakfast it was \u201chard to see\u201d how the demands on a cabinet minister could change to better accommodate family life, citing his own experience of spending 200 nights away from home during his 20 months in cabinet. \u201cYou sign up for these jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to be able to make a difference, affect the country\u2019s and region\u2019s future. You get the good and the bad with that.\u201d Chester said politicians were expected to \u201cget out there and talk to people\u201d and that meant they had to \u201cdo the hard miles\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s not much else we can do about that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This is the story of how, against all odds, I learned to love Phil Collins, the Dad of Dad-Rock and the Norm of Normcore. Alternatively: how I found myself dancing like a loon to Su-Su-sudio, one of the most evil earworms of its benighted era \u2013 a song which I had valiantly tried to purge from my memory shortly after its release in 1985, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qBaBb1Y-U\">now stuck in my head again</a>, this time for all eternity. Oh no!</p> <p>Whether you missed Collins or not during his brief retirement, one thing is for sure: it\u2019s quite a shock to see him. His first Australian show in more than 20 years, in Brisbane, sees him near the end of his wryly titled Not Dead Yet tour, named after his 2016 autobiography. He hobbles slowly on stage with the aid of a cane. It\u2019s no act. Collins is 68, and frankly he looks in rougher shape than several older rock\u2019n\u2019rollers who are far more fortunate to still be walking among us.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/14/in-defence-of-phil-collins-what-is-the-genesis-of-all-the-hatred\">In defence of Phil Collins: what is the genesis of all the hatred? | Bernard Zuel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In conditions somewhere between steamy and equatorial (definitely no jacket required), Collins is dressed in a half-zipped-up sweater over a crew-necked shirt. He sits down awkwardly on an ordinary swivel desk chair, next to a side table carrying a bottle of water and a folder full of lyrics. \u201cI had a back operation a few years ago,\u201d he tells the crowd in greeting. \u201cMy foot\u2019s fucked, but that\u2019s not going to stop us having some fun.\u201d</p> <p>And the opening chords for Against All Odds start. I stopped believing in guilty pleasures a long time ago \u2013 what you like is, well, just what you like \u2013 but even so, I\u2019m a little disturbed to find myself misting up to this definitive power ballad/karaoke classic. The crowd, which is demographically narrow but numerically enormous, roars. Collins begins to sing: \u201cHow can I just let you walk away?\u201d He needn\u2019t worry. We are all <em>so very</em> here for this.</p> <p>It\u2019s immediately obvious that Collins\u2019 voice, weathered by booze (which he\u2019s given up), age and multiple divorces, is smaller. On Against All Odds, he doesn\u2019t have the lungs to reach for its massive final chorus, and doesn\u2019t try. He\u2019s within himself, measured \u2013 and smart. Fear not: Collins can still sing, and mostly he sings beautifully, albeit within his slightly diminished range and capacity. It\u2019s life-affirming, even moving, to watch.</p> <p>From there, Collins and his 14-piece band (aided by four backup singers, a four-piece horn section and two drummers, including his 17-year-old son Nicholas) bust out a string of MOR ballads and white funk hits, starting with Another Day in Paradise, from 1989\u2019s \u2026But Seriously, and I Missed Again, from 1981\u2019s Face Value. There are also quite a few songs which I\u2019d long since forgotten, and which I am afraid to say I have instantly forgotten again.</p> <p>Those moments aside, the gig is immensely enjoyable. Collins\u2019s band is cooking, especially the Dumbledore-like figure of bassist Leland Sklar, even if it\u2019s hard to tell where his beard stops and his face begins. Collins introduces them all via a few unsubtle dick jokes about the size of each brass player\u2019s instrument, at which point a female fan screams: \u201cYOU CAN BLOW MY HORN ANYTIME!\u201d</p> <p>Off the stage, it\u2019s the best people-watching gig I\u2019ve ever attended. Those who have paid for the Easy Lover VIP gift package ($743.65; the top-tier Not Dead Yet package was valued at $973.05) receive, among other souvenirs, a complimentary set of drumsticks. At one point, between songs, an excitable fellow turns to the crowd and bellows \u201cCOME ON PEOPLE!!! GET YOUR STICKS OUT!!! STICKS IN THE AIR!!!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all quite mad.</p> <p>\u201cAbout 400 years ago I was in a band called Genesis,\u201d Collins says, the cue for Throwing It All Away and Follow You, Follow Me, accompanied by a video montage of vintage Phil. On Who Said I Would, he plays air-drums and nods along gnomically. During a long double-drum solo, he watches his young son (who\u2019s every bit as good as his dad was) with pride \u2013 though, silhouetted from behind as he is, it\u2019s hard to be sure Phil hasn\u2019t actually nodded off.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s a rumble of thunder, and it\u2019s not a product of the relentless Brisbane humidity. We know what\u2019s coming. Collins is out of his seat at last, and he stands and delivers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/sep/19/iwishidneverheardofphil\">In the Air Tonight</a> with magisterial authority. He hasn\u2019t been waiting for this moment all his life, so much as saving his voice to strike this night\u2019s knockout blow. Nicholas enters with that enormous drum sound Collins made famous. All that\u2019s missing is the gorilla suit.</p> <p>Hit after hit follows. The Supremes\u2019 classic You Can\u2019t Hurry Love is performed with due reverence, with Collins\u2019 backing singers covering for his voice. It\u2019s just beginning to flag a little, especially on the following Invisible Touch. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Easy Lover has us winding up for the big finish. Sure enough, Sussudio kicks in, and streamers and confetti rain down, and I\u2019m out of my seat with everybody else. I can\u2019t help it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/29/phil-collins-i-realise-in-hindsight-how-annoying-i-was\">Phil Collins: 'I realise in hindsight how annoying I was'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Take Me Home is the single encore, and it\u2019s the only choice, really. Phil looks knackered. He gets to his feet once more and hobbles off stage again, back-slapped by his bandmates, with a broad grin on his face. Everyone else is wearing one too \u2013 everyone, that is, except for the poor kid, maybe five years old, who is crying and complaining to his mother: \u201cTOO MUCH! TOO LOUD!!!\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/14/in-defence-of-phil-collins-what-is-the-genesis-of-all-the-hatred\">If you remain sceptical</a>, consider this: Collins is one of two artists to have sold 100m records both as a solo artist and as a principal member of a band. The other is Paul McCartney. And if 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can\u2019t Be Wrong \u2013 as the title of an RCA compilation of The King asserted \u2013 I am not going to be the one arrogant enough to assert that 200 million Phil Collins fans are. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Phil Collins\u2019 Australian tour <a href=\"https://m.ticketek.com.au/shows/show.aspx?sh=PHILCOLL19&amp;utm_source=&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;USER_ID_=\">continues through January</a></em></p> <p><br></p>",

Alternatively: how I found myself dancing like a loon to Su-Su-sudio, one of the most evil earworms of its benighted era \u2013 a song which I had valiantly tried to purge from my memory shortly after its release in 1985, now stuck in my head again, this time for all eternity. Oh no! Whether you missed Collins or not during his brief retirement, one thing is for sure: it\u2019s quite a shock to see him. His first Australian show in more than 20 years, in Brisbane, sees him near the end of his wryly titled Not Dead Yet tour, named after his 2016 autobiography. He hobbles slowly on stage with the aid of a cane. It\u2019s no act. Collins is 68, and frankly he looks in rougher shape than several older rock\u2019n\u2019rollers who are far more fortunate to still be walking among us. In conditions somewhere between steamy and equatorial (definitely no jacket required), Collins is dressed in a half-zipped-up sweater over a crew-necked shirt. He sits down awkwardly on an ordinary swivel desk chair, next to a side table carrying a bottle of water and a folder full of lyrics. \u201cI had a back operation a few years ago,\u201d he tells the crowd in greeting. \u201cMy foot\u2019s fucked, but that\u2019s not going to stop us having some fun.\u201d And the opening chords for Against All Odds start. I stopped believing in guilty pleasures a long time ago \u2013 what you like is, well, just what you like \u2013 but even so, I\u2019m a little disturbed to find myself misting up to this definitive power ballad/karaoke classic. The crowd, which is demographically narrow but numerically enormous, roars. Collins begins to sing: \u201cHow can I just let you walk away?\u201d He needn\u2019t worry. We are all so very here for this. It\u2019s immediately obvious that Collins\u2019 voice, weathered by booze (which he\u2019s given up), age and multiple divorces, is smaller. On Against All Odds, he doesn\u2019t have the lungs to reach for its massive final chorus, and doesn\u2019t try. He\u2019s within himself, measured \u2013 and smart. Fear not: Collins can still sing, and mostly he sings beautifully, albeit within his slightly diminished range and capacity. It\u2019s life-affirming, even moving, to watch. From there, Collins and his 14-piece band (aided by four backup singers, a four-piece horn section and two drummers, including his 17-year-old son Nicholas) bust out a string of MOR ballads and white funk hits, starting with Another Day in Paradise, from 1989\u2019s \u2026But Seriously, and I Missed Again, from 1981\u2019s Face Value. There are also quite a few songs which I\u2019d long since forgotten, and which I am afraid to say I have instantly forgotten again. Those moments aside, the gig is immensely enjoyable. Collins\u2019s band is cooking, especially the Dumbledore-like figure of bassist Leland Sklar, even if it\u2019s hard to tell where his beard stops and his face begins. Collins introduces them all via a few unsubtle dick jokes about the size of each brass player\u2019s instrument, at which point a female fan screams: \u201cYOU CAN BLOW MY HORN ANYTIME!\u201d Off the stage, it\u2019s the best people-watching gig I\u2019ve ever attended. Those who have paid for the Easy Lover VIP gift package ($743.65; the top-tier Not Dead Yet package was valued at $973.05) receive, among other souvenirs, a complimentary set of drumsticks. At one point, between songs, an excitable fellow turns to the crowd and bellows \u201cCOME ON PEOPLE!!! GET YOUR STICKS OUT!!! STICKS IN THE AIR!!!\u201d It\u2019s all quite mad. \u201cAbout 400 years ago I was in a band called Genesis,\u201d Collins says, the cue for Throwing It All Away and Follow You, Follow Me, accompanied by a video montage of vintage Phil. On Who Said I Would, he plays air-drums and nods along gnomically. During a long double-drum solo, he watches his young son (who\u2019s every bit as good as his dad was) with pride \u2013 though, silhouetted from behind as he is, it\u2019s hard to be sure Phil hasn\u2019t actually nodded off. Then there\u2019s a rumble of thunder, and it\u2019s not a product of the relentless Brisbane humidity. We know what\u2019s coming. Collins is out of his seat at last, and he stands and delivers In the Air Tonight with magisterial authority. He hasn\u2019t been waiting for this moment all his life, so much as saving his voice to strike this night\u2019s knockout blow. Nicholas enters with that enormous drum sound Collins made famous. All that\u2019s missing is the gorilla suit. Hit after hit follows. The Supremes\u2019 classic You Can\u2019t Hurry Love is performed with due reverence, with Collins\u2019 backing singers covering for his voice. It\u2019s just beginning to flag a little, especially on the following Invisible Touch. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Easy Lover has us winding up for the big finish. Sure enough, Sussudio kicks in, and streamers and confetti rain down, and I\u2019m out of my seat with everybody else. I can\u2019t help it. Take Me Home is the single encore, and it\u2019s the only choice, really. Phil looks knackered. He gets to his feet once more and hobbles off stage again, back-slapped by his bandmates, with a broad grin on his face. Everyone else is wearing one too \u2013 everyone, that is, except for the poor kid, maybe five years old, who is crying and complaining to his mother: \u201cTOO MUCH! TOO LOUD!!!\u201d If you remain sceptical, consider this: Collins is one of two artists to have sold 100m records both as a solo artist and as a principal member of a band. The other is Paul McCartney. And if 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can\u2019t Be Wrong \u2013 as the title of an RCA compilation of The King asserted \u2013 I am not going to be the one arrogant enough to assert that 200 million Phil Collins fans are. \u2022 Phil Collins\u2019 Australian tour continues through January",

There will be those who insist that her resignation is about anything other than her portfolio. Her resignation from representing a party she\u2019s alternatively called \u201cthe natural party for women\u201d and \u2013 allegedly \u2013 one of \u201chomophobic, anti-women climate-change-deniers\u201d is, she says, in order to spend more time with her family. There seem to be oblique suggestions that the \u201canti-women\u201d culture within the Liberal party may be a possible factor. Exposed by the revelations around neighbouring Liberal Julia Banks\u2019s resignation, commentators claim O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s departure is a \u201cdisaster for the Morrison government, which is already struggling to woo female voters\u201d. It\u2019s also fair to speculate that O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s factional alignment to the Liberal moderates compromised her ambitions when, outflanked by their internal rivals, August\u2019s leadership coup rolled their man Turnbull. But it\u2019s certainly curious that a senior cabinet minister \u2013 a mere 42 years old and who as recently as May was kicking $50,000 into a Liberal women\u2019s preselection fund \u2013 is calling it quits. Rumours abound of disastrous internal polling in Higgins, thoroughly believable in the wake of both the wave that elected independent Kerryn Phelps in Wentworth, as well as the Liberals\u2019 brutal routing in Victoria. Higgins\u2019 Liberal margin narrowed over the course of the last election and, certainly, everyone\u2019s aware that the small-l liberal Greens are a natural electoral threat in these leafy seats.

Apprenticeships have vanished. Award-stripping continues, while insecure work has ballooned to 40% of the workforce. The government has ignored the underemployment explosion, and its disinterest in protecting workers from exploitation in the gig economy is profound. Fighting unionism has continued, from some of the most restrictive labour laws in the OECD to a glaringly uneventful royal commission to the establishment of specialised anti-union \u201cpolice forces\u201d. Oh, and the government stacked another six pro-business ideologues into the Fair Work Commission, against objections from \u2026 the FWC president.
