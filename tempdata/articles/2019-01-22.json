      "bodyText": "The tragic and mysterious death of two Saudi Arabian sisters whose bodies were found, taped together, along New York City\u2019s waterfront last October appears to have been a double suicide. Rotana and Tala Farea both drowned and the cause of death was suicide, New York medical examiner Barbara Sampson said in a brief report on Tuesday evening. Rotana, 23, and Tala, 16, were found dead in the city around a year after they had ceased living with family members in Fairfax, Virginia. It later emerged there were reports they were victims of alleged abuse, although details have not emerged. They had been seeking asylum in the United States. \u201cToday, my office determined that the death of the Farea sisters was the result of suicide, in which the young women bound themselves together before descending into the Hudson River,\u201d Sampson said in a short but poignant note released on Tuesday. The river runs down the west side of Manhattan. Law enforcement sources in New York indicated last year that the sisters \u201cwould rather do harm to themselves\u201d than return to their home country. The sisters were discovered dead on 24 October 2018, lying on rocks along the river. New York police department\u2019s chief of detectives, Dermot Shea, had said at the time that there were no signs of trauma on their bodies. \u201cIt is entirely credible that the girls entered the water alive,\u201d Shea also said, later saying that the tape was \u201cnot binding them tight together \u2013 more like keeping them together.\u201d Shea had provided some details about the last year of the Farea sisters\u2019 lives. After leaving family in Fairfax, Virginia, they wound up in a \u201cshelter-like facility due to some abuse allegations that came up\u201d, Shea said. They left Saudi Arabia several years ago. The sisters were reported missing from the \u201cfacility\u201d last August and made their way to New York. Financial records obtained by police indicate that they stayed at \u201ca number of high-end hotels\u201d, routinely ordering meals. \u201cThe money started to run out,\u201d Shea said.

      "bodyText": "The BBC thriller Bodyguard has been named best new drama at the National Television awards, and its male lead, Richard Madden, won in the best drama performance category. The awards were presented at a ceremony at the O2 in London on Tuesday evening. Also among those honoured were This Morning, Strictly Come Dancing and Peter Kay\u2019s Car Share. Accepting his award, Madden credited his Bodyguard co-star, Keeley Hawes, who had been nominated in the same category, adding: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for a better, more talented actress.\u201d The award was the second this month for Madden after he won the Golden Globe for best actor in a TV drama for the BBC One series. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of a year. It feels kind of surreal for me. It was a year ago, and now I\u2019m here with this award. It feels very strange to me. I\u2019m very lucky and thankful for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s insane that so many people watched [Bodyguard], then the amount of people who voted and went to the effort of doing that. It\u2019s overwhelming. It\u2019s appreciated, so thank you to everyone who did that.\u201d Ant and Dec won their 18th consecutive award in the TV entertainment presenter category after a difficult year for Anthony McPartlin, in which he was fined for drink-driving and chose to take time off to deal with personal problems. \u201cThis is a genuine shock, especially this year,\u201d McPartlin said. \u201cWe want to say thank you to everybody. I really don\u2019t think that I can accept this award this year.\u201d He said his partner, Declan Donnelly, was the \u201cone reason we won\u201d, complimenting his \u201chard work, his wit, his dedication\u201d. Danny Dyer won the award for best serial drama performance for his portrayal of Albert Square\u2019s Mick Carter in EastEnders.

On Sunday, the day before the 36-year-old was confirmed in his new job, excited cameramen believed they had spotted him watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/20/huddersfield-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Huddersfield\u2019s defeat to Manchester City</a> from a corporate box in the John Smith\u2019s Stadium, but when approached on live TV the spectator mistaken for the German manager explained they were in fact talking to Martin Warhurst, a Manchester City fan from Wakefield.

In Germany his teams attacked with gusto, and Huddersfield have referred to \u201chigh-effort, high-intensity, high-pressing football that is good to watch\u201d. But Siewert did not want to begin by making grand pronouncements. \u201cWe can talk flowery about everything but the most important thing is to work it out with the players,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/20/huddersfield-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Sterling and San\u00e9 ensure Manchester City cruise to victory at Huddersfield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Siewert speaks three languages \u2013 French on top of German and his proficient English \u2013 and obvious charisma is another thing he has in common with Wagner. But, as Huddersfield\u2019s chief executive, Julian Winter, reiterated, the two men \u201chave similarities but are not the same\u201d. Siewert\u2019s mission is to build on the work of his predecessor, not to imitate it.</p> <p>That makes sense given that Wagner\u2019s departure came about last week after he intimated in December that he felt he had taken the team as far as he could. \u201cDavid, being the human being that he is, sort of said that building up to a January transfer window, does the club want to adapt, think about different things?\u201d explained Winter, adding the club\u2019s thoughts turned quickly to Siewert, whom they first became aware of two years ago while he was working with Bochum\u2019s reserves, from where he was hired by Dortmund. Huddersfield were so determined to lure him after Wagner\u2019s departure that they did not talk to any other candidates.</p> <p>The appointment is a calculated gamble. Siewert\u2019s previous stint as the manager of a senior team was in 2015-16 with Rot-Weiss Essen in the German fourth tier and ended with him being dismissed before completing a season. He now becomes the second-youngest manager in the whole of the English league, a few weeks older than Fleetwood Town\u2019s Joey Barton.</p> <p>Unlike Barton, he was never a well-known player, his career as a midfielder in the German lower leagues curtailed at the age of 23 by an injury to his left knee. But since then he has gained a reputation as an outstanding coach despite his misadventure at Essen. He has led Germany\u2019s U-17s and U-18s and he helped to rear top-class players at Dortmund, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/09/jadon-sancho-england-borussia-dortmund\" title=\"\">Jadon Sancho</a>, the young English forward who has thrived since joining the German side from Manchester City in August 2017.</p> <p>\u201cHe had to get used to German football and I think that was something he learned in my team and then he exploded in his second season at Dortmund,\u201d said Siewert of his role in Sancho\u2019s development. \u201cI have worked with other fantastic players. I worked with [Shinji] Kagawa, who played with my team, and Julian Weigl and Erik Durm also.\u201d</p> <p>At Huddersfield he will work with players who are enduring a miserable season, bottom of the league with two victories from 23 matches despite valiant performances. Good play has frequently been undermined by a lack of sharpness up front and the club has yet to make major investment in January reinforcements. Asked whether they will do so, Siewert answered \u201cmaybe\u201d.</p> <p>The likelihood is that prudent Huddersfield may have to wait until the summer to sign the players they need at a price that does not jeopardise the club\u2019s financial wellbeing. By that time recruitment may be geared towards achieving another promotion from the Championship. Because this season, even with new attackers, Siewert will have to prove to be a phenomenal coach to save Huddersfield from relegation.</p>",

Siewert\u2019s previous stint as the manager of a senior team was in 2015-16 with Rot-Weiss Essen in the German fourth tier and ended with him being dismissed before completing a season. He now becomes the second-youngest manager in the whole of the English league, a few weeks older than Fleetwood Town\u2019s Joey Barton. Unlike Barton, he was never a well-known player, his career as a midfielder in the German lower leagues curtailed at the age of 23 by an injury to his left knee. But since then he has gained a reputation as an outstanding coach despite his misadventure at Essen. He has led Germany\u2019s U-17s and U-18s and he helped to rear top-class players at Dortmund, including Jadon Sancho, the young English forward who has thrived since joining the German side from Manchester City in August 2017. \u201cHe had to get used to German football and I think that was something he learned in my team and then he exploded in his second season at Dortmund,\u201d said Siewert of his role in Sancho\u2019s development. \u201cI have worked with other fantastic players. I worked with [Shinji] Kagawa, who played with my team, and Julian Weigl and Erik Durm also.\u201d At Huddersfield he will work with players who are enduring a miserable season, bottom of the league with two victories from 23 matches despite valiant performances. Good play has frequently been undermined by a lack of sharpness up front and the club has yet to make major investment in January reinforcements. Asked whether they will do so, Siewert answered \u201cmaybe\u201d. The likelihood is that prudent Huddersfield may have to wait until the summer to sign the players they need at a price that does not jeopardise the club\u2019s financial wellbeing. By that time recruitment may be geared towards achieving another promotion from the Championship. Because this season, even with new attackers, Siewert will have to prove to be a phenomenal coach to save Huddersfield from relegation.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been difficult to escape from Escape at Dannemora (Sky Atlantic), the tale of an astounding real-life prison break that marks Ben Stiller\u2019s TV-directing debut. Patricia Arquette has won every award going for her portrayal of Joyce \u2018Tilly\u2019 Mitchell, the civilian who ran the prison sewing factory, and whose involvement with the men under her charge went beyond mere supervision. Some of those portrayed in the series have publicly denounced Stiller\u2019s vision of events, though, it should be said, they have been unable to actually see it, given their current situations. In 2015, two inmates broke out of a maximum security prison in upstate New York. Richard Matt and David Sweat, both murderers serving life sentences, pulled off the unthinkable and managed to cut through pipes and walls in order to escape. It was such an audacious feat that its dramatisation was inevitable, and this is an elegant, if meandering, take on the affair. The whole thing is now on Sky Atlantic \u2013 seven episodes of it \u2013 but it is one of those rare contemporary dramas that is ill-suited to binge-watching, and might be better to take at a more leisurely pace.

      "bodyText": "Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has used his international debut to sound the death knell for South America\u2019s \u201cBolivarian\u201d left and proclaim a new, conservative era of clean governance and godliness in the region. But his terse and widely panned appearance at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday was overshadowed by a snowballing scandal back home involving one of his sons, the recently elected senator Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro. As the president \u2013 who came to power vowing to free Brazil from corruption and criminality \u2013 prepared to take to the stage in Davos, reports in one of Brazil\u2019s leading newspapers linked his son with members of a Rio de Janeiro death squad called the Escrit\u00f3rio do Crime (The Crime Bureau). Rio broadsheet O Globo claimed that during Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s time as a Rio lawmaker, he had employed both the mother and wife of the gang\u2019s alleged leader, a former special forces agent called Adriano Magalh\u00e3es da N\u00f3brega. N\u00f3brega, who is reportedly on the run after police targeted his group with an operation dubbed \u201cThe Untouchables\u201d, is alleged to be a senior member of what O Globo called Rio\u2019s \u201cmost lethal and secretive phalanx of hired guns\u201d. Police and prosecutors reportedly suspect members of The Crime Bureau were behind the still unsolved murder of Rio councillor Marielle Franco last year. O Globo also claimed that the alleged gangster\u2019s wife and mother had been recommended to Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro by Fabr\u00edcio Queiroz, a longstanding friend of Brazil\u2019s president who has been pictured socialising with Jair Bolsonaro in a photo where both men appear topless. Marcelo Freixo, a leftist lawmaker and friend of Marielle Franco, was among those demanding answers on Tuesday. \u201cThe Bolsonaro family owes society explanations,\u201d he tweeted. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro rejected the report \u2013 which follows a trickle of other damaging allegations about his financial dealings \u2013 and claimed he was the \u201cvictim of a defamation campaign\u201d designed to hurt his father. \u201cThose who have made mistakes must be held accountable for their acts,\u201d he said in a statement. Celso Rocha de Barros, a political columnist for the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, said: \u201cThe Bolsonaro family must be in panic.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to measure the repercussions this might have \u2026 It\u2019s a bomb \u2013 a nuclear bomb,\u201d De Barros added. The growing scandal jarred with Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s claims in Davos to be spearheading a crusade against corruption and organized crime. During an unusually brief six-minute address to the annual summit, Bolsonaro said he hoped the world would see his \u201cnew\u201d cleaner Brazil with fresh eyes after a massive corruption scandal that has ravaged the country\u2019s political elite. \u201cI took over a Brazil in the midst of a profound ethical, moral and economic crisis. We are committed to changing our history \u2026 We want to govern by example,\u201d Bolsonaro declared. The far-right nationalist pitched himself as a flag-bearer for Latin America\u2019s new conservative vanguard. \u201cWe do not want a Bolivarian America,\u201d he said, in a reference to Venezuela\u2019s late president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who hoped to unite the continent with an alliance of progressive leaders. Bolsonaro said that rightwing leaders such as Argentina\u2019s Mauricio Macri and Chile\u2019s Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era were determined \u201cthe left will not prevail in this region\u201d. The Brazilian president also painted himself as a global statesman seeking \u201ca world of peace, liberty and democracy\u201d. \u201cWith the slogan: \u2018God above all else\u2019, I believe our relations [with the world] will bring unending progress for all,\u201d Bolsonaro declared. Political observers and audience members were unimpressed by Bolsonaro\u2019s coming out on the world stage. \u201cHe scares me \u2026 Brazil is a big country and deserves someone better,\u201d the Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller was quoted as saying by Valor Econ\u00f4mico, Brazil\u2019s top financial newspaper. Another audience member reportedly complained: \u201c[A] disaster. I wanted to like him but he said nothing. Why did he even come?\u201d De Barros called Bolsonaro\u2019s short address a generic \u201cfiasco\u201d that had probably been cut because of the scandal unfolding back home. Speaking on the eve of Bolsonaro\u2019s Davos speech, Jos\u00e9 Roberto de Toledo, a political journalist from the magazine Piau\u00ed, said his domestic popularity ratings remained high. \u201cConsumer confidence is the highest in years \u2026 money is coming in from overseas. The dollar has gone down. The stock market is breaking records \u2026 No one can bear another five years of crisis. Everyone wants to press the restart button.\u201d But he speculated that Bolsonaro would pay a political price for the growing whiff of corruption surrounding his son. \u201cFl\u00e1vio has put a sword [of Damocles] over his father\u2019s head that will be used to blackmail him, in congress, in the courts, on social media and in the press. It will be a weight he will always have to carry \u2013 and the likelihood is for that weight to grow with time.\u201d",

Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the UK\u2019s richest person with a \u00a321bn fortune, was reported last year to be planning to leave Britain for Monaco. Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said the litany of business announcements should send politicians a clear and simple message. \u201cA March no-deal must be ruled out immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the only way to halt irreversible damage and restore business confidence.\u201d Theresa May told business lobby groups on Tuesday that she was refusing to rule out a no deal as she tries to persuade reluctant MPs to back her Brexit plan by arguing that the only way to avoid crashing out of the EU is to sign up to her proposals. That amounted to a rebuke to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who suggested last week that a no-deal Brexit would be taken off the table in another conference call with 330 corporate executives. Claire Walker, co-executive policy director at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said it was a significant concern that businesses have been left \u201cin the dark\u201d about Brexit and are being forced to activate emergency plans for 29 March. Adrian Hallmark, the chief executive of Bentley, said the luxury carmaker was on track to return to profit this year, but will fail to do so in the event of a hard Brexit. He said stopping production at the company\u2019s Crewe plant would cost the Volkswagen-owned business millions of pounds a day. \u201cIt\u2019s Brexit that\u2019s the killer,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cIf we ended up with a hard Brexit ... that would hit us this year because we do have a potential to get beyond break-even to do the turnaround. It would put at fundamental risk our chance of becoming profitable.\u201d Dixons Carphone revealed on Tuesday it had been working with suppliers on a back up plan that would shore up its stocks of TVs and laptops. \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out that there might be some form of interruption,\u201d said Dixons finance chief Jonny Mason. \u201cIf there is, we are as well prepared as we can possibly be. Some suppliers have brought stock into the country so that it\u2019s closer to where it needs to be for us.\u201d",

A lawyer representing alleged phone-hacking victims also requested the historic expenses receipts of serving Sun reporter Nick Parker, in order to investigate whether his purchase of top-up vouchers for a burner mobile phone was related to the interception of voicemails. News UK declined to comment on any of the claims in court and has always strongly denied that any illegal activities took place at the Sun. The newspaper has always denied any involvement in phone hacking or wrongdoing by senior executives and said the illegality was confined to the News of the World, its defunct sister title, which was closed down in 2011 at the height of the scandal. Parker, who is the Sun\u2019s chief foreign correspondent, was handed a suspended sentence in 2014 after being convicted of handling a Labour MP\u2019s stolen mobile phone but was welcomed back to the newspaper the following year. The high court also heard that Elton John and his husband, David Furnish, were close to settling a phone-hacking claim with the publisher of the Sun and the News Of The World, just weeks before the case was due to go to trial. The court was told that the couple were close to reaching an agreement with News Group Newspapers, part of the wider News UK group, in a move that could avoid a high-profile trial over claims journalists at the Sun were involved in illegally obtaining voicemails, allegations the newspaper has always denied. The singer\u2019s solicitor did not return a request for comment on whether a deal had been reached. News UK has settled dozens of cases in recent years with confidential settlements thought to be worth millions of pounds, with agreements often reached on the eve of trial. The settlements do not accept any wrongdoing on the part of the Sun relating to the interception of voicemails. Barrister David Sherborne told the court that two other \u201cbig ticket\u201d claims have still yet to settle and are still due to go to trial on 4 February, which could potentially force senior Murdoch executives to appear in court. One case involves Liz Hurley and the other involves Heather Mills, who is the ex-wife of Paul McCartney, and her sister Fiona Mills. Sherborne also claimed at a pre-trial hearing that News Group Newspapers frustrated attempts to obtain material relevant to the case. The legal proceedings are still ongoing more than seven-and-a-half years after the News of the World closed following Guardian revelations about phone hacking that led to the conviction of Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor and Downing Street communications chief. Many of the claims of phone hacking still winding their way through the legal system relate to the sources of news stories published in the mid-2000s, with Murdoch\u2019s company having settled more than 1,000 civil claims for phone hacking. Last year another group of claimants, including the former boxer Frank Bruno, settled their cases against the newspaper group. News Group Newspapers recorded a loss of \u00a391m in the 2017 financial year, with the accounts stating that one-off costs included significant legal fees in relation to ongoing legal issues. The publisher of the Mirror has also made multiple settlements with celebrities over alleged phone hacking, including with the actor and press reform campaigner Hugh Grant. The publisher admitted last year it \u201cactively turned a blind eye\u201d to the practice over many years.",

Last year\u2019s figure is just ahead of the 176m admissions in 1971, when Diamonds are Forever, The French Connection and Dirty Harry were on the big screen.

Maduro, who last August survived an audacious drone assassination attempt, presides over a crippling economic and social crisis, and justifiably sees threats from all sides. Early on Monday, 27 national guardsman were arrested after allegedly attempting to mount an uprising, in a sign that he may be losing the backing of the military \u2013 long regarded as the power broker in Venezuela. Hours later, violent unrest rocked working-class neighbourhoods in Caracas, once the bedrock of Maduro\u2019s support. Angry residents set fire to barricades while security forces launched teargasto disperse demonstrators protesting against rising prices and low wages. \u201cThis situation is unbearable,\u201d Eduardo Solano, a young computer scientist who took to the streets in his Diego Lozada neighbourhood, said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you earn bolivars or dollars, it\u2019s not enough.\u201d Solano and his fellow protesters dispersed around midnight, when armed gangs loyal to the government \u2013 known as colectivos \u2013 arrived and fired shots in the air, he said. By Tuesday morning, the neighbourhood was strewn with rubble, and roads were scorched with burn marks. Though officials made no statement on the protests, local watchdogs reported that the national guard had deployed tanks to quell a disturbance in El Valle, another neighbourhood. The foiled uprising and street violence came ahead of nationwide opposition marches against Maduro planned for Wednesday. Oil-rich Venezuela is mired in economic and political turmoil, with hyperinflation rendering the bolivar currency practically worthless. Shortages in food staples and basic medicines are rampant, while crime is widespread. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled, causing consternation across the continent. Maduro, who assumed power when his mentor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013, has long resisted calls to stand down. He sidelined the opposition-led national assembly in 2017, replacing it with a pliant constituent assembly via elections labelled fraudulent. When mass street protests broke out that year, he sent in the national guard, killing at least 120 and injuring hundreds. Though years in the making, the crisis has accelerated since Maduro \u2013 who won re-election last May in a widely criticised vote \u2013 began his new term on 11 January, rallying the once-fractured opposition against him. Juan Guaid\u00f3, the leader of the opposition-held national assembly, declared himself ready to assume the presidency until open elections could be held. Guaid\u00f3 expressed support for those protesting. \u201cWe are all here in the same boat: without electricity, without water, without medicines, without gas and with an uncertain future,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe are all submerged in this crisis, except the usurper,\u201d he added, in reference to Maduro.

The dissenting justices were the four liberals on the court. The result means hundreds of transgender people already in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military\">the US military</a> can continue their service but transgender people cannot join up. The policy also allows people who serve \u201cin their biological sex\u201d to join the military. The LGBT civil rights group Lambda Legal said the court\u2019s Tuesday decision was \u201cperplexing, to say the least\u201d. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/22/donald-trump-defends-students-native-american-confrontation\">Trump has defended the high school students</a> who were filmed apparently confronting a Native American activist and military veteran.

Former head of the Australia Network, Bruce Dover, said the policy did not meet the needs of the Pacific and was effectively a taxpayer subsidy to commercial TV in the lead-up to the election. \u201cIt\u2019s bad policy, it smacks of white colonialism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe announcement makes a mockery of recent government reviews of soft power and Australian broadcasting in the Asia Pacific, both of which are yet to report and make recommendations.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Roma and The Favourite will go head to head at the Oscars after they received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/22/oscars-2019-roma-and-the-favourite-vying-for-glory-with-10-nominations-each\">10 Academy award nominations each</a>. </strong>Roma, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s memoir of childhood in 1970s Mexico City, topped many critics\u2019 lists of 2018 (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/04/the-50-best-films-of-2018-in-the-uk\">including the Guardian\u2019s</a>) and scored nominations including best film and best director.

Scabrous period comedy The Favourite also received 10 nominations, including best actress for Olivia Colman and best original screenplay for Australian Tony McNamara. A Star is Born picked up eight nominations, as did Vice, a comedy about Dick Cheney. Here is the full list of nominations, in which no women have been nominated in the best director category, which means that only one woman \u2013 Greta Gerwig for Lady Bird in 2018 \u2013 has been nominated for the award since Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win it in 2010 for The Hurt Locker.

      "bodyText": "New safety fears over high-rise blocks clad in materials different to those used on Grenfell Tower have forced the government to widen its fire testing regime, meaning potential uncertainty for thousands more residents. The housing minister, Kit Malthouse, has ordered combustibility tests on panels used on high-rise apartments, hotels and student accommodation that differ from the aluminium composite (ACM) panels used at Grenfell and 437 other buildings identified so far. Industry research suggests at least 160 apartment, hotel and student blocks are among high-rise properties built with materials in their rainscreen cladding systems that have not been accounted for in the government\u2019s targeting of buildings with ACM panels. They include so-called high-pressure laminate panels, made from compressed wood or paper fibre, which are used to produce often colourful skins for new buildings and some of which are classed as combustible. The ministerial decision to order fire tests on such materials 19 months after the Grenfell fire claimed 72 lives follows pressure from the Labour party, and has the potential to dramatically increase the number of buildings that may require action to make them safe. In the months after the disaster in west London in June 2017, the government advised owners of buildings with non-ACM cladding to check them. On Tuesday Malthouse told parliament that fire experts had updated that guidance. \u201cWe have commissioned the Building Research Establishment to conduct a programme of testing on non-ACM materials and we expect that testing to start shortly,\u201d he said. The government has already banned the use of combustible materials in the cladding of new high-rise accommodation blocks and has ordered the removal of combustible ACM panels from existing towers, although many building owners are in dispute with leaseholders over who should pay. Ministers have refused to say where the buildings are or who owns them, citing safety concerns. Malthouse said the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government had been \u201ccajoling\u201d private owners to remove the cladding and was now considering \u201cmore assertive\u201d measures. Residents in one block in Bromley, Kent, told the Guardian that they were facing possible bankruptcy and were falling ill with stress after the building owner and its developer refused to pay \u00a34m to make their homes safe. The latest government figures show that cladding on only five of 176 privately owned towers identified has been replaced as such disputes continue. In response to an urgent question in parliament from John Healey, the shadow housing and communities secretary, Malthouse said: \u201cThere remain 42 private residential buildings for which the owner\u2019s plans are unclear, so we are maintaining pressure and rule out no solutions.\u201d Healey said: \u201cIt should be a cause for national shame that over 19 months after the Grenfell Tower fire I am having to drag ministers to the house because there are still buildings in this country cloaked in Grenfell-style cladding and residents who do not know whether their homes are safe.\u201d The cost of remediating buildings with ACM cladding across England has already been estimated at \u00a31bn and the government has promised \u00a3400m from existing housing funding to help pay for the retrofit of affordable housing towers.",

Several MPs at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) on Monday night, which was addressed by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, spoke out against a second referendum, according to others present. Sceptical voices included the Warley MP John Spellar, usually considered as on the right of the Labour party, and Chris Williamson, a loyal ally of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. Labour\u2019s amendment calls on the government to allow parliament \u201cto consider and vote on options to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a ratified withdrawal agreement and political declaration\u201d \u2013 including Labour\u2019s softer Brexit, and a \u201cpublic vote\u201d.

The Streatham MP Chuka Umunna said: \u201cThere is always a flurry of excitement when the frontbench acknowledges the obvious \u2013 that a people\u2019s vote may be the only way forward (it is) \u2013 but that is not the position adopted by those running the show.

      "bodyText": "In a different political moment, Cardi B would probably be playing the biggest gig of her career next weekend, at the Super Bowl half-time show performing with \u2013 and probably upstaging \u2013 Maroon 5. But in December she made clear that although an official invitation had not yet been extended, she would be unmoved by the opportunity. A spokesperson said she wouldn\u2019t perform because of how she felt about \u201cColin Kaepernick and the whole movement\u201d. Cardi has been a vocal supporter of Kaepernick and has repeatedly called on NFL teams to hire him. Her Super Bowl refusal began a flurry of political activity. Last week, as the federal shutdown dragged on, she posted a video in which she said: \u201cI just want to remind y\u2019all because it\u2019s been a little bit over three weeks, Trump is now ordering, as in summoning, federal government workers to go back to work without getting paid.\u201d She dismissed comparisons to the 2013 shutdown, which took place under the Obama administration. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear y\u2019all motherfuckers talking about, \u2018Oh, but Obama shutdown the government for 17 days.\u2019 Yeah, bitch. For healthcare,\u201d she said, going on to argue that allowing grandmas to get their blood pressure checked and ensuring the availability of gynaecological screenings was not comparable to Donald Trump\u2019s border wall. A number of Democratic senators including Brian Schatz, Chris Murphy and Chuck Schumer tweeted that they wanted to share Cardi\u2019s message but were concerned about its many expletives. Schatz eventually concluded that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be senatorial\u201d. Days later, the Fox News host Tomi Lahren mocked Cardi\u2019s participation in the debate. Cardi was quick to respond, tweeting: \u201cLeave me alone I will dog walk you.\u201d In response, Lahren said her \u201cpolitical rambling\u201d was \u201cmoronic\u201d, to which Cardi also replied.

You don\u2019t know what this town has come to these days, you wonder are you safe.\u201d Some residents wondered if they would need to relearn rusty reflexes \u2013 avoiding courthouses, police vehicles and other potential targets \u2013 and teach them to a generation that did not grow up with checkpoints and the drone of army helicopters. \u201cWhen the young ones were told to evacuate on Saturday they went out to the street and took pictures, they didn\u2019t understand the danger,\u201d said Violet Atkinson, who is in her 60s. \u201cThe older ones, we know.\u201d Residents of a certain age remember what bombs and bullets can do, said Elaine Doherty, 55, a psychologist. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that you\u2019re boasting about.\u201d A resident in his 50s, who declined to be named \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not 100% healthy, there could be repercussions\u201d \u2013 said the past few days were mild compared with the 1980s but left an ominous feeling. \u201cIt puts a 1% fear in your head: my God, is this coming back?\u201d Colum Eastwood, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), said the New IRA could not mount a sustained campaign. \u201cFor that they need a certain level of support in the community and they don\u2019t have that. It\u2019s not comparable to what went on in the past. People are angry that such a small number of people can cause such chaos and tarnish the reputation that we\u2019re trying to build up as a tourist destination and a city that is moving forward.\u201d There was a caveat. Dissident republicans have tried in vain to reignite conflict since the 1998 Good Friday agreement \u2013 but now they can operate in a vacuum created by Brexit and the collapse of the power-sharing executive at Stormont in 2017. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to starve them of political relevance for 20 years,\u201d said Eastwood. \u201cNow they\u2019re able to cling to the chaos and worry that\u2019s out there because of Brexit and the lack of an assembly.\u201d Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, has said the bomb had \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with Brexit\u201d. Nigel Dodds, the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s leader in Westminster, echoed that. The New IRA emerged in 2012 via a merger of several groups opposed to the peace process, including the Real IRA. It has been linked with the murder of two prison officers and multiple other attacks, many pre-dating Brexit and talk of a hard border. They number just a few hundred, not all active, and can stage only sporadic attacks with limited firepower, say analysts. Saoradh, a fringe political party linked to the group, credited Saturday\u2019s bomb to \u201crepublican revolutionaries\u201d taking on \u201ccrown forces\u201d and linked it to this week\u2019s centenary of Ireland\u2019s war of independence. The language, like the attack, seemed anachronistic. But dissident republicans think Brexit has gifted them their best opportunity since the 1916 Easter Rising, said Marisa McGlinchey, the author of a forthcoming book, Unfinished Business: The Politics of \u2018Dissident\u2019 Irish Republicanism. If so Tuesday\u2019s headlines provided more succour: the European commission said a no-deal exit would result in a hard border. And the business group CBI warned no deal could leave Northern Ireland\u2019s economy almost \u00a35bn less productive by 2034. Future historians may mull the irony of English nationalism stoking radical Irish nationalism, but people in Derry on Tuesday were busier worrying about the next security alert. Merwan Aytas, who runs a barbershop near the courthouse, gestured to his near-empty shop. \u201cPeople are afraid to come out. I hope this doesn\u2019t continue. People don\u2019t want this happening again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The children of an Islamic State fighter who were abandoned in Syria have been reunited with their mother, a month after the Guardian tracked down their family in Trinidad. Mahmud and Ayyub Ferreira, now aged 11 and seven, were abducted by their father and taken to Syria in 2014, where they spent several years living in the so-called caliphate before ending up in Kurdish custody. On Monday, they were released into the care of their mother, Felicia Perkins-Ferreira, who had never left Trinidad before travelling 6,000 miles from the Caribbean to be reunited with her sons in north-east Syria. After crossing the Iraqi border with the human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith, the family was flown to Switzerland with the help of Roger Waters from the rock band Pink Floyd. The two boys and their mother cried when they were reunited in the Syrian Kurdish administrative capital, Qamishli, hugging each other close. Perkins-Ferreira cleaned their faces with baby wipes and changed them into the clean clothes she had brought with her. More used to humidity and tropical heat, the Trinidadian mother was well wrapped up against biting temperatures that dipped to -2C. On the long drive back across the border to Iraq, Ayyub and Mahmud slept on their mother\u2019s lap. She slept, too, she said. \u201cThat was the first time I\u2019ve slept properly in four years,\u201d said Perkins-Ferreira, who said she had been left traumatised by being separated from her sons. \u201cI often wouldn\u2019t eat for days, thinking: \u2018If they\u2019re not eating, why should I?\u2019\u201d On Tuesday, the family travelled to London where the two boys will receive counselling to help them recover from their ordeal. \u201cI\u2019m really, really grateful and I wish I could meet [all the people who helped] all in one and embrace them,\u201d said Perkins-Ferreira. Kidnapped the day after Ayyub\u2019s third birthday, the boys spent several years in Isis territory before the US-led coalition closed in and their father sent them out of Raqqa towards Turkey with their Belgian stepmother. They were found on the side of the road by the Kurdish-Arab Syrian Democratic Forces and held at Camp Roj with the families of dead or imprisoned militants. The boys\u2019 father is believed to have died in the fighting and their step-mother is being held in a different Kurdish camp. The brothers were so traumatised by their experiences they could not remember their mother\u2019s name, but they clung on to pictures of her, which the Guardian used to find Perkins-Ferreira in Petit Valley, a quiet suburb just outside Trinidad\u2019s capital, Port of Spain. She had received only intermittent news of her sons over the past four years. Stafford Smith, of the international legal nonprofit Reprieve, enlisted the financial help and private jet of Waters to get the Ferreria boys out of Syria, after asking the Trinidad and Tobago authorities to issue emergency travel documents for the children. At the river border where the Tigris separates Syria from Iraq, officials hurriedly ushered the family on to a boat across the fast-flowing river and through a checkpoint kept open beyond normal hours to accommodate their passage. As the snow-capped mountains on the Turkish side of the triangular border receded and night fell, the marathon journey was extended by a two-hour police security check in Dohuk, where officers verified the boys had been taken to Syria against their will and posed no threat. In Erbil, where they arrived shortly before 1am, they were embraced by an emotional Waters, who put them up in a suite on the top floor of the Rotana hotel. The following morning, they boarded a plane chartered by Waters to Zurich, from where they travelled to London to begin a rehabilitation programme Reprieve has put in place before their return to Trinidad. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that they get on with a really productive, decent life,\u201d said Stafford Smith.

Several months ago, Patel criticised Eton\u2019s \u201cabsurd and corrupt\u201d charitable status, tweeting that it gave the school an unfair advantage over state schools struggling with budget cuts. \u201cI can understand why people would say I\u2019m hypocritical because I\u2019m allowing myself to benefit from this education,\u201d Patel said. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying to build a better life for myself. I think Eton has resources to educate me to give me better life chances so I\u2019m well equipped to go out and tackle the injustices that pervade society.\u201d Patel said he was shocked to find out he won a place at the school. \u201cI sat down for a few minutes and tried to process it. It hit me and I was really excited,\u201d he said, adding his parents were incredibly pleased for him. \u201cMy dad was really happy. He told me when he was in India he didn\u2019t get to go to college because he couldn\u2019t afford it. He moved to the UK to get a better life for himself and his family,\u201d he said. In response to claims he was a \u201cchampagne socialist\u201d, he pointed out: \u201cMy free school meals don\u2019t serve champagne.\u201d Nonetheless, he said that accepting the scholarship had not changed his views of private schools, which he still believes give people an unfair advantage in society. When asked whether private schools should be abolished, he said he did not know. \u201cI wish I knew the solution myself. I don\u2019t have a plan set up. I do know that state schools aren\u2019t given the resources they need at the moment to succeed,\u201d he said. He described the application process for the scholarship as \u201cdaunting\u201d \u2013 he had to complete three entrance exams and eight interviews over two days. \u201cJust the whole idea of Eton as a place scared me. I didn\u2019t think I would be good enough,\u201d he said. Saeed Hussain, Patel\u2019s headteacher, said: \u201cHasan is an incredible inspiration to his peers and an exceptional young man, with huge potential. Hasan\u2019s scholarship serves as a reminder to all of us that it does not matter where you come from or who you are, if you are determined then you will succeed.\u201d Patel was told by many supporters to not let Eton change who he is. \u201cI can see why they\u2019d say that. A lot of people see Eton as a training ground for top bankers and elite professionals. They think my politics would change because I\u2019d be under quite a lot of pressure to conform,\u201d he said, but adds there\u2019s no reason to worry. \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll ever become a Tory.\u201d In fact, he\u2019s looking forward to the debates. \u201cI might end up taking a few students along to a local Labour party meeting,\u201d he said.",

The opening bid for compromise would be a permanent customs union. Labour says it wants one and enough Tories could stomach one for a parliamentary majority to look feasible. But only if tribal party allegiances are ignored. A Brexit deal that was carried by scores of Labour MPs, tacitly or explicitly backed by Jeremy Corbyn, would rip the Conservative party in half. And Corbyn has no interest in taking ownership of Brexit when a majority of his party\u2019s members want the whole thing scrapped. A transparent objective in the opposition leader\u2019s office is to get through the current crisis without leaving fingerprints on any unpopular resolution. Labour\u2019s official line is for things to be \u201con the table\u201d and for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/21/labour-calls-for-vote-in-commons-on-holding-second-referendum\" title=\"\">options to be considered</a>\u201d in parliament. The moment of actually picking one of those options will be deferred for as long as possible. Corbyn is relaxed about Brexit, but it would suit him if it were a wicked \u201cTory Brexit\u201d that he can denounce.</p> <p>Meanwhile, pro-European Conservatives underestimate the gravitational pull of Labour tribalism even on MPs who hate their leader. Pragmatic Conservatives cannot fathom why centre-left MPs who are probably going to be purged as \u201cBlairite\u201d heretics wouldn\u2019t make common cause with like-minded folk on the centre-right whose party has also been captured by maniacs. Tory centrists are confused because they have no emotional equivalent to the \u201cLabour-till-I-die\u201d creed that prevents anti-Corbyn defections. Theresa May probably understands it better because she loves her party the way Labour MPs love theirs.</p> <p>Brexit has generated cross-party dialogue, even friendships. There have been joint amendments and coordinated rebellions. But it is mostly on the level of procedure and agreement on what shouldn\u2019t happen. Ruling out no deal is the foothills of collaboration. Settling on what should happen is a higher mountain to climb. Dissolving party lines for long enough to pass the necessary legislation goes higher still.</p> <p>The referendum wreaked havoc with traditional political identities outside Westminster. Many voters now badge themselves as leavers and remainers more readily than they would sport a blue or red rosette. But in parliament the English party duopoly has proved formidably resilient. Tribal impulses run deep. There are few rewards for fraternising with the enemy.</p> <p>May and Corbyn are set in their ways and alike in craving approval from their party\u2019s least flexible supporters. Their interests are also perversely aligned on Brexit. When May\u2019s deal was rejected, she offered cross-party talks knowing there was no prospect of agreement with the Labour leader. It suited her that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-46941664\" title=\"\">he refused</a> the invitation. She likes to have Corbyn lurking on the sidelines, spooking Conservatives with the thought of radical socialist government. It suits Corbyn for May to carry on grinding away as she has always done, painting Tory colours on the Brexit mess from top to bottom. And the deeper we go into this crisis, the louder each side will accuse the other of putting party before country. Both will be right.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

But only if tribal party allegiances are ignored. A Brexit deal that was carried by scores of Labour MPs, tacitly or explicitly backed by Jeremy Corbyn, would rip the Conservative party in half. And Corbyn has no interest in taking ownership of Brexit when a majority of his party\u2019s members want the whole thing scrapped. A transparent objective in the opposition leader\u2019s office is to get through the current crisis without leaving fingerprints on any unpopular resolution. Labour\u2019s official line is for things to be \u201con the table\u201d and for \u201coptions to be considered\u201d in parliament. The moment of actually picking one of those options will be deferred for as long as possible. Corbyn is relaxed about Brexit, but it would suit him if it were a wicked \u201cTory Brexit\u201d that he can denounce. Meanwhile, pro-European Conservatives underestimate the gravitational pull of Labour tribalism even on MPs who hate their leader. Pragmatic Conservatives cannot fathom why centre-left MPs who are probably going to be purged as \u201cBlairite\u201d heretics wouldn\u2019t make common cause with like-minded folk on the centre-right whose party has also been captured by maniacs. Tory centrists are confused because they have no emotional equivalent to the \u201cLabour-till-I-die\u201d creed that prevents anti-Corbyn defections. Theresa May probably understands it better because she loves her party the way Labour MPs love theirs. Brexit has generated cross-party dialogue, even friendships. There have been joint amendments and coordinated rebellions. But it is mostly on the level of procedure and agreement on what shouldn\u2019t happen. Ruling out no deal is the foothills of collaboration. Settling on what should happen is a higher mountain to climb. Dissolving party lines for long enough to pass the necessary legislation goes higher still. The referendum wreaked havoc with traditional political identities outside Westminster. Many voters now badge themselves as leavers and remainers more readily than they would sport a blue or red rosette. But in parliament the English party duopoly has proved formidably resilient. Tribal impulses run deep. There are few rewards for fraternising with the enemy. May and Corbyn are set in their ways and alike in craving approval from their party\u2019s least flexible supporters. Their interests are also perversely aligned on Brexit. When May\u2019s deal was rejected, she offered cross-party talks knowing there was no prospect of agreement with the Labour leader. It suited her that he refused the invitation. She likes to have Corbyn lurking on the sidelines, spooking Conservatives with the thought of radical socialist government. It suits Corbyn for May to carry on grinding away as she has always done, painting Tory colours on the Brexit mess from top to bottom. And the deeper we go into this crisis, the louder each side will accuse the other of putting party before country. Both will be right. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

Israelis must turn away from the occupation, which is debasing their society and suffocating the Palestinians. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 January 2019 to refer expressly to teargas, and to omit a reference to shelling after the UN acknowledged error in its published material on which the reference to shelling had been based.",

      "body": "<p>Last Saturday afternoon a 23-year-old Italian called Enzo Bonito won a car race at the Foro Sol in Mexico City, and when he did it, motorsport shifted, just a little bit, towards a strange new future. Bonito was competing in the Race of Champions (RoC), racing head-to-head in a heat against Lucas di Grassi, a 34-year-old who <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Formula1/videos/2369837703240038/\" title=\"\">won the Formula E championship</a> just a couple of seasons back. And then, just to prove it wasn\u2019t a fluke, Bonito did it again the next day. This time he beat the 2012 Indycar champion, Ryan Hunter-Reay. The thing is, Bonito is a sim racer. He learned everything he knows from playing computer games.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t much of a surprise for me at all, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d says Ben Payne, who is the director of esports at McLaren. \u201cBut I know it raises eyebrows for a lot of other people.\u201d McLaren are investing a lot of time, effort and money in esports. Bonito is part of their team, along with Rudy van Buren, who won three races at last year\u2019s RoC, in Riyadh. Van Buren was working as a kitchen salesman when he won McLaren\u2019s World\u2019s Fastest Gamer competition, which earned him a year-long job as their simulator driver. Later this year, Payne says, Van Buren will probably make the switch from being a virtual racing driver to a real racing driver.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jun/15/simulators-egamers-robot-cars-bold-new-horizons-motor-sport\">Simulators, e-gamers and robot-cars: the bold new horizons of motor sport | Giles Richards</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIf you or I are amazing at Fifa, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to grace the FA Cup final any time soon and the same is true for most esports,\u201d Payne says. \u201cJust because you\u2019re good at NBA2K doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to get to play for the Boston Celtics. But sim racing is different. The skills are all so transferable. These guys know the tracks and they know the cars, they know the braking points, the gear changes, the apex points. They\u2019ve spent as much time training how to race these cars in the virtual world as anybody else has in the real world. And that\u2019s why they are taking names at RoC.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cd90bc14b99078caded4aa8274aa0ed0ff3afc1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cd90bc14b99078caded4aa8274aa0ed0ff3afc1/0_257_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Carroll, a sim-driver who competes in races from the rig set up in his bedroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Carroll, a sim-driver who competes in races from the rig set up in his bedroom.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Van Buren\u2019s backstory is a little different to Bonito\u2019s though. Van Buren used to kart race when he was a kid. He was the Dutch national champion in 2003 but he stopped when he was 16 because he couldn\u2019t afford to keep it up. Bonito, on the other hand, really has done most of his racing on a computer, at a wooden table, with a regular old chair. He got behind the wheel of a real racing car for the first time in 2018 at last year\u2019s RoC. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, at first jumping into the car was a bit terrifying,\u201d Bonito said back then. \u201cBut it went better than I thought.\u201d No joke. That same week he got within 0.4sec of beating Petter Solberg, the two-time world rallycross champion.</p> \n<p>Last week McLaren held their shadow project grand finals, a competition to find the world\u2019s best sim racers. They had more than 500,000 entrants. The final seven came to the UK to compete across a week of trials. On the Tuesday McLaren let them each loose in a 570S GT4 for 150 laps around the Top Gear test track in Dunsfold. \u201cYou do cross your fingers as they drive off,\u201d Payne says, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t have so much as a spin, really, and it was a bit greasy in the morning too.\u201d One of the competitors, Ebrahim Almubarak, had never even driven a real sports car before. In his online profile he admitted he does not have a favourite driver because he has never actually watched any races, \u201cbut on social media in recent years I have been hearing a lot about Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/14/hashtag-united-virtual-gamers-striking-rich-sport-2-0\">Hashtag United, Wimbly Womblys and the virtual gamers striking it rich</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When the telemetry data from those laps came back McLaren\u2019s analysts reckoned the best of the drivers were racing at a similar sort of level to someone who had spent a couple of years in F3. Which isn\u2019t a surprise, because the winner, Igor Fraga, was a karting champion who had a class win in Formula 3 Brazil in 2017. This year, Payne says: \u201cIgor will potentially have opportunities in a real car at McLaren.\u201d Fraga is one of a generation of drivers who are adept at both forms of the sport.</p> \n<p>Payne admits you cannot learn everything about real racing from a computer screen. The physical sensations, the fatigue, and the feel of the thing, the way it flows through your body, for instance, or, more than either of those, the fear.

      "bodyText": "Last Saturday afternoon a 23-year-old Italian called Enzo Bonito won a car race at the Foro Sol in Mexico City, and when he did it, motorsport shifted, just a little bit, towards a strange new future. Bonito was competing in the Race of Champions (RoC), racing head-to-head in a heat against Lucas di Grassi, a 34-year-old who won the Formula E championship just a couple of seasons back. And then, just to prove it wasn\u2019t a fluke, Bonito did it again the next day. This time he beat the 2012 Indycar champion, Ryan Hunter-Reay. The thing is, Bonito is a sim racer. He learned everything he knows from playing computer games. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t much of a surprise for me at all, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d says Ben Payne, who is the director of esports at McLaren. \u201cBut I know it raises eyebrows for a lot of other people.\u201d McLaren are investing a lot of time, effort and money in esports. Bonito is part of their team, along with Rudy van Buren, who won three races at last year\u2019s RoC, in Riyadh. Van Buren was working as a kitchen salesman when he won McLaren\u2019s World\u2019s Fastest Gamer competition, which earned him a year-long job as their simulator driver. Later this year, Payne says, Van Buren will probably make the switch from being a virtual racing driver to a real racing driver. \u201cIf you or I are amazing at Fifa, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to grace the FA Cup final any time soon and the same is true for most esports,\u201d Payne says. \u201cJust because you\u2019re good at NBA2K doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to get to play for the Boston Celtics. But sim racing is different. The skills are all so transferable. These guys know the tracks and they know the cars, they know the braking points, the gear changes, the apex points. They\u2019ve spent as much time training how to race these cars in the virtual world as anybody else has in the real world. And that\u2019s why they are taking names at RoC.\u201d Van Buren\u2019s backstory is a little different to Bonito\u2019s though. Van Buren used to kart race when he was a kid. He was the Dutch national champion in 2003 but he stopped when he was 16 because he couldn\u2019t afford to keep it up. Bonito, on the other hand, really has done most of his racing on a computer, at a wooden table, with a regular old chair. He got behind the wheel of a real racing car for the first time in 2018 at last year\u2019s RoC. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, at first jumping into the car was a bit terrifying,\u201d Bonito said back then. \u201cBut it went better than I thought.\u201d No joke. That same week he got within 0.4sec of beating Petter Solberg, the two-time world rallycross champion. Last week McLaren held their shadow project grand finals, a competition to find the world\u2019s best sim racers. They had more than 500,000 entrants. The final seven came to the UK to compete across a week of trials. On the Tuesday McLaren let them each loose in a 570S GT4 for 150 laps around the Top Gear test track in Dunsfold. \u201cYou do cross your fingers as they drive off,\u201d Payne says, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t have so much as a spin, really, and it was a bit greasy in the morning too.\u201d One of the competitors, Ebrahim Almubarak, had never even driven a real sports car before. In his online profile he admitted he does not have a favourite driver because he has never actually watched any races, \u201cbut on social media in recent years I have been hearing a lot about Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel\u201d. When the telemetry data from those laps came back McLaren\u2019s analysts reckoned the best of the drivers were racing at a similar sort of level to someone who had spent a couple of years in F3. Which isn\u2019t a surprise, because the winner, Igor Fraga, was a karting champion who had a class win in Formula 3 Brazil in 2017. This year, Payne says: \u201cIgor will potentially have opportunities in a real car at McLaren.\u201d Fraga is one of a generation of drivers who are adept at both forms of the sport. Payne admits you cannot learn everything about real racing from a computer screen. The physical sensations, the fatigue, and the feel of the thing, the way it flows through your body, for instance, or, more than either of those, the fear. There is no jeopardy in computer racing where you can always hit the reset button and start again. \u201cJenson Button once said that the fear factor is the biggest difference,\u201d Payne says. \u201cBut when we put these guys in the cars they aren\u2019t showing any fear because they know what they are doing. They\u2019ve done thousands of laps on these tracks. I think they should be scared, we all think they should be scared, but they have such confidence in their ability.\u201d Impressive as Bonito\u2019s victories were last Saturday, the RoC is still a world away from competing in F1. Not everyone is convinced real racing and virtual racing will ever entirely converge. But McLaren are. They say they are democratising the sport, and sim racing is surely a cheaper, and more readily accessible, way in to it than karting. \u201cWe think the future of esports is as big and bright as we want to make it,\u201d Payne says. He points out that McLaren\u2019s CEO Zak Brown recently said that he thinks in the next decade there will be an F1 champion who has come from a gaming background as opposed to a karting background. The line between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s virtual, Payne says, is getting blurrier by the day.",

The 40-year-old taxi driver, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is accused of conspiring with six others to carry out the attack on his own child. The youngster suffered serious burns to his face and arm after sulphuric acid was sprayed at him as he shopped for a birthday present in a Home Bargains store in Worcester. The court was told the father organised the attack due to an ongoing family court battle with his ex-wife after he demanded his children live with him.

      "body": "<p>A teenager took her own life at a mental health care home after the charity in charge laid off external therapists, employed unqualified staff and turned it into a \u201cboot camp\u201d, an inquest has heard.</p> <p>In May 2016 Sophie Bennett, 19, from Tooting, south-west London, killed herself in a bathroom at Lancaster Lodge in Richmond, west London, a facility that helps people with mental illnesses transition back to normal life, an inquest jury at West London coroner\u2019s court was told.</p> <p>The home was run by Richmond Psychosocial Foundation International, a charity set up by Elly Jansen, a leading figure in mental health care.</p> <p>In the first months of 2016, an abrupt change in management led to a deterioration in care, the inquest heard. After an inspection by the Care Quality Commission discovered problems, including about the administration of drugs, some of the 12 residents were told they would need to move out.</p> <p>Sophie was so upset by the prospect of leaving that she was placed on a regular five-minute inspection to ensure she did not harm herself. She was found unconscious in a bathroom minutes after one such check and died two days later in hospital. Another resident also attempted suicide.</p> <p>Before the changes, things looked like they were working out well for Sophie, her mother, Nickie Bennett, told the first day of the inquest, but later she became \u201cvery distressed\u201d.</p> <p>Sophie\u2019s father, Ben Bennett, said he felt no one at Wandsworth council\u2019s social services department gave any consideration to her safety.</p> <p>The teenager, a former county level swimmer described by her family as \u201ca bright, loving and caring person who loved sport and art and was talented at music\u201d, had been diagnosed with autism, bipolar and social anxiety disorders. She had twice previously taken overdoses and lived in an institution in Northamptonshire before moving to Lancaster Lodge.</p> <p>In late 2015 and early 2016, she had taken part in a Prince\u2019s Trust programme and worked in a charity shop, and the family hoped she might attend university. That unravelled when the care home manager, Vincent Hill, who she liked, was removed and \u201cmarched out of the building in front of the residents\u201d, Nickie Bennett said. Sophie\u2019s external therapist was also removed and her key worker dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t respond very well to [the new manager],\u201d said Sophie\u2019s mother. \u201cThey felt he didn\u2019t have the necessary qualifications. He wanted to run the place in a different way. Sophie described it that he wanted to run it as a boot camp.\u201d</p> <p>Clarissa Jeffrey, a fellow resident and friend of Sophie\u2019s said in a statement: \u201cThe changes felt as though they were fuelled by wanting to make money or save money. It eventually felt like we the residents were running the place.\u201d</p> <p>At one point some of them had to restrain a 17-year-old because \u201cnoone else would and she would have hurt herself,\u201d Jeffrey said.</p> <p>Richard Malado, a support worker interviewed by Jansen for a job after the original staff had left, said he had no qualification or experience in mental health work and said the post was \u201ca baptism of fire\u201d. In a statement he said he was aware of \u201csafeguarding concerns\u201d and it was \u201ca fragile environment\u201d.</p> <p>The CQC had carried out an inspection in March 2016 prompted by concerns about the handling of medicines, and by 7 April Sophie was told by her social worker that she would have to move, which left her \u201cvery distressed\u201d and \u201cvery unstable\u201d, the inquest heard.</p> <p>\u201cShe was absolutely desperate for us to say she could come home,\u201d said her mother, who told the coroner, John Taylor, it was not possibile. \u201cWe would have needed absolutely full-time care.\u201d</p> <p>On 2 May 2016, Sophie was found dead.</p> <p>Taylor told the jury that they would need to consider \u201cdid the changes [at Lancaster Lodge] cause or contribute to her death\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe she wanted to die,\u201d her mother said. \u201cShe just wanted some help.\u201d</p> <p>The inquest continues.</p>",

Sophie was so upset by the prospect of leaving that she was placed on a regular five-minute inspection to ensure she did not harm herself. She was found unconscious in a bathroom minutes after one such check and died two days later in hospital. Another resident also attempted suicide. Before the changes, things looked like they were working out well for Sophie, her mother, Nickie Bennett, told the first day of the inquest, but later she became \u201cvery distressed\u201d. Sophie\u2019s father, Ben Bennett, said he felt no one at Wandsworth council\u2019s social services department gave any consideration to her safety. The teenager, a former county level swimmer described by her family as \u201ca bright, loving and caring person who loved sport and art and was talented at music\u201d, had been diagnosed with autism, bipolar and social anxiety disorders. She had twice previously taken overdoses and lived in an institution in Northamptonshire before moving to Lancaster Lodge. In late 2015 and early 2016, she had taken part in a Prince\u2019s Trust programme and worked in a charity shop, and the family hoped she might attend university. That unravelled when the care home manager, Vincent Hill, who she liked, was removed and \u201cmarched out of the building in front of the residents\u201d, Nickie Bennett said. Sophie\u2019s external therapist was also removed and her key worker dismissed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t respond very well to [the new manager],\u201d said Sophie\u2019s mother. \u201cThey felt he didn\u2019t have the necessary qualifications. He wanted to run the place in a different way. Sophie described it that he wanted to run it as a boot camp.\u201d Clarissa Jeffrey, a fellow resident and friend of Sophie\u2019s said in a statement: \u201cThe changes felt as though they were fuelled by wanting to make money or save money. It eventually felt like we the residents were running the place.\u201d At one point some of them had to restrain a 17-year-old because \u201cnoone else would and she would have hurt herself,\u201d Jeffrey said. Richard Malado, a support worker interviewed by Jansen for a job after the original staff had left, said he had no qualification or experience in mental health work and said the post was \u201ca baptism of fire\u201d. In a statement he said he was aware of \u201csafeguarding concerns\u201d and it was \u201ca fragile environment\u201d. The CQC had carried out an inspection in March 2016 prompted by concerns about the handling of medicines, and by 7 April Sophie was told by her social worker that she would have to move, which left her \u201cvery distressed\u201d and \u201cvery unstable\u201d, the inquest heard. \u201cShe was absolutely desperate for us to say she could come home,\u201d said her mother, who told the coroner, John Taylor, it was not possibile. \u201cWe would have needed absolutely full-time care.\u201d On 2 May 2016, Sophie was found dead. Taylor told the jury that they would need to consider \u201cdid the changes [at Lancaster Lodge] cause or contribute to her death\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t believe she wanted to die,\u201d her mother said. \u201cShe just wanted some help.\u201d The inquest continues.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap after a busy day at Davos. Today\u2019s been largely dominated by environmental concerns, with a side order of anxiety about the world economy and Brexit Sir David Attenborough has challenged world leaders to do more to tackle the looming threat of climate change. In an interview with Prince William, the broadcasting legend warned that humans now had the power to exterminate whole communities of living creatures \u2018at will\u2019. Jacinda Ardern has also joined the push; New Zealand\u2019s PM told fellow world leaders to get on the right side of history, and embrace \u2018guardianship\u2019 of the earth. Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has vowed to create a \u2018New Brazil\u2019, based around slashing the size of the state. Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised by environmental activists for his insistence on developing parts of the Amazon rainforest. Greenpeace say the right-winger is one of the main threats to the environment. With America\u2019s delegation grounded, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addressed Davos by satellite link. Pompeo hailed Brexit, along with Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, as an example of the \u2018new wave\u2019 blowing through world politics. People are asking questions that haven\u2019t been asked, or taken seriously for an awfully long time. Brexit is also causing angst in the financial community; Citi\u2019s CEO Mike Corbat has said it will go \u2018down to the wire\u2019. We\u2019ll be back in the morning... At least one of the UK\u2019s coach-load full of ministers has been working hard at Davos.... UK ministers have kept a low profile at Davos today (they\u2019ve been busy with Brexit issues back home). But a row is brewing, after it emerged that SEVEN ministers are due at WEF this week - rubbing shoulders with the global elite rather than focusing on helping find a Brexit deal. Ross Kempsell of Talk Radio has the details: This has managed the rare trick of uniting the Labour Party and the Taxpayer\u2019s Alliance - not natural bedfellows. More news from Davos: WEF have announced an \u201cambitious new global partnership to accelerate inclusion for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people \u201c in the workplace. Called the Partnership for Global LGBTI Equality, it\u2019s designed to break down barriers and accelerate LGBTI inclusion in the workforce. It\u2019s been backed by big names, including Accenture, Deutsche Bank, EY, Mastercard, Microsoft, Omnicom and Salesforce, and supported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. In what is seemingly another veiled attempt to get Davos panellists to send a message to Trump, Al Gore asks Jacinda Arden to conjure a world leader in her mind. It can be \u201cman or woman\u201d he says - trying to stay vague - who doesn\u2019t want to do anything about the climate crisis, and is \u201chostile\u201d to any efforts to take action. What would you say to them, he asks. Jacinda says she\u2019s not sure she would say anything at all but instead show something. \u201cIt only takes a trip to the Pacific to see that climate change isn\u2019t a hypothetical,\u201d and it doesn\u2019t even require any knowledge of the science behind it. She said someone from the Pacific islands could show you where they used to play as children and where the water has risen to now. Then it\u2019s a matter of then saying that you don\u2019t have to cede power by acting on climate change, and assuring there\u2019s nothing to fear about their individual status. \u201cIt\u2019s about being on the right side of history,\u201d and being the politician looking back and knowing you were on the \u201cright side\u201d when the world was \u201ccrying out for a solution\u201d. Jacinda Ardern says she aims to to bring the New Zealand Maori philosophy of \u2018guardianship\u2019 of the environment into politics. She said the challenge is to deeply embed the infrastructure of long term change during a short political cycles that can be as short as three years. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason to be optimistic.\u201d Jacinda remembers that just 10 years ago she was booed by other politicians, and even her own family, when talking about climate change and environmentalism. There\u2019s been a marked shift since then, she said, adding that it\u2019s important not to go it alone. She thanked Attenborough for being a trusted voice that helped \u201ccreate space\u201d for politicians to do the right thing. She said now we need to turn pessimism and fear on its head, and into an opportunity to \u201cfuture proof\u201d society and the economy. The PM says it\u2019s the \u201conly option\u201d. Back in the congress hall, Al Gore notes that the fastest growing job in the US is currently \u2018solar installer\u2019 which is growing 9 times faster than average national job growth. The second is wind turbine technician, he said, adding that there\u2019s clearly an \u201copportunity for tens of millions of jobs\u201d to be retrofitting buildings with this renewable technology. The former US vice-president turned climate change campaigner is now challenging world leaders to step up: Kristalina Georgieva, the acting head of the World Bank has told a panel on investing in fragile states that there are four big reasons why countries are in a bad way: conflict, climate, high population growth and bad governance. One of the best ways to improve things was to empower women. \u201cIn a crisis environment you give a sense of strength to women and you have a better chance of peace\u201d. David Miliband, the former foreign secretary and now chief executive of the International Rescue Committee said on the same panel that displacement of peoples was seen as a short-term problem when in fact it was a long-term problem. \u201cPeople are more likely to be displaced for 17 years than 17 months\u201d, he said, adding that it was a \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d that only 2% of the humanitarian aid budget was spent on education. Back in the congress hall, Al Gore has taken the stage to introduce the Safeguarding Our Planet session. The panel includes Sir David Attenborough (he\u2019s been a busy man in the last 24 hours) and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden. With everyone sat down, they\u2019ve again played a clip from Attenborough\u2019s upcoming Netflix series made in conjunction with the WWF. Our Planet is definitely getting a lot of mileage at Davos this year.... Once they start talking, Ardern sounds like a leader who understands the scale of the crisis -- she\u2019s explaining how the need take \u2018guardianship\u2019 of our planet. Down the corridor from the Davos congress hall, the head of the World Bank is warning world leaders to help tackle extreme poverty, or face more security threats. Environmental experts are alarmed by Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s insistence on balancing \u2018environmental protection with economic development\u2019. Jennifer Morgan, executive director for Greenpeace International, believes Bolsonaro\u2019s attitude to the Amazon is one of the biggest threats to the environment. She says handing the agriculture ministry more control of the rainforest is \u201cincredibly worrying\u201d; it could damage the environment and harm the indigenous people who live in the Amazon. She told me: \u201cWe\u2019re working with allies, and we\u2019ll work to defend everything that we can because the Amazon isn\u2019t just an amazing forest, it\u2019s the lungs of the earth and it plays an incredibly important role in the climate.\u201d She is challenging business leaders to raise these issues with the Brazilian president, and \u201cprioritise the Amazon over short-term business profit.\u201d Lord Nicholas Stern, who wrote a ground-breaking report on the economics of climate change, is also concerned. \u201cBolsonaro was elected on a programme to deal with violence and criminality that kills 40-50000 people a year. My guess is that 100,000 die from air pollution.\u201d Stern added that he has raised the need to protect the Amazon rain forest with Bolsonaro\u2019s finance minister Paulo Guedes at a meeting in Davos. \u201cThe ravages of climate change are becoming clearer and clearer and time is running out. But the alternative is becoming more attractive. I would like to think the arguments are sinking in.\u201d Pompeo wrapped up his 30 minute satellite link to Davos by denying that the US is isolated on the world stage. That would be more convincing if the secretary of state wasn\u2019t addressing the global elite from 4,000 miles away (the ongoing shutdown is to blame there) Q: Are the US and Russia doomed to cold war rivalry? Pompeo jokily grumbles that he\u2019s not getting any easy questions. It\u2019s not the case that we are doomed to a cold war rivalry, he insists, But given Russia\u2019s \u201cformidable\u201d nuclear arsenal, the two sides must talk to prevent nuclear proliferation. Pompeo says the US is looking to Russia to change its behaviour, whether in Crimea or in the US, influencing elections. Chastising Vladimir Putin\u2019s administration, Pompeo says he \u201chopes they return to the right course of actions that lead them back to the rule of law.\u201d If that happens.. we are not destined to be protagonists, but it will require a change of heart from Russia. On the US-China trade war, Pompeo says he believes the two countries can have a bright future together. But there\u2019s still much hard work to do; he cites the need for intellectual property protections for US companies working in China. On geopolitics, Pompeo says \u201cWe face many new threats, some not so new\u201d. He cites: North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme Iran\u2019s \u201cforeign adventurism\u201d China \u201cstate-centred economic model , belligerence towards its neighbours, and embrace of a totalitarian state at home\u201d Islamic terrorism, which is still a threat. But Pompeo also hails the \u2018beautiful coalitions\u2019 that have helped the US. Pompeo is now tooting Trumpian economics. He says the US economy just grew at over 3% per year, wage growth is up, and female unemployment is a 65-year low. This \u201cunleashing of animal spirits\u201d has protected the US from a wider economic slowdown. He then urges Davos attendees to copy Trump\u2019s model of \u201clow taxes, economic liberalism and trade reforms\u201d. [yes, you too could have a rising deficit and a trade war with China....] We are living in interesting times, Mike Pompeo tells Davos. Voters have tuned out politicians and political alliance that they didn\u2019t were working in their interests. He cites Brexit, Emmanuel Macron in France, the Five Star movement in Italy, and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2016. People are asking questions that haven\u2019t been asked, or taken seriously for an awfully long time. Those questions include: Is economic growth good for me are politicians protecting me from terrorists are they working for my national interests abroad New winds are blowing across the world. But do they signal fair weather, or herald a storm, asks Pompeo poetically (well, for Davos anyway). He claims it is a positive development -- these developments show that nations and strong borders matter (he adds a pop at Nato members to raise military spending too) It\u2019s all go here at Davos. Jair Bolsonaro has left the stage, and he\u2019s been replaced by Mike Pompeo. Not in person, alas, but via a satellite link -- because Donald Trump decided to cancel the entire US delegation to Davos. Pompeo starts by saying that it\u2019s cold in Washington DC - so he feels like he\u2019s in Davos in spirit (minus 14 degrees this morning folks) Onto questions. WEF founder Klaus Schwab asks Jair Bolsonaro what \u2018concrete steps\u2019 he will take to create his New Brazil. I feared for a moment that Bolsonaro might talk about concreting over the Amazon (giving his push for \u2018much-needed economic development\u2019). But instead, the new president outlines how he will reduce the size of the state by reforming taxes, reforming social security, and lifting the \u201cheavy weight\u201d of the state. That might please free-marketeers in the audience, but it may worry Brazilians reliant on that aid (although Bolsonaro, of course, was elected on this platform). On economic issues, Bolsonaro says he is committed to opening up the Brazilian economy. He cites his commitments to reform taxes and privatise assets. And wrapping himself in the garb of a world leader, this former military officer declares: I want a world of freedom, peace and democracy. Brazil is a paradise, Bolsonaro declares, adding proudly: No other country in the world has as many forests as we do. The worry, of course, is that the new government will damage the Amazon. One of Bolsonaro\u2019s first acts was to transfer control of the regulation and creation of indigenous reserves to the agriculture ministry -- which is controlled by agribusiness lobby. That has been widely criticised by environmental groups. Bolsonaro\u2019s message is clear -- he wants economic development in the Amazon. He says: It is now our mission to make progress in harmonising environmental preservation and biodiversity, with the much needed economic development. Those who criticise us have a great deal to learn with us, he adds slightly cryptically. President Bolsonaro begins by talking about the New Brazil which he is building. He says he was victorious in last year\u2019s presidential race despite And he quickly criticises his predecessors, saying: I took office amid a great ethical, moral and economic crisis. I am committed to changing our history. Bolsonaro says his ministers are committed to cracking down on corruption and money-laundering. We are also spending more on security, he says, telling the Davos elite they should feel safe visiting Brazil with their families. It\u2019s time for the first major keynote speech - and the honour goes to Brazil\u2019s new president, Jair Bolsonaro. There\u2019s a lot of interest in Bolsonaro here at WEF, given his pledge to cut taxes, liberalise the Brazilian economy, and defeat socialism. But there should also be disquiet about Bolsonaro, given his history of inflammatory comments against minorities such as the LGBT community. Recent moves to open up exploitation of the Amazon, potentially causing great harm to indigenous people, are also a concern. A group of arctic scientists, camped out at Davos to promote the climate change crisis, have welcomed Sir David Attenborough\u2019s comments. We echo his calls for urgent action on climate change to prevent catastrophic changes to our planet through carbon emissions. What happens in the Arctic doesn\u2019t stay in the Arctic, for example, extreme weather at mid-latitudes is a symptom of a warming Arctic. The awesome clip showed today at Davos is replicating all over the Arctic - and we need urgent action to stop it. That\u2019s the end of the \u2018conversation\u2019 (disappointing, as I was hoping for more parenting insights from the Duke). Let\u2019s just hope the world leaders at Davos were listening to Attenborough\u2019s warnings about the need to address climate change, now, before we\u2019ve caused irreparable damage to the natural world. Otherwise, I fear the Prince may struggle to carve out a new career as a TV interrogator -- lucky he\u2019s a dab hand with a helicopter. I\u2019m delighted to report that Prince William has cracked a joke. We\u2019re being shown a dramatic clip from Our Planet, of a glacier \u2018calving\u2019 -- a massive skyscraper-sized piece of ice, surging upwards and away from the rest of the sheet (making the most almighty din) Before we see it, Attenborough is explaining how it\u2019s very tricky to film such an event, as you never quite know when it\u2019s going to happen. \u201cQuite like children, Sir David, unpredictable,\u201d grins the Duke. Attenborough is now plugging his new TV venture, Our Planet, created with the World Wildlife Fund. It\u2019ll be shown on Netflix, Attenborough says excitedly, saying that this will give a new audience for his work. It\u2019s a step forward from the old days of broadcast TV... Now, with Netflix, it is possible for a show to be seen by 150 million people overnight. [Other streaming services are available too.....] Q: Why will you be seeking a global deal for nature in 2020? Attenborough says the Paris Agreement recognised the \u201cparamount importance\u201d of recognising that humans were raising the word\u2019s temperature, and must control it. That recognition was important, but not universal, and some have withdrawn from it (yes you, Mr Trump). So a global deal for nature is meant to build on Paris, and ensure that countries stick to those commitments. Prince William isn\u2019t showing his hidden Jeremy Paxman here....but he does turn to the issue of how you balance capitalism and caring for the environment. Attenborough says that great damage was caused in the past, when people though that economic progress inevitably came at the expense of the environment. We are all one world. Attenborough is now explaining how the complexity of nature means humans can have a severe impact on the natural world. At the start of the 20th Century, sea otters in the Pacific were hunted for their most luxurious fur, so they were hunted heavily. Their numbers declined, and so - people eventually noticed - did fish stocks. Why? Sea otters prey on sea urchins, and they eat small algae. If they eat all that, the forest of algae vanishes, and there\u2019s no food for small fish. Q: What advice do you have for my generation, Prince William adds, as they take positions of power? The paradox that there have never been a time when ore people are out of touch from the natural world than they are now. Need to realise that every breath we take, every mouthful of food, comes from the natural world - so if we damage that we damage ourselves. And he goes on to urge the world leaders and business chiefs in the Davos conference hall to care for natural world, or we will harm ourselves. Q: Why have politicians been too slow to recognise the climate change problem? Attenborough explains that the industrial revolution took humans away from nature, so we didn\u2019t recognise the true impact of our activity on the environment. People saw the natural world as something to conquer, not care for. No excuse now, of course. Q: How urgent is the climate change crisis? It\u2019s hard to overstate it, Attenborough replies. Humans are now so numerous, and so powerful, that we can exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it, he replies somberly. We now have to be really aware about this, he adds, citing the growing problem of plastic in the sea. Prince William hardens up the questioning (a tiny notch), asking why Attenborough has become more vocal about environmental campaigning. DA replies that earlier in his career, it seemed unlikely that humans could drive a whole species to extinction - or it if happened, it was a rarity. Now we are ware that the whole natural world is within our control, he adds. Q: So that changed your view? Yes. Before, the notion that humanity might exterminate a whole community of animals was quite foreign. Q: How have technology changes affected the job of bringing nature to the public? Sir David says it\u2019s gone two ways. A few decades ago, if you showed a shot of an armadillo, they thought \u2018my goodness, what is that\u2019 -- the quality didn\u2019t matter. Now, advances in tech mean you can show nature in a way that \u201c20 years ago, no-one could have imagined\u201d Asked why his TV series have always proved so successful, Attenborough says he\u2019s not surprised - but that\u2019s thanks to the human capacity to be excited and amazed by the new. He cites a small child turning over a small stone, and declaring \u201cA slug, what a treasure!\u201d Q: How has the world changed since you started your broadcasting career in the 1950s? Sir DA explains that back in those days, the world felt unexplored and exciting. Visiting the Tropics for the first time, everywhere you turned you saw something new. You really got the feeling about how it must have been in the Garden of Eden. WEF\u2019s founder Klaus Schwab is introducing Prince William and Sir David Attenborough now, for a dialogue on nature The Duke begins by congratulating Sir David for winning the crystal award from the World Economic Forum last night. This session is called \u201cA Conversation with Sir David Attenborough and HRH the Duke of Cambridge\u201d, which sounds jolly cosy.... ....except this particular conversation is happening on a big stage, in a room that seats thousands. WEF says Attenborough will talk about \u201chis life\u2019s work and how he has inspired generations of people to become champions for our planet\u201d. There\u2019s a buzz building inside the Davos congress centre, as delegates flock towards its cavernous hall. Prince William has now been sighted, and will be interviewing Sir David Attenborough shortly. Sir David caused quite a stir at Davos last night, warning that human activity had pushed us into a new geological age: The Holocene has ended. The Garden of Eden is no more. We have changed the world so much that scientists say we are in a new geological age: the Anthropocene, the age of humans, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and the former Labour foreign secretary is speaking on a panel about the humanitarian crises that will shape 2019. He says the world is suffering from \u201ca crisis of diplomacy\u201d. We\u2019re seeing a retreat by the major global diplomatic players in a way that creates a vacuum in a way that we believe are contributors to the rising levels of violence and humanitarian tragedy that we see. I\u2019m here in Davos because I believe that at a time when governments are in retreat, NGOs and the corporate sector have to step up, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to see this week. AM Citi\u2019s CEO Mike Corbat also told Davos that he\u2019s worried about the people caught up in the US government shutdown, and \u201cthe hardship\u201d that is being created. Michael Corbat, chief executive officer of Citigroup, has told Davos that Brexit means his firm will be doing less work in London. Speaking at a lunch organised by Bloomberg, Corbat explained that Citi have already taken precautions for Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal - but wouldn\u2019t say how much it will cost. Corbat explained: From Citi\u2019s perspective, from the industry\u2019s perspective, as for many businesses, we\u2019ve had no choice but to prepare for a hard Brexit, as its likely we will come down to the wire. Hopefully reason will prevail and we\u2019ll strike a balanced outcome for each of the parties, but in some ways it\u2019s a difficult situation. Q: Do you think less of London than you used to? Corbat doesn\u2019t address the question directly, but then explains that Citi will be forced to move jobs overseas. The outcome is that we will be doing less there. If you look at our business there, a third of our business is UK related. About a third is Europe-related, and about a third is rest of world. Without a doubt it\u2019s likely we will be forced to move our European piece to the continent, and we\u2019ve prepared for that. Obviously we\u2019ll continue to do the UK piece in the UK, and over time we\u2019ll see what happens to the other third. Q: What will a hard Brexit cost Citi? That\u2019s confidential, Corbat, smiles, but \u201cit\u2019s not going to be a cost-neutral outcome.\u201d Matt Damon is in Davos, as part of his campaign for clean water: Christine Lagarde has been speaking to CNBC about the IMF\u2019s 2019 outlook. She says there is a lot of uncertainty facing the global economy, not least the trade war between the US and China, and the outcome of Brexit talks. AM A quick recap on European markets, where losses have widened as afternoon trading gets underway: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 6,936 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.6% at 11,072 France\u2019s CAC: -0.7% at 4,832 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1% at 19,444 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.5% at 9,006 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 355 AM Angel Gurria, secretary general of the OECD, says the chances of a no-deal Brexit are getting bigger every day. Speaking in Davos he said Brexit was a \u201csystemic\u201d issue, with far-reaching consequences. AM The World Economic Forum has some bad news for the US government -- reskilling its workforce to thrive in the new technological age will cost $34bn. And Washington will have to pick up most of the bill. WEF has calculated that it will only be profitable for companies to reskill around 25% of the nearly 15 million workers who will be forced out of the jobs market by automation in the next decade. The burden of the rest must be picked up by the state. Here\u2019s the key points from WEF\u2019s survey: New study on the US labour market finds that 86% of the $34 billion total cost for reskilling nearly 1.4 million \u201cstranded workers\u201d displaced by the Fourth Industrial Revolution and other factors over the next decade will likely fall on the government The private sector could profitably reskill 25% of all workers, a figure rising to 45% if businesses collaborate World Economic Forum partner companies have pledged to reskill or upskill 17 million workers globally, surpassing a 2018 target to reach 10 million workers by 2020 The latest wages and jobs report also showed another record high for UK employment. The number of people in work rose by 141,000 in the three months to November to 32.53m, easily beating economists\u2019 forecasts of 85,000. An employment rate of 75.8% is the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The unemployment rate meanwhile dipped unexpectedly to 4% from 4.1%. Here is the official take on the data from David Freeman at the ONS: The number of people working grew again, with the share of the population in work now the highest on record. Meanwhile, the share of the workforce looking for work and unable to find it remains at its lowest for over 40 years, helped by a record number of job vacancies. Wage growth continues to outpace inflation, which fell back slightly in the latest month. AM The head of Swiss banking giant UBS is cautiously optimistic that the Brexit crisis will be resolved, but wants to see more compromises... The free-market Institute for Economic Affairs think tank does not usually side with the anti-globalisation movement but on one thing they do agree: Davos is a bit of a racket. Philip Booth, an IEA fellow, said the annual January shindig was the perfect environment for \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d to flourish. \u201cIndustry is shaped by the dispersed decisions of seven billion consumers and tens of millions of businesses. It is not - or should not - be shaped by politicians. Yet Davos remains a huge magnet for politicians to work alongside leaders of the largest businesses and other vested interests to devise yet more regulations, interventions and barriers to entry that will undermine competition, by making it even harder for small businesses to operate in their markets. \u201cThe gathering perpetuates the myth that economic welfare is promoted by \u201cexperts\u201d. Next year, our government officials should sit the conference out, and leave Davos to the skiers.\u201d One of China\u2019s top financial regulators has told Davos that the country\u2019s economy is indeed slowing (as IHS\u2019s Nariman Behravesh just warned us) , but it\u2019s not a disaster. In the UK, figures just published show that pay grew at its fastest rate since 2008 at the end of last year, handing some good news to cash-strapped consumers. Pay (including bonuses) grew by 3.4% between September to November, compared with the same period in 2017 according to the ONS. It was the fastest rate since May to July 2008, before the global financial crisis had unleashed the worst of its effects. Economists had predicted growth of 3.3%, unchanged from the previous three months. That meant a real terms pay increase - when adjusted for inflation - of 1.2%. When bonuses were stripped out, regular pay increased by 3.3%, the highest since September to November 2008, equating to real terms pay rise of 1.1%. The decent wage data has sent the pound above the $1.29 mark. AM Nariman Behravesh, the chief economist of IHS Global Insight warns that global growth is slowing around the world. \u201cThis year the chances of a recession are around one in three but next year I see it as 50-50\u201d, he tells us, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. \u201cFor 2021 there is the same risk. Growth will be slow enough that it wouldn\u2019t take much of a shock to push it into recession.\u201d Behravesh added that an intensification of the trade war might be the trigger for a global recession, but the most likely cause would be a policy mistake.Looking at the world\u2019s three biggest economies, he said the US had been boosted temporarily by Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, the euro zone was again growing only slowly and the authorities in China were trying to stimulate activity. \u201cI am worried about China. It is surprising how fragile it is starting to look. All of a sudden the juggernaut is starting to look wobbly.\u201d Behravesh said he expected a Brexit deal because \u201ca hard Brexit would be horrible both for the UK and the EU. The backlash from business in the UK against a hard Brexit is pretty strong, but the EU is also starting to get worried despite what it says.\u201d You can read more details of Mohammed Hassan Mohamud\u2019s remarkable journey from two decades in a refugee camp to Davos here. Here\u2019s a flavour: At 28, Mohammed is the youngest Zonal Chairman at Kakuma, which was established in 1992 after the arrival of the \u2018Lost Boys of Sudan\u2019. These were about 20,000 children, mostly boys, who were separated from their families during conflict, trekking enormous distances to find refuge. Conditions in the camp, both mental and physical, are tough: We have adequate water. And obviously, it\u2019s not enough, but it\u2019s there. Like one tap. Our homes are made of iron sheets. We also have some services, access to medical facilities and the World Food Programme provides rations once a month. \u201cBut what I deal with is mainly psychological. People go crazy sometimes. Often, when outside people meet refugees, they only look at the physical suffering and the physical need. \u2018This person is injured, this person is hungry or homeless\u2019, and that\u2019s solved by donating food or giving shelter. \u201cBut 5, 10, 15 years down the line, the needs change. It\u2019s not about hunger now - it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s about finding a home. It\u2019s about identity. And that\u2019s what causes problems. And that\u2019s what I deal with myself also. Philipp Hildebrand, vice chairman of BlackRock (the world\u2019s largest fund manager) warns there could be a \u201cviolent\u201d market reaction to a no-deal Brexit. He told Bloomberg TV in Davos: If we\u2019re realistic we have to say there is little chance of the deal going through in its current form. So there is no Brexit on the one hand which could take various forms - the most modest one would be a delay initially - or a hard Brexit. A hard Brexit would be a dramatic event which I believe today is under-appreciated by the market. When we look at this we have to say that it\u2019s now either no Brexit or hard Brexit and that is something we should pay attention to because were that to happen, you can be sure that the market would react violently, perhaps at the last minute. AM One of the co-chairs at this year\u2019s Annual Meeting is being Mohammed Hassan Mohamud - a 28-year old refugee. Mohammed has spent the last 20 years confined to Kenya\u2019s Kakuma camp. He has no passport, no official date of birth and has never been anywhere outside the semi-arid climate of Sub-Saharan Africa - until this week, when WEF have brought him to Davos. He\u2019s a powerful speaker - telling delegates to drop their distrust of refugees and help. Mohammed says: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re afraid of. Refugees are real people. He explains that there are 185,000 refugees from 10 nationalities - he\u2019s kept awake at night worrying if he, and his brothers and sisters, will ever get out of the camp. We are just like other people. We have aspirations, we have dreams and we have needs. It surprises me that money and capital moves around the moves in seconds, but it takes a refugee decades - or in the case of my mother, she never got out. Waiting for 25 year for a change to call somewhere home. Refugee camps are not ethical - putting people in faraway places and pretending they don\u2019t exist is not ethical, nor sustainable, and not conducive for human growth. Davos attendees may be worried about climate change, but many are still choosing to arrive by private jet. Industry group Air Charter Service reckons there could be as many as 1,500 private jet flights over the week as delegates fly in for WEF. Andy Christie, Private Jets Director at ACS, explains: Davos doesn\u2019t have its own airfield and, whilst we have several clients who fly into the town by helicopter, the four main airfields that private jet users attending the forum use are Z\u00fcrich, D\u00fcbendorf, St. Gallen-Altenrhein and St. Moritz. \u201cWorking with WingX, we looked at private jet activity at those airports over the six days of each WEF week since 2013 \u2013 from one day before the event to one day after. Last year was the busiest year for private jets so far, showing an 11% increase on 2017, with more than 1,300 aircraft movements. If we see a similar increase this year, we could be looking at almost 1,500 aircraft movements over the six days. Some delegates will then further undermine the fight against climate change by taking a private limo from the airport into Davos, shunning the option of a bus or train (which are impressively reliable). Roland Rudd is in Davos and has been speaking about Brexit. The veteran PR man says the UK would \u201cfeel the pinch\u201d very soon if the UK leaves the EU without a deal and that the rest of the world is \u201camazed we\u2019re having this conversation\u201d. AM An early Davos mystery..... Davos Man and Woman are discussing the impact of strategic changes on their businesses. And after the raw greed and avarice that led to the financial crisis, it\u2019s refreshing to hear a bank boss argue in favour of financial regulation: Google\u2019s finance chief, Ruth Porat, is arguing that businesses need to win users\u2019 trust - and you only do that by doing the right thing in the first place. We just caught up with Christy Hoffman, the general secretary of the UNI global union, which represents 20 million service sector workers - from cleaners to Hollywood film directors - in 150 countries. She said her message to the executives gathered in Davos was the need for a new social contract to revive collective bargaining, manage the change brought about by new technology and spread the benefits of growth more widely. \u201cWorkers think globalisation for the elite, that Davos is for the elite. Where does that leave our global institutions and global trade. If we want a globalised economy it can\u2019t just be for corporations.\u201d Hoffman said she was shocked by the Oxfam report showing 26 billionaires owned the same wealth as half the world\u2019s population. There was a lot of talk at Davos about the need to deal with growing inequality but not a lot of action. Hoffman says: \u201cThere is no sense of sacrifice. There needs to be a transfer of wealth from one set of pockets to another.\u201d Global growth fears appear to be weighing on investor minds this morning, with European markets down in early trading following falls in Asia. The International Monetary Fund cut global growth forecasts on Monday, warning that a sharper slowdown in China and a no-deal Brexit are the biggest risks in 2019. Here are the scores so far across Europe: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,959 Gemany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 11,080 France\u2019s CAC: -0.4% at 4,846 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 19,542 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.5% at 9,011 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 355 Adair Turner, chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, has been speaking to Bloomberg in Davos about the impact of a China slowdown: AM Disappointingly, this year\u2019s Davos is missing several key world leaders. Donald Trump pulled out earlier this month, to focus on the US government shutdown. Ditto Theresa May, to focus on the Brexit talks. Emmanuel Macron is also staying at home, to focus on the anger of the Yellow Vest protests. And on Sunday, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa abandoned plans to pitch for more investment - as public unrest at home builds. We\u2019ll still get Bolsonaro, Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe, and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel. But as one Davos insider put it, the world leaders facing the biggest crises are staying at home. Good morning from Davos, where the first day of the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting is underway. It\u2019s a balmy minus 14 degrees this morning as top politicians, business leaders, advisers, rising \u2018young global leaders\u2019 and campaigners begin this annual gathering of the so-called global elite. Delegates should still have a stern warning from Sir David Attenborough ringing in their ears. Last night, the 92-year old broadcasting legend (the oldest, and perhaps most-loved attendee) declared that humans needed to urgently use their expert problem-solving skills to address the climate crisis, before catastrophe strikes. This official title of this year\u2019s event is \u2018Globalization 4.0: Shaping a Global Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2019. WEF hopes to make progress in tackling inequality, helping the losers from the last few decades of globalisation (but how quaffing champagne at exclusive parties in a Swiss ski resort achieves this is still unclear). After months of market turbulence, trade war tensions and signs that China is slowing down, the business chiefs who have made the trek to Davos this week are certainly nervous. Last night, PwC\u2019s annual healthcheck showed a worrying rise in pessimism. There\u2019ll be a big focus on the global economy today, with sessions on financial risk - and a satellite appearance by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Attenborough will also be appearing at a couple of sessions - one with Prince William, who will also be promoting mental health issues this week. The big ticket event, though, could be a speech by Brazil\u2019s new populist president Jair Bolsonaro. He\u2019ll be pitching his right-wing, free market policies to the investors at Davos. Here\u2019s a flavour of what\u2019s on the agenda: 8.45am GMT/9.45am Davos time: Are we ready for the next financial shock? USB chairman Axel Weber, Fang Xinghai, Vice-Chairman, China Securities Regulatory Commission, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater and Jin Keyu of the London School of Economics will give their views on this vital topic 9am GMT/10am Davos time: IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath and economist Adam Tooze will discuss how to rethink globalisation 12.30pm GMT/ 1.30pm Davos: Press Conference: The Humanitarian Crises That Will Shape 2019 1.15pm GMT / 2.15pm Davos: A Conversation with Sir David Attenborough and HRH The Duke of Cambridge 2.30pm GMT/3.30pm Davos: Special Address by Jair Bolsonaro, President of Brazil 3pm GMT/4pm Davos: Special Session with Michael Pompeo, Secretary of State of the United States 4pm GMT/5pm Davos: Sir David Attenborough, former US vice-president Al Gore and New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern will discuss how to save our planet (the title of Attenborough\u2019s new Netflix series)",

However, Russia has been warned it faces being banned from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and prohibited from hosting international sporting events if there is any evidence that the lab data \u2013 which was retrieved last week \u2013 has been tampered with. Wada\u2019s executive committee was heavily criticised in September when it decided to lift the Russian Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s suspension despite Russia continuing to deny its involvement in a massive state-sponsored doping operation. However the Wada president, Sir Craig Reedie, insisted that the \u201csignificant progress\u201d made since \u2013 including the acquisition of more than 20 terabytes of data from the Moscow lab which could help to prosecute potentially hundreds of doping cases \u2013 had justified the decision. \u201cCollecting the all-important data is a critical step and it was not easy to achieve,\u201d Reedie said. \u201cWe are not yet at the finishing line but undeniably we are much further along the track than we would have been without the September executive committee decision. \u201cWe are now proceeding to the second phase, namely authenticating the data retrieved from the Moscow laboratory so that ultimately we can use it to catch more athletes who cheated and to exonerate others.\u201d Reedie described the criticism he has faced from many anti-doping groups and athletes, who believe he has been too soft on Russia, as \u201cwearying\u201d but insisted recent events had vindicated his decisions. \u201cWe will not be deterred from this mission, which we firmly believe is in the best interests of clean sport and of athletes worldwide,\u201d he said. Meanwhile Wada\u2019s director of investigations, Gunter Younger, promised that his department was now in a \u201cvery good position\u201d to prosecute Russian doping cases after getting the Moscow lab data. \u201cWe had already identified the most suspicious cases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just needed the last piece of the puzzle, which was the raw lab data.\u201d He also promised his department would examine the lab data closely for signs of manipulation. \u201cIt is very complicated to falsify individual documents, but we are not naive.\u201d Jonathan Taylor, the head of Wada\u2019s compliance review committee, said the \u201ctoughest possible sanctions\u201d would be imposed on Russia if tampering was confirmed. \u201cThese will very likely include that Russia may not be granted any right to host any World Championships in any sport for a specified period; and that no Russian officials, athletes or athlete support personnel will be permitted to participate in the 2020 Olympic or Paralympic Games,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Wada director general Olivier Niggli.",

Going to Wetherspoon\u2019s to listen to Tim Martin address a meeting in a pub at 10.30am was, however, only ever likely to expose as narrow a range of sentiments as, for example, judging the moral climate by reference to readers\u2019 comments on Mail Online \u2013 at best imprecise, or just simply misleading. Abstemious readers should not be misled into believing that all Martin\u2019s patrons have signed a pledge to agree with his view on anything, let alone Brexit. John Harris also needs to get out of his musical rut, stop quoting punk lyrics from the time we joined the EU, and listen to something more uplifting but rebellious, like \u201cWhat would William Morris say\u201d, by contemporary folk writer and musician Reg Meuross.<br><strong>Les Bright</strong><br><em>Exeter, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 In attempting to explain Brexit fervour, John Harris cites the line in the Sex Pistols song Anarchy in the UK \u201cDon\u2019t know what I want, but I know how to get it\u201d as part of a centuries-old English \u201ctendency to indulge in futile, inexplicable gestures\u201d. Brexit may be better encapsulated by Johnny Rotten\u2019s question to the audience at the end of the last Sex Pistols concert in 1978: \u201cEver get the feeling you\u2019ve been cheated?\u201d</p> <p>Harris also says that \u201cbelief in a second referendum still seems to be largely the preserve of a certain kind of middle-class person\u201d. Perhaps we should include Nigel Farage in that: in an interview with the Daily Mirror on 16 May 2016 he anticipated a remain victory and said that, if it was a narrow win, pressure would grow for a rerun of the ballot: \u201cIn a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way.\u201d<br><strong>David Osmon</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris cites the futile yell of Johnny Rotten\u2019s Anarchy in the UK in his assessment of England\u2019s rebel spirit. But for me, as I believe John has already acknowledged in the past, it\u2019s Rotten\u2019s fatalistic poetry of God Save the Queen that nails the moment: \u201cThere\u2019s no future in England\u2019s dreaming\u201d. Yeah, I think that pretty much covers it. But sadly, I suspect the anger of the potential H-bombs he witnessed in Wetherspoon\u2019s will not be defused until they have their day. Only then perhaps will they wake up to the true consequences of their nationalistic dreams of independence, empowerment and status. It\u2019s just sad that the rest of us have to be dragged along. <br><strong>Colin Montgomery</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 Wetherspoon\u2019s is taking Brexit to absurdity, by serving fewer wines and beers from the EU. Where will this end? If it is using HP Sauce, that iconic brand with the picture of the Houses of Parliament on the label, then Wetherspoon\u2019s needs to look closer. It is now produced in the Netherlands. <br><strong>John Edgar</strong><br><em>Kilmaurs, East Ayrshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I grew up in the northern town of Blackburn in a very working-class family and then lived in an artists\u2019 community in Manchester, so I am in touch with both sides of the Brexit argument. People in my local pub talk about how they think politicians will betray Brexit and the people. Then I go to Manchester and I hear university students the same age as me who think the pub drinkers are idiots.</p> <p>People in working-class towns voted leave out of anger \u2013 not at the EU as an institution but against the political class in general. Of course, it is then easy to point at them and say: \u201cWhy vote against EU membership then?\u201d But that is to miss the point of their anger. For these people politics has not just failed them but forgotten them entirely. Industries that they had pride in shrank. Mine and steel workers, factory workers and tradesmen, had their occupations taken from them.</p> <p>Then a devastating recession forced many of them to the extremes of desperation. Then we had a referendum and they heard a Conservative prime minister asking them to vote for the status quo. Of course they voted leave. Theresa May says another referendum would damage social cohesion. I agree that in the current vicious and aggressive atmosphere it would. But if we were to reach out to the people we disagree with we could start to heal these divisions. After all, those guys in the pub in Blackburn and my friends in central Manchester would both buy me a pint, so why not each other? <br><strong>Carl Monaghan</strong><br><em>Blackburn</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is a straightforward and simple explanation for the Brexit vehemence that John Harris so vividly observes. This is, and always has been, an epistemological problem, a problem of knowledge. Present company excepted, the British media have, for 40 years, largely suppressed or censored information that would show the vast benefits and advantages that accrue from our partnership with other European countries. Eager to headline questions about straight bananas or sugar mountains in the past, the media have largely left the general population uninformed about Europe and the positive effects it has on our lives. Even Tim Martin of Wetherspoons appears to be completely in the dark about politics, Europe, and the great good our EU membership brings.<br><strong>Dr Ian Flintoff</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris evokes George Orwell\u2019s comments about nationalism versus patriotism, but is he observing patriots or nationalists? Has the distinction been lost, or was it ever understood? Orwell makes clear the distinction between love of place and identity as being decidedly preferable to a hatred of \u201cJohnny Foreigner\u201d born out of fear and ignorance. Both are usually based on sentimental myths often fed by the rightwing press and insufficiently exposed. Even banal bans on coloured lightbulbs and orders to reduce the power of vacuum cleaners stoke up resentment against the EU when, in fact, these were proposals from the UK government.</p> <p>Harris refers to a feeling of empathy for the Wetherspoon\u2019s patrons eager to swallow Tim Martin\u2019s agitprop with their pints. Certainly, the political elite need to begin to understand, and act on, the confusion and resentment felt by traditional communities to such rapid change to their sense of place and identity before the nationalism of the extreme right does it for them.<br><strong>Haydn Thomas</strong><br><em>Sidmouth, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris regrets that people are worked up about Brexit rather than climate change. Surely they are opposing choices? No one who cares about climate change could possibly vote for a policy that will entail transporting goods from the other side of the world rather than from across the channel, thus deepening the carbon footprint for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>In choosing Brexit, the British people showed their lack of concern about climate change and subsequent decisions, like accepting fracking, have confirmed that Britain is already closer to the US president\u2019s point of view on these questions, than that of Emmanuel Macron.<br><strong>Edwin Apps</strong><br><em>Liez par Maillezais, France</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here to upload it</em></strong></a><strong><em> and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

Perhaps we should include Nigel Farage in that: in an interview with the Daily Mirror on 16 May 2016 he anticipated a remain victory and said that, if it was a narrow win, pressure would grow for a rerun of the ballot: \u201cIn a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way.\u201d David Osmon London \u2022 John Harris cites the futile yell of Johnny Rotten\u2019s Anarchy in the UK in his assessment of England\u2019s rebel spirit. But for me, as I believe John has already acknowledged in the past, it\u2019s Rotten\u2019s fatalistic poetry of God Save the Queen that nails the moment: \u201cThere\u2019s no future in England\u2019s dreaming\u201d. Yeah, I think that pretty much covers it. But sadly, I suspect the anger of the potential H-bombs he witnessed in Wetherspoon\u2019s will not be defused until they have their day. Only then perhaps will they wake up to the true consequences of their nationalistic dreams of independence, empowerment and status. It\u2019s just sad that the rest of us have to be dragged along. Colin Montgomery Edinburgh \u2022 Wetherspoon\u2019s is taking Brexit to absurdity, by serving fewer wines and beers from the EU. Where will this end? If it is using HP Sauce, that iconic brand with the picture of the Houses of Parliament on the label, then Wetherspoon\u2019s needs to look closer. It is now produced in the Netherlands. John Edgar Kilmaurs, East Ayrshire \u2022 I grew up in the northern town of Blackburn in a very working-class family and then lived in an artists\u2019 community in Manchester, so I am in touch with both sides of the Brexit argument. People in my local pub talk about how they think politicians will betray Brexit and the people. Then I go to Manchester and I hear university students the same age as me who think the pub drinkers are idiots. People in working-class towns voted leave out of anger \u2013 not at the EU as an institution but against the political class in general. Of course, it is then easy to point at them and say: \u201cWhy vote against EU membership then?\u201d But that is to miss the point of their anger. For these people politics has not just failed them but forgotten them entirely. Industries that they had pride in shrank. Mine and steel workers, factory workers and tradesmen, had their occupations taken from them. Then a devastating recession forced many of them to the extremes of desperation. Then we had a referendum and they heard a Conservative prime minister asking them to vote for the status quo. Of course they voted leave. Theresa May says another referendum would damage social cohesion. I agree that in the current vicious and aggressive atmosphere it would. But if we were to reach out to the people we disagree with we could start to heal these divisions. After all, those guys in the pub in Blackburn and my friends in central Manchester would both buy me a pint, so why not each other? Carl Monaghan Blackburn \u2022 There is a straightforward and simple explanation for the Brexit vehemence that John Harris so vividly observes. This is, and always has been, an epistemological problem, a problem of knowledge. Present company excepted, the British media have, for 40 years, largely suppressed or censored information that would show the vast benefits and advantages that accrue from our partnership with other European countries. Eager to headline questions about straight bananas or sugar mountains in the past, the media have largely left the general population uninformed about Europe and the positive effects it has on our lives. Even Tim Martin of Wetherspoons appears to be completely in the dark about politics, Europe, and the great good our EU membership brings. Dr Ian Flintoff Oxford \u2022 John Harris evokes George Orwell\u2019s comments about nationalism versus patriotism, but is he observing patriots or nationalists? Has the distinction been lost, or was it ever understood? Orwell makes clear the distinction between love of place and identity as being decidedly preferable to a hatred of \u201cJohnny Foreigner\u201d born out of fear and ignorance. Both are usually based on sentimental myths often fed by the rightwing press and insufficiently exposed. Even banal bans on coloured lightbulbs and orders to reduce the power of vacuum cleaners stoke up resentment against the EU when, in fact, these were proposals from the UK government. Harris refers to a feeling of empathy for the Wetherspoon\u2019s patrons eager to swallow Tim Martin\u2019s agitprop with their pints. Certainly, the political elite need to begin to understand, and act on, the confusion and resentment felt by traditional communities to such rapid change to their sense of place and identity before the nationalism of the extreme right does it for them. Haydn Thomas Sidmouth, Devon \u2022 John Harris regrets that people are worked up about Brexit rather than climate change. Surely they are opposing choices? No one who cares about climate change could possibly vote for a policy that will entail transporting goods from the other side of the world rather than from across the channel, thus deepening the carbon footprint for the foreseeable future. In choosing Brexit, the British people showed their lack of concern about climate change and subsequent decisions, like accepting fracking, have confirmed that Britain is already closer to the US president\u2019s point of view on these questions, than that of Emmanuel Macron.

As for a second referendum \u201cundermining faith in our democracy\u201d, I suggest that many of us have already been disillusioned by a politically motivated referendum and a leave campaign based on undeliverable promises, funded by dubious sources and subject to covert manipulation by outside actors. Gordon Brown\u2019s proposal that we should hold a people\u2019s vote preceded by citizens\u2019 assemblies is a good one. This might just restore civil discourse and convince the world that this country is still capable of making informed and considered decisions after a mutually respectful debate.<br><strong>Susan Newton</strong><br><em>Uppermill, </em><em>Greater Manchester </em></p> <p>\u2022 How can it be that in all the discussion about Brexit-related threats, so little is said about the disastrous environmental impact of switching the UK\u2019s trading focus from our own continent to those that are far away?

However, she should reflect on how those same uncompromising members of rightwing organisations such as the English Defence League are likely to behave after Brexit, when, as will probably happen, some of them, at least, lose their jobs, can\u2019t get the prescriptions they need, can\u2019t afford to buy the foods they used to take for granted and realise they have been sold a pack of lies by the very people they thought were telling them the unvarnished truth. Oh, and that just as many foreign nationals are settling here as before, only most of them now come from the Indian subcontinent. At this point I imagine Messrs Johnson, Rees-Mogg, Duncan-Smith et al will suddenly find they have to pursue exciting other commitments, well away from the frontline of British politics. Mrs May makes much of her sense of duty. Isn\u2019t her principal responsibility to protect the interests of the 66 million inhabitants of the UK, not to satisfy the whims of 17 million highly biddable members of the public, expressed in an absurd simulacrum of democracy? Matthew Taylor Hove, East Sussex \u2022 It is rather late in the day for the prime minister to be worrying about social cohesion after a decade of Tory austerity and a steady dismantling and underfunding of our public services. As for a second referendum \u201cundermining faith in our democracy\u201d, I suggest that many of us have already been disillusioned by a politically motivated referendum and a leave campaign based on undeliverable promises, funded by dubious sources and subject to covert manipulation by outside actors. Gordon Brown\u2019s proposal that we should hold a people\u2019s vote preceded by citizens\u2019 assemblies is a good one. This might just restore civil discourse and convince the world that this country is still capable of making informed and considered decisions after a mutually respectful debate. Susan Newton Uppermill, Greater Manchester \u2022 How can it be that in all the discussion about Brexit-related threats, so little is said about the disastrous environmental impact of switching the UK\u2019s trading focus from our own continent to those that are far away? Are we so very unaware of the planetary crisis that threatens us all? Diana Francis Bath",

A member of North East Lincolnshire council, where the alleged conduct took place, strongly rejected the claim that enforcement officers harass people.</p> <p>In north Wales, an action group has been set up with 8,523 members who have run campaigns and marches against Kingdom. Members want to see the problem of littering and dog-fouling dealt with in-house.</p> <p>Across England and Wales, seven councils \u2013 including Liverpool, Anglesey, and Flintshire \u2013 no longer outsource the enforcement of minor environmental and antisocial behaviour fines to the firm. But at least 14 local authorities still have contracts with Kingdom Services Group.</p> <p>Liverpool dropped the company in November after complaints. The city\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, said: \u201c65% [of Kingdom officers] were operating in the city centre and 65% of fines were for disgarding cigarette butts. I am not saying that\u2019s right, there are toxins in cigarettes that do environmental damage, but people were saying officers were lying in wait for people to come out of office buildings to smoke and fining them.

It says it pays its staff \u201can hourly rate together with an allowance for strict adherence to quality and procedures, which ensures controls are followed\u201d. This is done to maintain \u201chigh standards\u201d, it says.</p> <p>The company says FPNs are determined by legislation that also provides strict guidelines as to what constitutes an offence. It said that Kingdom officers are required to operate within them and do so in an effort to protect environmental standards.</p> <p>Lara ten Caten, a legal Officer at Liberty, said: \u201cThese orders are overwhelmingly used in poorer areas \u2013 outsourcing enforcement to a company that is just in it to make as much money as possible is not just callous but irresponsible and a failure of governance.\u201d</p>",

Internal messages provided to the Guardian by a former Kingdom officer based in the north-west of England appear to show area management competing to issue as many fines as possible, drawing up a \u201c100 club\u201d league table for officers who issue at least 100 fines a month, equivalent to \u00a310,000. \u201cIt was an internal leaderboard,\u201d the former employee said, speaking anonymously. \u201cIt was all about targets and bonuses \u2026 In my training, if you saw someone smoking you could wait to see if they dropped their cigarette butts.\u201d Another former Kingdom officer, who worked in Wales before leaving the company in 2017, alleged there was a \u201cculture of fear\u201d and officers had to issue four tickets a day for the contract to be financially viable. When they had problems doing so in winter due to less footfall a training team was brought in. \u201cThe training team came in and caused mayhem \u2026 You are supposed to wear full uniform \u2026 but the training team came in and wore plain clothes and that contradicted what the council wanted from the contract. They were telling us to hide in bushes and to hide behind cars and to make sure no one saw our logo,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cI believe this company is profiting from poverty. Some people would trawl around estates or out of town centres and know where to target because it was easier. Some people would target certain age groups, like over-60s, as they were law abiding and if issued with a fixed penalty notice they would pay it.\u201d A few months ago a woman told Grimsby Live that she was followed for 15 minutes, including into a local pub, by five Kingdom officers for dropping a cigarette on Victoria Street. A member of North East Lincolnshire council, where the alleged conduct took place, strongly rejected the claim that enforcement officers harass people. In north Wales, an action group has been set up with 8,523 members who have run campaigns and marches against Kingdom. Members want to see the problem of littering and dog-fouling dealt with in-house. Across England and Wales, seven councils \u2013 including Liverpool, Anglesey, and Flintshire \u2013 no longer outsource the enforcement of minor environmental and antisocial behaviour fines to the firm. But at least 14 local authorities still have contracts with Kingdom Services Group. Liverpool dropped the company in November after complaints. The city\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, said: \u201c65% [of Kingdom officers] were operating in the city centre and 65% of fines were for disgarding cigarette butts. I am not saying that\u2019s right, there are toxins in cigarettes that do environmental damage, but people were saying officers were lying in wait for people to come out of office buildings to smoke and fining them. That\u2019s not what we are about.\u201d Kingdom said that it had ended a number of the contracts itself \u201cdue to commercial decisions it has taken\u201d. Kingdom Services Group still lists Liverpool city council as a customer on its website, and also says that it operates a range of payment schemes guaranteeing no cost to the local authority. \u201cKingdom\u2019s costs are recovered by the fixed penalty notices (FPNs) we issue and, with our average 75% payment rate, which has resulted in \u00a33.3m for local authorities during the last 12 months,\u201d the website states. The company has denied it operates a bonus scheme. It says it pays its staff \u201can hourly rate together with an allowance for strict adherence to quality and procedures, which ensures controls are followed\u201d. This is done to maintain \u201chigh standards\u201d, it says. The company says FPNs are determined by legislation that also provides strict guidelines as to what constitutes an offence. It said that Kingdom officers are required to operate within them and do so in an effort to protect environmental standards. Lara ten Caten, a legal Officer at Liberty, said: \u201cThese orders are overwhelmingly used in poorer areas \u2013 outsourcing enforcement to a company that is just in it to make as much money as possible is not just callous but irresponsible and a failure of governance.\u201d",

It is, however, common not to have enough space for all your books, a problem that I and many others experience. Now that I have reached peak book, I have made a deal with myself. I still buy books if I want them badly enough. But for each one I buy, I take two to the local charity bookshop. A drawback is that the two I move on are generally smaller than the one I acquire, so no net gain in space may accrue. This works for me, though it may not for others.

By 2020, electricity from renewables is likely to be consistently cheaper than fossil fuel energy, making it possible that 30% of electricity could come from renewable sources by 2030, one of the Mission2020 milestones. But coal-fired generation is still increasing, with coal-fired power plants continuing to be built in some areas, while existing plants are not being removed from service fast enough. Electric vehicles, meanwhile, comprise 1.4% of overall sales, making a 2020 milestone of 15% of new car sales hard to reach. The goals are the work of Mission 2020, a global coalition of several climate analysis organisations, headed by Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who negotiated the Paris accord. Mission 2020 has calculated that if these milestones are achieved by 2020, it will make the longer-term Paris goals possible \u2013 because progress now on reducing emissions will make it easier and cheaper to reduce them in the longer term \u2013 and wants to spur sufficient progress on climate change to bring that about. Figueres is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos to press political and business leaders for more support for climate change initiatives. She said: \u201cThe impacts [of climate change] have never been as clear, nor action so urgent, as we are quickly approaching tipping points of no return. It would follow, then, that leaders everywhere should now be discussing this number one concern as their number one priority.\u201d She added: \u201cThe decisions we take over the next two to three years are crucial for the unprecedented structural changes we must embark on to safeguard our climate and clean up our air. This is the make it or break it opportunity we have, knowing that the world is expected to invest about $90tn on infrastructure in the period up to 2030, with much of this investment to be programmed in the next few years.\u201d",

The Trump Organization, which is run by the president\u2019s sons, Eric and Donald Jr, wants to build 550 luxury homes and \u201cleisure units\u201d in fields a few hundred metres from their 18-hole golf course north of Aberdeen. Their proposals are expected to be voted on by Aberdeenshire councillors at meetings in February and March, and have attracted nearly 3,000 letters of protest \u2013 the highest number in the council\u2019s history. This week the council\u2019s housing officials told councillors they would only support the proposals if the Trumps stumped up \u00a35m to help meet a significant shortage of affordable homes, or the plans were changed to include affordable homes. Aberdeenshire\u2019s affordable housing strategy says cash compensation is only allowed in \u201crare and exceptional\u201d cases, and then as a last resort, where developers fail to include any affordable housing in a scheme and also fail to provide alternative sites for those homes. Aberdeenshire has a mandatory policy that all new housing projects must include 25% affordable housing, based on a Scottish government target that up to a quarter of housing schemes must be affordable. Last year, Aberdeenshire had more than 6,000 people on its housing waiting lists and the council hopes to spend \u00a3250m building 2,000 new homes. Housing officials signalled last year this was likely to be a sticking point for the Trump Organization and have now formally requested the \u00a35m payment as part of the planning application. It is thought the housing department\u2019s stance could strengthen councillors\u2019 opposition to the proposals, on the grounds that other, less powerful developers would be forced to include affordable homes in their plans. The Trumps would probably appeal to Scottish ministers, echoing the dispute they had with Aberdeenshire in 2008 when the original proposals for a \u00a3750m golfing resort were rejected and then accepted on appeal. While council departments, such as economic development, say the new housing would be useful, the scheme overturns the original masterplan agreement for Trump\u2019s estate in 2008. That deal stipulated that private homes can only be built after tourist facilities are in place. Belhelvie community council has also put in a long list of objections, including the lack of any affordable homes for local people. Trump\u2019s company had argued it was providing 27 flats as affordable accommodation but that appears to have been rejected by the council as those flats are for estate staff, not ordinary residents. Cllr Martin Ford, the Green party councillor who used his casting vote as chair of a local committee to temporarily block Trump\u2019s golfing resort scheme in 2008, said the lack of affordable housing was a critical issue. \u201cMr Trump\u2019s application for outline planning permission for a golf resort was also contrary to numerous planning policies,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThe unique treatment of that application \u2013 it was \u2018called in\u2019 and granted by the Scottish government \u2013 undoubtedly had much to do with the identity of the applicant. \u201cThis time there must be no special favours for Mr Trump\u2019s business.

A total of 72% of polled Americans now say global warming is personally important to them, according to the Yale program on climate change communication. This is the highest level of concern since Yale starting polling the question in 2008. Overall, 73% of Americans accept that global warming is happening, outnumbering those who don\u2019t by five to one. This acceptance has strengthened in recent years, rising by 10% since March 2015. The proportion that grasps that humans are the primary cause of warming is smaller, with 62% understanding this to be the case.

      "bodyText": "Mexico\u2019s murder rate broke a new record in 2018 as the country\u2019s drug war dragged on and criminal groups fought for control of an increasingly diversified range of illegal activities. Figures released this week by the country\u2019s public safety secretariat show that 28,816 homicide case files were opened in 2018, a 15% increase over the previous year. In recent years, violence has exploded in previously peaceful areas of the country such as Quintana Roo state, which registered 763 homicides in 2018 \u2013 double the 2017 figure. Conflict in Quintana Roo \u2013 home of the Caribbean resort cities of the \u201cMexican Riviera\u201d \u2013 has been attributed to a struggle for smuggling routes and local drug markets, but in other regions, violence has been driven by other illegal markets. In the western state of Guanajuato, homicide rates have been sent soaring by an epidemic of fuel theft \u2013 in which gasoline is siphoned from pipelines. Guanajuato, the country\u2019s conservative, Catholic heartland recorded 2,609 homicides in 2018, making it the most murderous state in Mexico. The new murder figures underline the scale of the challenge facing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office on 1 December promising to calm the country after 12 years of a militarised crackdown on drug cartels and organised crime. L\u00f3pez Obrador, known as Amlo, campaigned on a promise to tackle what he considered the root causes of crime such as poverty and a lack of opportunity, but has caused some disquiet by announcing plans for creating a militarised police force despite accusations that the country\u2019s armed forces have themselves contributed to the rising violence. \u201cThe creation of the [national guard] is popular among the political class and society in general. But the fuel that feeds it [is] political opportunism and social desperation in the face of violence,\u201d wrote Ernesto Portillo, technical secretary of the Mexican Forum for Democratic Security, in Animal Pol\u00edtico. L\u00f3pez Obrador has so far focused efforts on an attempt to stamp out fuel theft, which he said costs the country $3bn annually. The crackdown has caused long fuel lines in at least six states and prompted accusations that the crackdown had been improvised. The seriousness of the problem was brought home last Friday, when at least 93 people died after a tapped fuel pipeline exploded in central Hidalgo state. On Monday, the government reported that 14,894 such illegal taps had been found in 2018 \u2013 an average of about 41 a day nationwide.",

Ministers are outlining the risks of a no deal on health, the economy, transport and farming.</p> <p>The Labour first minister <strong>Mark Drakeford</strong> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a series of statements ministers will outline the risks we face \u2013 for public services, the economy and across society. The impacts are potentially far ranging and will be felt by everyone. These are not theoretical or hypothetical concerns but the reality of where we now find ourselves. Today\u2019s series of statements is part of our determination to ensure that assembly members are kept updated on this work.</p> <p>The truth is that no one really knows what will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It follows that neither Wales nor the UK as a whole can be truly prepared for all the possible eventualities.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Vaughan Gething,</strong> minister for health and social services, was first up. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I continue to be concerned about the future supply of radioisotopes to Wales in the event of a no deal scenario. Radioisotopes are essential for diagnostic and therapeutic use by our NHS. There are no sources in the UK and supplies are routinely imported from other EU countries through the main cross-channel ports. Disruption from customs checks at our ports is likely to render radioisotopes useless for healthcare treatment.</p> <p>A no deal Brexit will have a profound impact on all professions and all health and social care staff. The effects of changes to migration policy, particular a policy which favours high skills and wages, will be most keenly felt in those parts of the health and social care sector which depend on lower-paid workers, such as workers providing domiciliary or residential care, who have essential roles supporting some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Let us be clear, disruption in our social care sector would inevitably lead to delayed discharges and increased pressures on our hospitals.</p> <p>The Welsh government has been clear that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious and unavoidable harm to our health and care services. That harm would extend to all sectors, including at least 1,400 EU nationals known to working in our NHS.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dbd3f955c822cc1205ff1da220f4da85104bc7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dbd3f955c822cc1205ff1da220f4da85104bc7c/129_37_2736_1641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vaughan Gething.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vaughan Gething.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-22T17:36:56.962Z\">at 5.36pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c4742cce4b0197a614f80d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-22T16:23:51.708Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the Labour MP <strong>Virendra Sharma</strong> on the news that the Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski is asking the Polish government to intervene in the Brexit process (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/22/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-under-pressure-to-allow-ministers-free-vote-on-amendment-to-block-no-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5c4737d2e4b0197a614f805a#block-5c4737d2e4b0197a614f805a\"> 3.40pm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/22/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-under-pressure-to-allow-ministers-free-vote-on-amendment-to-block-no-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5c473983e4b058cfe6d94fe3#block-5c473983e4b058cfe6d94fe3\">3.43pm)</a>, in a statement released by the anti-Brexit group, <strong>Best for Britain.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It appears that Kawczynski has today appointed himself as roving Ambassador to Poland.

However, he did not rule out an extension beyond the summer, as he has done on previous occasions. \u201cCertainly I think this is only possible in the case the UK can indicate for how long and what for,\u201d he said, while adding that with no clear plan \u201cto break the deadlock seems to me very difficult to do\u201d.</p> <p>Commenting in detail on specific amendments in the House of Commons, Verhofstadt said MEPs needed to monitor closely developments at Westminster. But he ruled out any changes to the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are limits on what we can accept. For us the backstop is non-negotiable.</p> </blockquote> <p>The EU could consider changes to the non-binding political declaration that maps out the future, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are open for a deeper and more closer relationship than the relationship that is in the political declaration.</p> </blockquote> <p>Verhofstadt was speaking to MEPs on the European parliament\u2019s constitutional affairs committee, who are responsible for scrutinising the withdrawal agreement. The committee chair <strong>Danuta H\u00fcbner </strong>said that work would begin next week, despite uncertainty over whether Westminster will ratify the deal.</p> <p>If the UK remained a member state at the time of European elections in May, the UK had \u201cthe duty to organise European elections in line with the treaty and the electoral act,\u201d said H\u00fcbner. \u201cAny failure on this will mean a breach of the treaties and can be brought to the courts, of course.\u201d</p> <p>But other MEPs objected to suggestions that the UK could gain an extension, an indication of the pressure facing EU leaders who would ultimately agree any extension of talks.</p> <p>Veteran French MEP<strong> Alain Lamassoure</strong> said the EU needed to put its foot down on extension. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me tell you this.

He says the answer depends enormously on how you frame the question. If you ask people if they favour the public being offered a \u201cvote\u201d on the deal, they are likely to say yes, whereas if you ask them if they favour a \u201creferendum\u201d, they are likely to say no. Suggesting that remaining in the EU would be an option also seems to make the prospect more unpopular, Curtice says.</p> <p>Here is his conclusion:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems that some leave voters, at least, begin to warm to the idea of another ballot when it is implied that its purpose would be to enable voters (like themselves) to decide the fate of the Brexit deal that the government has negotiated. However, this support largely disappears when it is made clear it might result in a reversal of the decision to leave the EU. </p> <p>Any claims that the polls show a widespread clamour for a second referendum have to be treated with care. The proposal is one that, so far at least, appeals much more strongly to the half of the country that would like to see Brexit reversed than it does to those who support Brexit. True, there are signs that perhaps some Leave supporters could be persuaded to support another ballot - if it were to be portrayed as a chance for voters to decide the fate of the government\u2019s Brexit deal. But unless that were to happen, it would seem unlikely that holding any such ballot would succeed in healing the division and polarisation that has come to characterise the Brexit debate. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4711a3e4b0197a614f7e6d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-22T12:52:08.462Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May is holding a conference call this afternoon with business leaders including representatives of the CBI, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, the Press Association reports.

However, in every case MPs express greater overall concern than voters. It seems the public is more complacent about no deal than the policymakers whose choices will determine whether it happens.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this chart illustrates the gap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb9d7e83dc1a79035ac9d1041892268725a6ed20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb9d7e83dc1a79035ac9d1041892268725a6ed20/0_0_692_522/500.png\" alt=\"What MPs and voters think about no-deal Brexit\" width=\"500\" height=\"377\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What MPs and voters think about no-deal Brexit</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK in a Changing Europe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To compare what MPs generally fear, and what members of the public generally fear, you need to compare the positions of the yellow dots and the red dots.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Leave-supporting MPs are much less likely to worry about the negative impact of a no-deal Brexit than leave-supporting voters - or anyone else, the research finds.</strong> Remain-supporting voters are more likely to worry about a no-deal Brexit than leave-supporting voters. (Look at the gap between the black and the blue dots.) But the views of MPs are much more polarised, with remain-supporting MPs particularly worried and leave-supporting MPs particularly unworried. (Look at the gap between the green dots and the purple dots.) <strong>Ford </strong>and <strong>Wager</strong> say:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Concerns about most forms of no deal disruption are very widespread among remain MPs, while only a minority of leave MPs express any, while virtually none worry about the impact on medical supplies, flights or house prices. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Only around 4% of people think a no-deal Brexit would involve the UK remaining in the EU, the research finds.</strong><strong> Ford </strong>and <strong>Wager</strong> explain:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is worth starting with what the public very clearly knows to be true. Despite claims to the contary, there is no polling evidence to suggest that any significant section of the population think a no deal Brexit would mean that the UK would remain in the EU. Just 4% think that no deal means a reversion to the status quo ante. Only 8% think that \u2018nothing important would really change\u2019 if the UK left the EU without a deal.

You can read it <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP190122.pdf\">on the order paper (pdf),</a> on page 51.</p> <p>That would give MPs time in the House of Commons to debate ideas such as a customs union, Labour\u2019s own Brexit plan, a second referendum, no deal and the Norway model. Motions would be amendable and would have political force.</p> <p>Grieve has removed the most controversial aspect of his amendment from one of the leaked drafts, which would have allowed a motion put forward by a minority of 300 MPs from at least five parties \u2013 including 10 Tory MPs \u2013 to be debated as the first item for MPs in the Commons the next day.</p> <p>Instead, the motion now just allocates specific days for debate - and the dates have been chosen carefully so they will not clash with the days specified by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and the Tory Nick Boles who are making a separate attempt to pass a bill which would mandate an article 50 extension in the event of no deal.</p> <p>Grieve said his amendment was aimed at facilitating wider debate in the Commons on different options for Brexit, similar to a plan for \u201cindicative votes\u201d that has been floated by several cabinet ministers, such as like the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the education secretary, Damian Hinds.</p> <p>The six days specified by Grieve could in theory be used to pass primary legislation - but Grieve said that would be difficult in practice and he did not envisage that would happen. </p> <p>Any bill that required government spending like calling a new referendum would need a \u201cmoney resolution\u201d which needs government backing. Grieve told the Guardian he thought that was a constitutional change too far. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c46f265e4b058cfe6d94c4c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-22T10:52:04.053Z\">10.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Identification with remain/leave much stronger than identification with a political party, research finds</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you are interested in Brexit, there is a huge amount of quite interesting analysis in the <a href=\"http://ukandeu.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Public-Opinion-2019-report.pdf\">Brexit and Public Opinion 2019 report (pdf) </a>out today from the UK in a Changing Europe project. It contains 22 short essays by academics and other experts.</p> <p>One, by <strong>Geoff Evans </strong>and<strong> Florian Schaffner,</strong> says that whereas in the past people used to identify themselves politically according to the party they supported, now they are far more likely to identify themselves by where they stand on Brexit. Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The number of both remainers and leavers expressing a Brexit identity grew markedly following the referendum result. After then it has been almost neck-and-neck, with just under 50% identifying with each side but with a slight lead for remain. </p> <p>Tellingly, even in mid-2018, two years after the referendum, only just over 6% of people did not identify with either leave or remain. </p> <p>Compare this with party attachment. The percentage with no party identity increased from 18% to 21.5% over same period \u2013 in part due to the decline of UKIP. Only one in 16 people don\u2019t have a Brexit identity whereas more than one in five have no party identity ...</p> <p>The EU referendum seems to have resulted in a classic in-group versus out-group response, especially from remainers. The social and emotional intensity of these Brexit identities \u2013 held by almost everybody \u2013 is far higher than those for parties. The latter increased a little during the 2017 general election, especially for Labour, but then subsided. A Brexit identity remained prevalent and consequential even two years after the referendum itself. We are a long way removed from the idea that Britain \u2018has come together\u2019 to face the challenge of Brexit. Social polarisation is pronounced and shows no sign of diminishing.</p> </blockquote> <p>This has big consequences for party politics. In<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/10/brexit-latest-news-corbyn-speech-may-press-conference-reaches-out-to-labour-by-welcoming-workers-rights-amendment-politics-live?page=with:block-5c373c3de4b02fb91ff11ca7#block-5c373c3de4b02fb91ff11ca7\"> a recent speech in Wakefield</a> <strong>J</strong><strong>eremy Corbyn</strong> argued that \u201cthe real divide in our country is not between those who voted to remain in the EU and those who voted to leave\u201d but between the many and the few.

Theresa May is set to reject Tory calls for her to give her ministers and MPs a free vote on an amendment to the Brexit motion being debated next week intended to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal, government sources have indicated. (See 12.41pm.) This came as Labour\u2019s Jack Dromey and the Conservative Caroline Spelman tabled a new joint amendment saying the no-deal option should be rejected (see 2.45pm), and the Tory MP Andrew Murrison tabled an amendment demanding an end date to the backstop. (See 3.17pm.) Sir James Dyson, the British billionaire inventor and outspoken Brexiter, is moving the headquarters of his vacuum cleaner and hair dryer technology company to Singapore. The chief executive of the civil service has said the government will never be fully prepared for Brexit as he revealed plans to move up to 5,000 staff into an emergency command and control centre in the event of no deal. Proxy voting will be introduced to the House of Commons on a one-year pilot, Andrea Leadsom has announced. Unknown donors have funded nearly \u00a339,000 of trips by the Brexiter former cabinet minister Owen Paterson by routing the funds through his personal thinktank. The spending power of British workers increased to its highest level in two years in November following the biggest rise in real pay since September 2016. The UN\u2019s increasingly fraught attempt to salvage a ceasefire in the Yemeni port of Hodeidah that could lead to a wider peace across the war-torn country is to be shored up by an extra \u00a32.5m from the UK to support the civilian administration of the city. Sophie Walker has stepped down as leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard. The Welsh assembly schedule has been largely cleared to give ministers time to spell out preparations they are making for a no-deal Brexit. Ministers are outlining the risks of a no deal on health, the economy, transport and farming. The Labour first minister Mark Drakeford said: In a series of statements ministers will outline the risks we face \u2013 for public services, the economy and across society. The impacts are potentially far ranging and will be felt by everyone. These are not theoretical or hypothetical concerns but the reality of where we now find ourselves. Today\u2019s series of statements is part of our determination to ensure that assembly members are kept updated on this work. The truth is that no one really knows what will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It follows that neither Wales nor the UK as a whole can be truly prepared for all the possible eventualities. Vaughan Gething, minister for health and social services, was first up. He said: I continue to be concerned about the future supply of radioisotopes to Wales in the event of a no deal scenario. Radioisotopes are essential for diagnostic and therapeutic use by our NHS. There are no sources in the UK and supplies are routinely imported from other EU countries through the main cross-channel ports. Disruption from customs checks at our ports is likely to render radioisotopes useless for healthcare treatment. A no deal Brexit will have a profound impact on all professions and all health and social care staff. The effects of changes to migration policy, particular a policy which favours high skills and wages, will be most keenly felt in those parts of the health and social care sector which depend on lower-paid workers, such as workers providing domiciliary or residential care, who have essential roles supporting some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Let us be clear, disruption in our social care sector would inevitably lead to delayed discharges and increased pressures on our hospitals. The Welsh government has been clear that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious and unavoidable harm to our health and care services. That harm would extend to all sectors, including at least 1,400 EU nationals known to working in our NHS. Here is the Labour MP Virendra Sharma on the news that the Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski is asking the Polish government to intervene in the Brexit process (see 3.40pm and 3.43pm), in a statement released by the anti-Brexit group, Best for Britain. It appears that Kawczynski has today appointed himself as roving Ambassador to Poland. I am sure Warsaw has been waiting for his letter with bated breath. I don\u2019t envy Daniel\u2019s burden of self-awareness. Taking back control by asking a foreign government to veto a request made by the sovereign British Parliament is an interesting move. And here is Euronews\u2019 Darren McCaffrey on the same story. This is from Kevin Doyle, from the Independent in Ireland. Guy Verhofstadt has opened the door to Brexit negotiations extending into the next session of the next European parliament. The Liberal MEP, who is the European parliament\u2019s pointman on Brexit, said it would be more difficult to prolong article 50 beyond the 2 July, the first day of the new European parliament. However, he did not rule out an extension beyond the summer, as he has done on previous occasions. \u201cCertainly I think this is only possible in the case the UK can indicate for how long and what for,\u201d he said, while adding that with no clear plan \u201cto break the deadlock seems to me very difficult to do\u201d. Commenting in detail on specific amendments in the House of Commons, Verhofstadt said MEPs needed to monitor closely developments at Westminster. But he ruled out any changes to the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, saying: There are limits on what we can accept. For us the backstop is non-negotiable. The EU could consider changes to the non-binding political declaration that maps out the future, he said. We are open for a deeper and more closer relationship than the relationship that is in the political declaration. Verhofstadt was speaking to MEPs on the European parliament\u2019s constitutional affairs committee, who are responsible for scrutinising the withdrawal agreement. The committee chair Danuta H\u00fcbner said that work would begin next week, despite uncertainty over whether Westminster will ratify the deal. If the UK remained a member state at the time of European elections in May, the UK had \u201cthe duty to organise European elections in line with the treaty and the electoral act,\u201d said H\u00fcbner. \u201cAny failure on this will mean a breach of the treaties and can be brought to the courts, of course.\u201d But other MEPs objected to suggestions that the UK could gain an extension, an indication of the pressure facing EU leaders who would ultimately agree any extension of talks. Veteran French MEP Alain Lamassoure said the EU needed to put its foot down on extension. He said: Let me tell you this. If we accept this idea of extending the deadline without any serious political grounds for it and extend it beyond June 30, it will be the European Union that will pay the price, because we are never going to get out of that muddle. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has dismissed Theresa May\u2019s Brexit \u2018plan B\u2019 as just \u2018plan A\u2019 with \u201ca new helping of pious hopes\u201d, the Western Mail\u2019s David Williamson reports. According to Jakub Krupa, the Polish government will reject the Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski\u2019s call for it to veto any extension of article 50. (See 3.40pm.) The Brexiter Tory Daniel Kawczynski, who was born in Poland, says he has asked the Polish government to veto an extension of article 50. Poland could decide the matter because, for article 50 to be extended, the UK would have to make that request, and the EU27 would have to agree the move unanimously. Nick Gutteridge, the Sun\u2019s Brussels reports, thinks Kawczynski\u2019s idea is a non-starter. According to the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes, the Conservative MP Phillip Lee is going to table an amendment calling for a second referendum. Lee is planning this with his fellow Tory Brexit-sceptic, Sarah Wollaston. They are both doctors, and they have described this as an \u201cinformed consent\u201d amendment - based on the idea that Brexit is such an extreme measure that it should only go ahead with the \u201cinformed consent\u201d of the electorate (ie, that people should vote on the Brexit deal on the table, not just the principle, as they did in 2016). The Hawkes tweet refers to reports that the People\u2019s Vote campaign (PV) have been trying to get Lee to delay, on the grounds that they don\u2019t want MPs to vote on a second referendum until the Labour party is committed to supporting the idea. Here is the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on the Dromey/Spelman amendment. (See 2.45pm.) The Conservative MP Andrew Murrison has confirmed that he has retabled his amendment demanding an end date to the backstop. According to the Spectator (see 2.08pm), Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, told cabinet that this was exactly the sort of intervention the government needed. That is because, if MPs were to pass the Murrison amendment by a decent majority, Theresa May would be able to go back to Brussels citing this as proof that, with an expiry date added, her deal would be able to get through the Commons. But there is no guarantee that the Murrison amendment will be put to a vote. He tabled a similar amendment ahead of the big Brexit debate on Tuesday last week, but it was not called by the speaker, John Bercow. The Labour MP Jack Dromey and the Conservative MP Caroline Spelman have announced that they have tabled a joint amendment to the Brexit motion for Tuesday next week ruling out a no-deal Brexit. It is the shortest and simplest of all the amendments that have been tabled so far. The main government motion says: That this House, in accordance with the provisions of section 13(6)(a) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, has considered the written statement titled \u201cstatement under section 13(4) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018\u201d and made on 21 January 2019. And this is what the Dromey/Spelman amendment says: At end add \u201cand rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship\u201d. Already six amendments to the government motion are on the order paper (pdf). Now we are up to seven. We don\u2019t know yet how many will be called on Tuesday, but some of them will get ignored, and the amendments with most chance of success will be those with wide support across the Commons. The advantage this one has is that it would be easy for Conservative MPs to support. It does not involve any of the procedural innovation that features in amendments like Dominic Grieve\u2019s. (See 10.58am.) And Spelman, who does not have form as an anti-Brexit Tory rebel, is probably a less divisive figure amongst her party colleagues than Grieve. But the disadvantage with the amendment is that it is relatively innocuous. It would not be binding and, if passed, it would not necessarily stop the government taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. Dromey and Spelman both represents West Midlands constituencies where thousands of their constituents either work at the local Jaguar Land Rover factories or for their suppliers. In a joint statement, Dromey and Spelman said: We must rule out the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. As 29th March fast approaches, it becomes increasingly clear that crashing out of the EU without a deal will cause chaos and put the jobs of thousands of our constituents at risk. We are confident that there is widespread agreement across all parties in the House that a no-deal Brexit should be avoided. This amendment seeks to send that clear message: no to no deal. Whilst we remain committed to honouring the result of the referendum, for the sake of the people we represent, we cannot sanction crashing out of the EU without a deal. The Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth has written a good blog about what happened at today\u2019s cabinet. The Brexit discussion was calmer than some people expected, he says. Here\u2019s an extract. Perhaps, the two most interesting contributions came from Jeremy Hunt and David Gauke. Gauke questioned the government\u2019s new approach. He said he was worried that even if the government did get something on the backstop, there still wouldn\u2019t be enough Tory MPs backing the deal for it to pass. While Hunt argued that the best thing for the government to do was to get parliamentary support for a plan on time-limiting the backstop. Having done that, the Foreign Secretary argued, the UK should go back to the EU and say, this is what can pass parliament. On the basis of this account, Jeremy Hunt seems to be hoping for a new version of the Andrew Murrison amendment to be tabled for the debate next Tuesday. There is nothing like that on the order paper yet, but MPs have until Monday night to table amendments. Here is the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq tweeting about the proxy voting announcement that she helped to trigger. In the Commons Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, is responding to an urgent question on proxy voting in the chamber for MPs on maternity leave. In recent days, prompted by the Tulip Siddiq case, John Bercow, the speaker, has repeatedly complained about the government\u2019s failure to go ahead and introduce proxy voting, despite MPs backing the idea in principle around a year ago. Leadsom says she profoundly believes that new parents should be able to spend time with their new babies. She says she can now announce that MPs will vote to introduce a proxy voting scheme on Monday next week (28 January). The motion (which is almost certain to be passed, perhaps even without opposition), will implement a one-year proxy voting pilot, based on proposals in a procedure committee report. The Brexit and Public Opinion 2019 report (pdf) from the UK in a Changing Europe project mentioned earlier (see 10.52am and 12.14am) also includes an essay from the leading psephologist Sir John Curtice looking at whether voters really want a second referendum. He says the answer depends enormously on how you frame the question. If you ask people if they favour the public being offered a \u201cvote\u201d on the deal, they are likely to say yes, whereas if you ask them if they favour a \u201creferendum\u201d, they are likely to say no. Suggesting that remaining in the EU would be an option also seems to make the prospect more unpopular, Curtice says. Here is his conclusion: It seems that some leave voters, at least, begin to warm to the idea of another ballot when it is implied that its purpose would be to enable voters (like themselves) to decide the fate of the Brexit deal that the government has negotiated. However, this support largely disappears when it is made clear it might result in a reversal of the decision to leave the EU. Any claims that the polls show a widespread clamour for a second referendum have to be treated with care. The proposal is one that, so far at least, appeals much more strongly to the half of the country that would like to see Brexit reversed than it does to those who support Brexit. True, there are signs that perhaps some Leave supporters could be persuaded to support another ballot - if it were to be portrayed as a chance for voters to decide the fate of the government\u2019s Brexit deal. But unless that were to happen, it would seem unlikely that holding any such ballot would succeed in healing the division and polarisation that has come to characterise the Brexit debate. Theresa May is holding a conference call this afternoon with business leaders including representatives of the CBI, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, the Press Association reports. May\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the lobby briefing that the call was an opportunity for the prime minister to provide an update on the state of Brexit talks and for business leaders to raise any concerns they might have. Later in the week, May is due to meet trade union leaders, including Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, in Downing Street to discuss Brexit. The spokesman did not confirm the date of the meeting. But it is expected to take place on Thursday (not today, as I wrongly said earlier). Government sources are saying they would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if Theresa May allows a free vote on the amendment intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit. (See 9.26am.) This is how Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European, explained what his amendment to next week\u2019s Brexit motion (see 10.58am) would achieve on Sky News. What my amendment does is to identify a number of Tuesdays between now and the date of Brexit in which the business will be controlled by the House itself and not by the government. There will be a motion in neutral terms to start the day which is about looking at Brexit and what is going on, then members of parliament can table amendments for consideration which can be turned into resolutions of the House. A resolution of the House is a pretty solemn thing. If the House says that it thinks something ought to be done which the government isn\u2019t doing, the government can decide to ignore it but historically it would be very unusual in our constitution for that to happen. At his briefing in Brussels, as well as quoting the Spice Girls to make the point that the EU does not know what the UK wants on Brexit (see 11.53am), Margaritis Schinas, the European commission spokesman, also said that a no-deal Brexit would lead to the return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. He said: If you like to push me and speculate on what might happen in a no-deal scenario in Ireland, I think it\u2019s pretty obvious, you will have a hard border. Our commitment to the Good Friday agreement and everything that we have been doing for years with our tools, instruments and programmes will have to take inevitably into account this fact. So, of course, we are for peace, of course we stand behind the Good Friday agreement, but that\u2019s what a no-deal scenario would entail. According to the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge, that is the first time the commission has been this explicit. At the People\u2019s Vote press conference this morning the Labour MPs David Lammy and Bridget Phillipson welcomed the Labour amendment saying MPs should have a vote on whether to hold a second referendum. They argued that it was a move towards such a vote happening. Lammy said: It is clear that to achieve a public vote, all opposition parties would have to be aligned and the Labour party, as the official opposition, needs to be in a place where it is advocating for a people\u2019s vote. It is absolutely legitimate to work through the options - and the amendment sets out those options - before you arrive at the place on a people\u2019s vote. Ultimately, I think that we have to end up in a place where we put this to a public vote. That is the nature of the amendment Labour has put down. And Phillipson said: I know that Jeremy [Corbyn] wants to make sure the decisions that we take as a party are the decisions that are in the best interests of everyone we serve. But I don\u2019t think the interests of working people will be served by a Brexit which will see jobs leave my community, which will see wages fall and see a real impact on living standards. I think when it comes down to it, Jeremy won\u2019t want to see that happen either. I think Jeremy understands that a majority of Labour voters and a vast majority of Labour members want us to campaign for a referendum. I think he is a democrat and he will ultimately respond to that. The Brexit and Public Opinion 2019 report (pdf) from the UK in a Changing Europe project mentioned earlier (see 10.52am) also has a fascinating essay by Rob Ford and Alan Wager about what people and MPs think about a no deal Brexit. Here are the key points. MPs generally are much more worried about a no-deal Brexit having a negative impact than voters generally, the research finds. This is what Ford and Wager say: MPs and voters share roughly the same hierarchy of concerns about Brexit \u2013 worrying most about lorry queues and a fall in sterling, and least about flight cancellations and house price declines. However, in every case MPs express greater overall concern than voters. It seems the public is more complacent about no deal than the policymakers whose choices will determine whether it happens. And this chart illustrates the gap. To compare what MPs generally fear, and what members of the public generally fear, you need to compare the positions of the yellow dots and the red dots. Leave-supporting MPs are much less likely to worry about the negative impact of a no-deal Brexit than leave-supporting voters - or anyone else, the research finds. Remain-supporting voters are more likely to worry about a no-deal Brexit than leave-supporting voters. (Look at the gap between the black and the blue dots.) But the views of MPs are much more polarised, with remain-supporting MPs particularly worried and leave-supporting MPs particularly unworried. (Look at the gap between the green dots and the purple dots.) Ford and Wager say: Concerns about most forms of no deal disruption are very widespread among remain MPs, while only a minority of leave MPs express any, while virtually none worry about the impact on medical supplies, flights or house prices. Only around 4% of people think a no-deal Brexit would involve the UK remaining in the EU, the research finds. Ford and Wager explain: It is worth starting with what the public very clearly knows to be true. Despite claims to the contary, there is no polling evidence to suggest that any significant section of the population think a no deal Brexit would mean that the UK would remain in the EU. Just 4% think that no deal means a reversion to the status quo ante. Only 8% think that \u2018nothing important would really change\u2019 if the UK left the EU without a deal. While leave voters are three times more likely to think this \u2013 12% versus 4% \u2013 the idea that no deal would not be an event with consequences, for good or bad, is not widely held. In Brussels the European commission spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, has got so frustrated waiting for the UK to come up with a Brexit position that he has taken to quoting the Spice Girls, the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming reports. Brexit will cost the civil service \u00a374m a year in turnover of staff and endangers the progress of at least 26 projects designed to improve live in the UK, including the HS2 rail line, a new report claims. A research paper by the Institute for Government reports that numbers in the civil service have now risen to levels not seen since the second world war, yet a hung parliament coupled with Brexit \u201chave constrained the government\u2019s ability to pass legislation\u201d. Only five of the 13 bills which the government has said it needs to pass ahead of Brexit have made it through parliament, it finds. Earlier I included a Newsnight tweet quoting Nadine Dorries, the Tory backbencher, saying she and fellow Brexiters were coming around to the idea of voting for Theresa May\u2019s deal because they feared pro-Europeans might block Brexit. (See 9.26am.) She said: I can feel a growing consensus among a number of MPs \u2014 faced with these Europhile kamakaze MPs, who really don\u2019t care about their careers going up in flames, who want to overturn parliamentary tradition in order to stop Brexit \u2014 I think many people are now realising that we would support this deal to get it over the line. Because every day here is a dangerous day at the moment. We may have to see that this is a deal, we will have to swallow our pride, swallow what we would prefer, and vote for it. Dorries is now saying that she was quoted out of context and that she was only talking about backing May\u2019s deal if the Irish backstop were removed. UPDATE: This is from the Newsnight editor Esme Wren. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European who has tabled an amendment to next week\u2019s motion intended to ensure that MPs get a greater say over Brexit (see 10.58am) told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics that he thought article 50 would have to be extended. He said: Article 50 is going to have to be extended. Even if the prime minister got her deal through parliament next week, it is inconceivable that we could do the necessary enabling legislation for us to leave on 29 March. He also reaffirmed his desire to halt Brexit, saying: Despite two and a half years of trying to see a silver lining to this particular cloud, I think Brexit remains the biggest historic mistake the United Kingdom has made in it modern peacetime history. I think it is going to have very bad consequences for us. But MPs could not just ignore the referendum result, he went on. That was why he favoured a second referendum, he said. However, he also admitted that a second referendum was \u201cunlikely\u201d to happen unless there was a government in power that was in favour of holding one. Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and one of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest allies, will visit Number 10 for talks with Theresa May about Brexit, Channel 4 News\u2019s Gary Gibbon reports. CORRECTION: The original post said this was happening today, but the meeting is due to happen on Thursday. Jo Swinson, the deputy Lib Dem leader, told the People\u2019s Vote press conference this morning that Jeremy Corbyn had shown \u201ca dreadful lack of leadership\u201d over Brexit, because Labour was \u201criding both horses\u201d on a second referendum. (See 9.26am.) She said: Labour is at a point now where it has to choose. The Labour leadership has been riding both horses for far too long. Labour can decide. Their votes will be pivotal. They can either make Brexit happen or Labour can stop Brexit. The time for decision is upon us. Germany\u2019s justice minister, Katarina Barley, who is both a German and British citizen, and is also the Social Democrats\u2019 main candidate for the EU elections, told German radio (Deutschlandfunk) this morning, she is in favour of a second referendum, accusing Theresa May of presenting a Plan B that is hardly worth the paper it\u2019s written on and arguing her main aim at this stage is \u201cto play for time, but that in so doing she\u2019s also playing with fire.\u201d May\u2019s whole Brexit strategy \u201cwill go up in a puff of smoke if she continues in this vein, and right now that very much looks like the way things are going,\u201d she said. The former attorney general Dominic Grieve has put forward his motion to allow backbenchers to table different Brexit motions for debate six full days before the UK leaves the EU \u2013 12 and 26 February and 5, 12, 19 and 26 March. You can read it on the order paper (pdf), on page 51. That would give MPs time in the House of Commons to debate ideas such as a customs union, Labour\u2019s own Brexit plan, a second referendum, no deal and the Norway model. Motions would be amendable and would have political force. Grieve has removed the most controversial aspect of his amendment from one of the leaked drafts, which would have allowed a motion put forward by a minority of 300 MPs from at least five parties \u2013 including 10 Tory MPs \u2013 to be debated as the first item for MPs in the Commons the next day. Instead, the motion now just allocates specific days for debate - and the dates have been chosen carefully so they will not clash with the days specified by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and the Tory Nick Boles who are making a separate attempt to pass a bill which would mandate an article 50 extension in the event of no deal. Grieve said his amendment was aimed at facilitating wider debate in the Commons on different options for Brexit, similar to a plan for \u201cindicative votes\u201d that has been floated by several cabinet ministers, such as like the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the education secretary, Damian Hinds. The six days specified by Grieve could in theory be used to pass primary legislation - but Grieve said that would be difficult in practice and he did not envisage that would happen. Any bill that required government spending like calling a new referendum would need a \u201cmoney resolution\u201d which needs government backing. Grieve told the Guardian he thought that was a constitutional change too far. If you are interested in Brexit, there is a huge amount of quite interesting analysis in the Brexit and Public Opinion 2019 report (pdf) out today from the UK in a Changing Europe project. It contains 22 short essays by academics and other experts. One, by Geoff Evans and Florian Schaffner, says that whereas in the past people used to identify themselves politically according to the party they supported, now they are far more likely to identify themselves by where they stand on Brexit. Here is an extract. The number of both remainers and leavers expressing a Brexit identity grew markedly following the referendum result. After then it has been almost neck-and-neck, with just under 50% identifying with each side but with a slight lead for remain. Tellingly, even in mid-2018, two years after the referendum, only just over 6% of people did not identify with either leave or remain. Compare this with party attachment. The percentage with no party identity increased from 18% to 21.5% over same period \u2013 in part due to the decline of UKIP. Only one in 16 people don\u2019t have a Brexit identity whereas more than one in five have no party identity ... The EU referendum seems to have resulted in a classic in-group versus out-group response, especially from remainers. The social and emotional intensity of these Brexit identities \u2013 held by almost everybody \u2013 is far higher than those for parties. The latter increased a little during the 2017 general election, especially for Labour, but then subsided. A Brexit identity remained prevalent and consequential even two years after the referendum itself. We are a long way removed from the idea that Britain \u2018has come together\u2019 to face the challenge of Brexit. Social polarisation is pronounced and shows no sign of diminishing. This has big consequences for party politics. In a recent speech in Wakefield Jeremy Corbyn argued that \u201cthe real divide in our country is not between those who voted to remain in the EU and those who voted to leave\u201d but between the many and the few. He may well be right, but this research suggests that that is not the way people feel at the moment. Record numbers of people are in work and job vacancies are at their joint highest level since 2001, the Press Association says. In its report on today\u2019s unemployment figures, it goes on: Average earnings increased by 3.4% in the year to November, the highest for a decade, outpacing inflation. Employment increased by 141,000 in the three months to November to 32.5m, the highest since records began in 1971. Unemployment also increased, up by 8,000 to 1.37m, although the total is 68,000 lower than a year ago, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The UK\u2019s jobless rate is now 4%, down by 0.2% on a year ago, and the lowest since 1975. The ONS said average weekly earnings, adjusted for price inflation, increased by 1.2%, including bonuses, compared with a year earlier. The increase in both unemployment and employment is explained by the UK\u2019s rising population, and fewer people classed as economically inactive, which includes those on long-term sick leave, students, and people who have given up looking for a job. The number of economically inactive people fell by 100,000 in the latest quarter to 8.6 million, a rate of 21%, the lowest on record. Karin Kneissl, the Austrian foreign minister, told the Today programme this morning that the Polish plan for the backstop to be limited to five years did not have general EU support. She explained: We were all taken by surprise when the Polish minister made his statement. We have had cohesion and we wish to continue having cohesion on the EU27 position, so the statement by our Polish colleague came as a surprise, but I don\u2019t believe that it will cause some sort of breakthrough, certainly not because if we start having all kinds of bilateral suggestions it doesn\u2019t lead us anywhere. She also said that she did not think there was time to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement before Brexit. She said: The withdrawal agreement was negotiated along the red lines the British government have put. We respected always these red lines and I don\u2019t believe that things that couldn\u2019t be achieved over the past three years can be achieved now within the context of a few weeks. The BBC\u2019s Norman Smith has got what could be some very bad news for parliamentary journalists. Good morning. MPs will vote a week today on Brexit, and potentially on a whole range of alternative options. You can read the amendments that have already been tabled on the order paper (pdf), starting on page 48. Here is a summary of the overnight and early morning Brexit developments. Theresa May is under pressure to allow ministers a free vote on an amendment intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit, after the Times (paywall) claims that up to 40 members of the government would resign if ordered to vote against it. Sam Coates in the Times reports: Up to 40 members of the government will resign next week if Conservative MPs are banned from voting for a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit, No 10 has been told. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has demanded that all Tory MPs are allowed a free vote on plans that would clear the path for extending Article 50 \u2014 the mechanism by which Britain leaves the European Union. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has said the Labour amendment, saying the Commons should have a vote on whether to hold a second referendum, does not mean that Labour has committed to backing a second referendum yet. She told the Today programme: The amendment is very specifically-worded to allow for the debate of the options. It is not stating that the party supports a second referendum in any way and indeed if it was passed, the amendment, and it went to a vote on the specific issues, then that would be a decision for the party to take at the time. We are prioritising seeking a deal which provides many of the assurances we have sought from the PM. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has said it is not inevitable that the EU would grant an extension of article 50 if the UK requested one. He told the Today programme: It is not in the unilateral gift of the UK to extend. There are practical issues. I think that [support for an extension] is an over-simplification because there are many in the European parliament and elsewhere that are concerned about an extension in terms of the impact. There are many in Brussels that are concerned about the prospect of an extension in terms of the interplay with the European parliamentary elections, because you couldn\u2019t pass the legislation in the UK for a referendum ... in the time before the end of May. But also from the EU point of view, they have been very clear that they don\u2019t want an extension with no purpose and so we come back to the issue as to what it is MPs are for and just what they are against. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter and former party leader, has said that an amendment intended to allow backbenchers to take control of the parliamentary agenda and pass legislation ruling out a no-deal Brexit, would create \u201cmayhem\u201d. He told Today: I have a very simple formula for this, which is if you really support this constitutional nonsense of allowing a backbench group to take over the business and run legislation at the government, if the Labour party agrees to support that they have to think carefully what would happen if they were in power and they did not have a massive majority. This opens the door to mayhem in the Commons and I promise you those who think that the House of Commons could act as a government negotiating a trade deal are living in cloud cuckoo land. He also said allow ministers a free vote on this amendment would be unacceptable. The government has to have a position on something as fundamental as what their plan is for the future. The prime minister was very clear yesterday and there is collective responsibility in cabinet and among ministers - they have agreed there will be no extension of article 50, there will be no revocation of Article 50 and no customs union. Nadine Dorries, the Tory Brexiter and until recently a strong critic of May\u2019s deal, has said that Brexiters are increasingly inclined to vote for it now because they fear \u201cEurophile kamikaze MPs\u201d could halt Brexit. She said this in an interview last night for Newsnight. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Sir John Curtice, the psephologist, is among the speakers at a UK in a Changing Europe conference on Brexit and public opinion. It coincides with the publication of a new report on the subject. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Unemployment figures are published. 9.45am: The MPs David Lammy, Caroline Lucas, Jo Swinson and Bridget Phillipson speak at a People\u2019s Vote press conference. They are publishing a report (pdf) arguing there are flaws with alternative Brexit options to a second referendum. My colleague Dan Sabbagh has a preview here. 10.30am: The prominent Tory pro-European Anna Soubry takes part in a Mumsnet webchat. 11.30am: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 11.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives evidence to a Lords committee on the rural economy. 12pm: Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, speaks at the publication of the Institute for Government\u2019s annual Whitehall Monitor report. 2.30pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, gives evidence to a Lords committee about citizens\u2019 rights after Brexit. 3.30pm: Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, gives evidence to the Commons defence committee. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up, at around 4.30pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>Like many major metropolitan areas, Seattle is currently mired in what writer and housing activist Laura Bernstein has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lauraloeseattle/status/1085942039286407168?s=21&amp;fbclid=IwAR0H5AoyPL-7mKoMcB0h7eR7tVkMcZVU5NLMZFu_PpTUJF9sy-hLN6bJUto\">described as</a> \u201ca dual crisis of climate and affordability\u201d. A lack of affordable housing near industry has led to carbon-intensive sprawl \u2013 think of all those commuting cars \u2013 and economic distress among Seattleites. So, last Wednesday, when Microsoft announced a plan to dedicate $500m towards alleviating the affordable housing crisis in the area, one might have been forgiven for thinking it was an entirely good thing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/21/think-the-giants-of-silicon-valley-have-your-best-interestsat-heart-think-again\">Think the giants of Silicon Valley have your best interests at heart? Think again | John Naughton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, the impact that $500m will make should not be understated. In the Puget Sound area, $250m of the funds will go towards the <a href=\"https://t.co/rXSswQjeX9\">construction of housing</a> that people making 60% of the area median income ($48,150 for a two-person household) can afford. Another $225m will help area developers complete projects that have stalled for lack of funding, and also acquire land for future projects. Microsoft will also be granting $25m to local homeless aid organizations and anti-eviction lawyers. The money also comes coupled with a suggestion that local governments relax regressive zoning restrictions that make <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/housing/\">building affordable apartments illegal</a> in 75% of Seattle\u2019s city limits. In sum, this package will make a real material difference for Seattle\u2019s houseless, housing insecure and rent-burdened populations.</p> <p>But when you look the Microsoft gift horse in the mouth, certain cavities are visible. For instance, $475m of the funds are not, as is widely assumed, donations. They\u2019re actually market-rate loans that affordable housing providers and government agencies will need to pay back. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByRosenberg/status/1085999508280860672\">Seattle Times</a> reporter Mike Rosenberg notes that Microsoft will be turning a profit on this endeavor, while Seattle politics blog SCC Insight has cynically observed that the company is simply looking for places to sink some of its $135bn in liquid assets. In a declining stock market ransacked by Trump-induced economic insecurity, where better than an anemic public housing market to buy low and make a buck?</p> <p>The bigger problem at hand is that this bucket of funds had to come from a billion-dollar company, and not local government, in the first place. Washington state has no income tax; if it had even a minuscule one, it could have raised many times more than $500m over a longer period of time. As it stands, for the state with the most <a href=\"https://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/Report-Washington-regressive-tax-income-excise-13318033.php\">regressive tax code in the nation</a>, even a $500m windfall is too little; for the 191 King county residents who died homeless in 2018, it is tragically too late.<br><br>In May 2018, the Seattle city council introduced a modest tax on major corporations in the area; it repealed it a month later when the Seattle chamber of commerce spent nearly half a million dollars to excite <a href=\"https://www.cityartsmagazine.com/the-class-warfare-of-seattles-business-community/\">rightwing opposition</a>. Along with Amazon and Starbucks, Vulcan (Microsoft\u2019s satellite real estate enterprise) was one of the corporations that contributed to the anti-tax campaign. Seen in the light of this nasty political fight, the company\u2019s $500m gift seems a lot less like a donation, and more like a neoliberal rebrand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4162\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_opinion\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a political era defined by declining public investment, think back on all the basic services that America\u2019s tech overlords have attempted to recreate. The list is staggering. Silicon Valley transportation shuttles have caricatured <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2012/12/are-silicon-valleys-employee-shuttles-bad-san-francisco/4266/\">public transportation</a>. With its Prime Book Box subscription, Amazon has parodied <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90228561/amazons-prime-book-box-for-kids-can-now-do-what-libraries-have-always-done\">public libraries</a>. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has dropped $10m a mile on a kooky <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/12/elon-musk-tunnel-ride-tesla-boring-company-los-angeles/578536/\">transit tunnel</a>. And now, with its $500m contribution, Microsoft seeks to replace public housing. But the problem is that when we rely on capricious capitalists to do right by the public sector, they will always be a day late and a dollar short. The public sector can do better.</p> <p>During capitalism\u2019s so-called \u201cgolden age\u201d, between the end of the second world war and the early 1970s, high corporate tax rates subsidized the social safety net and public housing. Today, major corporations like Microsoft stash profits in offshore tax shelters, well out of reach of governments in need of revenue to fund basic services. Here in rainy Seattle, many residents living under the cloud of Jeff Bezos-era techno-libertarianism believe that the best we can do is wait for wealth to trickle down.</p> <p>But to meet its affordable housing crisis, Seattle could raise $500m of its own money by issuing municipal bonds. With visionary leadership, the city could embark on radical <a href=\"https://www.curbed.com/platform/amp/2018/12/11/18136188/city-density-climate-change-zoning?fbclid=IwAR14G8qbbjlHETR6qJljTrkQUqWamoWOq8CUNn95gTCDbjiujVmxormWnjU\">neighborhood densification</a> via comprehensive zoning reform.

      "bodyText": "Like many major metropolitan areas, Seattle is currently mired in what writer and housing activist Laura Bernstein has described as \u201ca dual crisis of climate and affordability\u201d. A lack of affordable housing near industry has led to carbon-intensive sprawl \u2013 think of all those commuting cars \u2013 and economic distress among Seattleites. So, last Wednesday, when Microsoft announced a plan to dedicate $500m towards alleviating the affordable housing crisis in the area, one might have been forgiven for thinking it was an entirely good thing. Indeed, the impact that $500m will make should not be understated. In the Puget Sound area, $250m of the funds will go towards the construction of housing that people making 60% of the area median income ($48,150 for a two-person household) can afford. Another $225m will help area developers complete projects that have stalled for lack of funding, and also acquire land for future projects. Microsoft will also be granting $25m to local homeless aid organizations and anti-eviction lawyers. The money also comes coupled with a suggestion that local governments relax regressive zoning restrictions that make building affordable apartments illegal in 75% of Seattle\u2019s city limits. In sum, this package will make a real material difference for Seattle\u2019s houseless, housing insecure and rent-burdened populations. But when you look the Microsoft gift horse in the mouth, certain cavities are visible. For instance, $475m of the funds are not, as is widely assumed, donations. They\u2019re actually market-rate loans that affordable housing providers and government agencies will need to pay back. The Seattle Times reporter Mike Rosenberg notes that Microsoft will be turning a profit on this endeavor, while Seattle politics blog SCC Insight has cynically observed that the company is simply looking for places to sink some of its $135bn in liquid assets. In a declining stock market ransacked by Trump-induced economic insecurity, where better than an anemic public housing market to buy low and make a buck? The bigger problem at hand is that this bucket of funds had to come from a billion-dollar company, and not local government, in the first place. Washington state has no income tax; if it had even a minuscule one, it could have raised many times more than $500m over a longer period of time. As it stands, for the state with the most regressive tax code in the nation, even a $500m windfall is too little; for the 191 King county residents who died homeless in 2018, it is tragically too late. In May 2018, the Seattle city council introduced a modest tax on major corporations in the area; it repealed it a month later when the Seattle chamber of commerce spent nearly half a million dollars to excite rightwing opposition. Along with Amazon and Starbucks, Vulcan (Microsoft\u2019s satellite real estate enterprise) was one of the corporations that contributed to the anti-tax campaign. Seen in the light of this nasty political fight, the company\u2019s $500m gift seems a lot less like a donation, and more like a neoliberal rebrand. In a political era defined by declining public investment, think back on all the basic services that America\u2019s tech overlords have attempted to recreate. The list is staggering. Silicon Valley transportation shuttles have caricatured public transportation. With its Prime Book Box subscription, Amazon has parodied public libraries. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has dropped $10m a mile on a kooky transit tunnel. And now, with its $500m contribution, Microsoft seeks to replace public housing. But the problem is that when we rely on capricious capitalists to do right by the public sector, they will always be a day late and a dollar short. The public sector can do better. During capitalism\u2019s so-called \u201cgolden age\u201d, between the end of the second world war and the early 1970s, high corporate tax rates subsidized the social safety net and public housing. Today, major corporations like Microsoft stash profits in offshore tax shelters, well out of reach of governments in need of revenue to fund basic services. Here in rainy Seattle, many residents living under the cloud of Jeff Bezos-era techno-libertarianism believe that the best we can do is wait for wealth to trickle down. But to meet its affordable housing crisis, Seattle could raise $500m of its own money by issuing municipal bonds. With visionary leadership, the city could embark on radical neighborhood densification via comprehensive zoning reform. If adopted by all major American cities, such a measure would achieve half the carbon reductions needed to hold global temperatures to a rise of 2C (3.6F). And with even modestly progressive redistributive taxes, we wouldn\u2019t have to depend on the kindness of oligarchs to house our citizens. We should thank Microsoft for the aid and wish it the best of luck turning a profit on its foray into philanthropy. But a cash-strapped public in desperate need of relief shouldn\u2019t allow software companies to have the final word. Shaun Scott is a Seattle writer and activist.

He then went to try to win her back; Trump shut down the government.\u201d</p> <p>Coulter criticized Trump\u2019s latest proposal as \u201camnesty\u201d, a claim Trump rejected on Twitter. This raises a bigger question, Meyers said. \u201cMan, why is he so subservient to her? Does she have a different pee tape?\u201d</p> <p>As for Congress, Meyers said that lawmakers should remember who they\u2019re negotiating with: \u201cPresident Werewolf, except he\u2019s a werewolf 29 days a month, and then there\u2019s a full moon and he turns into a human and you can talk to him.

You were having a good time.\u201d \u201cThe Maga hats is also a thing that you have to acknowledge,\u201d Noah added, an outfit choice that he said the boys had to know \u201cis a very explicit political symbol. You know how it makes people feel.\u201d Overall, though, to get into the full understanding of what happened and the background that produced it, \u201cI think it\u2019s too convoluted and complicated to get into in one sitting in a few hundred characters on Twitter,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut I think everyone played the victim card a little too hard.\u201d Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert avoided talk of the Lincoln Memorial confrontation and wished the country a happy Martin Luther King Day, \u201cin which we honor Dr King\u2019s dream: 50% off at Nordstrom\u2019s\u201d. Monday also marked the 31st day of the government shutdown, a fact the president attempted to address Saturday with an offer to restore Daca and \u201cTemporary Protected Status\u201d (TPS) protections for immigrants brought to the US as children \u2013 protections he previously took away \u2013 for three years in exchange for border wall funding. Somehow, Colbert said, Democrats didn\u2019t go for this deal. In other words: \u201cSo you want to rub the steak sauce on my head and I put my own head in the alligator\u2019s mouth? No thank you.\u201d The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, rejected the deal before Trump announced it on Saturday. \u201cShe said no before Trump even asked, a move known in Washington as \u2018The Melania\u2019,\u201d Colbert joked. To help drum up public support for his offer, Trump dispatched vice-president and \u201cman wishing the dogs in the dog park would put on some damn pants\u201d Mike Pence, who favorably compared Trump\u2019s actions to Martin Luther King\u2019s on Face the Nation. \u201cMike, are you sure you want us to judge Trump on the content of his character?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cHe puts a lot of effort into the color of his skin.\u201d Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers took a closer look at Trump\u2019s proposed offer from Saturday, a deal universally rejected by Democrats, but also by the conservative pundit Ann Coulter. \u201cNow, we are living in a very surreal time where people like Ann Coulter have tremendous sway over the president,\u201d Meyers explained. \u201cIn December, Trump was going to give up on the wall before Coulter called him a gutless and a vulgar publicity hound. He then went to try to win her back; Trump shut down the government.\u201d Coulter criticized Trump\u2019s latest proposal as \u201camnesty\u201d, a claim Trump rejected on Twitter. This raises a bigger question, Meyers said. \u201cMan, why is he so subservient to her? Does she have a different pee tape?\u201d As for Congress, Meyers said that lawmakers should remember who they\u2019re negotiating with: \u201cPresident Werewolf, except he\u2019s a werewolf 29 days a month, and then there\u2019s a full moon and he turns into a human and you can talk to him. And then all you dummies celebrate because you think it\u2019s permanent. Then the full moon goes away, and he goes back to chasing you through the woods.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It is tempting to indulge in some typical British lip-curling over the grand-sounding Treaty of Franco-German Cooperation and Integration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/22/france-and-germany-renew-postwar-vows-of-friendship\" title=\"\">signed on Tuesday</a> by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron in Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle in French), capital of Charlemagne\u2019s lost but not forgotten ninth-century European empire.</p> <p>The pact, reaffirming the 1963 \u00c9lys\u00e9e treaty that set the two countries on the path to post-war reconciliation, is intended to reassert the centrality of the Franco-German partnership in a splintering Europe beset by resurgent nationalism, rightwing populism and Brexit. Cynics will say it is also an attempt to reassert the fading relevance of Merkel and Macron.</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s not necessary to be an English Eurosceptic to have serious doubts about this project. Macron was accused of \u201chigh treason\u201d this week <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/german-france-relationship-aachen-emmanuel-macron-angela-merkel/\" title=\"\">by the French right</a> for supposedly secretly planning to surrender Alsace and Lorraine. Marine Le Pen, the leader of National Rally (formerly the National Front), claimed French schoolchildren would be forced to speak German.</p> <p>Merkel was also attacked at home for falling into the trap of appearing to endorse, at least in theory, some of Macron\u2019s more high-flown ideas about a joint eurozone budget, banking union, common taxes and European army. Alexander Gauland, leader of the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party, said Macron was <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/german-france-relationship-aachen-emmanuel-macron-angela-merkel/\" title=\"\">trying to grab \u201cGerman money\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Such claims are nonsense. So, too, is the idea put about by Eurosceptic media in Britain that Paris and Berlin are conspiring to seize full control of the EU and impose a new, shared hegemony at the expense of smaller states. The real problem with the new treaty is that it is mostly a bland, unambitious fudge.</p> <p>The soaring ideals and aspirations enunciated by the newly elected Macron in <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/5-takeaways-from-macrons-big-speech-on-europes-future/\" title=\"\">his Sorbonne speech in 2017</a>, about a Europe of democracy, sovereignty, unity and security, find but a faint, distorted echo today. The treaty has little concrete to say about key, contentious issues facing Europe such as migration, social fracture and alienation, and environmental challenges.</p> <p>It focuses, for example, on closer governmental coordination, intelligence sharing and cross-border cooperation \u2013 all of which have been mooted before. But it skates around differences over arms exports \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/24/britain-house-of-saud-jamal-khashoggi-murder\" title=\"\">Germany banned weapons sales to Saudi Arabia</a> after Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder; France did not.</p> <p>The pact is also silent on the vexed issue of \u201csharing\u201d France\u2019s permanent UN security council seat, as suggested by some in Berlin. Meanwhile, Macron\u2019s proposals about economic stimulus, social investment, a financial transaction tax and bank insurance have been lost in the mists of Germany\u2019s innate fiscal caution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/22/france-and-germany-renew-postwar-vows-of-friendship\">France and Germany provoke populist anger with 'friendship pact' renewal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In short, the Aachen treaty could be said to symbolise all that is bad about \u201cEurope\u201d, as viewed through jaundiced British eyes.

      "bodyText": "It is tempting to indulge in some typical British lip-curling over the grand-sounding Treaty of Franco-German Cooperation and Integration signed on Tuesday by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron in Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle in French), capital of Charlemagne\u2019s lost but not forgotten ninth-century European empire. The pact, reaffirming the 1963 \u00c9lys\u00e9e treaty that set the two countries on the path to post-war reconciliation, is intended to reassert the centrality of the Franco-German partnership in a splintering Europe beset by resurgent nationalism, rightwing populism and Brexit. Cynics will say it is also an attempt to reassert the fading relevance of Merkel and Macron. Yet it\u2019s not necessary to be an English Eurosceptic to have serious doubts about this project. Macron was accused of \u201chigh treason\u201d this week by the French right for supposedly secretly planning to surrender Alsace and Lorraine. Marine Le Pen, the leader of National Rally (formerly the National Front), claimed French schoolchildren would be forced to speak German. Merkel was also attacked at home for falling into the trap of appearing to endorse, at least in theory, some of Macron\u2019s more high-flown ideas about a joint eurozone budget, banking union, common taxes and European army. Alexander Gauland, leader of the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party, said Macron was trying to grab \u201cGerman money\u201d. Such claims are nonsense. So, too, is the idea put about by Eurosceptic media in Britain that Paris and Berlin are conspiring to seize full control of the EU and impose a new, shared hegemony at the expense of smaller states. The real problem with the new treaty is that it is mostly a bland, unambitious fudge. The soaring ideals and aspirations enunciated by the newly elected Macron in his Sorbonne speech in 2017, about a Europe of democracy, sovereignty, unity and security, find but a faint, distorted echo today. The treaty has little concrete to say about key, contentious issues facing Europe such as migration, social fracture and alienation, and environmental challenges. It focuses, for example, on closer governmental coordination, intelligence sharing and cross-border cooperation \u2013 all of which have been mooted before. But it skates around differences over arms exports \u2013 Germany banned weapons sales to Saudi Arabia after Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder; France did not. The pact is also silent on the vexed issue of \u201csharing\u201d France\u2019s permanent UN security council seat, as suggested by some in Berlin. Meanwhile, Macron\u2019s proposals about economic stimulus, social investment, a financial transaction tax and bank insurance have been lost in the mists of Germany\u2019s innate fiscal caution. In short, the Aachen treaty could be said to symbolise all that is bad about \u201cEurope\u201d, as viewed through jaundiced British eyes. It sounds fine and dandy, but it ducks the hard issues, dodges tough decisions and, in seeking out inoffensive common ground, forfeits any sense of vision. That is what will be said \u2013 and it is fundamentally wrong. In their different ways, with numerous caveats and hesitations, and notwithstanding their considerable domestic political difficulties, Macron and Merkel are bravely trying to achieve three distinct and laudable objectives. One is to remind Europeans, including the Brexiting British, that reconciling these two great continental powers was a signal achievement of the second half of the 20th century. It was a key British policy aim. And the ensuing partnership was a crucial cornerstone in the construction of the EU, still by far the world\u2019s most successful model of inter-state collaboration. It helped bring unprecedented peace, security and prosperity to Europe. \u201cSeventy-four years, a single human lifetime, after the end of world war two, what seems self-evident is being called into question again,\u201d Merkel said on signing the treaty. \u201cThat\u2019s why, first of all, there needs to be a new commitment toward our responsibility within the EU, a responsibility held by Germany and France.\u201d Second, by reaffirming their partnership, France and Germany are not seeking to dominate but to safeguard those hard-won gains in the face of a dangerous pan-European upsurge in nationalist sentiment, divisive rightwing demagoguery, and out-and-out racism and xenophobia. And they are seeking to compensate for the damaging loss of Britain as an active partner in that ongoing fight. It is to Britain\u2019s great collective shame that it appears set on abandoning the field and retreating into delusional nostalgia for an imagined past at the very moment when the forces of reaction are gathering new strength. Last, Macron and Merkel are doing what any British leader worth their salt should instinctively be doing too: namely reinforcing Europe\u2019s defences against the depredations, current and future, of a US that is increasingly intent on exploiting the privileges conferred by global leadership while rejecting the accompanying responsibilities; and against the rise of a ruthless new superpower, China, whose authoritarian, anti-democratic practices fundamentally challenge European values of independence, freedom of action and individual rights. Thank goodness Macron and Merkel, for all their faults and weaknesses, can still see the bigger picture. These days, for the most part, Britain\u2019s small-minded leaders cannot see beyond their rather stuck-up noses. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s rush hour, and Beatrice Gibson is having a panic attack in a packed carriage on the London underground. The train stops suddenly in the tunnel. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d she says. Cascading images fill the screen, in a flickering montage of ecological doom, refugee boats overturning, Grenfell Tower burning, tumult on the streets, Brexit, Donald Trump \u2026 the daily kaleidoscope of our fears. She can feel her body, but it is as if the skin has gone, she says. Racing thoughts of disaster erupt from within, interspersed with more homely thoughts. Family footage of kids playing on the beach and in the bath, domestic life; even the reassurance of the familiar feels under threat.</p> <p>So begins I Hope I\u2019m Loud When I\u2019m Dead, one of two new films by Gibson at <a href=\"https://www.camdenartscentre.org/whats-on/view/gibson\">Camden Arts Centre, London</a>. Both are dense, sometimes disorientating and disjunctive, packed with words, images, poetry and song. Titled after a poem by <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/caconrad\">CAConrad</a>, I Hope I\u2019m Loud repeatedly turns from the apocalyptic to the intimate. Like Gibson on the underground, I\u2019m hanging on in here, not knowing how much the details matter, or which matter, as we swerve from one scene to the next, from one voice to another. These are the world\u2019s mixed messages. A single viewing is not enough.</p> <p>Later, we join Gibson and Conrad in fellow American poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/16/eileen-myles-learn-to-write-poems\">Eileen Myles</a>\u2019s New York studio, on the eve of Trump\u2019s inauguration. My eye, like the camera, scans the room: a desiccated frog in an open spectacle case, Conrad\u2019s playing cards and the ephemera of Myles\u2019 poetic \u201crituals\u201d, a copy of Austrian novelist <a href=\"http://www.thomasbernhard.org/cousineautbintro.shtml\">Thomas Bernhard</a>\u2019s manic Concrete on the table. The camera hovers and moves on. I think of Bernhard\u2019s relentless, bitter, percussive prose even as the two poets read to camera. \u201cFuck the real America up the ass with a fake one,\u201d Conrad declaims, and talks about growing up, always taunted with the word \u201cfaggot\u201d. Myles reads their poem The Box.</p> <p>Swerving from news footage to home life, from Myles\u2019s studio to an empty dancefloor, what a strange and ambitious thing this unguarded and intense film is. Gibson\u2019s voiceover quotes fragments from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\">Audre Lorde</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/adrienne-rich-eve-ensler-jackie-kay\">Adrienne Rich</a> and <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alice-notley\">Alice Notley</a>, all as part of an imaginary letter to her daughter Laizer\u2019s future. However awful the world, it is almost all OK, says Gibson, \u201cbecause these voices exist\u201d. But the one Gibson learns most from, she continues, is her daughter. The edgelessness returns, not as panic this time but a kind of pulsating joy at her daughter\u2019s lively, unguarded presence.</p> <p>In a wonderful final scene, Gibson and her son Obie re-enact the ending from Claire Denis\u2019 1999 movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jun/27/artsfeatures3\">Beau Travail</a>. In Denis\u2019 film, a lone ex-soldier (played by Denis Levant) <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/105411522\">smokes and dances alone to Corona\u2019s 1994 disco anthem The Rhythm of the Night</a>. Gibson\u2019s dance with her child is an ecstatic celebration of life and their relationship, an antidote to fear and crisis.

The properties, which adjoin the NSW-government owned property, Gayini-Nimmie Caira and the Yanga national park, near Balranald, have been bought through a partnership with an agricultural investment company, Tiverton. It is is one of the most ambitious private conservation efforts attempted in Australia and together the three areas will result in more than 200,000 hectares of land being under protection. The area has been under constant threat of being converted to irrigated cropping. The Juanbung and Boyong cattle stations, along with the properties\u2019 water rights, will be managed in conjunction with Nimmie-Caira. This will result in the protection of almost the entire extent of the Great Cumbung swamp. \u201cCumbung is one of the largest and most important wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin.

If we are to save the basin\u2019s rivers and the communities that depend on them, conservationists, irrigators and governments must come together and act with courage, urgency and optimism,\u201d he said. In addition to wetland conservation and water recovery, Tiverton will manage the property for the dual objectives of conservation and sustainable agriculture. Like Nimmie Caira, this is likely to be for sustainable grazing in less sensitive areas. \u201cThis will ensure jobs continue in the Riverina,\u201d said Gilmore. Tiverton\u2019s director, Nigel Sharp, said the property would be managed for sustainable farming and the company would be exploring other options such as carbon and biodiversity offsets and ecotourism. The Great Cumbung will be managed in conjunction with the 87,000-hectare Gayini Nimmie-Caira property, which was purchased for conservation by the NSW government in2012 and is now managed by the Nature Conservancy and Nari Nari tribal council. The chair of the tribal council, Ian Woods, said: \u201cNari Nari people are very supportive of the purchase and we look forward to working with TNC and Tiverton at the Great Cumbung and Gayini Nimmie-Caira.\u201d The TNC\u2019s work in the Murray-Darling is being supported by John B Fairfax , The Ian Potter Foundation, the Besen family and the Baillieu Myer family\u2019s Yulgilbar Foundation.

Evaporation is then calculated by the difference.</p> <p>A second calculation of evaporation uses a metal pan at the Department of Primary Industries\u2019 Menindee office. It also likely overstates the evaporation rate as the lakes are deeper and colder than the metal tray, says McCrabb.</p> <p>A decision to move to a pipeline will change the lives of those south of Menindee, forever.

      "bodyText": "On the banks of the Darling, near Menindee, two grown men are fighting back tears. It\u2019s a week on from the fish kill that saw hundreds of thousands of fish die near their small town, including Murray cod that were estimated to be about 70 years old. These fish had survived the millennium drought of the late 1990s. Yet here they are dying. Each morning Graeme McCrabb and his mates patrol the river banks, looking for signs that another catastrophic event is about to occur \u2013 an event they argue is man-made. Last week Guardian Australia visited Menindee where we spent hours by a large waterhole which is all that remains at this point of the sometimes mighty Darling, Australia\u2019s longest river. Temperatures are forecast to be over 40C again this week and there is sense of foreboding as the river levels continue to dwindle, the water an ugly shade of bright green due to algal blooms. The confluence of the Murray (right) and Darling rivers at Wentworth in NSW, the green colour is due to algal blooms \u201cI am gutted,\u201d says McCrabb as we watch a large cod floating in the middle of the river, dead. \u201cWe were here when it came to the surface, We watched it die.\u201d \u201cThat one\u2019s in trouble too,\u201d he says pointing to a large fish which turns on its side, flashing its white belly, tail languidly flicking in an effort to right itself. Four enormous cod, each about 80cm in length, rest near a shallow sandbank at the lip of the pool, trying to catch the more oxygenated water from the almost imperceptible flow into it. They hardly move. This is extremely unusual behaviour for these native fish, which are classified as a vulnerable species. Dead fish from the mass fish kill People can go their whole lives without seeing these shy mottled green giants that hide in waterholes, and under logs, but here they are literally gasping for oxygen. \u201cThis is the biggest environmental catastrophe in the history of the river, and no one is here. It beggars belief,\u201d says McCrabb of the lack of visits by any one from the federal government or the Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) . The NSW minister responsible for fisheries, Niall Blair, did visit but toured the river by boat and did not meet locals, citing safety concerns. McCrabb\u2019s friend Paul Grose is close to tears. \u201cI am passionate about the cod. They\u2019re just a beautiful fish,\u201d he says. He wants to mount a rescue mission, and move them to a larger body of water, but neither man is sure the fish will survive. Menindee, too, is becoming endangered. Dust storm at Menindee A town of just over 500 people, it is a pint-sized example of how resources and infrastructure can drive the fortunes of a town up and down. The Darling has always been an ephemeral river, but old timers insist that it is running dry for longer under the Murray-Darling Basin plan. Now a project lodged by the NSW government with the MDBA proposes shrinking the Menindee Lakes and draining them more often. It will almost certainly result in a dry river south of the lakes becoming the norm most years. And that will have unknown consequences for fish populations. Why would the NSW government want to do this? With a kind of Kafka-esque logic, the Menindee Lakes project is about delivering more environmental water to the Murray Darling river system, by reducing evaporation from the lakes. But it will leave the lower Darling drier more often, cutting off the Murray from the Darling and leading to unknown environmental consequences for fish, bird and land-based wildlife that depend on the river. Kangaroos compete for the small amount of water which remains in the outfall at Lake Cawndilla Until now, most of the water retrieved under the Murray-Darling Basin plan for environmental flows has come from buying water rights back from irrigators. But with two-thirds of the target achieved so far, most of the easier deals have been done. So the federal government, under the former agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce, proposed that 605GL of the remaining 1300GL that needs to be found could come from projects that deliver \u201cequivalent environmental outcomes\u201d. NSW has put forward the Menindee Lakes project as its major contribution. It says it can save up to 106GL by cutting evaporation from the lakes system. But locals say the project amounts to \u201cdecommissioning the lower Darling\u201d. \u201cIf you think this is bad,\u201d says local grazier Rob McBride of Tolarno Station in reference to the fish kills, \u201cjust wait till the Menindee Lakes project goes ahead. Clockwise from top: Rob McBride on his station Tolarno south of Menindee, Tolarno station South of Menindee \u201cThis is just a dress rehearsal to what will happen in the river,\u201d he says. The impact of changed water practices under the Murray Darling Basin plan is obvious in Menindee. Hundreds of acres of dead grape vines stand like skeletons around the town. Menindee table grapes were once famous but with the dwindling river, Costa Group, a major agribusiness, made the decision in the 2000s to abandon production and consolidate in more reliable parts of the river system. Downstream, Webster Ltd\u2019s Tandou, facing uncertain flows, sold its water rights to the government in 2017 for $80m and announced it would no longer grow cotton. The buyout meant there was even less reason to send water down the Darling. Then came the decision to build the Broken Hill pipeline. The deputy mayor of Wentworth shire, Tim Elstone, said the $500m project was rushed through without an environmental impact study, without a business case being made public, and with little consultation. Deputy mayor of Wentworth shire Tim Elstone at the juction of the Murray and Darling rivers in Wentworth His town, which sits at the confluence of the Murray and the Darling, is where the water will be taken from to service Broken Hill\u2019s needs in the future. \u201cWe knew about it when we read about it in the local paper. There were informal talks with engineers, but there was never a formal business case put to council. We got a couple of emails saying we could look it up on a website but it was done and dusted by then,\u201d he says. \u201cCertainly we don\u2019t begrudge Broken Hill a clean, good-quality water supply but it cannot be at the expense of the lake system,\u201d he says. The pipe carrying the water supply from Menindee Lakes to Broken Hill The pipeline means that there is no longer any reason to keep a mandated amount of water in the Menindee Lakes to provide water for the people of Broken Hill, as has occurred to date. But the Menindee Lakes project will go much further. It is proposing to reset the threshold for the lakes from 240GL to 80GL, which is just a fraction of the 1,730GL the lakes can hold. This, says McCrabb, will cripple the tourist industry of Menindee. Grey nomads don\u2019t come when the lakes are dry. Sports fishing will also stop, he predicts. A report by consultants Deloitte contains six options to provide alternative water for towns that will be affected in the 900km stretch of river between Bourke and Wentworth. This will affect several hundred graziers and their families and the towns of Wilcannia, Menindee and Pooncarie. Department of Primary Industries workers install aerators in the Darling River in a bid to keep fish alive The bureaucratic language of the Deloitte report conceals the real impact of the project. \u201cThe proposed Menindee Lakes project (MLWSP) has been shown to impact water security and supply in the lower Darling,\u201d it says. \u201cThe hydrological review highlights that high-security water entitlements located on the Darling River downstream of Weir 32 and upstream of the Wentworth Weir will experience less reliable water supply following the implementation of the proposed MLWSP.\u201d In other words, the river will run dry more often. It says that alternative infrastructure will be needed to replace the water supplies to homesteads and in the towns along the river. Option one talks about \u201cstructural adjustment\u201d for the graziers along the river. This is code for buying out their water entitlements or their farms altogether. \u201cA compensation package has been proposed to remove high-security entitlements from the region,\u201d it said. Pooncarie\u2019s town water would be met by another pipeline running up from the Murray \u201cthat would only operate intermittently during no-flow events\u201d. Other options include building on-farm storages for the graziers along the river, tapping into artesian water using bores, or building additional weirs and storages along the river. Clockwise from top: Weir 32 near Menindee; Pelicans on the Darling River below Weir 32 Option six, which is preferred by the newly formed Menindee Water Users group, headed by local police seargent Paul Reynolds, involves compromising on the water savings from the Menindee Lakes plan and keeping more water in the lakes. \u201cThis option assumes a drought reserve of 275-615GL stored in the top two Menindee Lakes \u2013 Lake Wetherell and Lake Pamamaroo,\u201d the Deloitte report reveals. But this will leave NSW with roughly half the water savings it has sought to deliver. As for the environmental impacts of the options, the Deloitte report makes only passing mention, saying more work needs to be done. The MDBA\u2019s own assessment also raised serious concerns about the impact on fish nurseries in the Menindee Lakes, which help restock the entire river. But despite this, the MDBA waved the project through the first stage making it very difficult to reverse course. McCrabb says the \u201cwater savings\u201d from curbing evaporation are also hotly contested. The NSW government has put water lost to evaporation from Menindee Lakes at 106GL a year. The Darling River below the weir at Menindee But McCrabb and others say the likely savings are much lower. This is because the inflows are calculated according to an old depth gauge and volumes extrapolated, and do not allow for silting in the lakes since the last serious study was nearly two decades ago. This, he says, means the inflow is likely overstated. Meanwhile outflows are more carefully measured when they pass through gauges on the channels and back into the river system. Evaporation is then calculated by the difference. A second calculation of evaporation uses a metal pan at the Department of Primary Industries\u2019 Menindee office. It also likely overstates the evaporation rate as the lakes are deeper and colder than the metal tray, says McCrabb. A decision to move to a pipeline will change the lives of those south of Menindee, forever. They might achieve a more reliable water supply, but they will be living next to a dry river. For the Indigenous people along this stretch of the river, the Barka, the concept of a drier river, flowing less frequently, is devastating. Literally \u201cthe river people\u201d, the Barka have been granted native title along the river and co-manage Kinchega National park. But they are watching their land die around them. It could also challenge the very existence of towns like Pooncarie, population 150, 130km south of Menindee on the lower Darling. A hundred years ago it was a river port but now survives as a tourist town and a fishing spot. \u201cIt certainly affects us in so far as fishing,\u201d says the owner of the Port Pitstop, Val Kitson, as she watches the river dwindle. \u201cWe still have travellers go through, we still have locals and the school\u2019s about to reopen so that\u2019s a bonus for us,\u201d she says Pooncarie resident Mouse in the Pooncarie pub \u201cBut we don\u2019t have fishermen up here or campers. Over Christmas there was no one here.\u201d The fish kill was the last straw. \u201cA little town like this that relies on tourism, fishing,\u201d says Mouse, one of the locals at the pub. \u201cIt going to kill us,\u201d he says of the Menindee plan. \u201cIt\u2019s an utter shame, it\u2019s wrong,\u201d Kitson adds.",

They were in the forefront of a different way of providing services. Today, in the face of rising demand, panicked public officials talk about local residents being empowered to take more responsibility for their own health and wellbeing: exactly what women\u2019s refuges did from the start.</p> <p>The founders of women\u2019s refuges were survivors, like the women they supported. They had to campaign hard for money, points out June Freeman, a trustee of the <a href=\"http://www.colchester-refuge.org.uk/\">Colchester and Tendring women\u2019s refuge</a> for 40 years. \u201cPeople were sympathetic to the idea that domestic violence was a bad thing, but it wasn\u2019t an attractive cause to give money to,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t cancer, it wasn\u2019t kittens. It was very hard to find the money and to get public support.\u201d</p> <p>Refuges were also part of a radical new approach to services in the 1970s, says Freeman. \u201cNew attitudes to dealing with alcoholism, domestic violence and homelessness developed, in an attempt to get rid of patronising, condescending attitudes that had been with us since the Victorian era. The most important thing was to ask a woman who came into a refuge what she needed and how we could help.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women were so touched, because we were the first people who listened to them and believed them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Refuges have, inevitably, moved on from those early days. They have grown bigger and more organised, with huge specialist expertise on supporting women and their children.

      "bodyText": "Since the 1970s, women\u2019s refuges \u2013 safe spaces for women fleeing domestic abuse \u2013 have played a major role in the struggle for gender equality in the UK. Run locally, with precarious, hard-fought funding, refuges have been vital in protecting women and children from violence and in getting councils, public services and society more widely to take domestic abuse seriously. It is shocking that two women a week are killed by their partners, but there is greater protection now than in the 1970s. Since 2015, coercive and controlling behaviour has been a criminal offence and on Monday, the government\u2019s draft domestic abuse bill introduced further measures to tackle an issue that costs an estimated \u00a366bn a year. But there\u2019s another aspect of refuges in danger of being lost as cuts to public services bite deep. They were in the forefront of a different way of providing services. Today, in the face of rising demand, panicked public officials talk about local residents being empowered to take more responsibility for their own health and wellbeing: exactly what women\u2019s refuges did from the start. The founders of women\u2019s refuges were survivors, like the women they supported. They had to campaign hard for money, points out June Freeman, a trustee of the Colchester and Tendring women\u2019s refuge for 40 years. \u201cPeople were sympathetic to the idea that domestic violence was a bad thing, but it wasn\u2019t an attractive cause to give money to,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t cancer, it wasn\u2019t kittens. It was very hard to find the money and to get public support.\u201d Refuges were also part of a radical new approach to services in the 1970s, says Freeman. \u201cNew attitudes to dealing with alcoholism, domestic violence and homelessness developed, in an attempt to get rid of patronising, condescending attitudes that had been with us since the Victorian era. The most important thing was to ask a woman who came into a refuge what she needed and how we could help.\u201d Refuges have, inevitably, moved on from those early days. They have grown bigger and more organised, with huge specialist expertise on supporting women and their children. But they now face the same, frustrating challenge as so many other UK public services: how to survive as councils slash their funding and other support services disappear. The government\u2019s relentless attack on benefits and a lack of affordable housing have made it harder than ever to support women into secure, independent lives. \u201cThere\u2019s a real crisis,\u201d says Alison Inman, who stepped down in November 2018 as president of the Chartered Institute of Housing after a year of working on domestic abuse. Inman acknowledges that refuges are not always easy to work with, but are \u201camazing organisations that are local, women-led and survivor-influenced.\u201d It\u2019s not just cuts that have impacted refuges. Since the 1980s, and the start of full-scale outsourcing of public services, councils have been forced to focus on a very narrow definition of value for money that, in practice, means accepting the lowest bid. This has made it harder for small local organisations, including refuges, but many other charities, too, to bid for contracts from councils. Since 2010, funding for refuges in England, Wales and Scotland has been cut by almost \u00a37m. Women\u2019s refuges that provide specialist care, especially those working with black and minority ethnic (BME) women and survivors with complex needs, face a particularly high risk of closure. According to Women\u2019s Aid, 17% of specialist women\u2019s refuges were forced to close between 2010 and 2014. Baljit Banga, director of the London Black Women\u2019s Project, says the number is rising all the time. \u201cWe are worried, as a sector,\u201d she says. BME women\u2019s refuges have not fared well in an open market, despite their huge value to the survivors they support, and they are now at great risk \u2013 particularly those working with south Asian women and girls. \u201cIt can lead to moving women and children on before they are ready,\u201d says Banga. There is even a risk they could return to the perpetrator. With funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Freeman and Banga have organised exhibitions, plus a permanent archive at the University of Essex to preserve vital knowledge about the early days of refuges in the UK. For Freeman, one lesson stands out: the need to \u201ckeep at it\u201d, to keep finding funding, to ensure women themselves have a voice about everything that affects their lives as they and their children deal with domestic abuse.

At the same time, we will be seeking a buyer for the business and are hopeful of a good level of interest.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last week, the company admitted its finances were in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/16/patisserie-valerie-accounts-cafe\">even worse shape</a> than it had previously thought. Patisserie Valerie said forensic accountants had found \u201cthousands of false entries into the company\u2019s ledgers\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a statement to the stock market on Tuesday, Patisserie Holdings said that as a \u201cdirect result of the significant fraud\u201d, it had been unable to renew its bank facilities and \u201ctherefore regrettably, the business does not have sufficient funding to meet its liabilities\u201d.</p> \n<p>The company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/22/luke-johnson-from-pizza-express-to-patisserie-valerie\">chairman, Luke Johnson</a>, said he had personally extended a \u00a33m interest-free loan to it to help ensure January wages are paid to all staff.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis loan will also assist the administrators in trading as many profitable stores as possible while a sale process is undertaken,\u201d a statement said.</p> \n<p>The appointment of administrators wipes out the value of Johnson\u2019s and all other shareholders\u2019 investment in the stock market-listed business, which was valued at \u00a3450m before it flagged up the potential fraud.</p> \n<p>The company\u2019s finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrested by Hertfordshire police and bailed in October.

In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes.

      "bodyText": "Patisserie Valerie has collapsed into administration, putting more than 3,000 jobs at risk, after failing to secure a financial lifeline from its banks. About 70 of the cafe group\u2019s nearly 200 stores and concessions will close immediately, with the loss of about 900 jobs. Patisserie Holdings, the parent company that also owns the Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker &amp; Spice and Flour Power City brands, has been in crisis since October, when a \u00a340m black hole in its finances was blamed on \u201cpotentially fraudulent\u201d accounting irregularities. Blair Nimmo of KPMG, a joint administrator of the business, said: \u201cOur intention is to continue trading across the profitable stores, as collectively the brands have a strong presence on the high street and have proven very popular with consumers. At the same time, we will be seeking a buyer for the business and are hopeful of a good level of interest.\u201d Last week, the company admitted its finances were in even worse shape than it had previously thought. Patisserie Valerie said forensic accountants had found \u201cthousands of false entries into the company\u2019s ledgers\u201d. In a statement to the stock market on Tuesday, Patisserie Holdings said that as a \u201cdirect result of the significant fraud\u201d, it had been unable to renew its bank facilities and \u201ctherefore regrettably, the business does not have sufficient funding to meet its liabilities\u201d. The company\u2019s chairman, Luke Johnson, said he had personally extended a \u00a33m interest-free loan to it to help ensure January wages are paid to all staff. \u201cThis loan will also assist the administrators in trading as many profitable stores as possible while a sale process is undertaken,\u201d a statement said. The appointment of administrators wipes out the value of Johnson\u2019s and all other shareholders\u2019 investment in the stock market-listed business, which was valued at \u00a3450m before it flagged up the potential fraud. The company\u2019s finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrested by Hertfordshire police and bailed in October. He resigned that month. The Serious Fraud Office has confirmed it has opened a criminal investigation into an individual but has not given further information. The Financial Reporting Council has said it is also investigating Marsh and the accountancy firm Grant Thornton for its role as auditor to Patisserie Valerie. The crisis forced Johnson to put \u00a320m of his own money into an emergency refinancing to keep the company afloat. He was paid back \u00a310m after other shareholders agreed to inject \u00a315m in new funds. It is understood Johnson\u2019s initial \u00a310m loan was not secured against Patisserie Valerie\u2019s assets, so he will have to join other creditors, including suppliers and the group\u2019s main lenders, HSBC and Barclays, whose loans were also not secured, in waiting to see if administrators can raise funds to pay them back. A standstill of the group\u2019s banking facilities, which protected it from action to recover debts, expired on Friday, since which time investors have been waiting nervously for the outcome of talks. Paul Mumford of Cavendish Asset Management, which put an additional \u00a3100,000 into Patisserie Valerie as part of a \u00a315m rescue fundraising deal in November, said the administration was \u201ca big disappointment\u201d. \u201cI feel that perhaps there could have been a different solution,\u201d he said. Mumford suggested shareholders that participated in the fundraising would be \u201ca bit miffed\u201d they did so on the understanding that the company would make profits of \u00a312m, a figure Patisserie Valerie later said further investigation had revealed to be far too high. Chris Boxall at Fundamental Asset Management, another shareholder, said the collapse of Patisserie Valerie was \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d. He said he was considering launching legal proceedings and wanted to encourage other shareholders to join in. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a business making \u00a330m squeaky clean in September supplying coffee and cakes disappearing before February,\u201d Boxall said. \u201cThis is ridiculous \u2026 in a system that is supposed to be robust. Where are the directors?\u201d The collapse comes amid a tough time on the high street as slowing consumer spending and rising costs have prompted a swathe of restaurant groups and retailers to falter. HMV went into administration just after Christmas and high street players including New Look, Carluccio\u2019s, Byron and Carpetright have used an insolvency procedure to close dozens of stores. Rachel Reeves, the chairwoman of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said Patisserie Valerie\u2019s administration raised \u201cserious questions\u201d. \u201cThe extraordinary black hole in Patisserie Valerie\u2019s accounts which has led to this administration raises grave corporate governance concerns and poses serious questions regarding the effectiveness of the auditor and the current arrangements for regulation,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "We are in the middle of a fourth industrial revolution. The first saw the world move from rural societies to industrial urban centres; the second introduced mass production; and the third brought the digital revolution. The fourth is changing how we integrate technology into our lives, thanks to advances such as artificial intelligence (AI), nanotechnology and robotics. But what will this mean for humans as workers? Retraining will be an essential feature of the new employment landscape, in which many jobs will be automated. Opportunities to reskill should be offered across the whole economy and supported by tax relief to ensure the UK is prepared for the changes ahead, a recent Social Market Foundation report suggested. Postgraduate study is already a popular option for those looking to move their career in a new direction. Jean-Marc Frangos, a managing director based in Silicon Valley at BT, one of the UK\u2019s largest technology employers, has observed that a growing number of people working in tech retrained after studying for unrelated first degrees. \u201cWhen I meet people here, their original education might be anything from ancient Greek to marketing,\u201d he says. \u201cNow they work in the tech domain and they\u2019re very good. Don\u2019t assume that your original education is excluding you from a tech career.\u201d There are a wide variety of tech careers available for people to pursue after further study, he continues, but certain areas will be in greater demand \u2013 particularly data science analytics and cybersecurity, both of which are offered at master\u2019s level at universities across the country. A recent report from jobs site Indeed named data scientists and cybersecurity experts among the most \u201cfuture-proof\u201d careers. AI, too, is a huge growth industry: a report from jobs site Indeed found that employer demand for AI-related roles has more than doubled in the US in the past three years, while the number of jobseekers looking for those roles has remained roughly the same. In 2017, the UK government recommended creating an industry-funded AI master\u2019s programme. Caroline Jay is a senior lecturer in the school of computer science at the University of Manchester and teaches on the AI: Robot overlord, replacement or colleague? module. The course is available to students from all disciplines, she explains, and teaches the theory underpinning AI, as well as practical experience of programming. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more students from the sciences and social sciences, and even some from humanities,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re not trained in computer science as a first degree, but they do start to do bits of programming and coding along the way and realise it gives them a huge advantage over people who can\u2019t.\u201d Even if students don\u2019t end up working in AI, she says, the skills they develop on the course will be invaluable in an increasingly tech-driven jobs market. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed the way we think about technology,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have people who are experts in accounting or law or medicine or fashion design and they understand how technology could help them with that, they can be the ones to drive it forward. They might not be writing the programmes, but they will be leading the problem-solving aspect of it. They can make those informed decisions that people in the professions are going to need in the future.\u201d Nicola Webb is studying for an MSc in data science and computational intelligence at Coventry University, and is hoping to go on to research social robotics \u2013 which looks at advances such as using robots to take care of the elderly. She says the potential for development in this area is vast. \u201cWe often debate whether we should be developing AI to such an intelligent level,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think that this generation of computer and data scientists are more than aware of the dangers, through their own research, or from sci-fi movies like Ex Machina, that put such scenarios into play.

At least this title comes in recognition of a personal achievement.</p> <p><strong>Which is?</strong> Making very good avocado toast.</p> <p><strong>Not whispering to it?</strong> No. The title was conferred on her by an old friend, her former makeup artist Daniel Martin, after a visit to Meghan/HRH/Countess Thingy/etc at the weekend.</p> <p><strong>How do we know?</strong> He announced it on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs2csAnh2NP/\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>.

As she told another blog, <a href=\"http://eye-swoon.com/a-tig-moment-with-meghan-markle/\" title=\"\">EyeSwoon</a>, in 2017, she grew up on film sets helping to make food trays for everybody.</p> <p><strong>At least there</strong><strong> is evidence that people like food.</strong> Indeed. \u201cI learned \u2026 how happy people would be when I walked in with a tray of perfect crudites,\u201d she said.</p> <p><strong>I find that a </strong><strong>bowl of crisps has a similar effect.</strong> Ah, but crisps aren\u2019t very clean eating, or paleo or something. And, of course, the darling of that scene is the avocado.</p> <p><strong>Of course.</strong> Asked for her breakfast routine, Meghan told EyeSwoon: \u201cAcai bowl, clean cleanse shake or a green juice. If I\u2019m at a hotel, I will likely order poached eggs and toast with avocado.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Still, it\u2019s nice to know that modern royals live just like ordinary people, making their own toast, crushing their own avocado, eating their own chocolates from Fortnum </strong><strong>&amp; Mason.</strong> Just like ordinary people, yes.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cShould I curtsey when I meet the Avocado Toast Whisperer?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cDamn right.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Name: The Avocado Toast Whisperer. Age: 37. Occupation: Heir freshener. Appearance: Glowing. Also known as: Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex, the Countess of Dumbarton and Lady Kilkeel. Also also known as: Princess Henry of Wales. You mean Meghan? That\u2019s right. Born Rachel Meghan Markle. Although for a time she was Meghan Engelson. Actually, she might also be Meghan Windsor these days \u2026 Anyway, she is now the Avocado Toast Whisperer as well. Crikey. You\u2019d think she had enough names. I expect you stop counting after the first half-dozen or so. At least this title comes in recognition of a personal achievement. Which is? Making very good avocado toast. Not whispering to it? No. The title was conferred on her by an old friend, her former makeup artist Daniel Martin, after a visit to Meghan/HRH/Countess Thingy/etc at the weekend. How do we know? He announced it on Instagram. He\u2019s a makeup artist, remember. The post included a picture of two plates of the famous toast, plus a pot of tea and four Fortnum &amp; Mason chocolate truffles. Plus a bit of random blanket poking in at the side. Are chocolate truffles nice with avocado toast? Is that the secret? I think you probably have one and then the other. It was like being \u201cback to our Tig days\u201d, Martin said. What\u2019s a Tig? The Tig was Meghan\u2019s lifestyle blog, with an emphasis on food, which she ran from 2014 until 2017. Like that annoying Gwyneth Paltrow thing? Very much like that, I\u2019m afraid. She is, or at least was, a fan of \u201chomeopathic medicine\u201d and \u201cholistic remedies\u201d. Right. As she told another blog, EyeSwoon, in 2017, she grew up on film sets helping to make food trays for everybody. At least there is evidence that people like food. Indeed. \u201cI learned \u2026 how happy people would be when I walked in with a tray of perfect crudites,\u201d she said. I find that a bowl of crisps has a similar effect. Ah, but crisps aren\u2019t very clean eating, or paleo or something. And, of course, the darling of that scene is the avocado. Of course. Asked for her breakfast routine, Meghan told EyeSwoon: \u201cAcai bowl, clean cleanse shake or a green juice. If I\u2019m at a hotel, I will likely order poached eggs and toast with avocado.\u201d Still, it\u2019s nice to know that modern royals live just like ordinary people, making their own toast, crushing their own avocado, eating their own chocolates from Fortnum &amp; Mason. Just like ordinary people, yes. Do say: \u201cShould I curtsey when I meet the Avocado Toast Whisperer?\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cDamn right.\u201d",

With only a couple of near misses therein, no Scottish team outside Celtic and Rangers have won the title since 1985.</p> <p>Just don\u2019t dare suggest to certain Scottish managers that Celtic\u2019s stranglehold on the championship will end at seven in a row. The theme was started by Neil Lennon after Hibernian, then far more prominent than now, lost a thrilling fixture, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/20/celtic-hibernian-scottish-premiership\" title=\"\">4-2 to Celtic</a>, in October. \u201cCeltic have a budget of \u00a360m,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cThey have a \u00a39m striker [Odsonne \u00c9douard]. I\u2019ve got free transfers and rejects from other clubs.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, from revenue of \u00a3101.6m for the financial year of 2018 Celtic had labour costs of \u00a359.3m. Hibs\u2019 comparative figures were \u00a39.6m and \u00a35.3m.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a title race,\u201d said the Aberdeen manager, Derek McInnes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone can say that, even if we would all want that. After 21 games it shows there is a real credibility at the moment but it falls short of a real title race.</p> <p>\u201cIf we get to March and April and there\u2019s still congestion at the top then you could say with certainty that there is a title race on then. It\u2019s easy to have a good couple of months in this league.\u201d In truth, the modern day problem has been that such runs haven\u2019t been easy at all.</p> <p>Aberdeen have 39 points versus Celtic\u2019s 42. McInnes may cite realism as the cause for his comments but they appear needlessly fatalistic; if this club\u2019s staff don\u2019t believe in smashing the status quo, why should supporters?</p> <p>Steve Clarke, Kilmarnock\u2019s manager, entered similar territory as Rangers prepare to visit Rugby Park on Wednesday. Clarke revealed that the reported \u00a335,000 per week Rangers are contributing towards the Bournemouth wage of Jermain Defoe equals his squad budget for the same period. Kilmarnock amassed more Premiership points than any other club in 2018 but Clarke, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/08/celtic-kilmarnock-scottish-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">heavy defeat by Celtic</a> last month, accused people of \u201ctalking out of their backsides\u201d when predicting a title tilt. The Ayrshire team are a point from the top. In Clarke\u2019s defence, his budget is a fraction of that enjoyed even by McInnes and Kilmarnock were regulars at the wrong end of the table before his arrival.</p> <p>An exhilarating start by Heart of Midlothian had seen them race clear at the top before the kind of injury woe that a saboteur couldn\u2019t have more appropriately masterminded. That the Edinburgh team are a mere six points behind Celtic following a slump owes plenty to subsequent Hearts recovery and a division where leading teams have, to a greater degree than recently, nicked points from each other. When Hearts were at the peak of their powers the manager, Craig Levein, broke with convention by stating it was not his place \u201cto tell supporters they cannot dream\u201d.</p> <p>That Rangers and Hearts are better than last season is beyond dispute. Kilmarnock\u2019s finest performer of the 2017-18 season, Youssouf Mulumbu, now warms the bench at Celtic. Aberdeen\u2019s key man over the same period, Kenny McLean, moved to Norwich. Hibs have lost star midfielders to Sunderland and Aston Villa. Rangers were so dysfunctional last season that it was almost a given they would improve under Steven Gerrard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/17/football-hampden-roar-scotland-plastic-pitches\">Scottish football, a Jurassic world where ancient species thrive | Kevin McKenna</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the Scottish season plays out on the basis of resource alone, Celtic will streak clear and Rangers will establish themselves as a second force. Victory \u2013 fully deserved \u2013 for Gerrard\u2019s side in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/29/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">the Old Firm game</a> of 29 December has fuelled already fever-pitch excitement around Ibrox that Celtic can be halted. Gerrard\u2019s transfer activity illustrates that belief extends to the boardroom. Rangers will play four league games away in the next month, during which they will seek to eliminate the travel sickness which blighted the early months of Gerrard\u2019s tenure.</p> <p>That Rangers and Celtic wobbled between August and new year can be explained in part by participation in the group phase of the Europa League. Nonetheless, Celtic\u2019s January return to the loan market for short-term fixes highlights their inability to place anything like the daylight between themselves and the rest as was possible when Rangers and other leading clubs weren\u2019t competitive. Speculation linking Brendan Rodgers with Leicester City refuses to go away, amid the understanding that the former Liverpool manager inevitably has ambitions beyond Scotland.</p> <p>Should Rodgers decide this summer represents an opportune time to exit, divorce would arrive at a time when Celtic have become more accustomed to domestic frights. Whether they exist because of a general improvement in standards, or regression from the top, is a fascinating point for debate. For now, Scots should cherish the unknown.</p>",

In the Bundesliga, RB Leipzig lie fourth but 14 points worse off than Borussia Dortmund. A Juventus stroll towards the Serie A title is such that they lead by nine. Paris St-Germain have already dismantled Ligue 1; their advantage is 13 points over Lille with two matches in hand. Competition, of course, doesn\u2019t relate directly to quality but Scottish fans have borne the brunt of jokes relating to a one- or two-horse races for long enough that they may enjoy these times. With only a couple of near misses therein, no Scottish team outside Celtic and Rangers have won the title since 1985. Just don\u2019t dare suggest to certain Scottish managers that Celtic\u2019s stranglehold on the championship will end at seven in a row. The theme was started by Neil Lennon after Hibernian, then far more prominent than now, lost a thrilling fixture, 4-2 to Celtic, in October. \u201cCeltic have a budget of \u00a360m,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cThey have a \u00a39m striker [Odsonne \u00c9douard]. I\u2019ve got free transfers and rejects from other clubs.\u201d Indeed, from revenue of \u00a3101.6m for the financial year of 2018 Celtic had labour costs of \u00a359.3m. Hibs\u2019 comparative figures were \u00a39.6m and \u00a35.3m. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a title race,\u201d said the Aberdeen manager, Derek McInnes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone can say that, even if we would all want that. After 21 games it shows there is a real credibility at the moment but it falls short of a real title race. \u201cIf we get to March and April and there\u2019s still congestion at the top then you could say with certainty that there is a title race on then. It\u2019s easy to have a good couple of months in this league.\u201d In truth, the modern day problem has been that such runs haven\u2019t been easy at all. Aberdeen have 39 points versus Celtic\u2019s 42. McInnes may cite realism as the cause for his comments but they appear needlessly fatalistic; if this club\u2019s staff don\u2019t believe in smashing the status quo, why should supporters? Steve Clarke, Kilmarnock\u2019s manager, entered similar territory as Rangers prepare to visit Rugby Park on Wednesday. Clarke revealed that the reported \u00a335,000 per week Rangers are contributing towards the Bournemouth wage of Jermain Defoe equals his squad budget for the same period. Kilmarnock amassed more Premiership points than any other club in 2018 but Clarke, following heavy defeat by Celtic last month, accused people of \u201ctalking out of their backsides\u201d when predicting a title tilt. The Ayrshire team are a point from the top. In Clarke\u2019s defence, his budget is a fraction of that enjoyed even by McInnes and Kilmarnock were regulars at the wrong end of the table before his arrival. An exhilarating start by Heart of Midlothian had seen them race clear at the top before the kind of injury woe that a saboteur couldn\u2019t have more appropriately masterminded. That the Edinburgh team are a mere six points behind Celtic following a slump owes plenty to subsequent Hearts recovery and a division where leading teams have, to a greater degree than recently, nicked points from each other. When Hearts were at the peak of their powers the manager, Craig Levein, broke with convention by stating it was not his place \u201cto tell supporters they cannot dream\u201d. That Rangers and Hearts are better than last season is beyond dispute. Kilmarnock\u2019s finest performer of the 2017-18 season, Youssouf Mulumbu, now warms the bench at Celtic. Aberdeen\u2019s key man over the same period, Kenny McLean, moved to Norwich. Hibs have lost star midfielders to Sunderland and Aston Villa. Rangers were so dysfunctional last season that it was almost a given they would improve under Steven Gerrard. If the Scottish season plays out on the basis of resource alone, Celtic will streak clear and Rangers will establish themselves as a second force. Victory \u2013 fully deserved \u2013 for Gerrard\u2019s side in the Old Firm game of 29 December has fuelled already fever-pitch excitement around Ibrox that Celtic can be halted. Gerrard\u2019s transfer activity illustrates that belief extends to the boardroom. Rangers will play four league games away in the next month, during which they will seek to eliminate the travel sickness which blighted the early months of Gerrard\u2019s tenure. That Rangers and Celtic wobbled between August and new year can be explained in part by participation in the group phase of the Europa League. Nonetheless, Celtic\u2019s January return to the loan market for short-term fixes highlights their inability to place anything like the daylight between themselves and the rest as was possible when Rangers and other leading clubs weren\u2019t competitive. Speculation linking Brendan Rodgers with Leicester City refuses to go away, amid the understanding that the former Liverpool manager inevitably has ambitions beyond Scotland. Should Rodgers decide this summer represents an opportune time to exit, divorce would arrive at a time when Celtic have become more accustomed to domestic frights. Whether they exist because of a general improvement in standards, or regression from the top, is a fascinating point for debate. For now, Scots should cherish the unknown.",

By contrast, this place is sad but clean and organised; mothers and children sit beside a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe; boys play football \u2013 but it\u2019s no more than a way station.</p> <p>All three at our table want to work in construction in the US, but while the Guatemalans left recently, Jonathan\u2019s nightmare is in his adolescent past: he\u2019s now 19, become an artful dodger and survivor of the road, trying to cross the border into America. \u201cI\u2019ve been in Mexico five years now, working, saving, hiding \u2013 planning the moment. The Mexicans ordered me deported twice, but I slipped the net.

But now my time has come to cross.\u201d</p> <p>With lines for asylum lengthening, and Donald Trump entrenching his hostility to migration, Jonathan has not entered the system most families here have joined, registering for a plastic bracelet and numbered place in the so-called metering line for an asylum hearing. \u201cThey\u2019ve made it too difficult, and it takes too long. I\u2019ll go alone, my own way.\u201d</p> <p>Osman and Rodrigo are going illegally too; \u201cTrump has made asylum impossible \u2013 too long, and you\u2019ll likely get turned back,\u201d says Osman, in English. \u201cI miss it back there; my mother calls me every fucking day \u2013 it\u2019s torture - but too dangerous to stay and there\u2019s no future in Guatemala. I have to risk it.\u201d Rodrigo, quieter, is more nervous: \u201cI\u2019ve a wife and son back home, that\u2019s who I\u2019m doing this for \u2013 but what if I get caught?\u201d</p> <p>Word is out that migrants arriving in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez stand a statistically negligible chance of asylum through El Paso compared with ports of entry into California from Tijuana where lines are therefore longer, tempting more and more to try Jonathan\u2019s way.</p> <p>But El Paso\u2019s courts are not the only menace. Ju\u00e1rez last year suffered a sudden surge in homicides: 1,247 \u2013 a rate of 96 per 100,000. By far the highest toll for any year since the city\u2019s hyper-violence of 2008-2011, during which this was the most murderous metropolis in the world. Ju\u00e1rez now has Mexico\u2019s second highest murder rate after Tijuana, attributed by city security and justice officials to turf wars between gangs for street-sale and cross-border smuggling of drugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"58d642f079f413b0b66c6e73ba70b2606f484e97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58d642f079f413b0b66c6e73ba70b2606f484e97/0_0_3600_2421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Contruction of the border wall in El Paso, in Rio Grande.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Contruction of the border wall in El Paso, in Rio Grande.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Cardona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Break</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Casa del Migrante</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>lies</strong> on the city outskirts towards the perilous Valle de Ju\u00e1rez, entrep\u00f4t for narco-traffic and likely route for migrants trying to cross illegally, including these boys.</p> <p>So acute danger faces those heading north, as traffickers hover to prey on and profit from the increased pool of potential custom, and those deported in the opposite direction, as gangs recruit their foot soldiers. The worst massacre in Mexico\u2019s carnage since 2006 was not drug-related, but that of 72 migrants at San Fernando, Tamaulipas, in 2010, who refused or were unable to pay \u201c<em>la cuota\u201d</em> \u2013 the levy. Traffickers are known in the parlance as \u201c<em>coyotes\u201d </em>or \u201c<em>polleros\u201d</em> \u2013 their quarry \u201c<em>pollos\u201d</em>, chickens.</p> <p>Blanca Rivera is one of two social workers at Casa del Migrante; after eight years, she says, \u201cI\u2019ve seen all kinds come through \u2013 before mostly Mexicans, but no longer. It\u2019s never been like this \u2013 these numbers and so desperate, people who just cannot go back.\u201d</p> <p>Ribera explains that a police presence outside the chain-link fence topped with razor wire is \u201cbecause of incidents at the center and to keep away <em>polleros</em>. It\u2019s forbidden for migrants go to the fence and talk to <em>polleros</em>. If they do, and seem honest, we\u2019ll explain the risks; if they look to be doing business, they must leave. Those expelled, we do not see again.\u201d Whether they make it or not; migrant disappearances are oft-reported along the border; sometimes people ask at the centre if a vanished person has been seen.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a twist, according to Jonathan and almost all those who plan crossing of their own device. \u201cThe police are part of the system. We all know that,\u201d says Jonathan. How part of this? Jonathan laughs again and makes to slice his index finger in half, \u201cFifty-fifty, that\u2019s how it works. We watch the <em>polleros </em>watching us on the bridges and in the town, and the police allow the <em>polleros </em>to work on their <em>plaza </em>\u2013 turf \u2013 for a 50-50 cut on the money paid. If you don\u2019t believe that, you\u2019re an idiot. That\u2019s partly why I stay away from them \u2013 to be apart from that shit.\u201d</p> <p>Leticia Chavarr\u00eda is a GP in one of Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s many assembly plants who established a medical advocacy committee during the city\u2019s most violent years and now works with the Bi-national Network for Solidarity with Migrants. \u201cEveryone knows the crossings are managed by the <em>polleros,</em>\u201d she says, \u201cand it\u2019s been understood that for years they\u2019ve operated complicit with the authorities, under an accord never documented or proved. <em>Polleros </em>run stash houses across the city and do business openly, but are only arrested in very isolated cases.\u201d</p> <p>There was no response to a request through his office to interview the mayor of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Armando Carbada, on the policing of migrant security.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ba908967ab41bfeac976821069640dac7a92376\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ba908967ab41bfeac976821069640dac7a92376/0_0_3600_2421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casa del Migrante workers hand out clothing donated by the binational community of Ju\u00e1rez, El Paso and Las Cruces.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casa del Migrante workers hand out clothing donated by the binational community of Ju\u00e1rez, El Paso and Las Cruces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Cardona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Break</a> </figure>  <p><strong>The border hardens still: </strong>just east of downtown Ju\u00e1rez, late winter sun skates across a concrete slope down to the slow trickle of the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo on this side), and up the other bank, which is the USA, where Mexican-American workers operate a Volvo digger and trucks to build a brand new stretch of high steel fence. Wall or no wall, this new fortification \u2013 which started to the north, separating the satellite barrio of Anapra from New Mexico, under the Obama administration \u2013 began late last year under Trump, and continues.</p> <p>And as another caravan forms this week in Honduras, Ribera draws attention to a further, crucial, matter: resources. Circumstances combine against the running of places like Casa del Migrante; not just the surge in numbers and entrenched US policy, but accession by Mexico\u2019s new president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, to a demand from Trump that asylum seekers must wait in Mexico, not the US, for their cases to be heard.</p> <p>Mexico\u2019s borderland is not yet America\u2019s migrant waiting room, \u201cbut as the number of migrants increases, government help is reduced\u201d, says Ribera. At Christmas, the priest who oversees Casa del Migrante, Padre Javier Calvillo, gave a rare press conference during which he lambasted Mexican federal, state and municipal authorities for failing to provide sufficient funds or manpower to help centres like this cope.</p> <p>\u201cThe municipality had taken 80 migrants from the bridge directly to Casa del Migrante, without any processing,\u201d says Chavarr\u00eda, \u201cand Fr Calvillo said he could take no more. The city opened its own shelter, but it lasted a week.\u201d</p> <p>Ribera says the city has now \u201cassigned six workers due to arrive, and six more to come\u201d. She added: \u201cBut the reality is that we are dependent on the church, and private donations from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, El Paso and Las Cruces [New Mexico]. It\u2019s ironic that while Donald Trump\u2019s policies and wall divide our countries, the support is all binational, from good people on both sides of the border. It\u2019s <em>coraz</em><em>\u00f3n contra h\u00edgado</em>, as we say in Mexico \u2013 heart against liver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is,\u201d says Chavarr\u00eda, \u201cthat when most of those going across or being deported were Mexicans, there was more interest. The attitude is that these are Central Americans, not our problem. But it is. What will they do if they cannot enter the United States? Our work, either side of the border, is to educate both migrants and our own citizens on the rights they have.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Break</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Back at Casa del Migrante,</strong> more people arrive at the heavy gates: families from Guatemala like Eder Ram\u00edrez and his daughter, Leti, aged eight; and two women travelling from Panajachel, with two children each, \u201crunning from the gangs\u201d.

By contrast, this place is sad but clean and organised; mothers and children sit beside a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe; boys play football \u2013 but it\u2019s no more than a way station. All three at our table want to work in construction in the US, but while the Guatemalans left recently, Jonathan\u2019s nightmare is in his adolescent past: he\u2019s now 19, become an artful dodger and survivor of the road, trying to cross the border into America. \u201cI\u2019ve been in Mexico five years now, working, saving, hiding \u2013 planning the moment. The Mexicans ordered me deported twice, but I slipped the net. The trains through this country\u201d \u2013 La Bestia \u2013 \u201chave been my home. They\u2019re more dangerous for women than me; getting raped, kidnapped and killed. But now my time has come to cross.\u201d With lines for asylum lengthening, and Donald Trump entrenching his hostility to migration, Jonathan has not entered the system most families here have joined, registering for a plastic bracelet and numbered place in the so-called metering line for an asylum hearing. \u201cThey\u2019ve made it too difficult, and it takes too long. I\u2019ll go alone, my own way.\u201d Osman and Rodrigo are going illegally too; \u201cTrump has made asylum impossible \u2013 too long, and you\u2019ll likely get turned back,\u201d says Osman, in English. \u201cI miss it back there; my mother calls me every fucking day \u2013 it\u2019s torture - but too dangerous to stay and there\u2019s no future in Guatemala. I have to risk it.\u201d Rodrigo, quieter, is more nervous: \u201cI\u2019ve a wife and son back home, that\u2019s who I\u2019m doing this for \u2013 but what if I get caught?\u201d Word is out that migrants arriving in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez stand a statistically negligible chance of asylum through El Paso compared with ports of entry into California from Tijuana where lines are therefore longer, tempting more and more to try Jonathan\u2019s way. But El Paso\u2019s courts are not the only menace. Ju\u00e1rez last year suffered a sudden surge in homicides: 1,247 \u2013 a rate of 96 per 100,000. By far the highest toll for any year since the city\u2019s hyper-violence of 2008-2011, during which this was the most murderous metropolis in the world. Ju\u00e1rez now has Mexico\u2019s second highest murder rate after Tijuana, attributed by city security and justice officials to turf wars between gangs for street-sale and cross-border smuggling of drugs. Casa del Migrante lies on the city outskirts towards the perilous Valle de Ju\u00e1rez, entrep\u00f4t for narco-traffic and likely route for migrants trying to cross illegally, including these boys. So acute danger faces those heading north, as traffickers hover to prey on and profit from the increased pool of potential custom, and those deported in the opposite direction, as gangs recruit their foot soldiers. The worst massacre in Mexico\u2019s carnage since 2006 was not drug-related, but that of 72 migrants at San Fernando, Tamaulipas, in 2010, who refused or were unable to pay \u201cla cuota\u201d \u2013 the levy. Traffickers are known in the parlance as \u201ccoyotes\u201d or \u201cpolleros\u201d \u2013 their quarry \u201cpollos\u201d, chickens. Blanca Rivera is one of two social workers at Casa del Migrante; after eight years, she says, \u201cI\u2019ve seen all kinds come through \u2013 before mostly Mexicans, but no longer. It\u2019s never been like this \u2013 these numbers and so desperate, people who just cannot go back.\u201d Ribera explains that a police presence outside the chain-link fence topped with razor wire is \u201cbecause of incidents at the center and to keep away polleros. It\u2019s forbidden for migrants go to the fence and talk to polleros. If they do, and seem honest, we\u2019ll explain the risks; if they look to be doing business, they must leave. Those expelled, we do not see again.\u201d Whether they make it or not; migrant disappearances are oft-reported along the border; sometimes people ask at the centre if a vanished person has been seen. But there\u2019s a twist, according to Jonathan and almost all those who plan crossing of their own device. \u201cThe police are part of the system. We all know that,\u201d says Jonathan. How part of this? Jonathan laughs again and makes to slice his index finger in half, \u201cFifty-fifty, that\u2019s how it works. We watch the polleros watching us on the bridges and in the town, and the police allow the polleros to work on their plaza \u2013 turf \u2013 for a 50-50 cut on the money paid. If you don\u2019t believe that, you\u2019re an idiot. That\u2019s partly why I stay away from them \u2013 to be apart from that shit.\u201d Leticia Chavarr\u00eda is a GP in one of Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s many assembly plants who established a medical advocacy committee during the city\u2019s most violent years and now works with the Bi-national Network for Solidarity with Migrants. \u201cEveryone knows the crossings are managed by the polleros,\u201d she says, \u201cand it\u2019s been understood that for years they\u2019ve operated complicit with the authorities, under an accord never documented or proved. Polleros run stash houses across the city and do business openly, but are only arrested in very isolated cases.\u201d There was no response to a request through his office to interview the mayor of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Armando Carbada, on the policing of migrant security. The border hardens still: just east of downtown Ju\u00e1rez, late winter sun skates across a concrete slope down to the slow trickle of the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo on this side), and up the other bank, which is the USA, where Mexican-American workers operate a Volvo digger and trucks to build a brand new stretch of high steel fence. Wall or no wall, this new fortification \u2013 which started to the north, separating the satellite barrio of Anapra from New Mexico, under the Obama administration \u2013 began late last year under Trump, and continues. And as another caravan forms this week in Honduras, Ribera draws attention to a further, crucial, matter: resources. Circumstances combine against the running of places like Casa del Migrante; not just the surge in numbers and entrenched US policy, but accession by Mexico\u2019s new president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, to a demand from Trump that asylum seekers must wait in Mexico, not the US, for their cases to be heard. Mexico\u2019s borderland is not yet America\u2019s migrant waiting room, \u201cbut as the number of migrants increases, government help is reduced\u201d, says Ribera. At Christmas, the priest who oversees Casa del Migrante, Padre Javier Calvillo, gave a rare press conference during which he lambasted Mexican federal, state and municipal authorities for failing to provide sufficient funds or manpower to help centres like this cope. \u201cThe municipality had taken 80 migrants from the bridge directly to Casa del Migrante, without any processing,\u201d says Chavarr\u00eda, \u201cand Fr Calvillo said he could take no more. The city opened its own shelter, but it lasted a week.\u201d Ribera says the city has now \u201cassigned six workers due to arrive, and six more to come\u201d. She added: \u201cBut the reality is that we are dependent on the church, and private donations from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, El Paso and Las Cruces [New Mexico]. It\u2019s ironic that while Donald Trump\u2019s policies and wall divide our countries, the support is all binational, from good people on both sides of the border. It\u2019s coraz\u00f3n contra h\u00edgado, as we say in Mexico \u2013 heart against liver.\u201d \u201cThe truth is,\u201d says Chavarr\u00eda, \u201cthat when most of those going across or being deported were Mexicans, there was more interest. The attitude is that these are Central Americans, not our problem. But it is. What will they do if they cannot enter the United States? Our work, either side of the border, is to educate both migrants and our own citizens on the rights they have.\u201d Back at Casa del Migrante, more people arrive at the heavy gates: families from Guatemala like Eder Ram\u00edrez and his daughter, Leti, aged eight; and two women travelling from Panajachel, with two children each, \u201crunning from the gangs\u201d. Had they heard about two other children from their own country who died in US custody just across the river, over Christmas? No. A guard explains the rules: you must surrender your phone at reception and collect it when you leave. No weapons or drugs; no Viagra, only one smoking area. Then they register, grateful for a wide smile on the volunteer\u2019s face. Leti wants a soda from the vending machine, but there\u2019s no cash, and they look in a storage closet for donated used clothes that might fit. Leti chooses a pink Loony Tunes hoodie. I tell Jonathan I hope his friend is grateful for what he did \u2013 or didn\u2019t do. \u201cHe is,\u201d he replies. \u201cHe vanished from the Mara\u2019s sight, and is still alive.\u201d How long can you stay here? \u201cThree days.\u201d How long have you been here? \u201cThree days. I cross tomorrow night.\u201d",

The day-to-day reality of comedians co-habiting is \u201cdisappointingly boring\u201d, insists Nottingham-born Keyworth. (\u201cWe cry a lot, and often we just sit at a table and desperately try to think of something funny to say.\u201d) But being a comedian is a strange and emotionally demanding job. That\u2019s when their relationship seems to really kick in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b611fb6d4cfbade6cd1c09cf5ce6ef8f13e9e435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b611fb6d4cfbade6cd1c09cf5ce6ef8f13e9e435/401_526_1730_1039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Delaney and Sarah Millican.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plenty of material \u2026 Gary Delaney and Sarah Millican.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ellis O\u2019Brien/BBC/Open Mike Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBeing with another comic, at least they understand the isolation of the job,\u201d says Dubliner Bohart. \u201cThey understand that you need to go to Northampton to do a free gig on a Sunday when the other person wants to go to a wedding. It must be much harder for comics who are with a partner who isn\u2019t a comic.\u201d</p> <p>Keyworth agrees. \u201cIf you\u2019re having a meltdown because you can\u2019t get the right ending for your bit about condensation, but you\u2019re dating someone who works in a hospital, they\u2019re going to be like: \u2018Get a grip, there are actually important things happening in the world.\u2019 Whereas we can look at each other and go: \u2018I know this is hard for you. There is definitely something funny about cabbage. We can find it together!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlthough \u2026 who\u2019s going to pay the bills? That\u2019s a question,\u201d adds Bohart. They suggest, semi-jokingly, that a wealthy, asexual husband would be a welcome addition to the Kilburn homestead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55384e488ccff2045b33c2b01a923ee01d4ea842\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55384e488ccff2045b33c2b01a923ee01d4ea842/0_0_3682_5524/667.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Keyworth and Catherine Bohart.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">They like a good spar \u2026 Sarah Keyworth and Catherine Bohart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no shortage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/19/stewart-lee-bridget-christie-comedy-couples-standup-sarah-millican-edinburgh\">standup couples</a>: Stewart Lee and Bridget Christie, Sarah Millican and Gary Delaney, Isy Suttie and Elis James, Bobby Mair and Harriet Kemsley. But not much domestic tittle tattle makes it on to the stage. Millican is a kitchen-sink comic who has plenty of material on \u201cher fella\u201d and their sex life. Christie refers to Lee as her \u201cfictional onstage husband\u201d, casting him as a raging bigot. Then there\u2019s the break-up show: a gory new trend in which ex-couples do extraordinarily revealing shows about each other, ideally about 500 metres from each other at the Edinburgh fringe (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/15/john-robins-review-edinburgh-festival-sara-pascoe\">Sara Pascoe and John Robins</a> were at least pretty civil about it in 2017).</p> <p>But Keyworth, 25, and Bohart, 30, don\u2019t talk much about their relationship on stage. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/27/sarah-keyworth-dark-horse-review-edinburgh-festival-debut\">Keyworth\u2019s Dark Horse, which got her a nomination for best newcomer in Edinburgh</a>, is a quietly powerful show in which she describes her job as a nanny and the loss of confidence she has observed in the girl she looks after. Bohart\u2019s Immaculate is similarly personal: her relationship with her father \u2013 a Catholic deacon \u2013 comes under the spotlight, particularly in relation to her coming out, and she touches on broader issues such as abortion in Ireland and mental health. As a former university debater, she is shaping up to be a comic who\u2019s combative, and eloquent with it.</p> <p>Her dad is yet to see Immaculate, though she is enthusiastic for this to happen (\u201cso long as I didn\u2019t know he was there\u201d), and she did ask his permission before talking about him on stage. Similarly, Keyworth got the green light from the family she nannies for \u2013 in fact they encouraged her to be more open than she was, to keep the real names in the show. Keyworth changed them anyway.</p> <p>Bohart says: \u201cComedy is always complicated when it comes to the people you\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re always going to say, \u2018That\u2019s not exactly true\u2019, because what people say isn\u2019t necessarily \u2026 funny, plus it\u2019s just your perspective and you have to make that clear. It feels quite obnoxious that they don\u2019t have the right to reply. Like my dad, I talk about him a lot and I want to represent him fairly as I can, it\u2019s not supposed to be an attack on him but I also want him to be three-dimensional.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can look at each other and go: there is definitely something funny about cabbage. Let\u2019s find it together!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In person they are not that much different to their stage characters: Bohart is fluent and resolutely rational, Keyworth is economical and deadpan. And they like a good spar: the interview is all but paused while they debate the precise turn of events when they first met outside a comedy show. Bohart says Keyworth was ruthless and unfriendly, Keyworth pleads innocence. What they do agree on is that they flat-out didn\u2019t like each other for the first few months, until the \u201cpassive-aggressive flirting\u201d gave way to the inevitable.</p> <p>Sexuality has been a big influence on both comics\u2019 acts. For Keyworth, it\u2019s part of the reason she became a comic at all. She recalls how she made a conscious effort to become funny at school, to take control of the bullying.</p> <p>\u201cEither I could be this weird little androgynous boy-girl thing,\u201d she says, \u201cor I could be the girl who eats paper and slaps herself in the face. I\u2019d rather be the one making people laugh than being laughed at.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdVZENehMJU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cdVZENehMJU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch Sarah Keyworth and Catherine Bohart on Comedy Central</figcaption> </figure>   <p>For Bohart, it\u2019s more of a stylistic thing. \u201cWhat queerness has given me is I think more empathy and more open-mindedness. I read a lot of things that I wouldn\u2019t have if I\u2019d been straight, about queer identity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/25/truth-about-polyamory-monogamy-open-relationships\">polyamory</a>, trans issues, feminism \u2026 I was looking for a place to understand myself, really. And empathy is a good place for comedy because you can put yourself in other people\u2019s shoes and discern what might be funny or not.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/25/sarah-keyworth-funniest-things\">Sarah Keyworth: \u2018Funniest heckle?

That\u2019s when their relationship seems to really kick in. \u201cBeing with another comic, at least they understand the isolation of the job,\u201d says Dubliner Bohart. \u201cThey understand that you need to go to Northampton to do a free gig on a Sunday when the other person wants to go to a wedding. It must be much harder for comics who are with a partner who isn\u2019t a comic.\u201d Keyworth agrees. \u201cIf you\u2019re having a meltdown because you can\u2019t get the right ending for your bit about condensation, but you\u2019re dating someone who works in a hospital, they\u2019re going to be like: \u2018Get a grip, there are actually important things happening in the world.\u2019 Whereas we can look at each other and go: \u2018I know this is hard for you. There is definitely something funny about cabbage. We can find it together!\u2019\u201d \u201cAlthough \u2026 who\u2019s going to pay the bills? That\u2019s a question,\u201d adds Bohart. They suggest, semi-jokingly, that a wealthy, asexual husband would be a welcome addition to the Kilburn homestead. There\u2019s no shortage of standup couples: Stewart Lee and Bridget Christie, Sarah Millican and Gary Delaney, Isy Suttie and Elis James, Bobby Mair and Harriet Kemsley. But not much domestic tittle tattle makes it on to the stage. Millican is a kitchen-sink comic who has plenty of material on \u201cher fella\u201d and their sex life. Christie refers to Lee as her \u201cfictional onstage husband\u201d, casting him as a raging bigot. Then there\u2019s the break-up show: a gory new trend in which ex-couples do extraordinarily revealing shows about each other, ideally about 500 metres from each other at the Edinburgh fringe (Sara Pascoe and John Robins were at least pretty civil about it in 2017). But Keyworth, 25, and Bohart, 30, don\u2019t talk much about their relationship on stage. Instead, Keyworth\u2019s Dark Horse, which got her a nomination for best newcomer in Edinburgh, is a quietly powerful show in which she describes her job as a nanny and the loss of confidence she has observed in the girl she looks after. Bohart\u2019s Immaculate is similarly personal: her relationship with her father \u2013 a Catholic deacon \u2013 comes under the spotlight, particularly in relation to her coming out, and she touches on broader issues such as abortion in Ireland and mental health. As a former university debater, she is shaping up to be a comic who\u2019s combative, and eloquent with it. Her dad is yet to see Immaculate, though she is enthusiastic for this to happen (\u201cso long as I didn\u2019t know he was there\u201d), and she did ask his permission before talking about him on stage. Similarly, Keyworth got the green light from the family she nannies for \u2013 in fact they encouraged her to be more open than she was, to keep the real names in the show. Keyworth changed them anyway. Bohart says: \u201cComedy is always complicated when it comes to the people you\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re always going to say, \u2018That\u2019s not exactly true\u2019, because what people say isn\u2019t necessarily \u2026 funny, plus it\u2019s just your perspective and you have to make that clear. It feels quite obnoxious that they don\u2019t have the right to reply. Like my dad, I talk about him a lot and I want to represent him fairly as I can, it\u2019s not supposed to be an attack on him but I also want him to be three-dimensional.\u201d In person they are not that much different to their stage characters: Bohart is fluent and resolutely rational, Keyworth is economical and deadpan. And they like a good spar: the interview is all but paused while they debate the precise turn of events when they first met outside a comedy show. Bohart says Keyworth was ruthless and unfriendly, Keyworth pleads innocence. What they do agree on is that they flat-out didn\u2019t like each other for the first few months, until the \u201cpassive-aggressive flirting\u201d gave way to the inevitable. Sexuality has been a big influence on both comics\u2019 acts. For Keyworth, it\u2019s part of the reason she became a comic at all. She recalls how she made a conscious effort to become funny at school, to take control of the bullying. \u201cEither I could be this weird little androgynous boy-girl thing,\u201d she says, \u201cor I could be the girl who eats paper and slaps herself in the face. I\u2019d rather be the one making people laugh than being laughed at.\u201d For Bohart, it\u2019s more of a stylistic thing. \u201cWhat queerness has given me is I think more empathy and more open-mindedness. I read a lot of things that I wouldn\u2019t have if I\u2019d been straight, about queer identity, polyamory, trans issues, feminism \u2026 I was looking for a place to understand myself, really. And empathy is a good place for comedy because you can put yourself in other people\u2019s shoes and discern what might be funny or not.\u201d So can we expect any relationship material to appear in the future? The answer is a slightly squeamish yes. \u201cIf there was something that made one of us uncomfortable we could discuss it,\u201d explains Keyworth. \u201cBut we know how hard it is to write anything.\u201d So if one does a routine about the other one and it\u2019s working: \u201cWe\u2019ll just laugh along,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd cry alone later.\u201d \u2022 Sarah Keyworth: Dark Horse is at Soho theatre, London, 28 January-2 February. Catherine Bohart: Immaculate is at the same venue, 25 February-2 March.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>THE LAST GOODBYE</strong></h2> \n<p>Last Saturday, just three days ago, Emiliano Sala agreed to join Cardiff City. His \u00a315m transfer from Nantes generated much excitement: the 28-year-old striker from Argentina had scored 12 goals in 16 matches this season in France, a record bettered only by Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 and PSG\u2019s front three, and would become the Bluebirds\u2019 record signing. Nantes waved off a much-loved talent with their blessing. \u201cThe management and the whole of FC Nantes thank warmly Emiliano Sala, and wish him much success for the rest of his career,\u201d read one official tweet. \u201cForever yellow and green,\u201d promised another. Then on Monday he bade farewell to his former team-mates, posting a snap of himself on social media, arms around old buddies, warmth radiating from the screen. Alongside yellow and green hearts read one simple message: \u201cLa ultima ciao.\u201d The last goodbye.</p> \n<p>That post is now unspeakably poignant. On Monday night, a small private Piper Malibu plane flying from Nantes to Cardiff disappeared near the Casquets lighthouse off Alderney in the Channel Islands. The French civil aviation authority have confirmed that Sala <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/22/cardiff-city-emiliano-sala-missing-plane-channel\">was one of two people on board</a>. Guernsey Coastguard received an alert at 8.23pm GMT, and a search-and-rescue operation was carried out until 2am, when \u201cchallenging\u201d conditions \u2013 six-foot waves and heavy rain \u2013 forced a halt. The search resumed at 8am. Five planes and two lifeboats have pored over 1,000 square miles but there has been no trace of the missing aircraft.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe expected Emiliano to arrive last night into Cardiff and today was due to be his first day with the team,\u201d said Cardiff\u2019s CEO Ken Choo. \u201cWe made the decision first thing to call off training with the thoughts of the squad, management staff and the entire club with Emiliano and the pilot. We continue to pray for positive news.\u201d A vigil for Sala is planned in the town square of Nantes on Tuesday night, with the club postponing Wednesday\u2019s Coupe de France tie at L\u2019Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien. Meanwhile another of Sala\u2019s former employers, Chamois Niortais, sent out a heartbreaking plea: \u201cTell us it\u2019s a joke, Emi.\u201d The search for the plane continues at the time of writing, and all hope is not yet lost, although with visibility deteriorating and the water extremely cold, the authorities have said they fear the worst.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a7446cee-0583-4790-bf05-0e3f03561e26\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oul3LYKywWE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>RECOMMENDED LISTENING</h2> \n<p>Here\u2019s the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/jan/21/seething-sarri-liverpool-win-again-and-a-slide-tackling-fan-football-weekly-podcast\">Football Weekly podcast</a>.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cI love Norwich \u2026 next to me is a Morrisons which is good so I can buy my food.

It was my second spring since arrival and I\u2019d slipped into a back pew for morning Mass on Easter Sunday. I enjoyed the prayers and choir, content to just be a tall stranger, albeit one who was long-haired and bearded which didn\u2019t quite blend with the local style. Well, at the end, as we were all shuffling out, I felt a tugging on my coat\u2019s sleeve. I looked down and a little girl looked up, to whom I asked: \u2018Hello. Can I help you?\u2019 She nodded her head and I smiled, saying: \u2018Em, are you Jesus?\u2019 How to handle this? \u2018Ah no lass, I\u2019m not the Lord.\u2019 Her face was at crest before fallen, but I continued in baritone whisper. \u2018You have seen through my disguise, though. You see\u2019 \u2026 I looked around conspiratorially \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m The Doctor.

      "bodyText": "THE LAST GOODBYE Last Saturday, just three days ago, Emiliano Sala agreed to join Cardiff City. His \u00a315m transfer from Nantes generated much excitement: the 28-year-old striker from Argentina had scored 12 goals in 16 matches this season in France, a record bettered only by Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 and PSG\u2019s front three, and would become the Bluebirds\u2019 record signing. Nantes waved off a much-loved talent with their blessing. \u201cThe management and the whole of FC Nantes thank warmly Emiliano Sala, and wish him much success for the rest of his career,\u201d read one official tweet. \u201cForever yellow and green,\u201d promised another. Then on Monday he bade farewell to his former team-mates, posting a snap of himself on social media, arms around old buddies, warmth radiating from the screen. Alongside yellow and green hearts read one simple message: \u201cLa ultima ciao.\u201d The last goodbye. That post is now unspeakably poignant. On Monday night, a small private Piper Malibu plane flying from Nantes to Cardiff disappeared near the Casquets lighthouse off Alderney in the Channel Islands. The French civil aviation authority have confirmed that Sala was one of two people on board. Guernsey Coastguard received an alert at 8.23pm GMT, and a search-and-rescue operation was carried out until 2am, when \u201cchallenging\u201d conditions \u2013 six-foot waves and heavy rain \u2013 forced a halt. The search resumed at 8am. Five planes and two lifeboats have pored over 1,000 square miles but there has been no trace of the missing aircraft. \u201cWe expected Emiliano to arrive last night into Cardiff and today was due to be his first day with the team,\u201d said Cardiff\u2019s CEO Ken Choo. \u201cWe made the decision first thing to call off training with the thoughts of the squad, management staff and the entire club with Emiliano and the pilot. We continue to pray for positive news.\u201d A vigil for Sala is planned in the town square of Nantes on Tuesday night, with the club postponing Wednesday\u2019s Coupe de France tie at L\u2019Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien. Meanwhile another of Sala\u2019s former employers, Chamois Niortais, sent out a heartbreaking plea: \u201cTell us it\u2019s a joke, Emi.\u201d The search for the plane continues at the time of writing, and all hope is not yet lost, although with visibility deteriorating and the water extremely cold, the authorities have said they fear the worst. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Here\u2019s the latest Football Weekly podcast. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI love Norwich \u2026 next to me is a Morrisons which is good so I can buy my food. And also I\u2019d never seen an Argos before in my life. I walked inside and saw the catalogue with things you can order. You can order bikes, TVs \u2026 Argos has everything and I\u2019ve never seen this in my life before. When I need something, I buy it from Argos! I live in a perfect area. There\u2019s H&amp;M, Costa and Boots nearby. It\u2019s great\u201d \u2013 the wide-eyed and resolutely unpretentious retail habits of Norwich City\u2019s Onel Hern\u00e1ndez. Imagine what he\u2019d have made of Woolies. FIVER LETTERS \u201cReading about Martin of Wakefield (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs) \u2013 a fine knight\u2019s title if ever I\u2019ve seen one \u2013 being mistaken for the new Huddersfield manager reminds me of the most charming moment I have experienced since I emigrated from Canada to Ireland. It was my second spring since arrival and I\u2019d slipped into a back pew for morning Mass on Easter Sunday. I enjoyed the prayers and choir, content to just be a tall stranger, albeit one who was long-haired and bearded which didn\u2019t quite blend with the local style. Well, at the end, as we were all shuffling out, I felt a tugging on my coat\u2019s sleeve. I looked down and a little girl looked up, to whom I asked: \u2018Hello. Can I help you?\u2019 She nodded her head and I smiled, saying: \u2018Em, are you Jesus?\u2019 How to handle this? \u2018Ah no lass, I\u2019m not the Lord.\u2019 Her face was at crest before fallen, but I continued in baritone whisper. \u2018You have seen through my disguise, though. You see\u2019 \u2026 I looked around conspiratorially \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m The Doctor. Shhh.\u2019 Smiles, a wink to the parents and I was gone\u201d \u2013 Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI think you got your linguistic knickers slightly in a twist yesterday when you wrote \u2018all of the decorum and coup de grace of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s attritional public dressing-room wars\u2019. While I know Jos\u00e9 is renowned for his decorum and just the slightest hint of attrition \u2013 not to mention dressing-room wars \u2013 I cannot recall him ever being so kind as to apply a merciful touch to finish off his opponents in a gracious way: he usually favours grinding his heel in until it really hurts\u201d \u2013 Chris Weaver.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Former youth football coach Kit Carson, whose car crashed into a tree on the day he was due to go on trial over historical sexual abuse charges, died of a traumatic brain injury, an inquest has heard. Millwall are close to agreeing a deal with the local council that would mean the club can stay at The Den free from the threat of their stadium being demolished. Cristiano Ronaldo has admitted committing tax-knack fraud while playing for Real Madrid and agreed to pay a \u00a316.5m fine in return for a 23-month suspended sentence in the Big House. FA suits have slapped West Ham with a \u00a3100,000 fine for their fans\u2019 pwopah nawty behaviour against Burnley last season that involved one airing The Full Souness. Arsenal\u2019s H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn has been ruled out for six to nine months after suffering anterior cruciate ligament-knack. Istanbul Basaksehi have announced the signing of Demba Ba on loan from Shanghai Shenhua in a Godfather-themed \u201creveal\u201d video before getting the striker to pose in a rubber owl mask, obviously. And Bolton boss Phil Parkinson isn\u2019t too chuffed at fans lobbing tennis balls on the pitch in protest against owner Ken Anderson. \u201cThey have done what they wanted to do. Now it is up to the supporters to get behind the team and help us in our quest to stay in the league,\u201d he roared after a 2-0 home defeat to West Brom. STILL WANT MORE? \u201cPace and power\u201d \u2013 the words that highlight why we need to rethink how we cover BAME footballers, writes Sachin Nakrani. How the flip did Kevin-Prince Boateng sign for Bar\u00e7a? Sid Lowe knows. More unlikely transfers, courtesy of Ed Aarons. \u201cOrlando Pride are mesmerising.

Real libraries pay the publisher and author for the right to lend ebooks. In addition, in the UK, authors also receive a Public Lending Right payment of 8.52p per loan,\u201d said the Girl With a Pearl Earring novelist. \u201cThe Open Library does none of that \u2013 it has scanned physical copies of books without paying anyone for the privilege. So the creators of books are not getting paid for their work. And if we don\u2019t get paid, eventually we\u2019ll have to look for other ways to make a living. Many authors are already struggling to get by; this is making things even worse.\u201d</p> <p>Pointing out that British \u201cauthors\u2019 earnings are in decline and many are struggling financially\u201d, the SoA said that the Open Library\u2019s actions have \u201cthe potential to destroy the ebook market and make it even harder for authors to make a living from their work\u201d, as well as competing with \u201cbona fide\u201d UK libraries.</p> <p>The SoA said that if it did not receive assurances from the Internet Archive by 1 February, it would immediately take measures to ensure that Open Library books could not be downloaded in the UK. If the library did not stop scanning books by UK authors without permission, the society would \u201chave to consider legal action on behalf of our members to prevent this practice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf that becomes necessary we shall be seeking damages for copyright infringement and payment of all legal costs,\u201d said the SoA, which follows the American author organisation, the Authors Guild, in <a href=\"https://www.authorsguild.org/industry-advocacy/controlled-digital-lending-is-neither-controlled-nor-legal/\">attacking the Open Library</a>.</p> <p>The Internet Archive said its practices appeared to have been misunderstood. \u201cAs a library, we work with authors, publishers, and booksellers to buy and lend books in responsible and controlled ways,\u201d said the spokesperson, highlighting the fact that the Internet Archive is a signatory to the <a href=\"https://controlleddigitallending.org/signatories\">position statement on controlled digital lending by libraries.</a> The statement argues that, thanks to the fair-use doctrine, a library can digitise and lend a title to its members, provided it loans only the number of copies it owned before digitisation (so if a hard copy of the book is checked out, the digital copy cannot be borrowed, and vice versa).</p> <p>The position is <a href=\"https://www.authorsalliance.org/2018/09/28/authors-alliance-supports-controlled-digital-lending-by-libraries/\">supported by the Authors Alliance</a>, which describes it as \u201ca good-faith interpretation of copyright law for libraries considering digitising works in their collections and circulating the digitised title in place of a physical one\u201d, but rejected by the Authors Guild, which calls it \u201c<a href=\"https://www.authorsguild.org/industry-advocacy/controlled-digital-lending-is-neither-controlled-nor-legal/\">neither controlled nor legal</a>\u201d, and by the SoA, which says that \u201cthis practice is definitely unlawful in the UK, where the fair use exception does not exist\u201d.</p>",

Many authors are already struggling to get by; this is making things even worse.\u201d Pointing out that British \u201cauthors\u2019 earnings are in decline and many are struggling financially\u201d, the SoA said that the Open Library\u2019s actions have \u201cthe potential to destroy the ebook market and make it even harder for authors to make a living from their work\u201d, as well as competing with \u201cbona fide\u201d UK libraries. The SoA said that if it did not receive assurances from the Internet Archive by 1 February, it would immediately take measures to ensure that Open Library books could not be downloaded in the UK. If the library did not stop scanning books by UK authors without permission, the society would \u201chave to consider legal action on behalf of our members to prevent this practice\u201d. \u201cIf that becomes necessary we shall be seeking damages for copyright infringement and payment of all legal costs,\u201d said the SoA, which follows the American author organisation, the Authors Guild, in attacking the Open Library. The Internet Archive said its practices appeared to have been misunderstood. \u201cAs a library, we work with authors, publishers, and booksellers to buy and lend books in responsible and controlled ways,\u201d said the spokesperson, highlighting the fact that the Internet Archive is a signatory to the position statement on controlled digital lending by libraries. The statement argues that, thanks to the fair-use doctrine, a library can digitise and lend a title to its members, provided it loans only the number of copies it owned before digitisation (so if a hard copy of the book is checked out, the digital copy cannot be borrowed, and vice versa). The position is supported by the Authors Alliance, which describes it as \u201ca good-faith interpretation of copyright law for libraries considering digitising works in their collections and circulating the digitised title in place of a physical one\u201d, but rejected by the Authors Guild, which calls it \u201cneither controlled nor legal\u201d, and by the SoA, which says that \u201cthis practice is definitely unlawful in the UK, where the fair use exception does not exist\u201d.",

It is broadcast live on ABC in the US, on Sky in the UK, and on Channel Nine in Australia. The red carpet portion of the show is broadcast live by the E! network.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who decides on the Oscars?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscars are voted for by members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (aka Ampas), which currently numbers just under 8,000 voting members, divided into 17 separate branches, including actors, directors, costume designers, etc. (To join, names have to be proposed and approved by individual branches.) The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived white/male/elderly bias of its voters \u2013 and a drive to create a more diverse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many Oscars are there and how does a film get nominated?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are 24 categories \u2013 ranging from best picture to best sound mixing \u2013 presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg's PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).</p>\n    <p>Each of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries \u2013 first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination \u2013 which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do Oscar winners win?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscar statuette isn't solid gold:&nbsp;it's gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn't own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won't sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Just behind with seven nods, Marvel makes its Academy Awards debut with the highly entertaining Afro-futurist extravaganza <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\">Black Panther</a>: an entirely justified nomination for an excellent film which has demonstrated extraordinary popularity and resounding box-office clout.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s five for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/16/green-book-the-true-story-behind-the-oscar-buzzed-road-trip-drama\">Green Book</a>, the true-ish story of African-American pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) being ferried around in the 60s by a \u201cgoombah\u201d Italian-American white driver (Viggo Mortensen). The liberal white/black balance narrative has not found universal favour, Don Shirley\u2019s surviving relatives have complained about inaccuracies contrived, evidently, in the services of this fifty-fifty approach, and nominee Ali was reported to have remarked: \u201cI did the best I could with the material I had\u201d \u2014 which has to be the most self-deprecating personal publicity campaign in the history of the Academy awards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"383e2f449488006c8b843cf537dd3e6068d66dbf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/383e2f449488006c8b843cf537dd3e6068d66dbf/0_90_3075_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gwilym Lee, left, Rami Malek and Joe Mazzello in Bohemian Rhapsody.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gwilym Lee, left, Rami Malek and Joe Mazzello in Bohemian Rhapsody.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Bailey/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hilariously, the Freddie Mercury feelgood biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2018/nov/05/bohemian-rhapsodys-runaway-success-confirms-it-2018-is-the-year-of-the-critic-proof-movie\">Bohemian Rhapsody</a> continues on its triumphal progress with five nods, including one for its undeniably impressive turn from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/14/rami-malek-being-offered-the-part-of-freddie-mercury-was-a-gun-to-the-head-moment-\">Rami Malek</a> \u2013 and very much none for its disgraced credited director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/07/bryan-singer-bohemian-rhapsody-golden-globes-instagram-thank-you\">Bryan Singer</a>, who unrepentantly posted a \u201cthank you\u201d message on Instagram after its Golden Globes success in which he, again, did not personally participate. There is an excellent chance of Bohemian Rhapsody converting some of these nominations into wins and indeed of Singer embarrassing the industry again with another pointed thankbrag on social media.</p> \n<p>And what of the wunderkind Damien Chazelle? His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/29/first-man-review-ryan-gosling-shoots-for-the-moon-in-neil-armstrong-biopic\">First Man</a>, a very stirring, if conservative account of Neil Armstrong and the moon landing, starring Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy, has picked up four nominations, but is not predicted to trouble the scorer much, or at all, on the night. There\u2019s no doubt about it: First Man somehow hasn\u2019t got the momentum. Can this really be because of a dirty-tricks social media campaign to signal-boost Republican complaints about Chazelle failing to show the American flag being planted on the moon? Stranger things have happened.</p> \n<p>The best actor race is anyone\u2019s guess. Almost any of the contenders could win: and it could even be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/19/willem-dafoe-at-eternitys-gate-vincent-van-gogh\">Willem Dafoe</a>\u2019s year for his straightforwardly earnest portrayal of Vincent Van Gogh in Julian Schnabel\u2019s At Eternity\u2019s Gate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/08/satan-christian-bale-dick-cheney-golden-globes\">Christian Bale</a> could pinch it for his Dick Cheney, perhaps because the Hollywood establishment is nostalgically/masochistically yearning for a rightwing Republican bad guy of the pre-Trump old school. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/03/why-bradley-cooper-is-the-real-star-of-a-star-is-born\">Bradley Cooper</a> is great in A Star Is Born.

But every one of the other nominees (including Colman, Roma\u2019s Yalitza Aparicio, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga\">Lady Gaga</a> in A Star Is Born and most interestingly the outstanding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-mccarthy\">Melissa McCarthy</a> in Can You Ever Forgive Me?) is entirely plausible.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, the director\u2019s list is interesting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2018/aug/23/spike-lee-talks-to-gary-younge-about-blackkklansman-video\">Spike Lee</a> actually makes his debut as a director for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/26/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-blistering-return-to-form\">BlacKkKlansman</a> (his 1990 nomination for Do the Right Thing was as a screenwriter).

It is, however, disappointing that Tim Wardle\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/28/three-identical-strangers-the-bizarre-tale-of-triplets-separated-at-birth\">Three Identical Strangers</a> didn\u2019t make it on to this list, or indeed Peter Jackson\u2019s marvellous first world war film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/16/they-shall-not-grow-old-review-first-world-war-peter-jackson\">They Shall Not Grow Old</a>.

This also has 10 nominations, including of course a best actress nomination for Olivia Colman, who this year has become (justly) catapulted to international treasure status. (An upgrade from national to international treasure status might also be due for Richard E Grant, who has a best supporting actor nomination for his venal Brit boozehound in Can You Ever Forgive Me?) These are the prestige products, the blue-chip movies that the Academy hivemind has decided are the headline successes. As for the snubs, complaining about these has evolved to such an extent in recent years that they have become the pundits\u2019 alternative refusenik fantasy league. But the lack of women directors in the best picture and best director lists is woeful, at least partly because they exclude one of the very best films: Debra Granik\u2019s superb Leave No Trace.

Barry Jenkins\u2019s fine If Beale Street Could Talk has been largely overlooked, although I am confident that Regina King will win best supporting actress for her delicate, intelligently judged performance in that movie. Nicole Kidman deserved a shot at an Oscar for her very interesting performance in Destroyer, and Steve McQueen\u2019s terrific thriller Widows is turning into this awards season\u2019s Cinderella, bafflingly excluded from ball after ball. The biggest and most deplorable snub was however that Ari Aster\u2019s brilliant scary movie Hereditary received nothing: with a lead performance from the wonderful Toni Collette which could go toe-to-toe with any of the current contenders. Bubbling under the big two are the more middleweight/commercial contenders: eight nominations for Adam McKay\u2019s flashy satire Vice, with its entertaining latexed turn from Christian Bale as Bush-era vice-president Dick Cheney. Eight nominations also for Bradley Cooper\u2019s terrific new sugar-rush version of A Star Is Born, which I continue to think is one of the very best films of the year, despite some medium-sized reservations raised elsewhere; more of a sidelash than a backlash.

The liberal white/black balance narrative has not found universal favour, Don Shirley\u2019s surviving relatives have complained about inaccuracies contrived, evidently, in the services of this fifty-fifty approach, and nominee Ali was reported to have remarked: \u201cI did the best I could with the material I had\u201d \u2014 which has to be the most self-deprecating personal publicity campaign in the history of the Academy awards. Hilariously, the Freddie Mercury feelgood biopic Bohemian Rhapsody continues on its triumphal progress with five nods, including one for its undeniably impressive turn from Rami Malek \u2013 and very much none for its disgraced credited director Bryan Singer, who unrepentantly posted a \u201cthank you\u201d message on Instagram after its Golden Globes success in which he, again, did not personally participate. There is an excellent chance of Bohemian Rhapsody converting some of these nominations into wins and indeed of Singer embarrassing the industry again with another pointed thankbrag on social media. And what of the wunderkind Damien Chazelle? His First Man, a very stirring, if conservative account of Neil Armstrong and the moon landing, starring Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy, has picked up four nominations, but is not predicted to trouble the scorer much, or at all, on the night. There\u2019s no doubt about it: First Man somehow hasn\u2019t got the momentum. Can this really be because of a dirty-tricks social media campaign to signal-boost Republican complaints about Chazelle failing to show the American flag being planted on the moon? Stranger things have happened. The best actor race is anyone\u2019s guess. Almost any of the contenders could win: and it could even be Willem Dafoe\u2019s year for his straightforwardly earnest portrayal of Vincent Van Gogh in Julian Schnabel\u2019s At Eternity\u2019s Gate. Christian Bale could pinch it for his Dick Cheney, perhaps because the Hollywood establishment is nostalgically/masochistically yearning for a rightwing Republican bad guy of the pre-Trump old school. Bradley Cooper is great in A Star Is Born. Only snobs deny it. As for lead actress, this has to be Glenn Close\u2019s year. Her performance, in The Wife, as the enigmatically reserved wife of the conceited Saul Bellow-style Nobel laureate novelist is a high-IQ treat. But every one of the other nominees (including Colman, Roma\u2019s Yalitza Aparicio, Lady Gaga in A Star Is Born and most interestingly the outstanding Melissa McCarthy in Can You Ever Forgive Me?) is entirely plausible. Elsewhere, the director\u2019s list is interesting. Spike Lee actually makes his debut as a director for BlacKkKlansman (his 1990 nomination for Do the Right Thing was as a screenwriter). Lee is an extremely popular nominee and he could well win this category, despite the heavy-hitter competition from Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski, Cuar\u00f3n, McKay and Lanthimos. The nearest thing to a shoo-in of this Oscar season, apart from Regina King, has to be Free Solo in the documentary list, a gasp-inducing study of Alex Honnold who climbs terrifyingly high rock faces without a rope. It is, however, disappointing that Tim Wardle\u2019s Three Identical Strangers didn\u2019t make it on to this list, or indeed Peter Jackson\u2019s marvellous first world war film They Shall Not Grow Old. Also, many will have been hoping that Joe Pearlman and David Soutar\u2019s Bros: After the Screaming Stops might have got a nomination. If that had won, the Goss brothers could have got up on the Oscar stage and sentimentally demonstrated their boyhood \u201cdart-throwing\u201d game. The other clear shoo-in is Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse for animation \u2014 a film which is witty, freaky and mind-bending and probably the best superhero film of all time. An intriguing, and wide-open Oscar race.",

This can only be seen as a vote of no confidence in the idea of Brexit Britain.\u201d</p> <p>The company said the decision to move to Singapore was not made for tax reasons. The corporate tax rate in Singapore is 17%, compared with 19% in the UK.</p> <p>There is no capital gains or inheritance tax in Singapore. In the UK inheritance tax is charged at 40% on anything above \u00a3450,000.</p> <p>Rowan said Dyson would \u201ccontinue to pay tax in the UK\u201d. Weybourne Group, through which Sir James holds his business interests including Dyson plc, paid \u00a3185m of tax in 2017, according to accounts filed at Companies House.</p> <p>Dyson, which reported record annual profits of \u00a31.1bn for 2018 on Tuesday, has already shifted the vast majority of its production to Singapore, and has announced plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/23/dyson-to-build-electric-cars-in-singapore-with-launch-planned-for-2021\">to build a new electric vehicle plant</a> in the city state. The factory is scheduled for completion in 2020 and is part of a \u00a32.5bn investment in new technology.</p> <p>The company said some of the investment money would be spent in the<br>UK, where it employs 4,500 people and has a research and development<br>campus. Dyson employs a total of 12,000 people worldwide. Relocating<br>the HQ will not lead to job cuts in the UK, the firm insisted.</p> <p>Dyson\u2019s announcement comes shortly after Singapore and the EU agreed a landmark free trade agreement. Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said the deal, signed in October, was: \u201can ambitious trade deal, it is a high-quality arrangement, and it is one which will fly the flag and encourage others, I hope, to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>Sir James has previously urged ministers to walk away from talks with the EU without a deal \u2013 he has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2017/nov/19/brexit-vacuum-cleaner-james-dyson\" title=\"\">\u201cthey\u2019ll come to us\u201d</a>, arguing that European firms would want to sell their goods in Britain rather than lose market access.</p> <p>He is not the first Brexit-backing billionaire to pull back from the UK since the Brexit vote. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the UK\u2019s richest person with a \u00a321bn fortune, was revealed last year to be planning to leave <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2018/aug/09/britains-richest-man-to-leave-uk-for-tax-free-monaco\">Britain for tax-free Monaco</a>.</p> <p>The plans for Ratcliffe, the founder and chief executive of petrochemicals company Ineos, to leave the UK came just months after he was knighted by the Queen for services to business and investment.</p>",

Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour shadow business secretary, said: \u201cFor too long this government has allowed a culture of short termism to work its way into some of our greatest British businesses, whilst those businesses doing the right thing and investing in their communities and workforce for the long term are left wanting, with little government support.\u201d Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said: \u2018This is staggering hypocrisy for Brexit-backing businessman James Dyson. It is utterly unbelievable that the business face of Brexit is moving yet another part of his business out of the UK. \u201cJames Dyson can say whatever he wants but he is ditching Britain. This can only be seen as a vote of no confidence in the idea of Brexit Britain.\u201d The company said the decision to move to Singapore was not made for tax reasons. The corporate tax rate in Singapore is 17%, compared with 19% in the UK. There is no capital gains or inheritance tax in Singapore. In the UK inheritance tax is charged at 40% on anything above \u00a3450,000. Rowan said Dyson would \u201ccontinue to pay tax in the UK\u201d. Weybourne Group, through which Sir James holds his business interests including Dyson plc, paid \u00a3185m of tax in 2017, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Dyson, which reported record annual profits of \u00a31.1bn for 2018 on Tuesday, has already shifted the vast majority of its production to Singapore, and has announced plans to build a new electric vehicle plant in the city state. The factory is scheduled for completion in 2020 and is part of a \u00a32.5bn investment in new technology. The company said some of the investment money would be spent in the UK, where it employs 4,500 people and has a research and development campus. Dyson employs a total of 12,000 people worldwide. Relocating the HQ will not lead to job cuts in the UK, the firm insisted. Dyson\u2019s announcement comes shortly after Singapore and the EU agreed a landmark free trade agreement. Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said the deal, signed in October, was: \u201can ambitious trade deal, it is a high-quality arrangement, and it is one which will fly the flag and encourage others, I hope, to do the same.\u201d Sir James has previously urged ministers to walk away from talks with the EU without a deal \u2013 he has said \u201cthey\u2019ll come to us\u201d, arguing that European firms would want to sell their goods in Britain rather than lose market access. He is not the first Brexit-backing billionaire to pull back from the UK since the Brexit vote. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the UK\u2019s richest person with a \u00a321bn fortune, was revealed last year to be planning to leave Britain for tax-free Monaco. The plans for Ratcliffe, the founder and chief executive of petrochemicals company Ineos, to leave the UK came just months after he was knighted by the Queen for services to business and investment.",

The brutal crackdown followed protests last week against the doubling of the fuel price, which led to rioting and sporadic looting. The military and police appear to have targeted officials and supporters of mainstream opposition parties, as well as union officials and high-profile civil society activists, rather than alleged thieves. At least 12 people were killed and 78 treated for gunshot wounds, according to the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, which recorded more than 240 incidents of assault and torture. About 700 people have been arrested and remain in custody, including five opposition MPs. On Tuesday, the government-appointed Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission issued a highly critical report, saying at least eight people had been killed and soldiers and police had instigated \u201csystematic torture\u201d. The commission said armed soldiers and police had visited many homes at night to give \u201cindiscriminate beatings\u201d to men and boys as young as 11. \u201cTorture was perpetrated through beating the men with baton sticks on their backs while they lay on the ground,\u201d it said, adding that attack dogs were used and victims were often too scared to seek medical attention. The violence was the most extensive since the 37-year authoritarian rule of Robert Mugabe ended in November 2017 with a military takeover, and has dashed any hopes for political reform. Mnangagwa returned to Harare on Monday night, curtailing a visit to Europe and central Asia to drum up investment. Human rights organisations said raids were continuing in the early hours of Tuesday, though internet and social media sites appeared to be partially returning to normal after being shut down by authorities for several days. There was also more traffic in the centre of major cities, but a significant number of soldiers remained on the streets. Mnangagwa, who won a contested election in July, said insubordination among security forces was intolerable and \u201cif required, heads will roll\u201d. \u201cViolence or misconduct by our security forces is unacceptable and a betrayal of the new Zimbabwe,\u201d the president said in a statement released on social media. \u201cChaos and insubordination will not be tolerated. Misconduct will be investigated.\u201d He also criticised the protests last week. \u201cEveryone has the right to protest, but this was not a peaceful protest. Wanton violence and cynical destruction, looting police stations, stealing guns and uniforms, incitement and threats of violence. This is not the Zimbabwean way,\u201d said Mnangagwa, a ruling Zanu-PF party stalwart who has been advised on his communications by a team of international consultants. Opposition officials were unimpressed by the president\u2019s offer of dialogue, which they called a \u201cgimmick to buy time\u201d. \u201cMnangagwa\u2019s overtures are always on Twitter. He knows where we are, yet he has chosen not to talk to us directly,\u201d said Jacob Mafume, a spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Nelson Chamisa, the leader of the MDC, said his attempts at dialogue had been \u201cspurned and mocked\u201d and people must be free to talk without fear. Mnangagwa also defended the raising of the fuel price, saying it was \u201cnot a decision we took lightly. But it was the right thing to do.\u201d Fuel in Zimbabwe is heavily subsidised and officials have said the money saved by the increase will be redirected to buying essential commodities. The protests were stoked by chronic daily shortages of banknotes, fuel, food and medicine. Mugabe\u2019s rule left Zimbabwe with vast debt, crumbling infrastructure and soaring unemployment, especially among young people. Most of its 16 million people live hand-to-mouth, or survive on remittances from the extensive diaspora. Inflation is at 40%. Mnangagwa had visited Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan before cutting short his trip, which had included attending the Davos summit of world leaders this week. After Mugabe\u2019s rule ended, there had been widespread optimism that the repression of previous decades was over. The crisis has attracted fierce criticism from western states and will undermine Zimbabwe\u2019s efforts to rejoin the international community. The US, the UK, the EU and the UN human rights office criticised the government\u2019s reaction to the unrest. The army and police denied any wrongdoing, saying some of those who raided homes and beat people were impostors wearing stolen uniforms. Analysts are divided over whether the crisis provides further evidence of splits within Zanu-PF and the government\u2019s highest officials. The vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, a hardline former army general, was in charge while Mnangagwa was away. He was blamed for deploying soldiers who shot six civilians in Harare two days after the election last year. Some observers believe Chiwenga is impatient with the more moderate line taken by Mnangagwa, who they say is keen to win international legitimacy.

      "body": "<p>Pebbles from a nearby riverbed form a chunky cobbled floor in the entrance to the new <a href=\"http://www.muzeumsusch.ch/e/\">Muzeum Susch</a> in Switzerland, as if a tributary once flowed through the building. Maybe it still does. The sound of dripping water can be heard coming from the end of a corridor, where a shiny trickle snakes down a bare rock face. There are other strange things going on. Peer through one opening and you find a gnarled column of earth plunging down into the basement, as if it\u2019s the remains of an archaeological dig. Another passage is encrusted with viscous white goo, forming stringy stalactites that lead to a curious cave downstairs.</p> <p>In this beguiling new gallery in the Engadin valley, it is hard to tell where nature ends and artifice begins. It is located on the site of a 12th-century monastery, in a rambling complex of buildings that formerly housed a vicarage, hospice and brewery, and the young architects <a href=\"http://schmidlinarchitekten.ch/\">Chasper Schmidlin</a> and <a href=\"https://luvo.ch/\">Lukas Voellmy</a> have concocted a magical place where the historic fabric, contemporary art and the raw geology of the landscape collide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b001044a74a8e065bd665c22038e4d7b4ce0f59e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b001044a74a8e065bd665c22038e4d7b4ce0f59e/0_80_2835_3544/800.jpg\" alt=\"Voellmy Schmidlin Architektur turned a disused monastery into a gallery.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hard to tell where nature ends and artifice begins \u2026 Muzeum Susch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Studio Stefano Graziani/courtesy Muzeum Susch and Art Stations Foundation CH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The project is the brainchild of <a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/top200/grazyna-kulczyk/\">Gra\u017cyna Kulczyk</a>, former wife of the late billionaire industrialist <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/jan-kulczyk/\">Jan Kulczyk</a>, and one of Poland\u2019s richest women. A 68-year-old with a platinum-blond bob and a fondness for skin-tight leather, Kulczyk has been collecting art since she was a law student in the 1970s. <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/polish-collector-grazyna-kulczyk-unveils-off-grid-private-museum-in-swiss-alps\">She has amassed an impressive haul</a>, predominantly focused on female artists, which she describes as a \u201cmatrilineage through global art history\u201d.</p> <p>In 2004, Kulczyk established an arts and retail complex <a href=\"https://starybrowar5050.com/en/\">in a former brewery</a> in her hometown of Pozna\u0144, but sold it in 2015 to concentrate on this Swiss outpost, after plans for a base in Warsaw fell through. The resulting combination of deep-pocketed patronage and Swiss precision is one of the most exquisitely crafted private museums realised in recent years.</p> <p>From the outside, you might be hard-pressed to differentiate the building from any other white-rendered house in Susch. But step inside and the place unfolds as a Tardis-like warren of rooms, leading you from vaulted basements to airy timber lofts and galleries excavated from the mountainside \u2013 a process that saw 9,000 tonnes of rock blasted out. It is alpine chalet, primitive grotto and Bond villain\u2019s lair in one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c15339354026e937781d656a6ccdd080481629e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c15339354026e937781d656a6ccdd080481629e2/0_156_2835_3297/860.jpg\" alt=\"The outside of the museum, built on the site of an old monastery\" width=\"860\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The outside of the museum, built on the site of an old monastery</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: (c) Studio Stefano Graziani, courtesy Muzeum Susch, Art Stations Foundation CH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sleepy village of Susch might seem like an unlikely place to find such an institution. It\u2019s a tiny hamlet with a population of around 200, whose other main feature is a clinic for people suffering from <a href=\"https://www.clinica-holistica.ch/\">burnout syndrome</a>. But, just a short drive from the gilded playgrounds of St Moritz and Davos, the site isn\u2019t quite as odd as it seems. The museum joins <a href=\"https://thespaces.com/high-culture-a-guide-to-art-in-the-alps/\">a growing gallery scene</a> that has mushroomed over the last few years to service the area\u2019s wealthy cultured visitors, in search of more than the usual apr\u00e8s ski. There are now more than 30 galleries in the Engadin, <a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2018/09/17/mountains-hauser-wirth-will-open-gallery-st-mortiz-switzerland/\">with Hauser &amp; Wirth joining the party last year</a>.</p> <p>To make it stand out from the commercial galleries, Kulczyk says she has conceived the museum as more of a \u201claboratory\u201d, where a series of permanent site-specific installations by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/19/adrian-villar-rojas-studio\">Adri\u00e1n Villar Rojas</a> (the stratified column) and <a href=\"http://www.muzeumsusch.ch/e/muzeum-susch-sara-masueger.html\">Sara Mas\u00fcger</a> (the gooey cave) will complement a programme of rotating exhibitions. Launching with a feminist bang, the opening show \u2013 titled <a href=\"http://www.muzeumsusch.ch/e/muzeum-susch-opening.html\">A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women</a> \u2013 explores female representation, sexual emancipation and the subversion of traditional gender roles, mixing work from Kulczyk\u2019s collection with international loans. Given that Switzerland was the last European country to give women the vote (with one canton holding out until as late as 1991), the rooms of powerful female forms and gaping yonic voids are a welcome provocation.</p> <p>Without overwhelming the art, it is the building that is the star of the show.

      "bodyText": "Pebbles from a nearby riverbed form a chunky cobbled floor in the entrance to the new Muzeum Susch in Switzerland, as if a tributary once flowed through the building. Maybe it still does. The sound of dripping water can be heard coming from the end of a corridor, where a shiny trickle snakes down a bare rock face. There are other strange things going on. Peer through one opening and you find a gnarled column of earth plunging down into the basement, as if it\u2019s the remains of an archaeological dig. Another passage is encrusted with viscous white goo, forming stringy stalactites that lead to a curious cave downstairs. In this beguiling new gallery in the Engadin valley, it is hard to tell where nature ends and artifice begins. It is located on the site of a 12th-century monastery, in a rambling complex of buildings that formerly housed a vicarage, hospice and brewery, and the young architects Chasper Schmidlin and Lukas Voellmy have concocted a magical place where the historic fabric, contemporary art and the raw geology of the landscape collide. The project is the brainchild of Gra\u017cyna Kulczyk, former wife of the late billionaire industrialist Jan Kulczyk, and one of Poland\u2019s richest women. A 68-year-old with a platinum-blond bob and a fondness for skin-tight leather, Kulczyk has been collecting art since she was a law student in the 1970s. She has amassed an impressive haul, predominantly focused on female artists, which she describes as a \u201cmatrilineage through global art history\u201d. In 2004, Kulczyk established an arts and retail complex in a former brewery in her hometown of Pozna\u0144, but sold it in 2015 to concentrate on this Swiss outpost, after plans for a base in Warsaw fell through. The resulting combination of deep-pocketed patronage and Swiss precision is one of the most exquisitely crafted private museums realised in recent years. From the outside, you might be hard-pressed to differentiate the building from any other white-rendered house in Susch. But step inside and the place unfolds as a Tardis-like warren of rooms, leading you from vaulted basements to airy timber lofts and galleries excavated from the mountainside \u2013 a process that saw 9,000 tonnes of rock blasted out. It is alpine chalet, primitive grotto and Bond villain\u2019s lair in one. The sleepy village of Susch might seem like an unlikely place to find such an institution. It\u2019s a tiny hamlet with a population of around 200, whose other main feature is a clinic for people suffering from burnout syndrome. But, just a short drive from the gilded playgrounds of St Moritz and Davos, the site isn\u2019t quite as odd as it seems. The museum joins a growing gallery scene that has mushroomed over the last few years to service the area\u2019s wealthy cultured visitors, in search of more than the usual apr\u00e8s ski. There are now more than 30 galleries in the Engadin, with Hauser &amp; Wirth joining the party last year. To make it stand out from the commercial galleries, Kulczyk says she has conceived the museum as more of a \u201claboratory\u201d, where a series of permanent site-specific installations by the likes of Adri\u00e1n Villar Rojas (the stratified column) and Sara Mas\u00fcger (the gooey cave) will complement a programme of rotating exhibitions. Launching with a feminist bang, the opening show \u2013 titled A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women \u2013 explores female representation, sexual emancipation and the subversion of traditional gender roles, mixing work from Kulczyk\u2019s collection with international loans. Given that Switzerland was the last European country to give women the vote (with one canton holding out until as late as 1991), the rooms of powerful female forms and gaping yonic voids are a welcome provocation. Without overwhelming the art, it is the building that is the star of the show. Schmidlin and Voellmy, both in their 30s, with one other small gallery in Basel to their name, have struck a brilliant balance between preservation and intervention, amplifying traces of the buildings\u2019 former lives while creating new spaces that are very much their own. The project shows incredible attention to detail throughout, standing as a testament to local craftsmanship and the architects\u2019 ability to deploy a limited palette of materials in unexpected new ways. They have used gravel dredged from the riverbed to make a coarse grey plaster, moulded over the existing masonry like thick icing on a lumpy cake.

Set across multiple levels of sloping hillside, the exhibition spaces range from the crepuscular to the light-flooded. A narrow staircase leads down a former slot between two buildings to a vaulted basement, where Magdalena Abakanowicz\u2019s moulded hessian figures stand like ghosts in the gloom. Upstairs, a former hay loft has been converted into a double-height auditorium and performance space, with huge picture windows that frame postcard-perfect views over the snowy valley. There are constant reminders of the past. Some ceilings are still charred from the beer brewing process, while the former stable block has a manure gutter running through the floor to a low-level window, and a hefty stone watering trough repurposed as a plinth for an archive display. Meanwhile, a triple-height space, once used as an \u201cice tower\u201d to cool the brewery in summer, has been transformed into an enormous light-well, where Monika Sosnowska\u2019s mangled steel stairs now hang like crumpled ribbons \u2013 perhaps a wry comment on where less imaginative architects might have placed a \u201cfeature\u201d staircase. But the real drama is found in the bowels of the former brewery, where a storage cave has been enlarged to create a subterranean exhibition space worthy of Ernst Stavro Blofeld. A polished steel cylinder by Miros\u0142aw Ba\u0142ka rotates slowly in the centre of the cave, adding to the sci-fi theatrics, while more water trickles down from the jagged rocky ceiling. It is a fittingly stagey prelude to what comes next: a black-walled concrete bunker, where 200 spot-lit portraits of Nazi generals line the room, their monocled faces and toothbrush moustaches glowing from the walls with camp horror.

It\u2019s time to reject micro and bumbags that can\u2019t even carry the bare essentials, and become a turtle once more. Prada, A Cold Wall and Emporio Armani\u2019s catwalks featured models making the case for more is more, while Louis Vuitton took up the most room with enormous woollen backpacks.

It needn\u2019t be straight-laced: Charles Jeffrey used tartan for his Loverboy range; Clare Waight Keller crafted two-tone wool tweeds and gem-stone-hued styles; and Dries Van Noten went tie-dye. On the high street, places such as Arket, River Island and Zara will help you to look sharp right now.</p>",

It\u2019s time to reject micro and bumbags that can\u2019t even carry the bare essentials, and become a turtle once more. Prada, A Cold Wall and Emporio Armani\u2019s catwalks featured models making the case for more is more, while Louis Vuitton took up the most room with enormous woollen backpacks. Sat front row at his show was Frank Ocean, who is already ahead of the trend. He clutched an extra-large tote at his side at several of the shows. Wear a suit at all times Suits are officially the new streetwear (which used to be the new suit). Thanks to Kim Jones at Dior, Hedi Slimane at Celine, Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton and Kris Van Assche at Berluti, beautiful tailoring is back on the agenda, and it can be worn myriad ways. It needn\u2019t be straight-laced: Charles Jeffrey used tartan for his Loverboy range; Clare Waight Keller crafted two-tone wool tweeds and gem-stone-hued styles; and Dries Van Noten went tie-dye. On the high street, places such as Arket, River Island and Zara will help you to look sharp right now.",

Thomas Jones\u2019s body was found floating in the river on 28 September last year after going missing nine days earlier. Two men were arrested on suspicion of murdering Jones but released without charge and the inquest in Stourport-on-Severn was told there was no suggestion of third-party involvement in his death. The coroner, Geraint Williams, appeared to become upset as he looked at a photograph of the 18-year-old before reaching an open conclusion on Tuesday. CCTV cameras in the area where Jones was last seen picked up a cry for help moments before he apparently slipped and fell down an embankment in Worcester at about 3.50am. Pc Chris Buffery, of West Mercia police, said he could not be certain but it was likely the University of Worcester student had gone to help someone or had gone to the river to urinate.

      "bodyText": "Brussels is to warn EU member states that the \u201cgolden visa\u201d schemes used by Britain and others to attract the wealthy have exposed the continent to corruption and organised crime. A report from the the European commission, expected to be published on Wednesday, claims the schemes designed to encourage the super-rich to invest in return for residency rights or citizenship pose a danger to the continent\u2019s security. The 28 EU member states have earned about \u20ac25bn (\u00a322bn) of foreign direct investment in the last decade from a variety of different offers to wealthy people under which investors can secure the right to free movement in the bloc. Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta sell citizenship in return for investments ranging between approximately \u00a3800,000 and \u00a31.6m, while 20 member states, including those three, offer residence permits for cash. Before her murder, the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was investigating an alleged abuse of the scheme in Malta. Following the poisoning of the former spy Sergei Skripal, the UK Home Office announced it would review 700 golden visas issued to wealthy Russians under its scheme. The commission, according to a report obtained by Reuters, is to say the cash-for-status offers pose \u201crisks to security, including the possibility of infiltration of non-EU organised crime groups, as well as risks of money laundering, corruption and tax evasion\u201d. In December, the British government announced it would suspend its tier 1 visa, which provides a fast-track route to settlement for people willing to invest millions in the UK, while new rules were being formulated. But the government failed to follow through on that pledge, and has not offered any updates on its commitment to reform the system. Sophie in \u2019t Veld, a Dutch member of the European parliament, who is the vice-chair of its committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs, said the EU had been slow to respond to the abuse. She said: \u201cI welcome the fact the European commission is, albeit belatedly, sounding the alarm. We need a ban on these schemes, which are exploited by organised criminals who often receive limited background checks, and to align rules for acquiring citizenship. \u201cAfter all, by acquiring citizenship of an EU member state, you get EU citizenship automatically. Golden visas and passports are essentially state-facilitated corruption and money-laundering schemes. \u201cWhile some governments are busy building up a fortress Europe, they are cynically rolling out the red carpet for wealthy foreign criminals, who are then free to circulate freely in our single market. Golden visa schemes are essentially incompatible with free movement within the Schengen area.\u201d The commission\u2019s report is said to highlight the varying standards across the EU in terms of the background checks on applicants The EU does not have any competence in the field of investor schemes but it is set to urge governments to adopt common approval criteria and be more transparent about their internal processes. A long-running court case in Portugal on the alleged abuse of the government\u2019s golden visa scheme led to two people being given suspended sentences and two Chinese nationals fined earlier this month. Visas had been offered by the government since 2012 to wealthy foreigners willing to invest \u20ac500,000 in property, make a capital transfer of \u20ac1m or create 10 jobs. Miguel Macedo, who resigned as interior minister from the then government in November 2014, was among those acquitted of bribery charges. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe Tier 1 (Investor) visa is not currently suspended, however we remain committed to reforming the route. A further announcement will be made in due course.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the civil service has said the government will never be fully prepared for Brexit as he revealed plans to move up to 5,000 staff into an emergency command and control centre in the event of no deal. John Manzoni said the civil service had already hired 10,000 people to cope with Brexit with another 5,000 in the pipeline. But he warned: \u201cThe longer it goes on, the better we are prepared, but we still won\u2019t be completely prepared.\u201d He was speaking at the launch of Whitehall Monitor 2019, an Institute for Government report, which laid bare the cost of Brexit on governing the country, with a fifth of major non-Brexit projects at risk as exiting the EU chokes the system. Implementing Brexit has been described as \u201cthe biggest, most challenging peacetime task the civil service has faced\u201d, yet officials will have less time than London had to deliver the Olympics, the report finds. \u201cIf the UK leaves without a deal, deadlines for implementing new arrangements would be tighter still,\u201d it says. \u201cThe government could only expect to have \u2018a fraction\u2019 of the necessary processes and systems in place \u2013 such as ensuring that the UK complies with international law \u2013 by exit.\u201d Only five of the 13 bills the government has said it needs to pass before Britain leaves the EU have made it through parliament, it finds. Manzoni confirmed reports of government departments commandeering volunteers for a new \u201ccommand and control\u201d emergency operation, which would be put in place in the event of no deal. \u201cIf we find ourselves in a sort of crash-out no deal, we have to put some operational capability into place, which is a few thousand \u2013 that is largely because people will be working 24/7 in a command and control mode; that\u2019s the next focus; we are largely ready with that and part of the preparations as we get closer is that last act of getting those people to move,\u201d he said. He said he did not have the precise number to hand of those involved but put it at \u201ca bit less than 5,000\u201d . The report claimed that Brexit was endangering the progress of at least 26 projects designed to improve life in the UK, including the HS2 high-speed rail line. \u201cI\u2019ve never pretended it\u2019s all going to go swimmingly well in the event of a no deal,\u201d said Manzoni, who said the civil service was in constant engagement with the government over national priorities apart from Brexit. The report says staff numbers in the civil service have risen to levels not seen since the second world war, yet a hung parliament coupled with Brexit \u201chave constrained the government\u2019s ability to pass legislation\u201d. High turnover of civil service staff is proving both expensive \u2013 costing up to \u00a374m each year \u2013 and disruptive, as knowledge and expertise is lost. In the last year, some departments, including the Treasury, lost two in five of their civil servants, either to other departments or to roles outside the civil service, partly due to Brexit. One-third of Treasury staff are working on Brexit. The unprecedented number of ministerial resignations \u2013 21 since the 2017 general election, has also caused disruption, as it means only half of current cabinet ministers and half of all ministers took on their role only in 2018. This has taken a toll on progressing government priorities with a fifth of 133 major non-Brexit projects now endangered. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said Brexit negotiations were \u201ca priority for the government\u201d but it continued to \u201ctackle the other issues that matter to people including backing the long term plan for the NHS\u201d and housing plans.",

      "bodyText": "I am in a line of work where it is standard practice for one\u2019s work to be read over by a colleague in order to spot any mistakes before being submitted to the client. Even though I still have my problems with this after years of it, I can see the point. However, I have one particular colleague who basically rewrites my work. He doesn\u2019t stop at correcting actual errors, he makes stylistic changes too \u2013 so many that I\u2019m lucky if a single sentence remains unchanged. I find this deeply offensive and patronising. But I hate conflict so I don\u2019t know how to resolve the situation. Unfortunately, many of those in my profession are like this guy (nerdy know-it-alls) but I feel his approach is particularly over the top. What should I do? \u2022 When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Working It Out asking for help, and may well view your comments here. \u2022 If you have a problem at work, this is your chance to get some advice. Email your dilemma to Working.It.Out@theguardian.com (up to 150 words, please; no attachments), or set it out below. Every fortnight we\u2019ll ask readers to advise on one of them.

There were certain people I knew were irrepressible. I discovered a rapper called Lowkey and I just knew he would be a star because of his intensity.

And he was 16 so I also knew he had time. </p> \n      <p>On the whole, I just never fully believed the type of music any of us were making had the potential to make stars out of anyone, sadly. Maybe Klashnekoff ... he seemed to have something that bridged the gap between old UK rap and the new eave. On the whole we were still making an English version of an American art form; we hadn't evolved. Grime, the new wave of British rap, has evolved into something 100% British, which is so much more interesting, so much more exciting. </p> \n      <p>That said, I had my own superstars when I was young: Chester P, Skinnyman, Blak Twang, Fallacy, Skeme, Sway.

Rickety_Cricket asks: What was your favourite task to perform on Taskmaster? And DaleMiniCooper adds: Can I piggyback and ask for biggest Taskmaster regret? DTMinter asks: If you had to make a terrible choice and work only in music, standup or drama, which would you choose? Also: winning an Oscar or Crystal Palace FC winning the Premier League....? archdeacon asks: How much fun was Task Master to be in? telfordspa says: Hi Ben, I was up against you for a Picture book award in 2016. It can be a real gruelling industry, but also one that is full of fun and wonderment. How did you find the whole experience and if you have any future plans in this area? (FWIW It was the Junior design awards best emerging author - I wrote I Have an Orange Juicy Drink - I read your book and felt really annoyed to be up against such stiff competition.) 4legsgood asks: You have many strings to your bow and have achieved success in a number of highly competitive fields, but is there anything that you\u2019re really rubbish at that you\u2019d really like to be able to master? simonk85 asks: Whats your favourite Jehst verse? Blah Blah asks: How do you feel about being called Ben Baby Smith as opposed to Ben Bailey Smith? reverendbow asks: Have you found anyone to make you a cup of proper tea? MasterOfHisOwnDomain asks: In regards to UK hip-hop, is there anyone you came up with who you felt would become a big start, but it never worked out for them? And is there anyone who is around now who you feel worthy of more exposure? I\u2019m a big fan of the artists on High Focus, and I feel like if you\u2019d have continued down the hip-hop path, then maybe you\u2019d have found a home on that label, would you agree? And Millingabout adds: For my part I think its absolutely mad that Jehst never really blew. Drifter and Falling down are both masterpieces, and I loved Dragon. MrWhisky asks: What music do your kids listen to? MrDancingGecco says: I listened to the interview you did with Stuart Goldsmith for his ComComPod podcast \u2013 well worth a google if you haven\u2019t heard it \u2013 which has prompted my question. You discuss with Stuart how the loneliness you felt as a touring standup comedian had a detrimental effect on your mental health. Did you seek professional help to get over the issues? How has that helped you going forward? maschruhm asks: Who would win in a fight between hedgehogs and tortoises? unklefu asks: Hey Doc. Been listening to you since the Citizen Smith mixtapes. Thank you for all your music! Man can never steal ma thunder / whenever i appear ya shudder / people stare at with either fear o wonder cos they hear ma hunger. Who are your three favourite rappers of all time? And does it make you angry that a lot of popular rap is such garbage when you take your craft and your wordplay so seriously? RiichardC asks: The first book my little boy and girl (twins) learned off by heart was I Am Bear because you got them to rap to it! They still adore it. Any new books on the horizon they can look forward to? garythenotrashcougar asks: What was it like doing the video for \u2018Equality Street\u2019 with Ricky Gervais? You looked like you had an absolute blast. How many takes were involved, I\u2019m guessing hundreds? southlundon says: My family\u2019s all time favourite CBeebies story time episode is of you doing My Big Shouting Day. We quote it regularly (especially my 10 year old) and I could watch it personally over and over - it\u2019s just fantastic! I just wanted to say thanks and have you recorded or considered recording any more TV for young children? And count_duckula is a fan too: Same! The delivery of the story is just spot-on. Our 2yo is mystified as to why his dad and I find it quite so funny. \u201cI have a hurting foot!\u201d And here\u2019s an iPlayer link to that story \u2013 for now or for bedtime. ZongoTheSneaky asks: Hi Ben, I was interested to hear you on the Comedian\u2019s Comedian, saying that you wished you hadn\u2019t kept the \u201cDoc Brown\u201d name when you moved into standup. Given that your profile as \u201cBen\u201d is a lot higher now, do you think that, if you go back to stand up, you are now well enough known to do so under your own name, and keep \u201cDoc\u201d for your music? DWFan1 asks: What\u2019s your favourite Pixar film? And Ccfc11 follows up with: Do you keep up with politics much? What is your take on the current situation with regards to Brexit? That Dyer take in full: Ccfc11 asks: Do you still keep up with the UK rap/grime/drill scene much? If so do you have any favourite artists or songs? If not what other kinds of music do you listen to now? What did you think of the recent uproar over drill music and it\u2019s link to knife crime \u2013 how true is that in your opinion? lewisdenson asks: Which is your favourite book by your sister? [The novelist Zadie Smith] Richard Smart asks: Are there any plans for more Strange Hill? My son and I discovered this gem last year and thinks it\u2019s brilliant, great for father-son bonding \u2013 oh and hello to Jason Isaacs. Ben is with us at the Guardian, and answering your questions. If you\u2019re not familiar with the name Ben Bailey Smith, you\u2019ll like recognise the moniker of his on-stage alter ego, Doc Brown.

      "bodyText": "The National Portrait Gallery is to get a new main entrance more than a century after a rich donor insisted it should not point north towards the filth of Soho and Covent Garden. The entrance is part of a \u00a335.5m redevelopment that is intended to make the gallery more welcoming and less crowded, and to better display contemporary crowd-pleasers such as Sam Taylor-Johnson\u2019s video of David Beckham sleeping. A crowdfunding appeal to help raise money for the project, the gallery\u2019s biggest redevelopment since its current home opened in 1896, was announced by its director, Nicholas Cullinan, on Tuesday. One of the biggest changes will be the new main entrance, created by converting three windows in the northern facade of the building into doors. The project\u2019s architect, Jamie Fobert, said the current narrow entrance was a result of an important Victorian donor insisting that it be placed as close to Trafalgar Square as possible so as not to face the then more disreputable areas of London. After 2023 it will point to Soho. Outside Fobert plans to create a public forecourt, rejuvenating what is a rather shabby, sad area of railings and bins. A statue of the Victorian actor Henry Irving will remain, although moved by five metres. \u201cAt the moment it feels like an incredibly unsafe space at night, a certain amount of antisocial behaviour happens behind Henry Irving,\u201d said Fobert. All the relevant bodies have been consulted and are supportive, he said, apart from some niggling fears that street performers who ply their trade in Trafalgar Square may relocate. \u201cI think Westminster [council] have said that there is a constant concern about how many Yodas you can have on that pavement in front of the National Gallery and whether that is something that is going to happen here.\u201d Another key part of the project is to create new gallery space in the building\u2019s east wing, which is being used as offices. All the building\u2019s galleries will be refurbished to bring a consistency that does not currently exist as rooms have been updated at different times. \u201cThe effect of this is to create quite a fragmented experience for our visitors, the decor and ambience changes quite a bit as you walk around,\u201d said Cullinan. The redevelopment will create 20% more public space, although the display space will remain about the same. Contemporary and 20th-century portraits, which often get displaced or moved because of temporary exhibitions, will be more consistently displayed. Cullinan said: \u201cThe most common question that visitors ask is \u2018Why does nobody here look like me?\u2019\u201d The gallery has raised \u00a327.4m for the project and hopes the public will be moved to contribute to the \u00a38m that remains to be found.

He wanted to scrap our nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union at the height of the cold war. So it should be no surprise that he insists Britain should unilaterally disarm in its negotiations with the EU. That is what his demand that Theresa May take no deal off the table means. If we rule out leaving with no withdrawal agreement, we would have to accept whatever terms the EU dictates.

Writing in the journal Forensic Science International Genetics, Cemper-Kiedslich and colleagues report that their conclusion is based on analysis of a blood sample taken from Spandau #7 in 1982. The sample was hermetically sealed on a microscope slide kept for years for teaching purposes by another of the study\u2019s authors, Rick Wahl, a former US army pathologist. It was a fortunate situation: Hess\u2019s body was disinterred and cremated in 2011 to avoid his grave becoming a site of pilgrimage for neo-Nazis. The team tracked down a distant male relative of Hess, whose identity they are careful to protect. According to the New Scientist, which first reported on the study, the man agreed to give a DNA sample and the team compared it with that of Spandau #7, looking at DNA markers across the genome.. Cemper-Kiesslich told the Guardian the key was to look particularly at the Y-chromosome. \u201cUsually the DNA markers that are used for paternity testing don\u2019t work out for distant relatives. But on the other hand we knew that both sample donors [if Spandau #7 was Hess] shared a common paternal line,\u201d he said. With Y-chromosomes passed down from father to son, that offered the possibility of a different analysis. \u201cPersons with an unbroken paternal line display the same set of DNA markers on the Y chromosome,\u201d said Cemper-Kiesslich. The authors say the people who carried out the analysis were unaware of the story of the samples until after the results were in. The results showed that the two people from whom the samples were taken were more than 99.99% likely to be related. \u201cWe are extremely sure that both samples [originate] from the same paternal line,\u201d Cemper-Kiesslich said. \u201cThe person the slide sample was taken from indeed was Rudolf Hess.\u201d",

Roma\u2019s success demonstrates the Oscars\u2019 acceptance of streaming giant Netflix, which it had had hitherto treated with suspicion. Netflix has launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/21/cinema-release-a-twist-in-the-tale-as-netflix-goes-hunting-for-oscars\">an expensive awards campaign</a> which appears to be have paid off.</p> \n<p>Scabrous period comedy The Favourite, about political power games at the 18th-century court of Queen Anne, also received 10 nominations, including best actress for Olivia Colman. With 12 Bafta nominations, and a single Golden Globe win for Colman (for the best actress, musical or comedy), The Favourite emerged as a much liked contender as awards season has progressed, and a powerful vehicle for its cast, which includes Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, who were both nominated for best supporting actress.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e8ad9179229ceab79cee4f10ecb209a58eb3746\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e8ad9179229ceab79cee4f10ecb209a58eb3746/0_5_2624_1574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bradley Cooper, left, and Lady Gaga in a A Star is Born.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradley Cooper, left, and Lady Gaga in a A Star is Born.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A Star is Born, Bradley Cooper\u2019s directorial debut about a waning country icon and the unknown singer (played by Lady Gaga) he mentors, picked up eight nominations.

It secured best actor and actress nominations for Cooper and Gaga, as well as best picture and best song, but was surprisingly passed over for best director.</p> \n<p>Also on eight nominations is Vice, the comedy about Dick Cheney, vice president to George W Bush and architect of the war on terror. Christian Bale is nominated for best actor as Cheney, Sam Rockwell for best supporting actor as Bush, and Amy Adams for best supporting actress as Lynne Cheney.

The red carpet portion of the show is broadcast live by the E! network.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who decides on the Oscars?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscars are voted for by members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (aka Ampas), which currently numbers just under 8,000 voting members, divided into 17 separate branches, including actors, directors, costume designers, etc. (To join, names have to be proposed and approved by individual branches.) The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived white/male/elderly bias of its voters \u2013 and a drive to create a more diverse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many Oscars are there and how does a film get nominated?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are 24 categories \u2013 ranging from best picture to best sound mixing \u2013 presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg's PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).</p>\n    <p>Each of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries \u2013 first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination \u2013 which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do Oscar winners win?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscar statuette isn't solid gold:&nbsp;it's gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn't own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won't sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Black Panther, the Marvel superhero film starring Chadwick Boseman, clocked up a surprise seven nominations, including best picture and best song for All the Stars. Directed by Ryan Coogler, the film has won a string of awards, including movie of the year from the MTV Movie awards, and was expected to be the main beneficiary of the proposed \u201cbest popular film\u201d category proposed by the Academy. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/06/oscars-popular-film-category-suspended\">the plan was cancelled</a> after industry figures complained it patronised commercially successful films.</p> \n<p>Firebrand film-maker Spike Lee received his first nomination for best director for his police drama BlacKkKlansman, which stars John David Washington as a detective who helps infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. Lee was given an honorary Oscar in 2015, and BlacKkKlansman received six nominations in total, including best picture, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for Adam Driver.</p> \n<p>However, no women have been nominated in the best director category, with Lynne Ramsay, Debra Granik and Chloe Zhao overlooked for You Were Never Really Here, Leave No Trace and The Rider respectively, all of which have performed well on critics\u2019 lists and independent-film awards. This means that only one woman \u2013 Greta Gerwig for Lady Bird in 2018 \u2013 has been nominated for the award since Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win it in 2010 for The Hurt Locker.</p> \n<p>Green Book, the early Oscar frontrunner about the burgeoning friendship between African American pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his Italian-American driver Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) scored a disappointing five nominations, including best picture and best supporting actor for Ali. Its awards campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/11/green-book-nick-vallelonga-anti-muslim-tweet\">has become dogged by controversy</a>, after the film\u2019s director Peter Farrelly apologised for sexual harassment and co-writer Nick Vallelonga apologised for an anti-Muslim tweet he sent in 2015. However, Green Book still remains a strong contender, especially after <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/in-contention/oscars-with-pga-victory-green-book-becomes-best-picture-frontrunner-1203112994/\">winning the key Producers\u2019 Guild award</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e3972db3a977a50f2f5eb6fe2a35e7895828440\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e3972db3a977a50f2f5eb6fe2a35e7895828440/0_6_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Bale, left, and Sam Rockwell in Vice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Bale, left, and Sam Rockwell in Vice.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Kennedy/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bohemian Rhapsody, the hit biopic of Freddie Mercury and Queen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/06/golden-globes-2019-bohemian-rhapsody-green-book\">emerged unexpectedly strongly from the Golden Globes</a>, where it won best drama and best actor, drama, for Rami Malek.

      "bodyText": "Roma and The Favourite will go head to head at the Oscars after they received 10 Academy Award nominations each. Roma, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s memoir of childhood in 1970s Mexico City, topped many critics\u2019 lists of 2018 (including the Guardian\u2019s) and has scored 10 nominations, including best film and best director for Cuar\u00f3n. Roma\u2019s success demonstrates the Oscars\u2019 acceptance of streaming giant Netflix, which it had had hitherto treated with suspicion. Netflix has launched an expensive awards campaign which appears to be have paid off. Scabrous period comedy The Favourite, about political power games at the 18th-century court of Queen Anne, also received 10 nominations, including best actress for Olivia Colman. With 12 Bafta nominations, and a single Golden Globe win for Colman (for the best actress, musical or comedy), The Favourite emerged as a much liked contender as awards season has progressed, and a powerful vehicle for its cast, which includes Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, who were both nominated for best supporting actress. A Star is Born, Bradley Cooper\u2019s directorial debut about a waning country icon and the unknown singer (played by Lady Gaga) he mentors, picked up eight nominations. The film, which premiered at the Venice film festival last August, began awards season as frontrunner, before losing momentum. It secured best actor and actress nominations for Cooper and Gaga, as well as best picture and best song, but was surprisingly passed over for best director. Also on eight nominations is Vice, the comedy about Dick Cheney, vice president to George W Bush and architect of the war on terror. Christian Bale is nominated for best actor as Cheney, Sam Rockwell for best supporting actor as Bush, and Amy Adams for best supporting actress as Lynne Cheney. Bale was a popular winner of the best actor, musical or comedy, at the Golden Globes, where he thanked Satan as an inspiration for his performance. Black Panther, the Marvel superhero film starring Chadwick Boseman, clocked up a surprise seven nominations, including best picture and best song for All the Stars. Directed by Ryan Coogler, the film has won a string of awards, including movie of the year from the MTV Movie awards, and was expected to be the main beneficiary of the proposed \u201cbest popular film\u201d category proposed by the Academy. However, the plan was cancelled after industry figures complained it patronised commercially successful films. Firebrand film-maker Spike Lee received his first nomination for best director for his police drama BlacKkKlansman, which stars John David Washington as a detective who helps infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. Lee was given an honorary Oscar in 2015, and BlacKkKlansman received six nominations in total, including best picture, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for Adam Driver. However, no women have been nominated in the best director category, with Lynne Ramsay, Debra Granik and Chloe Zhao overlooked for You Were Never Really Here, Leave No Trace and The Rider respectively, all of which have performed well on critics\u2019 lists and independent-film awards. This means that only one woman \u2013 Greta Gerwig for Lady Bird in 2018 \u2013 has been nominated for the award since Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win it in 2010 for The Hurt Locker. Green Book, the early Oscar frontrunner about the burgeoning friendship between African American pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his Italian-American driver Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) scored a disappointing five nominations, including best picture and best supporting actor for Ali. Its awards campaign has become dogged by controversy, after the film\u2019s director Peter Farrelly apologised for sexual harassment and co-writer Nick Vallelonga apologised for an anti-Muslim tweet he sent in 2015. However, Green Book still remains a strong contender, especially after winning the key Producers\u2019 Guild award. Bohemian Rhapsody, the hit biopic of Freddie Mercury and Queen, emerged unexpectedly strongly from the Golden Globes, where it won best drama and best actor, drama, for Rami Malek. It has continued its successful streak at the Oscars, with five nominations, including best picture and Malek up for best actor. Its credited director Bryan Singer, who left the production in controversial circumstances before the end of filming, has not been nominated. First Man, which stars Ryan Gosling as astronaut Neil Armstrong, was considered a safe bet for Oscar success when it was first premiered at Venice, with La La Land director Damien Chazelle behind the camera and support from The Crown\u2019s Claire Foy as Armstrong\u2019s wife Janet. It came up short at the Golden Globes with two nominations (one of which was for Foy) and one win, for its score. It now receives four nominations for the Oscars, none of which are in the headline categories. Black Sheep, a short film commissioned by the Guardian, received a nomination for best short documentary. Free to view on the Guardian website, it describes the lengths that a black 11-year-old, Cornelius Walker, went to to fit in with a racist gang after his family moved away from London. For only the second time in their 91-year history, the Academy Awards will not have a host, after the resignation last December of Kevin Hart, following a backlash to re-emerged homophobic comments. Speculation had been rife that Hart would return to the role; after he declared himself uninterested earlier this month, the Academy opted not to replace him and instead opt for a rolling cast of A-list presenters. Key awards ceremonies still to come before the Oscars include the Screen Actors Guild awards on 27 January and the Baftas on 10 February. This year\u2019s ceremony will take place on 24 February in the Dolby Theater in Hollywood.

      "bodyText": "Proxy voting will be introduced to the House of Commons on a one-year pilot, Andrea Leadsom has announced. It follows an outcry over the lack of support for the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who delayed the birth of her son by two days to vote against Theresa May\u2019s EU withdrawal agreement. Despite initial indications that somebody would be allowed to vote in Siddiq\u2019s place a week ago, the MP was subsequently told by the Conservatives she would have to go to Westminster in person if she wanted her voted to be recorded. Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, told MPs that a motion approving the scheme would be on the order paper for approval by the house on Monday 28 January. She said: \u201cI am delighted to be able to confirm to the house today that a substantive motion on proxy leave in the case of maternity, paternity and adoption has been tabled today for the house\u2019s agreement on Monday 28 January. \u201cThis is a step forward, removing the choice between parliamentary and parental responsibilities, and helping to make parliament a more modern workplace,\u201d she said. Siddiq, who was advised by doctors to have a caesarean section after complications in the birth of her first daughter, Azalea, voted in a wheelchair last week against May\u2019s agreement. A breakdown in trust over the pairing system for pregnant MPs and new mothers meant she wanted to attend the Commons in person or risk losing her vote on behalf of her constituents, 76% of whom voted remain. Siddiq blamed the Conservatives, saying: \u201cIt is sad to learn that senior politicians are actively delaying proxy voting in order to gain a partisan advantage.\u201d She was pushed through the division lobbies in a wheelchair by Labour colleague Clive Lewis. The government lost by a record 230 votes. Her son, Raphael Mujib St John Percy, was born on Thursday, two days after the vote. Responding to the announcement, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn tweeted a photo of herself holding her son while watching Leadsom at the dispatch box. \u201cWatching the urgent question with Raphael who, at just six days old, is delighted to have been mentioned in Hansard, due to the historic introduction of #ProxyVoting in the House of Commons. A really momentous (and overdue) change that I welcome,\u201d she wrote. Leadsom made the announcement in a response to an urgent question tabled by Jo Swinson, who was excluded in a similar pairing row last summer. Swinson welcomed the announcement but said the situation Siddiq was put in last week was \u201cshameful\u201d. The one-year pilot will be based on the procedure committee report into proxy voting. The scheme will be available in cases of childbirth or care of an infant or newly-adopted child and will be administered by the Speaker, with the proxy vote cast by another member or a whip. The change takes the form of a temporary standing order. The pilot allows for the procedure committee to review the success of the scheme before the end of the pilot, after which it is hoped it can be rolled out on a permanent basis. The full practical details of how the scheme will operate will be discussed by the house authorities and will be signed off by the Speaker as well as the leaders of the three largest political parties in the house.",

Black Sheep is executive produced by the Guardian\u2019s head of documentaries, Charlie Phillips, and Lindsay Poulton, executive producer, documentaries. Katharine Viner, the editor-in-chief of Guardian News &amp; Media, said: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see such an important and personal story resonate with so many people and I\u2019m delighted that the Guardian helped to tell it.\u201d Phillips added: \u201cThanks to [Cornelius\u2019s] bravery in speaking with such candour, combined with Ed Perkins\u2019 beautiful filmmaking, this film will resonate with anyone who\u2019s struggled with their identity as a teenager, and it says something profound and relevant about race in today\u2019s world.\u201d Simon Chinn said that he was \u201cthrilled and honoured\u201d at the nomination. \u201cThanks to Ed, to everyone who worked on the film and to Cornelius, who was so generous and candid in telling his story and without whom this film could never have been made,\u201d he added. Black Sheep has already won a string of awards, including best short at Sheffield Doc/Fest and the grand jury prize at the Berlin British Shorts film festival. It is the first time a Guardian film has been nominated for an Oscar. The Academy Awards will take place on 24 February at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.",

The service is free to consumers, but financial firms have to pay about \u00a3500 per claim adjudicated.</p> <p>Wayman did not dispute the whistleblower\u2019s claims, but defended the FOS\u2019s record. She said the organisation typically deals with about 100,000 \u201ccore\u201d disputes each year, but it had recorded 50,000 more complaints about payday lenders from consumers in the past year.</p> <p>This had caused delays, she admitted, but pointed to the recruitment of more staff that would ease the case load, particularly in the low-cost credit market. She also said the number would have been higher had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/wonga\">Wonga</a> not collapsed.</p> <p>MPs expressed concerns that the delays getting cases heard are only set to get worse.

      "bodyText": "Delays in getting a case heard by the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) have grown threefold since the service was reorganised in 2016, and 30,000 cases are still waiting to be allocated to an investigator, a whistleblower has told the Treasury select committee. Questioning the FOS chief executive, Caroline Wayman, MPs said the whistleblower also told them there was a backlog of 8,000 investigated claims yet to be adjudicated upon. The committee has been investigating the FOS, which is the official body to which consumers can take a dispute with their bank, insurer or other finance firm. Consumers have frequently complained to their MPs and the media that the adjudication service takes far too long, and feels as though it is stacked in favour of the big City firms, whose staff often employ delaying and other tactics. The House of Commons inquiry was in part sparked by a Channel 4 Despatches programme in March 2018 that claimed the organisation was failing consumers, particularly those who had complex cases. The service is free to consumers, but financial firms have to pay about \u00a3500 per claim adjudicated. Wayman did not dispute the whistleblower\u2019s claims, but defended the FOS\u2019s record. She said the organisation typically deals with about 100,000 \u201ccore\u201d disputes each year, but it had recorded 50,000 more complaints about payday lenders from consumers in the past year. This had caused delays, she admitted, but pointed to the recruitment of more staff that would ease the case load, particularly in the low-cost credit market. She also said the number would have been higher had Wonga not collapsed. MPs expressed concerns that the delays getting cases heard are only set to get worse. In 10 weeks\u2019 time, they said, 210,000 more small- and medium-sized businesses will be entitled to use the service \u2013 a service that is already \u201cswamped\u201d. Wayman said additional recruitment would address these concerns and that an extra 20 ombudsmen were being recruited to deal with SME complaints. Payment protection complaints had fallen below those expected in the last 12 months, she added. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) set a deadline of 29 August for the final PPI claims to banks and other loan providers. Asked why the FOS was shedding permanent staff through a voluntary redundancy programme, while taking on more expensive \u201ccontract\u201d staff, she claimed this gave the FOS flexibility. MPs expressed shock that the FOS plans to spend \u00a3100m-plus a year on contractors from the next financial year.",

Kristine Beckerle, Yemen specialist for Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cWe have not seen the international response needed to make clear to the warring parties that meeting in Sweden in December is not enough, you need to actualise the agreements that you have made\u201d.",

This is two children next to each other, looking like they are quietly huddled over their books, making notes of the teacher\u2019s bon mots, but in fact using their books to engage in a kind of written banter.\u201d</p> <p>Although English-language school poetry anthologies have been part of the classroom since the beginning of mass education in the 19th century, Blake explains, their history was unexplored. She embarked on her PhD after finding she had no answer for poets she met while working at the Poetry Archive, who asked her \u2013 as a former teacher \u2013 why the selections of poems in school anthologies were \u201cso strange\u201d.\u201cThe question stayed with me, some other professional experiences fed into it,\u201d Blake says, \u201cand eventually it got so itchy in my mind that I thought it was time to set about answering it properly.\u201d She met Morag Styles and David Whitley from the Centre for Research in Children\u2019s Literature at Cambridge\u2019s Faculty of Education, who encouraged her to take this thinking further. With her thesis nearing completion, Blake has found that the number of anthologies declined as government regulation of the curriculum increased. In the 1980s there were more than 50 in circulation, covering around 7,000 poems. Today, there are four, featuring just 129 poems in total.</p> <p>\u201cThe constant changes to the national curriculum meant awarding bodies had to keep changing their GCSE specifications,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn time, they moved from recommending or specifying commercially produced book-form anthologies to producing their own A4 examination booklets of poems. These had advantages in that every pupil got one to keep, and that when you think about it is an extraordinary thing for children who don\u2019t come from a house of books, but their production values aren\u2019t the same.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years, the number of female poets selected has increased dramatically. In 1974, there was not a single woman included in the Worlds anthology, a situation that Blake says would be unthinkable now.</p> <p>\u201cEven with 129 poems, as now,\u201d she says, \u201cthere is a joyful inclusion of poems by lots of different outstanding female poets, from Emily Dickinson to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/imtiaz-dharker\">Imtiaz Dharker</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The national curriculum also established the requirement in 1988 that literature from different countries and cultures should be included, she explains. \u201cSo we have had a wonderful range of poems included in GCSE anthologies by poets such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/daljit-nagra\">Daljit Nagra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/17/derek-walcott-obituary\">Derek Walcott</a>, Grace Nichols, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/audio/2014/oct/13/john-agard-poetry-podcast-half-caste-diversity-race\">John Agard</a>, Imtiaz Dharker, Sujata Bhatt, and many others. These poems appear alongside and in dialogue with poems by other classic, modern and contemporary poets.\u201d</p> <p>Her exhibition includes a copy of Songes and Sonettes, also known as Tottel\u2019s Miscellany, which Richard Tottel first published in 1557, making it the first printed anthology of poems in English. Including poems by Henry Howard, Thomas Wyatt and Nicholas Grimald, it sees Tottel exhorting his \u201cunlearned\u201d readers to use the poems to help purge their \u201cswinelike grossness\u201d. Alongside Tottel\u2019s Miscellany sits the 1985 anthology Touched With Fire, which, four centuries later, also included Wyatt, and the poem beginning: \u201cThey flee from me that sometime did me seek.\u201d</p> <p>Blake has also included A Legacy for Young Ladies, an 1826 anthology of letters and poems addressed to young women by the poet Anna Laetitia Barbauld, and published posthumously by her niece Lucy Aikin. \u201cThough not strictly a school poetry anthology, writers such as Barbauld, Hannah More and Maria Edgeworth argued for a better education for girls, and this book contributed to that discourse,\u201d says Blake, who exhibits it next to the 1989 anthology Fire the Sun. \u201cAn explicitly feminist anthology, this offered poems attending to many different dimensions of female experience, including Ntozake Shange\u2019s Get It and Feel Good.

Khan, a Pakistani national who came to the UK nine years ago and overstayed his visa, was refused a lifesaving heart transplant just before Christmas because of his ineligibility for free healthcare. Now he\u2019s been told that he will be charged before he can receive end-of-life care.

It goes against every professional ethic and our Hippocratic oath.

But two years ago, in a bid to eliminate so-called health tourism, the Conservative government introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/23/rules-allowing-upfront-charges-for-foreign-users-of-nhs-come-into-force\" title=\"\">new regulations</a>. These require NHS trusts in England to charge refused asylum seekers, those who have overstayed their visa, certain EU citizens and those from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland who are not studying or working for most healthcare. They can still see a GP free of charge, but they must pay up to 150% of the cost of their hospital care before they can be treated.</p> <p>Patients needing urgent or \u201cimmediately necessary\u201d hospital treatment are still entitled to it. However, healthcare professionals and charities say the rules are being flouted and applied inconsistently. \u201cHospitals are going overboard,\u201d says Dr Dana Beale, a GP at <a href=\"http://www.greatchapelst.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Great Chapel Street Medical Centre</a> in London who focuses on homeless people. \u201cI heard of one case where a mental health trust was asking for a council tax bill, ID and a utility bill before they provided any treatment.\u201d But a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/21/who-report-migrants-refugees-health-western-countries\" title=\"\">report by the World Health Organisation</a> this week found that charging migrants for healthcare was a false economy and cost governments more. \u201cCountries tend to use costs as a justification of limiting or delaying healthcare access to newcomers or providing emergency access only,\u201d said Dr Santino Severoni, the coordinator of public health and migration for WHO Europe. \u201cBut this is not cost-effective \u2013 early identification costs less than delaying until absolutely necessary hospital treatment\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6387d9c951477eed244fbab6045c00e023ea09be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6387d9c951477eed244fbab6045c00e023ea09be/0_0_720_960/375.jpg\" alt=\"Nasar Ullah Khan, who was denied NHS treatment as he overstayed his visa\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nasar Ullah Khan, who was denied NHS treatment as he overstayed his visa</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the changes have left healthcare professionals powerless to treat patients as the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\" title=\"\">hostile environment policy</a> encroaches on the NHS. \u201cAs a result of this cruel policy, overstretched NHS hospitals are put under increased pressure to carry out immigration checks. Meanwhile, vulnerable patients are dying from lack of treatment,\u201d says Anna Miller, UK policy and advocacy manager at <a href=\"https://www.doctorsoftheworld.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Doctors of the World</a>, which runs a clinic providing free treatment in London to people excluded from mainstream healthcare. \u201cHospitals are getting much more efficient and better at identifying patients who can be charged for their treatment. When the law was first introduced, it didn\u2019t bring about much of a change on the ground but it feels now that it\u2019s beginning to bite ... On every level we\u2019re seeing more patients refused treatment.\u201d</p> <p>In December, four medical bodies representing more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/20/medical-colleges-criticise-charging-migrants-for-nhs-care\" title=\"\">70,000 doctors urged ministers to suspend the rules</a> that force hospitals to charge overseas visitors upfront for NHS care. The situation has ramifications for the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/immigration/eu-migration-and-uk/\" title=\"\">3.7 million EU citizens</a> living in the UK.

      "bodyText": "Nasar Ullah Khan is lying in a hospital bed in Birmingham. He is 38 and has weeks, if not days, left to live. Khan, a Pakistani national who came to the UK nine years ago and overstayed his visa, was refused a lifesaving heart transplant just before Christmas because of his ineligibility for free healthcare. Now he\u2019s been told that he will be charged before he can receive end-of-life care. He was handed his first invoice for \u00a316,000 on New Year\u2019s Eve, days after he was told he would probably die within a month. The payment for hospital treatment already received is due at the end of January. \u201cIt\u2019s completely gut-wrenching,\u201d says Elizabeth Bates, a Birmingham GP who is working with Doctors of the World. \u201cKnowing that he\u2019s been handed bills in his hospital room after he\u2019s been given a dreadful diagnosis \u2026 I cannot understand what the philosophy of the people running the hospital is and how they expect that to impact on the clinical staff and on the patient sitting in front of them.\u201d Bates, who has been helping Khan, says refusing to help care for him while he is dying is especially unfeeling. \u201cEverybody is appalled that he might be charged for palliative care. It goes against every professional ethic and our Hippocratic oath. We should be treating people according to need.\u201d Before 2017, migrants and visitors to the UK not eligible for free healthcare were entitled to receive it and be billed afterwards. But two years ago, in a bid to eliminate so-called health tourism, the Conservative government introduced new regulations. These require NHS trusts in England to charge refused asylum seekers, those who have overstayed their visa, certain EU citizens and those from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland who are not studying or working for most healthcare. They can still see a GP free of charge, but they must pay up to 150% of the cost of their hospital care before they can be treated. Patients needing urgent or \u201cimmediately necessary\u201d hospital treatment are still entitled to it. However, healthcare professionals and charities say the rules are being flouted and applied inconsistently. \u201cHospitals are going overboard,\u201d says Dr Dana Beale, a GP at Great Chapel Street Medical Centre in London who focuses on homeless people. \u201cI heard of one case where a mental health trust was asking for a council tax bill, ID and a utility bill before they provided any treatment.\u201d But a report by the World Health Organisation this week found that charging migrants for healthcare was a false economy and cost governments more. \u201cCountries tend to use costs as a justification of limiting or delaying healthcare access to newcomers or providing emergency access only,\u201d said Dr Santino Severoni, the coordinator of public health and migration for WHO Europe. \u201cBut this is not cost-effective \u2013 early identification costs less than delaying until absolutely necessary hospital treatment\u201d. Meanwhile, the changes have left healthcare professionals powerless to treat patients as the government\u2019s hostile environment policy encroaches on the NHS. \u201cAs a result of this cruel policy, overstretched NHS hospitals are put under increased pressure to carry out immigration checks. Meanwhile, vulnerable patients are dying from lack of treatment,\u201d says Anna Miller, UK policy and advocacy manager at Doctors of the World, which runs a clinic providing free treatment in London to people excluded from mainstream healthcare. \u201cHospitals are getting much more efficient and better at identifying patients who can be charged for their treatment. When the law was first introduced, it didn\u2019t bring about much of a change on the ground but it feels now that it\u2019s beginning to bite ... On every level we\u2019re seeing more patients refused treatment.\u201d In December, four medical bodies representing more than 70,000 doctors urged ministers to suspend the rules that force hospitals to charge overseas visitors upfront for NHS care. The situation has ramifications for the 3.7 million EU citizens living in the UK. In the event of a hard Brexit, they would need to apply for settled status, or pre-settled status if they have lived in the UK less than five years, while new arrivals to the UK from the EU after Brexit might not have access to hospital treatment unless they paid for it. The policy is creating administrative headaches for already overstretched GPs. \u201cSeven years ago, I\u2019d do a referral and they [migrant patients] would get seen and sorted out,\u201d says Beale\u2019s colleague, Dr Natalie Miller. \u201cSomebody might be billed in retrospect, but if they couldn\u2019t pay nothing would happen.

His presence was always such a reassuring one that it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise, even now, to switch on TMS and hear his sensible tones expressing some surprise at an outrageous choice of shot or an outre hairstyle. Something of the world at least would be back in its rightful place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/21/shai-hope-west-indies-england-first-test-cricket\">Shai Hope aims to beat the England team he might have played for</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An unfashionably old-style Englishman, slightly out of place in the late 20th century, let alone the 21st, he nevertheless treated everyone, from hotel receptionist to taxi driver, with a hundred small courtesies (always, in The Spin\u2019s book, a pretty good signal of someone\u2019s humanity).</p> <p>Way back in the 1990s I was asked by my friend the late journalist Charlie de Lisle, who had co-written a book \u2013 An Australian Summer \u2013 with CMJ, to interview him for publicity purposes. I set off on one of those sweet summer days where a breath of the morning air is enough to have you cartwheeling barefoot down the garden path, to his beautiful house in deepest Sussex where I was given coffee by his wife Judy before being invited into CMJ\u2019s book-lined study. Probably tongue-tied and definitely overawed, I jotted down everything I could see on the shelves whenever I thought CMJ wasn\u2019t looking.</p> <p>The piece never saw the light of day, I can\u2019t now remember what was on the shelves and the dictaphone tape was lost long ago, but I hold tightly to the memory of a kind, impeccably polite man who gave thoughtful answers to what would have been rambling questions as his friendly black labrador pottered to and fro.</p> <p>He was the same person on TMS and a good starting-point for Cook, who has raised a few eyebrows with his pre-microphone pronouncements.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to criticise James Anderson if he has a bad day,\u201d he said in the Sunday Times. \u201cBroady too. There is no way around it. We have been through so much together, especially Jimmy. I have too much respect for him and I am too friendly with him.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Cook has been scarred by the experiences of his own former captain Andrew Strauss. Strauss had thought about giving commentary a go, before he accidentally called Kevin Pietersen \u201ca complete cunt\u201d when he thought he was off-air during a stint at Lord\u2019s for Sky. He soon gave up any thoughts of a media career and went on to join the England and Wales Cricket Board.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0772ac219b011b9261ed9822f42241fa800f1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0772ac219b011b9261ed9822f42241fa800f1e/0_1327_2779_1666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CMJ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mild-mannered Christopher Martin-Jenkins sparked anger in the Caribbean during England\u2019s 1990 tour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dack / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>CMJ shared Cook\u2019s reluctance to engage in personal criticism but managed to find a way round it with measured tones and sometimes a little exasperation. It didn\u2019t destroy his relationship with players, who respected his innate fairness and deep love of the game.</p> <p>Though not even CMJ could avoid all controversy \u2013 his biggest brush with it came in Barbados, where England\u2019s tour proper starts on Wednesday with the first Test at Bridgetown. It was 1990 and England were, incredibly, leading the series 1-0 going into the fourth Test and West Indies were in the unfamiliar position of rubbing their heels on the ropes.</p> <p>CMJ was in the commentary box when late in the afternoon Rob Bailey was given out caught down the legside by the umpire Lloyd Barker after Viv Richards had embarked on an extravagant celebration. CMJ pondered on air that a very good umpire had cracked under pressure.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his mistake that was so sad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the fact that [he] was pressurised into changing his original decision. If that is gamesmanship or professionalism, I am not quite sure what cheating is.\u201d</p> <p>The local reaction was firecracker hot \u2013 with accusations of whinging, colonialism and racism. CMJ was banned from the Voice of Barbados, who held a day-long phone in on the matter, the local newspaper reported on \u201cbiased Brits\u201d and Barker issued a writ for defamation. When play restarted after the rest day, crowds protested outside the ground, with placards suggesting that prison might be a suitable punishment.</p> <p>CMJ was horrified and apologised to Barker but the whole scene left an unpleasant taste on what was a tumultuous tour (which West Indies went on to win 2-1). The writ was settled two years later and bygones slowly became bygones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/21/moeen-ali-england-sole-spinner-west-indies\">Moeen Ali makes peace with role as England\u2019s sole spinner in West Indies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barbados was also the scene of another, more amusing CMJ moment. Vic Marks remembers him being lent a rather upmarket set of golf clubs. \u201cAs he was driving through Bridgetown in a mini moke he had the bag lodged in the back. CMJ could be an erratic driver which may have contributed to the sad fact that one by one the clubs bounced out of the bag on to the road without him noticing. He was crestfallen when discovering their disappearance, and when broadcasting on the local station the following day at the Test match he made a plaintive appeal that any stray golf clubs that had been found on the streets of Bridgetown might be returned to him at the Kensington Oval. But none were forthcoming.\u201d</p> <p>And it was in West Indies, though Jamaica not Barbados, that the best CMJ story of all took place. CMJ was on the golf course when he tried to phone the office with an urgent message \u2013 using the TV remote control from his room. That, at least, is a step Cook is unlikely to replicate.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-spin\" title=\"\"><strong><em>To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions</em></strong></a>.</p>",

It seems unbelievable that it was just over six years ago (1 January 2013), that Christopher Martin-Jenkins slipped quietly away to his celestial Lord\u2019s, at the age of 67, after suffering from cancer. His presence was always such a reassuring one that it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise, even now, to switch on TMS and hear his sensible tones expressing some surprise at an outrageous choice of shot or an outre hairstyle. Something of the world at least would be back in its rightful place. An unfashionably old-style Englishman, slightly out of place in the late 20th century, let alone the 21st, he nevertheless treated everyone, from hotel receptionist to taxi driver, with a hundred small courtesies (always, in The Spin\u2019s book, a pretty good signal of someone\u2019s humanity). Way back in the 1990s I was asked by my friend the late journalist Charlie de Lisle, who had co-written a book \u2013 An Australian Summer \u2013 with CMJ, to interview him for publicity purposes. I set off on one of those sweet summer days where a breath of the morning air is enough to have you cartwheeling barefoot down the garden path, to his beautiful house in deepest Sussex where I was given coffee by his wife Judy before being invited into CMJ\u2019s book-lined study. Probably tongue-tied and definitely overawed, I jotted down everything I could see on the shelves whenever I thought CMJ wasn\u2019t looking. The piece never saw the light of day, I can\u2019t now remember what was on the shelves and the dictaphone tape was lost long ago, but I hold tightly to the memory of a kind, impeccably polite man who gave thoughtful answers to what would have been rambling questions as his friendly black labrador pottered to and fro. He was the same person on TMS and a good starting-point for Cook, who has raised a few eyebrows with his pre-microphone pronouncements. \u201cI am not going to criticise James Anderson if he has a bad day,\u201d he said in the Sunday Times. \u201cBroady too. There is no way around it. We have been through so much together, especially Jimmy. I have too much respect for him and I am too friendly with him.\u201d Perhaps Cook has been scarred by the experiences of his own former captain Andrew Strauss. Strauss had thought about giving commentary a go, before he accidentally called Kevin Pietersen \u201ca complete cunt\u201d when he thought he was off-air during a stint at Lord\u2019s for Sky. He soon gave up any thoughts of a media career and went on to join the England and Wales Cricket Board. CMJ shared Cook\u2019s reluctance to engage in personal criticism but managed to find a way round it with measured tones and sometimes a little exasperation. It didn\u2019t destroy his relationship with players, who respected his innate fairness and deep love of the game. Though not even CMJ could avoid all controversy \u2013 his biggest brush with it came in Barbados, where England\u2019s tour proper starts on Wednesday with the first Test at Bridgetown. It was 1990 and England were, incredibly, leading the series 1-0 going into the fourth Test and West Indies were in the unfamiliar position of rubbing their heels on the ropes. CMJ was in the commentary box when late in the afternoon Rob Bailey was given out caught down the legside by the umpire Lloyd Barker after Viv Richards had embarked on an extravagant celebration. CMJ pondered on air that a very good umpire had cracked under pressure. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his mistake that was so sad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the fact that [he] was pressurised into changing his original decision. If that is gamesmanship or professionalism, I am not quite sure what cheating is.\u201d The local reaction was firecracker hot \u2013 with accusations of whinging, colonialism and racism. CMJ was banned from the Voice of Barbados, who held a day-long phone in on the matter, the local newspaper reported on \u201cbiased Brits\u201d and Barker issued a writ for defamation. When play restarted after the rest day, crowds protested outside the ground, with placards suggesting that prison might be a suitable punishment. CMJ was horrified and apologised to Barker but the whole scene left an unpleasant taste on what was a tumultuous tour (which West Indies went on to win 2-1). The writ was settled two years later and bygones slowly became bygones. Barbados was also the scene of another, more amusing CMJ moment. Vic Marks remembers him being lent a rather upmarket set of golf clubs. \u201cAs he was driving through Bridgetown in a mini moke he had the bag lodged in the back. CMJ could be an erratic driver which may have contributed to the sad fact that one by one the clubs bounced out of the bag on to the road without him noticing. He was crestfallen when discovering their disappearance, and when broadcasting on the local station the following day at the Test match he made a plaintive appeal that any stray golf clubs that had been found on the streets of Bridgetown might be returned to him at the Kensington Oval. But none were forthcoming.\u201d And it was in West Indies, though Jamaica not Barbados, that the best CMJ story of all took place. CMJ was on the golf course when he tried to phone the office with an urgent message \u2013 using the TV remote control from his room. That, at least, is a step Cook is unlikely to replicate. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

It\u2019s rather worrying, not least because the last time this happened, in 1989, an infamous debacle ensued \u2013 a strange opening number involving Snow White, Rob Lowe and a rendition of I\u2019ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like a failure, and an ominous sign of our inability to sustain any kind of shared stage,\u201d says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skornhaber?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Spencer Kornhaber</a>, a pop culture journalist for the Atlantic. \u201cNo one is able to step up to the plate and just tell some jokes and get out of the way.\u201d</p> <p>This confusion is one place where the Oscars can claim a type of relevance, although not the type it wants. As its TV audience has dwindled, the Academy has tried to shake things up by hiring a variety of \u201cedgy\u201d hosts. Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Seth Macfarlane, the bizarre pairing of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1S_vCW69jE\">James Franco and Anne Hathaway</a>: you can\u2019t say they haven\u2019t tried.

And there\u2019s just so much at risk.\u201d</p> <p>At first, Hart seemed the ideal host, especially as he was one of the few who had actively campaigned for it. Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/05/oscars-host-kevin-hart-homophobia-is-no-laughing-matter\">his uncovered tweets</a> from 10 years ago \u2013 in which he called someone \u201cfat-faced fag\u201d \u2013 created a furore. It\u2019s a distinctly 2019 scenario.</p> <p>Not that it\u2019s unclear why Hart had to go. But there remains the fundamental problem that any compere is expected to be edgy, but not too edgy. There\u2019s a line, but no one quite knows where it lies. Perhaps the clearest example is Ricky Gervais\u2019s stint at the Golden Globes, which drew both cackles and gasps when he did three in a row from 2010-12 (and again, less controversially, in 2016).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be0f79293dded3cd403c7ef0d3fdc4feee72360d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be0f79293dded3cd403c7ef0d3fdc4feee72360d/0_219_5125_3075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Furore \u2026 Kevin Hart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Furore \u2026 Kevin Hart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gags about Angelina Jolie\u2019s brood of kids or Robert Downey Jr\u2019s stints in rehab <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/ricky-gervais-vs-hollywood-his-most-f-ked-up-golden-globes-jokes-67332/\">delighted some and disgusted others</a>. Oddly, that degree of brazenness now seems a relic of another time. \u201cAs much as I dislike Ricky Gervais, there was something kind of fun about his run,\u201d says Abramovitch (who found Samberg and Oh \u201ccompletely forgettable\u201d). \u201cI think that era is over \u2013 people are too sensitive now. But the danger of it was fun.\u201d</p> <p>The loose expectation of an awards host is to act as a court jester among showbusiness royalty, poking fun at their foibles. The problem is that these events thrive on a sense of their own prestige, so it doesn\u2019t do to jest too much. And this is the age of \u201cwokeness\u201d, where people \u2013 particularly that crucial younger audience \u2013 are more conscious of gags revolving around gender, sexuality and race.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a generational thing,\u201d says Abramovitch, who is 46. \u201cWith my generation, it was still OK to poke some things, but the millennial generation are a lot more sensitive. It\u2019s hard for them to understand context or satire.\u201d Not that he thinks it is all political correctness gone mad. \u201cThis reckoning that\u2019s happening, it\u2019s all good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e76b115ad74d2e47279cafd533c98f87ec447782\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76b115ad74d2e47279cafd533c98f87ec447782/0_147_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Wolf at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Too hot to handle \u2026 Michelle Wolf roasted the president at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron P Bernstein/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When causing offence is almost inevitable, it takes a strong stomach to want to give it a go. I spoke, on condition of anonymity, to an events organiser who helps put together an important awards ceremony in London. \u201cI\u2019ve found it trickier to find a host this year,\u201d they said. \u201cYou want a big name \u2013 but they don\u2019t need to do it.\u201d The reasons for hosting an event have changed, the organiser suggests: comedians have other platforms to showcase their talents. Often they don\u2019t need the money. And yes, there is the danger of saying the wrong thing. \u201cYou have to be so careful, don\u2019t you? Because the backlash can be extreme.\u201d</p> <p>In Britain, even the dependable Bafta hosts <a href=\"https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/graham-norton-pokes-fun-at-sheridan-smith-and-caroline-flack-in-biting-opening-bafta-tv-monologue-734320.html\">Graham Norton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/14/stephen-fry-hits-back-at-criticism-of-baftas-bag-lady-joke-she-got-it-derrr\">Stephen Fry</a> have landed in hot water for jokes deemed too rude. Perhaps it just shows that you can never please everyone, and possibly also that camp \u2013 such a good way of saying naughty things politely \u2013 cannot cover for every sin. Nevertheless, the UK\u2019s culture wars still seem less savage than in America, where things have ramped up since a certain reality TV star was elected president in 2016.\u201cTrump is trying to destroy popular culture,\u201d Kornhaber says. The \u201cmonoculture\u201d, that sense of all of us enjoying mainstream events together, has already been frayed by the rise of the internet. But this is something Trump has only accentuated, says Kornhaber: \u201cHe has actually gone of out of his way to play up the cultural divides.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33effbebeb74f75f12bb525057024bace8040b0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33effbebeb74f75f12bb525057024bace8040b0d/230_0_2777_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beyonc\u00e9, Chris Martin and Bruno Mars at the 2016 Super Bowl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star-studded showcase \u2026 Beyonc\u00e9, Chris Martin and Bruno Mars at the 2016 Super Bowl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This attitude applies to everything from the Super Bowl to the Oscars to the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner: Trump\u2019s persona is anti-establishment, and there\u2019s nothing he loves more than blasting a Hollywood system that long mocked and ignored him. His <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/magazine/nfl-owners-trump-football.html\">battles with the NFL</a>, for instance, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/30/colin-kaepernick-grievance-nfl-trial\">in dispute with</a> the footballer Kaepernick, who in turn is regularly attacked by Trump, is a perfect storm of sports, race, showbiz and politics. Similarly, Trump has managed to toxify the issue whenever \u201cany comedian makes a joke about him in a high-profile forum\u201d, points out Kornhaber. \u201cIt becomes this fake debate about decorum and how to respect the president, because the president is firing back.\u201d</p> <p>The Super Bowl has always had a problem when its performers get too racy \u2013 consider the vitriol around Janet Jackson\u2019s 2004 \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d. Where awards ceremonies struggle with humour, the half-time show struggles with the typical rock\u2019n\u2019roll tropes of sex and rebellion. Yet it\u2019s striking when a superstar like Rihanna decides she would rather pass on a potential TV audience of 150 million. There is a whole other fanbase she would rather speak to; and that reminds us just how fragmented the cultural conversation has become.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ceaeb58804682b6db18d8c8e5b2e682c16e8647b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceaeb58804682b6db18d8c8e5b2e682c16e8647b/69_40_2569_1541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edgy \u2026 Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Repeat offender \u2026 Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Drinkwater/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We saw a symptom of this in 2016, when Coldplay\u2019s bland set suddenly featured a guest spot from Beyonc\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/08/beyonce-black-panthers-homage-black-lives-matter-super-bowl-50\">in what seemed to be an all-black Angela Davis tribute</a>. It was two dissonant worldviews colliding, with only an Uptown Funk finale as a kind of glue. Cardi B could have done something similar with Maroon 5\u2019s set this year. As it is, her fellow rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/13/big-boi-travis-scott-super-bowl-halftime-show-protests\">Travis Scott</a> is now scheduled to appear alongside the band, and is being hotly <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/kendis-gibson/watch/travis-scott-at-super-bowl-raises-concerns-in-kaepernick-era-1429203011716\">criticised for it</a>.</p> <p>Which leads us to the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner, a more niche event already widely begrudged for its tuxedoed cosying-up between Washington\u2019s political elite and the fourth estate. Yet its dilemma could be the most telling. Last year Wolf took the traditional \u201croast\u201d brief of the host seriously, giving Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, a thorough going-over, as the subject sat through it stony-faced. (Trump boycotts the dinner.) Wolf got a pasting, which has left many bemused. \u201cThey threw her under a bus,\u201d says Abramovitch. \u201cAnd now, when we need this more than ever, they\u2019re wimping out and taking the safe route.\u201d</p> <p>In the Trump era, though, many feel exhausted and trapped: hit back harder and you are just entrenching yourself; don\u2019t hit back at all and it\u2019s a type of appeasement. What should be simple entertainment is now anything but. Perhaps the greatest story showbiz likes to tell is that we\u2019re all one big happy family. In today\u2019s vituperative climate, that\u2019s a story no one wants to tell or hear.</p>",

It\u2019s rather worrying, not least because the last time this happened, in 1989, an infamous debacle ensued \u2013 a strange opening number involving Snow White, Rob Lowe and a rendition of I\u2019ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts. \u201cIt feels like a failure, and an ominous sign of our inability to sustain any kind of shared stage,\u201d says Spencer Kornhaber, a pop culture journalist for the Atlantic. \u201cNo one is able to step up to the plate and just tell some jokes and get out of the way.\u201d This confusion is one place where the Oscars can claim a type of relevance, although not the type it wants. As its TV audience has dwindled, the Academy has tried to shake things up by hiring a variety of \u201cedgy\u201d hosts. Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Seth Macfarlane, the bizarre pairing of James Franco and Anne Hathaway: you can\u2019t say they haven\u2019t tried. But the reception has been lukewarm. The list of potential hosts is always short, points out Seth Abramovitch of the Hollywood Reporter: \u201cThey typically struggle to find someone because there isn\u2019t a lot of upside to it, they want someone of a certain stature, the show is on ABC so it can\u2019t be someone from a competing network, and they want someone with a wide variety of skills \u2013 but primarily being a comedian. And there\u2019s just so much at risk.\u201d At first, Hart seemed the ideal host, especially as he was one of the few who had actively campaigned for it. Yet his uncovered tweets from 10 years ago \u2013 in which he called someone \u201cfat-faced fag\u201d \u2013 created a furore. It\u2019s a distinctly 2019 scenario. Not that it\u2019s unclear why Hart had to go. But there remains the fundamental problem that any compere is expected to be edgy, but not too edgy. There\u2019s a line, but no one quite knows where it lies. Perhaps the clearest example is Ricky Gervais\u2019s stint at the Golden Globes, which drew both cackles and gasps when he did three in a row from 2010-12 (and again, less controversially, in 2016). Gags about Angelina Jolie\u2019s brood of kids or Robert Downey Jr\u2019s stints in rehab delighted some and disgusted others. Oddly, that degree of brazenness now seems a relic of another time. \u201cAs much as I dislike Ricky Gervais, there was something kind of fun about his run,\u201d says Abramovitch (who found Samberg and Oh \u201ccompletely forgettable\u201d). \u201cI think that era is over \u2013 people are too sensitive now. But the danger of it was fun.\u201d The loose expectation of an awards host is to act as a court jester among showbusiness royalty, poking fun at their foibles. The problem is that these events thrive on a sense of their own prestige, so it doesn\u2019t do to jest too much. And this is the age of \u201cwokeness\u201d, where people \u2013 particularly that crucial younger audience \u2013 are more conscious of gags revolving around gender, sexuality and race. \u201cI think it\u2019s a generational thing,\u201d says Abramovitch, who is 46. \u201cWith my generation, it was still OK to poke some things, but the millennial generation are a lot more sensitive. It\u2019s hard for them to understand context or satire.\u201d Not that he thinks it is all political correctness gone mad. \u201cThis reckoning that\u2019s happening, it\u2019s all good.\u201d When causing offence is almost inevitable, it takes a strong stomach to want to give it a go. I spoke, on condition of anonymity, to an events organiser who helps put together an important awards ceremony in London. \u201cI\u2019ve found it trickier to find a host this year,\u201d they said. \u201cYou want a big name \u2013 but they don\u2019t need to do it.\u201d The reasons for hosting an event have changed, the organiser suggests: comedians have other platforms to showcase their talents. Often they don\u2019t need the money. And yes, there is the danger of saying the wrong thing. \u201cYou have to be so careful, don\u2019t you? Because the backlash can be extreme.\u201d In Britain, even the dependable Bafta hosts Graham Norton and Stephen Fry have landed in hot water for jokes deemed too rude. Perhaps it just shows that you can never please everyone, and possibly also that camp \u2013 such a good way of saying naughty things politely \u2013 cannot cover for every sin. Nevertheless, the UK\u2019s culture wars still seem less savage than in America, where things have ramped up since a certain reality TV star was elected president in 2016.\u201cTrump is trying to destroy popular culture,\u201d Kornhaber says. The \u201cmonoculture\u201d, that sense of all of us enjoying mainstream events together, has already been frayed by the rise of the internet. But this is something Trump has only accentuated, says Kornhaber: \u201cHe has actually gone of out of his way to play up the cultural divides.\u201d This attitude applies to everything from the Super Bowl to the Oscars to the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner: Trump\u2019s persona is anti-establishment, and there\u2019s nothing he loves more than blasting a Hollywood system that long mocked and ignored him. His battles with the NFL, for instance, which is in dispute with the footballer Kaepernick, who in turn is regularly attacked by Trump, is a perfect storm of sports, race, showbiz and politics. Similarly, Trump has managed to toxify the issue whenever \u201cany comedian makes a joke about him in a high-profile forum\u201d, points out Kornhaber. \u201cIt becomes this fake debate about decorum and how to respect the president, because the president is firing back.\u201d The Super Bowl has always had a problem when its performers get too racy \u2013 consider the vitriol around Janet Jackson\u2019s 2004 \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d. Where awards ceremonies struggle with humour, the half-time show struggles with the typical rock\u2019n\u2019roll tropes of sex and rebellion. Yet it\u2019s striking when a superstar like Rihanna decides she would rather pass on a potential TV audience of 150 million. There is a whole other fanbase she would rather speak to; and that reminds us just how fragmented the cultural conversation has become. We saw a symptom of this in 2016, when Coldplay\u2019s bland set suddenly featured a guest spot from Beyonc\u00e9, in what seemed to be an all-black Angela Davis tribute. It was two dissonant worldviews colliding, with only an Uptown Funk finale as a kind of glue. Cardi B could have done something similar with Maroon 5\u2019s set this year. As it is, her fellow rapper Travis Scott is now scheduled to appear alongside the band, and is being hotly criticised for it. Which leads us to the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner, a more niche event already widely begrudged for its tuxedoed cosying-up between Washington\u2019s political elite and the fourth estate. Yet its dilemma could be the most telling. Last year Wolf took the traditional \u201croast\u201d brief of the host seriously, giving Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, a thorough going-over, as the subject sat through it stony-faced. (Trump boycotts the dinner.) Wolf got a pasting, which has left many bemused. \u201cThey threw her under a bus,\u201d says Abramovitch. \u201cAnd now, when we need this more than ever, they\u2019re wimping out and taking the safe route.\u201d In the Trump era, though, many feel exhausted and trapped: hit back harder and you are just entrenching yourself; don\u2019t hit back at all and it\u2019s a type of appeasement. What should be simple entertainment is now anything but. Perhaps the greatest story showbiz likes to tell is that we\u2019re all one big happy family. In today\u2019s vituperative climate, that\u2019s a story no one wants to tell or hear.",

Hence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/17/glass-review-m-night-shyamalan-samuel-l-jackson-james-mcavoy\">Glass</a>, the new film from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mnightshyamalan\">M Night Shyamalan</a>, extending the story of his earlier films <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/dec/29/culture.peterbradshaw\">Unbreakable</a> (2000) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/27/split-review-james-mcavoy-m-night-shyamalan-fantastic-fest-austin\">Split</a> (2017). Uniting the casts of those two titles \u2013 notably James McAvoy, Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson \u2013 looked like a strategy to give the director his biggest hit in more than a decade.</p> <p>So far, Glass looks set to do just that, with a UK debut of \u00a33.33m (\u00a33.42m including previews). That compares with \u00a32.56m for Split exactly two years ago. Unbreakable debuted on the last weekend of 2000 with just over \u00a32m. In the US, Glass began with just over $40m, for which the UK equivalent would be \u00a34m. Split also opened in the US with $40m, and the UK debut fell short of the equivalent figure.</p> <p>Split became a word-of-mouth hit in the UK, eventually reaching \u00a311.4m. It\u2019s uncertain whether the much hyped Glass will match that total: it will depend on how broader audiences respond once the initial fanbase is used up.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnqjSgMU36U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wnqjSgMU36U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>The runner-up: Mary Queen of Scots</strong></h2> <p>Another week, and another awards contender lands in cinemas \u2013 this time from British production powerhouse Working Title. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/16/mary-queen-of-scots-review-saoirse-ronan-margot-robbie-power-politics\">Mary Queen of Scots</a>, the big-screen debut of acclaimed theatre director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/josie-rourke\">Josie Rourke</a>, boasts a classy cast led by Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie, who were both nominated for the best actress Oscar a year ago, respectively for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/15/lady-bird-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-laurie-metcalf\">Lady Bird</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/22/i-tonya-review-margot-robbie-figure-skating\">I, Tonya</a> \u2013 losing to Frances McDormand.</p> <p>Mary Queen of Scots opened solidly with \u00a32.08m, including negligible previews, from 499 cinemas.

Total after 10 days is a sturdy \u00a36.1m. The biographical comedy-drama is likely to be one of this awards season\u2019s contenders with the broadest appeal, at least in the UK, where it is set.</p> <p>The Favourite, which climbed 9% on its second weekend, now dips 44% with its third session. Still, 20th Century Fox will be pleased with its total so far of \u00a311.1m, and the edgy costume drama should be sustained by its prominent position in the awards race.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y23HyopQxEg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y23HyopQxEg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>The plucky alternative: Beautiful Boy</strong></h2> <p>Indie cinemas are chock-a-block with Mary Queen of Scots, Stan &amp; Ollie and The Favourite as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/09/colette-review-keria-knightley-dominic-west-wash-westmoreland\">Colette</a>, so StudioCanal made the sensible decision not to push too wide with its own awards contender, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/16/beautiful-boy-review-steve-carell-timothee-chalamet-david-nic-sheff-drugs-addiction\">Beautiful Boy</a>, the true story of how one young man\u2019s drug addiction affected his family.

Including previews, the total rises to \u00a3361,000 \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t enough to earn a place in the UK Top 10.</p> <h2><strong>The market</strong></h2> <p>Despite the arrival of Glass and Mary Queen of Scots and solid numbers from Stan &amp; Ollie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/12/mary-poppins-returns-review-sequel-emily-blunt\">Mary Poppins Returns</a> and The Favourite, overall box office is down 30% on the equivalent weekend a year ago. That session was led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/coco-review-pixar-land-of-the-dead-animation\">Coco</a>, whereas the big animations this time around (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2386490/\">How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3513498/\">The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part</a>) don\u2019t arrive until February.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not the whole story. A year ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/13/darkest-hour-review-gary-oldman-toronto-film-festival-tiff\">Darkest Hour</a> was performing better than any of this year\u2019s awards contenders, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/20/the-greatest-showman-review-pt-barnum-hugh-jackman\">The Greatest Showman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/09/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-review-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-jack-black-karen-gillan\">Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</a> were also steady contributors to the money pot.

      "bodyText": "The winner: Glass While the January release calendar is traditionally dominated by awards bait, not everybody wants to binge on prestige dramas for a whole month. Hence Glass, the new film from M Night Shyamalan, extending the story of his earlier films Unbreakable (2000) and Split (2017). Uniting the casts of those two titles \u2013 notably James McAvoy, Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson \u2013 looked like a strategy to give the director his biggest hit in more than a decade. So far, Glass looks set to do just that, with a UK debut of \u00a33.33m (\u00a33.42m including previews). That compares with \u00a32.56m for Split exactly two years ago. Unbreakable debuted on the last weekend of 2000 with just over \u00a32m. In the US, Glass began with just over $40m, for which the UK equivalent would be \u00a34m. Split also opened in the US with $40m, and the UK debut fell short of the equivalent figure. Split became a word-of-mouth hit in the UK, eventually reaching \u00a311.4m. It\u2019s uncertain whether the much hyped Glass will match that total: it will depend on how broader audiences respond once the initial fanbase is used up. The runner-up: Mary Queen of Scots Another week, and another awards contender lands in cinemas \u2013 this time from British production powerhouse Working Title. Mary Queen of Scots, the big-screen debut of acclaimed theatre director Josie Rourke, boasts a classy cast led by Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie, who were both nominated for the best actress Oscar a year ago, respectively for Lady Bird and I, Tonya \u2013 losing to Frances McDormand. Mary Queen of Scots opened solidly with \u00a32.08m, including negligible previews, from 499 cinemas. That\u2019s a bit down on the debuts for awards-fare hits The Favourite and Stan &amp; Ollie. Most relevant comparisons are with Elizabeth and its sequel Elizabeth: The Golden Age, which reached lifetime totals of \u00a35.54m and \u00a35.22m respectively. Mary Queen of Scots should easily pass those numbers, albeit helped by higher ticket prices. The strong hold: Stan &amp; Ollie Distributor eOne should be happy with the second-weekend performance of Stan &amp; Ollie, down just 26% from its opening session. Total after 10 days is a sturdy \u00a36.1m. The biographical comedy-drama is likely to be one of this awards season\u2019s contenders with the broadest appeal, at least in the UK, where it is set. The Favourite, which climbed 9% on its second weekend, now dips 44% with its third session. Still, 20th Century Fox will be pleased with its total so far of \u00a311.1m, and the edgy costume drama should be sustained by its prominent position in the awards race. The plucky alternative: Beautiful Boy Indie cinemas are chock-a-block with Mary Queen of Scots, Stan &amp; Ollie and The Favourite as well as Colette, so StudioCanal made the sensible decision not to push too wide with its own awards contender, Beautiful Boy, the true story of how one young man\u2019s drug addiction affected his family. Steve Carell and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet star. Beautiful Boy opened with a respectable \u00a3252,000 from 124 cinemas, yielding a site average just above \u00a32,000. Including previews, the total rises to \u00a3361,000 \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t enough to earn a place in the UK Top 10. The market Despite the arrival of Glass and Mary Queen of Scots and solid numbers from Stan &amp; Ollie, Mary Poppins Returns and The Favourite, overall box office is down 30% on the equivalent weekend a year ago. That session was led by Coco, whereas the big animations this time around (How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part) don\u2019t arrive until February. But that\u2019s not the whole story. A year ago, Darkest Hour was performing better than any of this year\u2019s awards contenders, while The Greatest Showman and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle were also steady contributors to the money pot. We currently lack the equivalents. From this Friday, hopes are pinned on the family film A Dog\u2019s Way Home, the Jennifer Lopez comedy Second Act, Clint Eastwood in The Mule and awards contenders Vice and Destroyer. However, it will be a surprise if this crop of new titles can salvage the situation for January. Expect the month to end down on 2018. Top 10 films, 18-20 January 1.

That statistic was not challenged by young American Tiafoe, who was swatted aside 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in only an hour and 47 minutes.</p> \n  <p>Nadal, who extended his winning streak over Americans to 21 straight matches, said: \u201cFor me it\u2019s very emotional to be back in the semi-finals in Melbourne. I had some troubles here in all my career, so to be back means everything to me. Of course I\u2019m very happy with the way that I played tonight.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The 32-year-old has now dismissed two of the next generation in Tiafoe and Alex De Minaur, and must prepare for another one in Stefanos Tsitsipas. \u201cI said a couple of rounds ago that they can wait a little bit, but it looks like they don\u2019t want to wait,\u201d said Nadal with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great year in terms of sharing generations. That makes this sport special.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added of Tsitsipas: \u201cHe\u2019s a player that during the last year he has been improving every month. He\u2019s able to win against the best players of the world already. He\u2019s a great player. He\u2019s unbelievable today but he will have the chance to be one of the best for such a long time.\u201d</p> \n  <p>This has been a breakthrough slam for Tiafoe, who turned 21 on Sunday, but he was simply unable to match the relentless power and consistency of Nadal. He had struggled physically during his fourth-round victory over Grigor Dimitrov, resorting to drinking pickle juice to try to give him energy. His plan was to attack the Spaniard as early as possible in rallies, but, as countless opponents have found, that is much easier said than done and he was firmly on the back foot from the moment he lost his opening service game.</p> \n  <p>After dropping serve again at the start of the second set, Tiafoe had two chances to get back on level terms in the fourth game but could not take either and from there Nadal raced towards the finish line. </p> \n  <p><em>Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report to follow</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c470bf8e4b00173154a9066\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-22T12:26:34.374Z\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And with that, I\u2019m gone.

He has dropped one set in each of his five matches so far, and played seven tie breaks to Nadal\u2019s one. He has played a <em>lot</em> more tennis than Nadal.

To be able to compete in this level, that\u2019s why I wake up every morning and go to the court or to the gym to be a better player.</p> \n   <p>I said a couple of rounds ago, these young players can wait a little bit. It looks like they don\u2019t want to wait. It\u2019s going to be a great year in terms of sharing generations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>John McEnroe tries to convince Rafa to rip off his shirt, as Tiafoe has after his victories in this tournament, but he\u2019s not interested. \u201cYou can do it, I cannot.\u201d Then he\u2019s asked about his semi-final opponent, Stefanos Tsitsipas: </p> \n  <p>He\u2019s a player that during the last year, he has been improving very month. He\u2019s able to win against the best players in the world already. He\u2019s a great player and he\u2019s unbelievable today, but he will have the chance to be one of the best for a long time.</p> \n  <p>McEnroe asks about his forehand, which seems to be perhaps better than ever, as indeed does his serve:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019ve been practicing during the off season, the serve and the first shot, and during this event probably I did it more than ever, the serve and the winner with the first forehand. That\u2019s giving me a lot of free points and that\u2019s so important at this stage in my career. I\u2019m so happy with this improvement. I\u2019m so happy hitting the serve and the first forehand.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Finally, he\u2019s asked about the impact Carlos Moya has made since joining Nadal\u2019s coaching team in late 2016:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Being honest I feel very lucky about all the people I\u2019ve had around me during my whole career. Since Carlos came it\u2019s been a great combination. Carlos is giving me another view of the game too. We were practising since he came a little different. At some point in your career it\u2019s important to change things and find new things. We have a great team working together, and that\u2019s so important for me.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c470544e4b00173154a9008\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-22T11:58:53.609Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Tiafoe is roared from the court.

      "bodyText": "From the Press Association: Rafael Nadal reached his 30th grand slam semi-final with a crushing victory over Frances Tiafoe at the Australian Open. The second seed arrived in Melbourne having not played a match since September because of a series of injury problems but has barely put a foot wrong all fortnight and is the only man not to have dropped a set. That statistic was not challenged by young American Tiafoe, who was swatted aside 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in only an hour and 47 minutes. Nadal, who extended his winning streak over Americans to 21 straight matches, said: \u201cFor me it\u2019s very emotional to be back in the semi-finals in Melbourne. I had some troubles here in all my career, so to be back means everything to me. Of course I\u2019m very happy with the way that I played tonight.\u201d The 32-year-old has now dismissed two of the next generation in Tiafoe and Alex De Minaur, and must prepare for another one in Stefanos Tsitsipas. \u201cI said a couple of rounds ago that they can wait a little bit, but it looks like they don\u2019t want to wait,\u201d said Nadal with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great year in terms of sharing generations. That makes this sport special.\u201d He added of Tsitsipas: \u201cHe\u2019s a player that during the last year he has been improving every month. He\u2019s able to win against the best players of the world already. He\u2019s a great player. He\u2019s unbelievable today but he will have the chance to be one of the best for such a long time.\u201d This has been a breakthrough slam for Tiafoe, who turned 21 on Sunday, but he was simply unable to match the relentless power and consistency of Nadal. He had struggled physically during his fourth-round victory over Grigor Dimitrov, resorting to drinking pickle juice to try to give him energy. His plan was to attack the Spaniard as early as possible in rallies, but, as countless opponents have found, that is much easier said than done and he was firmly on the back foot from the moment he lost his opening service game. After dropping serve again at the start of the second set, Tiafoe had two chances to get back on level terms in the fourth game but could not take either and from there Nadal raced towards the finish line. Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report to follow And with that, I\u2019m gone. It\u2019s been a blast. Bye! Here are some highlights from Tsitsipas\u2019 press conference after his victory over Roberto Bautista Agut earlier today: Nadal\u2019s longest match so far was against Alex de Minaur in the third round, which took two hours 22 minutes. Today\u2019s, at one hour 47 minutes, was the shortest, and the second that has been finished in under two hours. Tsitsipas\u2019s shortest match of this tournament took almost an hour longer, and his longest took three hours 45 minutes. He has dropped one set in each of his five matches so far, and played seven tie breaks to Nadal\u2019s one. He has played a lot more tennis than Nadal. Of course he\u2019s only 20 years old, 12 years younger than Nadal, but that might catch up with him at some point. Nadal was brilliant today, and not for the first time in this event. So far in this tournament, he\u2019s won his five matches without dropping a set: 6-4, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4, 6-0, 6-1, 7-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. John McEnroe has a chat with Rafael Nadal: It was for me very emotional, to be back in the semi-finals here. I had some troubles in this event during all my career. So to be back in the semi-finals means everything to me. To be able to play in this court is always so special and of course I\u2019m very happy to win as I did tonight. I feel lucky to be where I am after all the things I went through. To be able to compete in this level, that\u2019s why I wake up every morning and go to the court or to the gym to be a better player. I said a couple of rounds ago, these young players can wait a little bit. It looks like they don\u2019t want to wait. It\u2019s going to be a great year in terms of sharing generations. John McEnroe tries to convince Rafa to rip off his shirt, as Tiafoe has after his victories in this tournament, but he\u2019s not interested. \u201cYou can do it, I cannot.\u201d Then he\u2019s asked about his semi-final opponent, Stefanos Tsitsipas: He\u2019s a player that during the last year, he has been improving very month. He\u2019s able to win against the best players in the world already. He\u2019s a great player and he\u2019s unbelievable today, but he will have the chance to be one of the best for a long time. McEnroe asks about his forehand, which seems to be perhaps better than ever, as indeed does his serve: I\u2019ve been practicing during the off season, the serve and the first shot, and during this event probably I did it more than ever, the serve and the winner with the first forehand. That\u2019s giving me a lot of free points and that\u2019s so important at this stage in my career. I\u2019m so happy with this improvement. I\u2019m so happy hitting the serve and the first forehand. Finally, he\u2019s asked about the impact Carlos Moya has made since joining Nadal\u2019s coaching team in late 2016: Being honest I feel very lucky about all the people I\u2019ve had around me during my whole career. Since Carlos came it\u2019s been a great combination. Carlos is giving me another view of the game too. We were practising since he came a little different. At some point in your career it\u2019s important to change things and find new things. We have a great team working together, and that\u2019s so important for me. Tiafoe is roared from the court. This grew from a one-sided start to become a compelling match, and will be back. Today, though, he was beaten in an hour and 47 minutes. Third set: Nadal* 6-3, 6-4, 5-2 Tiafoe Nadal comes out to serve for the match. Tiafoe takes his position, and hopes his opponent\u2019s concentration wavers. Nadal starts with an ace, and then another. A forehand hit long delays the procession, but Nadal is unstoppable today and holds to 15 to win the match! Third set: Nadal 6-3, 6-4, 5-2 Tiafoe* Tiafoe loses the first couple of points and presents Nadal with a decent passing opportunity in the third, the Spaniard smashing his backhand wide. Still, the tone is set: Tiafoe nets a backhand, his second unforced error of the game, to give Nadal two break points and the Spaniard\u2019s brilliant crosscourt return ensures he snaffles the first of them. And that, surely, is the end of the road, or at least of this road, for Tiafoe. Third set: Nadal* 6-3, 6-4, 4-2 Tiafoe In only one of Nadal\u2019s service games has Tiafoe seriously threatened to break, and this one whooshes past without him looking at all likely to make it two, and time for the American is running out. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 6-4, 3-2 Tiafoe* From 30-0 Tiafoe hits two unforced errors, one wide and one into the net, to open the door to Nadal. Then he closes it again with two excellent first serves. Third set: Nadal* 6-3, 6-4, 3-1 Tiafoe Nadal holds to 15. He wins the penultimate point despite Tiafoe anticipating the shot, just getting too much pace and angle on it, and then wins the game by sending Tiafoe the wrong way. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 6-4, 2-1 Tiafoe* A remarkable game from Tiafoe, who wins the first point well enough and then hits three aces in a row. He\u2019s 13-8 ahead on the ace count now, and his win percentage on first serve (and bear in mind that Nadal didn\u2019t lose a point on first serve until midway through the second set) is now 75%, to Nadal\u2019s 71%. Third set: Nadal* 6-3, 6-4, 2-0 Tiafoe Nadal streaks to a 40-0 lead, but though he wobbles a bit to let Tiafoe back into it, he eventually holds to 30. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 6-4, 1-0 Tiafoe* In each of the first two sets Tiafoe lost his first service game and never recovered. At 0-30 he looks to be on his way to an unwanted hat-trick. He takes a bit more time over what is a crucial serve, and then he absolutely nails it, sending an ace out wide. Nadal wins the next point at the end of a great rally, curling a forehand into the corner and then somehow hitting a drop half-volley to clinch it. Tiafoe saves one break point but then hits a forehand into the top of the net, and he\u2019s been broken again! Second set: Nadal* 6-3, 6-4 Tiafoe And so Nadal is forced to serve out the set, a challenge which predictably fails to trouble him. Tiafoe desperately challenges a call after Nadal makes it 40-0 only to change his mind and withdraw the challenge, the ball clearly having landed in, and Nadal then wins the final point, holding to love to take a two-set lead! Second set: Nadal 6-3, 5-4 Tiafoe* At 15-15 Tiafoe, leaning back, spears a forehand just wide, and then he nets an apparently straightforward, shoulder-high volley, anticipating a better shot from Nadal than the Spaniard actually produced. The American saves both break/set points, one with a perfect serve-putaway combo and the second with an ace, and when a forehand just wide concedes another, he saves that one too with a fine first serve. An excellent sliced backhand and an ace later, the game\u2019s done. Second set: Nadal* 6-3, 5-3 Tiafoe This match is much better now than it was in the first set-and-a-bit. Rallies are longer, and most games better contested. Tiafoe\u2019s forehand in particular is more regularly causing damage. He is, though, about to serve to stay in the set. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 4-3 Tiafoe* A game with two excellent rallies, one won by each player, and three aces. Second set: Nadal* 6-3, 4-2 Tiafoe A fabulous point from Nadal at 15-15, the players trading blows from the baseline before Tiafoe forces Nadal wide and the Spaniard rips a forehand down the line for the cleanest of winners. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 3-2 Tiafoe* After all the drama of the last game, Tiafoe wins this one to love. Second set: Nadal* 6-3, 3-1 Tiafoe Tiafoe goes 0-15 up, winning a point on Nadal\u2019s first serve for the first time in the match! It\u2019s an unforced error really, Nadal\u2019s sliced backhand floating wide, but still. History. Nadal then overhits a forehand, and it\u2019s 0-30! The Spaniard fights back to 30-30, but Tiafoe earns a break point at the end of a fine rally, won with an excellent down-the-line forehand, which Nadal gets back in play but only by presenting his opponent with an easy winner. Nadal saves that with a fine first serve only to concede a second break point with a poor forehand wide. He saves that too, but the battle continues before, after four deuces, Tiafoe nets a backhand to give up the longest game of the match. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 2-1 Tiafoe* Nadal hits the most ridiculous backhand return winner down the line, reaching so far to the backhand side that he was essentially pirouetting when he made contact. Still, this is better from Tiafoe, who holds to 30. Second set: Nadal* 6-3, 2-0 Tiafoe Nadal\u2019s first service game of the second set stands in complete contrast to Tiafoe\u2019s. Four first serves, two aces, another service winner, and he\u2019s 2-0 up. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 1-0 Tiafoe* A disastrous start to the set from Tiafoe, who fails to land any of his first three first serves, loses all of those points, and when he finally does get one in play he forces Nadal into a defensive forehand and, given a chance to win the point from midcourt, forecasts his shot, Nadal anticipates and the Spaniard hits a clean winner to complete a break to love! First set: Nadal* 6-3 Tiafoe Tiafoe has Nadal on the defensive at 15-15 but tries an angled drop-volley and doesn\u2019t quite nail the angle. Nadal ends the first set with his 100% record on first serve intact (15/15), winning the game and the set at the end of the match\u2019s first rally of any length, the crowd unable to control the buzz of excitement as the players trade blows before Nadal eventually finds a forehand winner. First set: Nadal 5-3 Tiafoe* Tiafoe wastes no time between serves. He reaches his mark, bounces the ball twice, and off he goes. He could perhaps do with slowing things down just a little, because this match seems to be happening at wild speed. He tries a couple of drop shots here, and though Nadal reaches both he loses the second point, and with it the game, by trying to blast a backhand winner crosscourt and overhitting, when a little more finesse might have served him better. Not that I\u2019m criticising, obviously. First set: Nadal* 5-2 Tiafoe And another straightforward hold. Nadal has yet to lose a point after landing his first serve, and the one he surrendered with an unforced error at 40-0 was just the second he has lost from six attempts at a second serve. There haven\u2019t been many extended rallies as yet. First set: Nadal 4-2 Tiafoe* Since breaking Tiafoe\u2019s serve Nadal hasn\u2019t won a point on it. He holds to love again. First set: Nadal* 4-1 Tiafoe At 15-15 Tiafoe comes forward to take the second serve early, and keeps going to the net. Nice idea in theory, but the ball whistles back past him before he\u2019s remotely ready. Nadal holds to 15. First set: Nadal 3-1 Tiafoe* So what do you do, when your opponent has blasted you off court in an opening 10-minute salvo of great power and bewildering quality? Start with two unreturnable serves, and keep up the pressure from there. Tiafoe gets on the board by holding to love himself. First set: Nadal* 3-0 Tiafoe Nadal holds to love again. This is vicious. Brutal. Eight minutes played, three games won. First set: Nadal 2-0 Tiafoe* Tiafoe makes his own statement with his first serve of the match, which flies down the middle for an ace. But when given a chance to return Tiafoe\u2019s serve Nadal does so with interest, and after a single deuce he wins his first break point with a barrage of groundstrokes of impeccable depth and power. First set: Nadal* 1-0 Tiafoe A statement of a start from Nadal, who serves two aces and holds to love in the blink of an eye. Hello world! Right, not a lot of time for chit-chat. Nadal and Tiafoe have never played before; Stefanos Tsitsipas awaits the winner. Nadal won the toss, and will serve.",

      "bodyText": "France\u2019s foreign ministry has summoned the Italian ambassador in an escalating row over migrant arrivals in Europe that pits the centrist government of Emmanuel Macron against Italy\u2019s far-right-populist coalition. Teresa Castaldo was summoned over \u201chostile\u201d remarks made by the Italian deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio. Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), told a rally in the central Abruzzo region on Sunday: \u201cIf today people are leaving Africa is it because some European countries, with France taking the lead, have never stopped colonising tens of African states?\u201d He called on the EU to sanction France for \u201cimpoverishing Africa\u201d and for migrants to be taken to the southern French port of Marseille instead of Italy. An estimated 170 people were feared to have drowned in the Mediterranean in two incidents at the weekend as they tried to make their way to Europe from Libya. Sources told the Ansa news agency the remarks were \u201chostile and without cause given the partnership between France and Italy in the European Union\u201d. This is the latest fight Italy has picked against France since M5S came to power in coalition with the far-right League last June. Di Maio has never quite forgiven the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for speaking about \u201cpopulist leprosy\u201d in a reported criticism of the Italian government shortly after it was formed. Earlier this month, he urged France\u2019s gilets jaunes, who have held several violent anti-government protests since early December, to \u201cnot give up\u201d. Italy also summoned the French ambassador after Macron criticised Italy for \u201ccynicism and irresponsibility\u201d when the country\u2019s leaders turned away a migrant rescue ship with more than 600 people onboard weeks after coming to power. Italy\u2019s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, added fuel to the fire on Tuesday morning, saying France was not looking to bring calm to violence-ravaged Libya because its energy interests there rivalled those of Italy. \u201cThere are countries that steal wealth from Africa and France is definitely one of them,\u201d Salvini said on Italian TV. \u201cFrance has no interest in making Libya a better place. Paris is interested in taking control of the oil there. And their interests are opposed to the Italian ones. I\u2019m proud to govern a generous country. We don\u2019t take lessons on humanity from France, let alone from Macron. \u201cIn recent years, France turned back thousands of migrants, including women and children. They took them back to Italy in the middle of the night, like animals. Again, I don\u2019t take lesson from Macron.\u201d A French diplomatic source told Reuters it was not the first time that Salvini had made such comments and that it was probably because he felt he had been upstaged by Di Maio. The source added that the accusation was baseless and reiterated that French efforts in Libya were aimed at stabilising the country, preventing the spread of terrorism and curbing the migration flows. Both Salvini and Di Maio are campaigning hard for European parliamentary elections in May and are eager to show they have broken with the consensual politics of centre-left and centre-right parties. The two men have repeatedly targeted neighbouring France and accused the French president of doing nothing to help handle the hundreds of thousands of mainly African migrants who have reached Italy from Libya in recent years.

This showed that Greenland lost about 280bn tons of ice per year between 2002 and 2016, enough to raise the worldwide sea level by 0.03 inches annually.

Researchers said this was driven by rising global temperatures from human-induced climate change as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation, a periodic weather phenomenon that brings warmer air to western Greenland. The fate of Greenland\u2019s huge glaciers in the south-east and north-west has long been viewed as a key factor in global sea level rise but the Ohio State-led research suggests the ice fields of the island\u2019s south-west may prove an unexpectedly large source of meltwater. Scientists have been gaining a greater understanding of how the two massive ice masses on the planet, in Greenland and Antarctica, are reacting to a warming ocean and atmosphere. Arctic ice loss has tripled since the 1980s, with melting in places such as Greenland and Alaska providing the greatest instigator of sea level rise while destabilizing the very ground underneath 4 million people\u2019s feet. Antarctica is becoming an increasing concern, however, with ice vanishing at its fastest rate in recorded history. The world\u2019s largest expanse of ice is now losing about 219bn tonnes of ice a year, a trajectory that would contribute more than 25cm to total global sea level rise by 2070.

Alley added that while there are uncertainties over future sea level rise \u201cif the big ice sheets change more rapidly than expected, they could drive faster or much faster rise than expected\u201d.",

Carson\u2019s trial was listed to begin at Peterborough crown court on 7 January, but he died in a single-vehicle crash that morning. Cambridgeshire\u2019s senior coroner, David Heming, opening and adjourning an inquest in Huntingdon on Tuesday, said Carson was the driver of a Mazda 3 car that crashed off the A1303 at Bottisham, about seven miles east of Cambridge. \u201cThe circumstances as presently known are that the vehicle left the carriageway on to a wide grass verge and collided with a tree,\u201d said Heming. \u201cMr Carson suffered fatal injuries.

This is said to have involved Carson showing the complainant images of scantily clad women while the boy exercised. No further details of the allegations against Carson were given in court. However, during an investigation by the Guardian before his arrest, former players claimed: They were touched intimately by Carson. They were routinely made to strip and exercise so their muscular development could be examined in the UK and while on trips abroad. They were instructed to wrestle in muddy puddles just in underwear with each other, told to swim naked or massage each other with oil. Carson was the Peterborough United academy director from 1993 until 2001, and a number of players he coached there went on to have careers in the Premier League. The hearing was adjourned until 18 June for a full inquest.",

However, if I had the power to choose only one option, it would have to be a Corbyn-led Labour government. Despite his initials, Jeremy Corbyn is not the messiah.

Of course they got neither. What if progressives were now offered either Britain remaining in the EU or Jeremy Corbyn winning a 2019 general election? I agree with Freedland that leaving the EU would be catastrophic and am very hopeful that we will get a second referendum. However, if I had the power to choose only one option, it would have to be a Corbyn-led Labour government. Despite his initials, Jeremy Corbyn is not the messiah. But his policies would feed and house the poor and heal the sick by putting an end to the cruel austerity that is sadly a feature of Conservative Britain. Angela Smith Norwich, UK Book on fat displayed obvious sophistry Bee Wilson is right to denounce the sophistry of Anthony Warner\u2019s book, The Truth About Fat (11 January). Without saying it explicitly, this book disregards one of the essential facts about obesity development: the loss of a balanced energy sheet. Obesity will inevitably occur if energy intake exceeds the sum of energy expenditure by the body. This is the direct consequence of the first law of thermodynamics that nobody or nothing can violate, even the most eloquent sophist. Jean-Marie Gillis Wezembeek-Oppem, Belgium Chickens could not cope with harsh conditions I am no expert on Tanzania, Rwanda or poultry farming but John Vidal\u2019s article (11 January) has a hole. I want to know how the inbred, crippled Cobb 500 chickens are going to preen the fly eggs from their feathers. And how will they deal with the lice, the rats, the mosquitoes, the mites, the cats, the fleas, the ticks that all chickens in Tanzania and Rwanda must be exposed to? Surely \u201ctreating them like babies\u201d will either be impossible or will make these chickens unaffordable for locals. The local \u201cscrawny\u201d hens are the type that survives local conditions. I am not sure if Vidal is leading us to draw our own conclusion that rich Americans sent by God to Africa are deluded, but I can\u2019t help feeling someone has removed the basic biology from his article. Mary Morgan-Richards Palmerston North, New Zealand Universities surrendered to advertising creed George Monbiot, in his opinion piece about how ads and academia are controlling our thoughts, states: \u201cThe Enlightenment ideal, which all universities claim to endorse, is that everyone should think for themselves.\u201d He goes on to ask: \u201cSo why do they [universities] let researchers explore new means of blocking this capacity?\u201d (4 January). The answer lies within the changes undergone in universities over the last 30 years or so. Knowledge produced in universities is measured not for its contribution to help people think for themselves, but by criteria that are in many ways about advertising: metrics on the number of times research is quoted by other researchers, league tables about the best universities, and research impact as applauded in the Research Excellence Framework. The research that Monbiot is rightly complaining about is a symptom of how universities have helped weaken their own resistance to the advertising creed.

In 2007, just after she had got her licence, she was charged with drink-driving. \u201cI was a very different person back then,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot can happen in 11 years of a person\u2019s life. And for me that was a very different situation I got myself into. But it was a massive wake-up call. It made me realise that being an international rugby player was what I really wanted.\u201d Twelve years later, the back-rower has over a half-century of caps and a World Cup winner\u2019s medal.</p> <p>Now, she felt, \u201cit\u2019s all over, I\u2019m going to never play for England again, I\u2019m going to have 59 caps for England and it\u2019s done.\u201d She was so ashamed that she did not tell anyone what had happened. \u201cMy mum knew, my partner, a close friend.\u201d She dreaded telling the rest of her family and friends, all the people \u201cthat are really proud of me\u201d. Especially her grandparents. \u201cMy nan who I\u2019m really close to, I speak to her every few days, whereas in this time I\u2019d been speaking to her much less. She knew there was something up, but she didn\u2019t know what and I wasn\u2019t telling her.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For them to support me, to say we\u2019re not going to punish you in your rugby, is massive. But it\u2019s not been an easy ride</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually the England squad met up for what they call a values day. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be planning for this future when I had this hanging over me and I\u2019m not being honest about it,\u201d Packer says. \u201cBut I just didn\u2019t really know how to tell people.\u201d She finally spoke to the forwards coach, Richard Blaze. \u201cA few words came out of his mouth. Idiot was definitely one of them. Then he said: \u2018Have you spoken to anyone?\u2019 And I said: \u2018I don\u2019t really know how to,\u2019 but he told me I had to.</p> <p>\u201cSo right at the end of the day I spoke to the head of performance [Nicky Ponsford] and I said to her: \u2018You know when I mess up it\u2019s not, like, a small mess, but it\u2019s a catastrophic thing, well \u2026\u2019\u201d They made an appointment with the head coach, Simon Middleton. They met in a little room at Twickenham. Packer broke down in tears then, and she does again now. When Ponsford said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to punish you,\u201d Packer got this great lump in the back of her throat. \u201cJust with the relief, it wasn\u2019t over, I\u2019m still an England player.\u201d</p> <p>Other players have been dropped for similar offences. In 2012 Danny Care was cut from the England squad when he was caught drink-driving. But the RFU decided that Packer needed their support. \u201cI think for the RFU the thing was it\u2019s something that was dealt with away from rugby, it was dealt with in the courts, and that\u2019s how they saw it, the punishment for me was I could lose my job, lose my livelihood, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get around to training. I think for them to support me, to say we\u2019re not going to punish you in your rugby, is massive. But it\u2019s not been an easy ride, don\u2019t think they\u2019ve not given me the talking-to that I\u2019ve needed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/10/poppy-bryony-cleall-saracens-twins-womens-rugby-union\">Meet the Clealls: the Saracens twins forging a winning partnership</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She was eventually banned from driving for 17 months and fined \u00a3461. When the news finally came out England were in the middle of their autumn series. \u201cIt was soul destroying.\u201d Packer has been an amateur most of her life, she didn\u2019t play the game for money, but love. Which might be why this affected her so much. But soon after she resigned from the plumbing job, and took up a full-time contract with England. It is a new start. Now all she is thinking about is England\u2019s first match of the Six Nations, against Ireland in Dublin, a week on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cI made a couple of resolutions,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m currently on dry January, which is something I thought I\u2019d do. And I\u2019ve given up chocolate too. And I\u2019m trying to be more positive, not to dwell on the negatives, just keep looking forward. I\u2019m a bit more of a senior player now. If you\u2019d asked me five years ago I\u2019d have said: \u2018Yeah I\u2019m going to play rugby forever,\u2019 but now I\u2019m in my latter stages of playing for England. So I want to make sure I grab it all and never let go of it until it\u2019s the right time. And I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve got left, but I want to make the most of it.\u201d</p>",

It made me realise that being an international rugby player was what I really wanted.\u201d Twelve years later, the back-rower has over a half-century of caps and a World Cup winner\u2019s medal. Now, she felt, \u201cit\u2019s all over, I\u2019m going to never play for England again, I\u2019m going to have 59 caps for England and it\u2019s done.\u201d She was so ashamed that she did not tell anyone what had happened. \u201cMy mum knew, my partner, a close friend.\u201d She dreaded telling the rest of her family and friends, all the people \u201cthat are really proud of me\u201d. Especially her grandparents. \u201cMy nan who I\u2019m really close to, I speak to her every few days, whereas in this time I\u2019d been speaking to her much less. She knew there was something up, but she didn\u2019t know what and I wasn\u2019t telling her.\u201d Eventually the England squad met up for what they call a values day. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be planning for this future when I had this hanging over me and I\u2019m not being honest about it,\u201d Packer says. \u201cBut I just didn\u2019t really know how to tell people.\u201d She finally spoke to the forwards coach, Richard Blaze. \u201cA few words came out of his mouth. Idiot was definitely one of them. Then he said: \u2018Have you spoken to anyone?\u2019 And I said: \u2018I don\u2019t really know how to,\u2019 but he told me I had to. \u201cSo right at the end of the day I spoke to the head of performance [Nicky Ponsford] and I said to her: \u2018You know when I mess up it\u2019s not, like, a small mess, but it\u2019s a catastrophic thing, well \u2026\u2019\u201d They made an appointment with the head coach, Simon Middleton. They met in a little room at Twickenham. Packer broke down in tears then, and she does again now. When Ponsford said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to punish you,\u201d Packer got this great lump in the back of her throat. \u201cJust with the relief, it wasn\u2019t over, I\u2019m still an England player.\u201d Other players have been dropped for similar offences. In 2012 Danny Care was cut from the England squad when he was caught drink-driving. But the RFU decided that Packer needed their support. \u201cI think for the RFU the thing was it\u2019s something that was dealt with away from rugby, it was dealt with in the courts, and that\u2019s how they saw it, the punishment for me was I could lose my job, lose my livelihood, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get around to training. I think for them to support me, to say we\u2019re not going to punish you in your rugby, is massive. But it\u2019s not been an easy ride, don\u2019t think they\u2019ve not given me the talking-to that I\u2019ve needed.\u201d She was eventually banned from driving for 17 months and fined \u00a3461. When the news finally came out England were in the middle of their autumn series. \u201cIt was soul destroying.\u201d Packer has been an amateur most of her life, she didn\u2019t play the game for money, but love. Which might be why this affected her so much. But soon after she resigned from the plumbing job, and took up a full-time contract with England. It is a new start. Now all she is thinking about is England\u2019s first match of the Six Nations, against Ireland in Dublin, a week on Friday. \u201cI made a couple of resolutions,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m currently on dry January, which is something I thought I\u2019d do. And I\u2019ve given up chocolate too. And I\u2019m trying to be more positive, not to dwell on the negatives, just keep looking forward. I\u2019m a bit more of a senior player now. If you\u2019d asked me five years ago I\u2019d have said: \u2018Yeah I\u2019m going to play rugby forever,\u2019 but now I\u2019m in my latter stages of playing for England. So I want to make sure I grab it all and never let go of it until it\u2019s the right time. And I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve got left, but I want to make the most of it.\u201d",

Also nominated: Bradley Walsh, Graham Norton, Phillip Schofield New drama Will win: Bodyguard Should win: Bodyguard Back comes new drama as a category after two years off, giving Jed Mercurio\u2019s ratings-buster a clear run without Call the Midwife or Casualty sniping at it from a nearby rooftop. As Guardian critics\u2019 number one show of the year, Killing Eve feels like a \u201cshould win\u201d, but \u2026 should it? It\u2019s years since anything hypnotised the nation like Bodyguard did, and quality mainstream fare is what tonight is all about. Also nominated: A Discovery of Witches, Girlfriends, The Cry Drama performance Will win: Richard Madden, Bodyguard Should win: Jodie Comer, Killing Eve Richard Madden was a solid, reliable plank taking Bodyguard\u2019s weight, but that show was about plot not acting. Meanwhile, Jodie Comer burned through Killing Eve like sulphuric acid through meringue and deserves every award available. Strong category, though, with Jodie Whittaker having masterfully overcome the pressure of expectation in her first season of Doctor Who: good in the weak episodes, terrific in the strong ones. Also nominated: Cillian Murphy, Peaky Blinders; Michelle Keegan, Our Girl TV judge Will win: Louis Tomlinson Should win: Robert Rinder The nomination for the actually legally qualified Judge Rinder shakes up a category that otherwise feels pointless: who did you think was the best at saying who was the best, on shows where you then voted for the winner yourself anyway? Louis Tomlinson brought the odd gush of humble emotion to his debut X Factor stint, which will be enough the see off the other, leathery contenders. Also nominated: David Walliams, Robbie Williams, Simon Cowell Bruce Forsyth entertainment award Will win: I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! Should win: Ant &amp; Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway ITV\u2019s two big guns go up against each other for the first time since 2016: recently IACGMOOH! has hoovered up the challenge show rosette, but that\u2019s not up for grabs this year. Dec\u2019s brave work finishing off the latest series of Saturday Night Takeaway without Ant probably won\u2019t override the lure of the jungle. The dark horse is Love Island, even if fans only vote for it to see if Dani and Jack accept the award together. Also nominated: All Round to Mrs Brown\u2019s, The Graham Norton Show Talent show Will win: Strictly Come Dancing Should win: Strictly Come Dancing Strictly is generally unstoppable, and this year it dealt effortlessly with the rare setback of a proper tabloid scandal by simply keeping love rat Seann Walsh in the competition and daring people to stop watching. They didn\u2019t, the final was a dazzler, and if you can remember anything that happened in any of the other shortlisted shows this year, award yourself another glass of wine as a prize. Also nominated: Britain\u2019s Got Talent, Dancing on Ice, The Voice UK, The X Factor Serial drama Will win: Coronation Street Should win: Coronation Street Until 2017 the soaps prize was only about Corrie and Easties, with the pair listlessly trading punches like a lovechild\u2019s two possible fathers. Then Emmerdale upped its game and won \u2013 twice. It dipped in the past 12 months, though, while Corrie nailed several difficult subjects, rape and suicide among them. EastEnders\u2019 knife-crime story scored acclaim, but probably not enough. Also nominated: Hollyoaks Quiz show Will win: The Chase Should win: The Chase New category! In years gone by the contenders here have competed for the daytime gong, which has meant being massacred by This Morning. The tweak lets in late-night bad boys 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown and A League of Their Own, but this is surely The Chase v Pointless. The Chase deserves it, if only for the recent edition that asked: \u201cUranus is thought to smell like what?\u201d Also nominated: Catchphrase Factual entertainment Will win: The Great British Bake Off Should win: Paul O\u2019Grady: For the Love of Dogs Another refugee from the absent challenge show category, Bake Off has NTAs form and will see off Gogglebox, which normally wins this but has been fading for years. But these are harsh times, during which both dogs and avuncular Liverpudlian comedians are precious relief. Give them an award, they\u2019re good boys. Alternatively, Britain could do worse than reward DIY SOS: the Big Build for its Grenfell special. Also nominated: Ambulance Daytime Will win: This Morning Should win: This Morning No reason why This Morning shouldn\u2019t chalk up nine wins on the spin: it kicked off 2018 by making Theresa May squirm, broke new ground when Rylan and Dan Clark-Neal became the show\u2019s first husband-and-husband guest presenters, then celebrated its 30th birthday. Loose Women\u2019s highlight was a genuinely horrible shouting match between Kim Woodburn and a Nolan sister. No contest. Also nominated: Good Morning Britain, Sunday Brunch, The Jeremy Kyle Show",

A statement from the party\u2019s co-founders, the television presenter Sandi Toksvig and Catherine Mayer, said: \u201cWe are hugely sorry to see Sophie go, but as we look back over her tenure as leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, we also thank our lucky stars that she was there from the beginning and stayed for as long as she did to see this new party fully launched and established. \u201cWe set up the party because we were impatient for equality and we wanted to open politics to the talents it routinely excludes. We knew these untapped talents were out there.\u201d",

It was only later that I realised that this idea would depend on those students being willing \u2013 for instance \u2013 to turn the M25 into the \u201csigil Odegra\u201d in the language of the Black Priesthood of Ancient Mu (which means \u201cHail the Great Beast Devourer of Worlds\u201d) then set it on fire, and then allow several lead characters to drive through it anyway.

It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel, make new friends, and make old ones jealous. Except my own time in Spain and Paraguay turned out to be more difficult than my final exams the following year. Of course, students who get the change to study abroad should be grateful for the fantastic opportunity, and I don\u2019t suggest anyone should feel sorry for them. But here\u2019s my advice if the year abroad happens not to be the time of your life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/10/study-abroad-part-international-community-europe-postgraduate-students\">Study abroad: \u2018I like being part of an international community\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of people I know who spent the first few months feeling like a failure for not immediately acclimatising to their new surroundings. When you\u2019re no longer a tourist people speak to you faster, don\u2019t disguise regional accents, and often interact with you in large social groups, all of which might leave you feeling like you don\u2019t speak the language as well as you thought you did. It\u2019s also surprising how exhausting thinking in another language all day can be.</p> <p>Secondly, keep an eye on your social media consumption. While the internet is a blessing for keeping up with friends and family, it can be intensely lonely to scroll through the feeds of others abroad, or your friends still together back home. \u201cA massive piece of advice I\u2019d give is to not place too much importance on how you think other people are experiencing the year abroad,\u201d says Ellie Hill, who went to Italy and Paraguay. \u201cEspecially when social media is involved.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26075923\">Studies show</a> the worst thing you can do on social media for your mental health is use it a lot but not post yourself.

      "bodyText": "The year abroad is a compulsory element of most modern languages degrees in the UK. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel, make new friends, and make old ones jealous. Except my own time in Spain and Paraguay turned out to be more difficult than my final exams the following year. Of course, students who get the change to study abroad should be grateful for the fantastic opportunity, and I don\u2019t suggest anyone should feel sorry for them. But here\u2019s my advice if the year abroad happens not to be the time of your life. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of people I know who spent the first few months feeling like a failure for not immediately acclimatising to their new surroundings. When you\u2019re no longer a tourist people speak to you faster, don\u2019t disguise regional accents, and often interact with you in large social groups, all of which might leave you feeling like you don\u2019t speak the language as well as you thought you did. It\u2019s also surprising how exhausting thinking in another language all day can be. Secondly, keep an eye on your social media consumption. While the internet is a blessing for keeping up with friends and family, it can be intensely lonely to scroll through the feeds of others abroad, or your friends still together back home. \u201cA massive piece of advice I\u2019d give is to not place too much importance on how you think other people are experiencing the year abroad,\u201d says Ellie Hill, who went to Italy and Paraguay. \u201cEspecially when social media is involved.\u201d Studies show the worst thing you can do on social media for your mental health is use it a lot but not post yourself. As an experiment, during a low point on my year abroad I posted a snap of the local countryside to Instagram. I was astonished by the number of comments from friends about how amazing my new life was, and how jealous they were. This didn\u2019t make me feel any better, but realising how different the social media image of my life was to the reality reduced the envy I felt of my friends\u2019 posts.

      "body": "<p>In the months since the Harvey Weinstein story broke and the #MeToo movement exploded, there has been a growing awareness of the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), in some cases, to gag victims of sexual assault, or buy their silence, preventing them from going public with their stories, or even sharing information with colleagues and acquaintances. Many people, however, remain unaware of the extensive use of such agreements to silence women who have experienced maternity discrimination.</p> <p>We know that such discrimination is rife in the UK: an Equality and Human Rights Commission report estimated in 2015 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/24/maternity-leave-discrimination-54000-women-lose-jobs-each-year-ehrc-report\" title=\"\">54,000 women a year</a> lose their jobs as a result. But the full picture may be masked by the widespread abuse of NDAs.</p> <p>Amanda Symes (not her real name) had been working for a large finance corporation for many years and had worked her way gradually up the ladder, progressing from an entry-level role to a much more prestigious position. Then, she explains: \u201cI got pregnant: and it all started.\u201d</p> <p>She continues: \u201cWhen I told my team I was pregnant, I lost count of the number of people who said: \u2018I assume you won\u2019t be coming back to work, then.\u2019 Then there were general comments \u2013 observations about my weight, comments like: \u2018Don\u2019t upset the pregnant lady.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Symes briefly mentioned the comments to somebody in HR. When the time came, she went on maternity leave. Then two weeks before she was due to start back at work, she was called in by HR for a \u201ccatchup\u201d.</p> <p>At the meeting, Symes was told the company knew she was unhappy in her role and wanted to move her. They offered two options: one was a base-level role in a different team, far junior to the position she had held, with a salary about \u00a310,000 lower. The other was similar to her previous job, but required her to take a significant number of exams within her first six months back at work: a non-negotiable requirement Symes felt was simply incompatible with adjusting to juggling motherhood and her career. All she wanted was to return to the job she had enjoyed and done well at before maternity leave.</p> <p>When Symes didn\u2019t budge, the HR professionals started criticising her past performance, suggesting that she had not been good enough at her role, although all her previous reviews had been extremely positive. Eventually, \u201cthey handed me a [pre-prepared] envelope and said: \u2018You can take this offer.\u2019 It was a financial offer for redundancy. At that point, I left in tears.\u201d</p> <p>With the help of a lawyer friend, Symes wrote a letter to her company. The firm responded by doubling the amount of money they were offering, \u201cbut said I had to sign the NDA if I wanted to receive any money and I had to tell my friends and anyone that asked it was my decision to leave\u201d.</p> <p>She considered legal action, \u201cbut I was so emotionally drained from the whole thing and so upset and I started having panic attacks at home. In the end I had to see a counsellor and get my head sorted before I could find a new job.\u201d</p> <p>Despite not having done anything wrong, Symes has been left with a sense of guilt. \u201cMaybe if I\u2019d had the courage to stand up and do it, it might not have happened to the next person that came along, but at the end of the day I just couldn\u2019t risk my family and everything else. That\u2019s my biggest regret, not being strong enough to do that.\u201d</p> <p>According to Joeli Brearley, founder of <a href=\"http://pregnantthenscrewed.com/\" title=\"\">the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed</a>, NDAs are very common in pregnancy- and maternity-discrimination cases. \u201cThere are many well-known companies who use them regularly to cover up mistreatment of new mothers in the workplace. For obvious reasons we cannot say the names of these companies, but the public would be very shocked if they knew what was going on behind the closed doors of some of the most well-known and loved brands in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Brearley knows first-hand of maternity discrimination. She started Pregnant Then Screwed in 2015 after being sacked at four months pregnant, the day after informing her employer. \u201cI started legal proceedings but then discovered I was having a high-risk pregnancy and the doctor said: \u2018Whatever you do, don\u2019t get stressed.\u2019 Stress could trigger early labour and at four months pregnant my baby would have died. I was forced to drop the case.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91c4747a537a8239d51e362c4134d68b4f5eee6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91c4747a537a8239d51e362c4134d68b4f5eee6f/0_494_7360_4418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NDAs are used to hide discrimination against pregnant women and mothers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NDAs are used to hide discrimination against pregnant women and mothers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Arcurs/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pregnant Then Screwed runs a free legal advice line (helping on average 350 callers a year) and a mentor scheme to support women taking legal action against employers. In the past few months, it has carried out a survey of 260 women who had signed NDAs after experiencing pregnancy or maternity discrimination. More than 90% said they felt signing an NDA was their only option. A shocking 70% of respondents said they felt signing the NDA had had a negative impact on their mental health.</p> <p>Lisa Thurrock (not her real name) was working for a FTSE 100 company at senior level when she got pregnant. She told Pregnant Then Screwed: \u201cI had been a dedicated, high-achieving employee for six years with an exemplary record of achievement, so when I discovered I was pregnant I wasn\u2019t worried about my career.\u201d But as soon as she told her employers, things \u201cturned sour\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey sidelined me from meetings and started to give some of my work to a more junior, male member of my team without any discussion. They chipped away at my confidence, making backhanded comments about my appearance and my work ethic, which hadn\u2019t changed.

      "bodyText": "In the months since the Harvey Weinstein story broke and the #MeToo movement exploded, there has been a growing awareness of the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), in some cases, to gag victims of sexual assault, or buy their silence, preventing them from going public with their stories, or even sharing information with colleagues and acquaintances. Many people, however, remain unaware of the extensive use of such agreements to silence women who have experienced maternity discrimination. We know that such discrimination is rife in the UK: an Equality and Human Rights Commission report estimated in 2015 that 54,000 women a year lose their jobs as a result. But the full picture may be masked by the widespread abuse of NDAs. Amanda Symes (not her real name) had been working for a large finance corporation for many years and had worked her way gradually up the ladder, progressing from an entry-level role to a much more prestigious position. Then, she explains: \u201cI got pregnant: and it all started.\u201d She continues: \u201cWhen I told my team I was pregnant, I lost count of the number of people who said: \u2018I assume you won\u2019t be coming back to work, then.\u2019 Then there were general comments \u2013 observations about my weight, comments like: \u2018Don\u2019t upset the pregnant lady.\u2019\u201d Symes briefly mentioned the comments to somebody in HR. When the time came, she went on maternity leave. Then two weeks before she was due to start back at work, she was called in by HR for a \u201ccatchup\u201d. At the meeting, Symes was told the company knew she was unhappy in her role and wanted to move her. They offered two options: one was a base-level role in a different team, far junior to the position she had held, with a salary about \u00a310,000 lower. The other was similar to her previous job, but required her to take a significant number of exams within her first six months back at work: a non-negotiable requirement Symes felt was simply incompatible with adjusting to juggling motherhood and her career. All she wanted was to return to the job she had enjoyed and done well at before maternity leave. When Symes didn\u2019t budge, the HR professionals started criticising her past performance, suggesting that she had not been good enough at her role, although all her previous reviews had been extremely positive. Eventually, \u201cthey handed me a [pre-prepared] envelope and said: \u2018You can take this offer.\u2019 It was a financial offer for redundancy. At that point, I left in tears.\u201d With the help of a lawyer friend, Symes wrote a letter to her company. The firm responded by doubling the amount of money they were offering, \u201cbut said I had to sign the NDA if I wanted to receive any money and I had to tell my friends and anyone that asked it was my decision to leave\u201d. She considered legal action, \u201cbut I was so emotionally drained from the whole thing and so upset and I started having panic attacks at home. In the end I had to see a counsellor and get my head sorted before I could find a new job.\u201d Despite not having done anything wrong, Symes has been left with a sense of guilt. \u201cMaybe if I\u2019d had the courage to stand up and do it, it might not have happened to the next person that came along, but at the end of the day I just couldn\u2019t risk my family and everything else. That\u2019s my biggest regret, not being strong enough to do that.\u201d According to Joeli Brearley, founder of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, NDAs are very common in pregnancy- and maternity-discrimination cases. \u201cThere are many well-known companies who use them regularly to cover up mistreatment of new mothers in the workplace. For obvious reasons we cannot say the names of these companies, but the public would be very shocked if they knew what was going on behind the closed doors of some of the most well-known and loved brands in the UK.\u201d Brearley knows first-hand of maternity discrimination. She started Pregnant Then Screwed in 2015 after being sacked at four months pregnant, the day after informing her employer. \u201cI started legal proceedings but then discovered I was having a high-risk pregnancy and the doctor said: \u2018Whatever you do, don\u2019t get stressed.\u2019 Stress could trigger early labour and at four months pregnant my baby would have died. I was forced to drop the case.\u201d Pregnant Then Screwed runs a free legal advice line (helping on average 350 callers a year) and a mentor scheme to support women taking legal action against employers. In the past few months, it has carried out a survey of 260 women who had signed NDAs after experiencing pregnancy or maternity discrimination. More than 90% said they felt signing an NDA was their only option. A shocking 70% of respondents said they felt signing the NDA had had a negative impact on their mental health. Lisa Thurrock (not her real name) was working for a FTSE 100 company at senior level when she got pregnant. She told Pregnant Then Screwed: \u201cI had been a dedicated, high-achieving employee for six years with an exemplary record of achievement, so when I discovered I was pregnant I wasn\u2019t worried about my career.\u201d But as soon as she told her employers, things \u201cturned sour\u201d. \u201cThey sidelined me from meetings and started to give some of my work to a more junior, male member of my team without any discussion. They chipped away at my confidence, making backhanded comments about my appearance and my work ethic, which hadn\u2019t changed. I knew the stress of it all was getting to me and I was concerned about my health and the health of the baby so I kept my head down and waited until maternity leave, hoping that when I returned things would be back to normal. \u201cSix weeks after my baby was born I received an email. It was a discussion between my boss and the HR department, sent to me by accident.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Top story: Missile site exposed as Trump-Kim summit nears US experts have revealed the existence of a previously undeclared missile site in North Korea, said to house medium-range Nodong ballistic missiles that could reach South Korea, Japan or Guam, a US territory. The report on the seven sq mile (18 sq km) Sino-ri site, one of 20 such sites that North Korea is suspected of failing to declare, comes weeks before Donald Trump is expected to meet Kim Jong-un for a second summit on denuclearisation. Never declared. Analysts at Washington\u2019s Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which produced the report, said the fact that the base was never declared meant it did \u201cnot appear to be the subject of denuclearisation negotiations\u201d. Kamala Harris officially enters 2020 presidential race The California senator Kamala Harris has announced she will seek the Democratic presidential nomination, joining an already crowded and diverse field of candidates vying for the chance to run against Trump in 2020. The daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, Harris will formally launch her campaign at a rally in her home city of Oakland, California, on Sunday. While Republicans were quick to criticise her \u201cradically liberal voting record\u201d in the US Senate, Harris will also face questions from progressives about her record on criminal justice during her tenure as California\u2019s attorney general. Breaking barriers. Harris broke barriers during her meteoric rise through California politics, as Vivian Ho reports, while her campaign logo pays tribute to another pioneering political candidate, Shirley Chisholm. Starbucks boss. Howard Schultz, the founder and former CEO of Starbucks, is mulling a run for president as an independent, according to US media reports. New video gives context to teen\u2019s confrontation with activist Fresh footage of an apparent confrontation between a Native American activist and a Kentucky schoolboy has provided extra context to the incident in Washington DC last Friday, which is being touted as symbolic of deepening social and racial divisions. Members of another protest group, the Black Hebrew Israelites, may have been largely responsible for sparking the standoff between schoolboys from the private, all-male Covington Catholic high school, who were attending an anti-abortion march, and activists taking part in an indigenous peoples\u2019 march. Competing claims. The controversial video showed Nick Sandmann, a student in a Maga cap, in an apparent face-off with Nathan Phillips, an Omaha tribe elder. Phillips claimed afterwards that he intervened to prevent the schoolboys \u201cattacking \u2026 four black individuals\u201d, while Sandmann said in a statement that he was the one playing peacemaker. Xi warns China to keep \u2018political security\u2019 in faltering economy The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has urged officials to maintain \u201cpolitical security\u201d as the country\u2019s economy falters amid its trade war with the US. Last year the Chinese economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990, raising fears in Beijing that the Communist regime could face unrest and opposition. Speaking to senior provincial leaders and ministers on Monday, Xi warned of an \u201cideological struggle\u201d on the internet, where \u201cdomestic and foreign forces are trying to develop supporters of their values\u201d. Black swans. Xi also said the party must watch for economic \u201cblack swans\u201d \u2013 unpredictable events that can derail an economy, as well as \u201cgrey rhinoceroses\u201d \u2013 known risks that go ignored until too late. Crib sheet Greenland\u2019s ice is melting much faster than previously thought, with new research showing that the pace of ice loss has increased fourfold since 2003. The Venezuelan government says it has foiled an attempted military insurrection by more than two dozen national guardsmen, in the latest sign of dissent against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro amid the country\u2019s ongoing humanitarian crisis. A second woman became pregnant as part of a Chinese researcher\u2019s illicit attempt to create the world\u2019s first genetically edited babies, a practice banned in most countries, including China. The UK Labour party has called for a vote in parliament on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum, a move that the Conservative prime minister, Theresa May, says would threaten Britain\u2019s \u201csocial cohesion\u201d. Must-reads The new elite\u2019s phoney crusade to save the world The former McKinsey consultant and New York Times columnist Anand Giridharadas has mingled with the world\u2019s privileged elite. He says the business and political leaders gathering at Davos really do want to improve the world \u2013 but only as long as their place in it isn\u2019t threatened. Adam Moss bids farewell to New York magazine The editor of New York magazine is stepping down after 15 years successfully steering a beloved print institution into the digital age. He tells Ed Pilkington that, contra the accepted wisdom, \u201cthe magazine business is doing fine\u201d. Painting the oceans to showcase climate change The artist Danielle Eubank has spent 20 years painting about 200 bodies of water from the Arctic to the Mediterranean, to raise awareness of pollution and climate change. Ocean warming is \u201cthe most frightening thing I can think of,\u201d she tells Nadja Sayej. Is The Other Two 2019\u2019s funniest new show? In the new Comedy Central sitcom The Other Two, a pair of older siblings must come to terms with the wild success of their 13-year-old brother, a Bieber-style pop sensation. Stuart Heritage says it is funny, scathing, touching \u2013 and perfectly observed. Opinion The psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen has spent his career studying empathy. He argues that appreciating the perspectives of others could prevent political violence, not least in the Israel-Palestine conflict. I see empathy as one of our most valuable natural resources. It has particular promise as an approach to conflict resolution, one that has advantages over viewing a problem through a chiefly military, economic or legal lens. Sport Gayle Benson, the owner of the New Orleans Saints, has complained that her team were \u201cunfairly deprived\u201d of a place in the Super Bowl by a glaring missed call late in their NFC Championship game against the LA Rams on Sunday. The former Manchester United and England star Rio Ferdinand lost both his wife and mother to cancer in quick succession. As he launches a nutrition business, he tells Simon Hattenstone that tragedy made him determined to do whatever he could to make sure his children would not be bereaved prematurely again.

      "bodyText": "A Russian lawyer for Paul Whelan, the US citizen accused of spying on Russia, has said his client was carrying state secrets when he was arrested in Moscow but may not have realised it. Whelan, an ex-marine, has been accused of an unspecified \u201cact of espionage\u201d, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. \u201cI can only confirm that information constituting state secrets was found in the course of Whelan\u2019s detention,\u201d Vladimir Zherebenkov, a court-appointed lawyer, told journalists at a Moscow court on Tuesday. \u201cI do not know how he got it, and what he was supposed to do with it; it is also unknown whether Whelan was aware that he possessed secret information. There is nothing but conjectures so far.\u201d A judge at the court ruled that Whelan would remain under arrest in Lefortovo prison until at least 28 February as authorities continue their investigation. Whelan\u2019s court appearance on Tuesday was his first in public since his arrest last month. The pre-trial detention hearing was closed to the press because the case material is secret, but Whelan could be seen by journalists after the judge delivered his sentence. Police escorting Whelan wore balaclavas to obscure their identities. Since December, anonymously sourced reports in Russian media have said that Whelan received a USB drive with secret information about Russian government employees. But the content of the charges against him have not been made public by officials. Some western analysts have suggested that Russia arrested Whelan in order to set up an exchange, although Moscow has denied that. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said last week that Whelan had been caught \u201cred-handed\u201d when he was arrested by FSB officers at Moscow\u2019s downtown Metropol hotel. Family members have said Whelan was in Moscow for a wedding. Before Whelan\u2019s court appearance, his lawyer said he could confirm information made public by the foreign ministry. But his remarks confirming Whelan\u2019s alleged possession of a \u201cstate secret\u201d appeared to go further. Because the case is related to national security, Zherebenkov said he was \u201cforbidden from commenting on the case material\u201d, except that which had been made public by the government. Whelan is the security director for a Michigan-based automotive parts supplier and holds US, Canadian, British and Irish citizenship. He served two tours in Iraq and was given a bad-conduct discharge in 2008.",

      "body": "<p>The emerging global movement of rightwing populists is guilty of many things but ideological incoherence in choosing their enemies is generally not one of them. Whether it is Steve Bannon bashing Pope Francis, Matteo Salvini attacking the \u201cdo-gooders\u201d in humanitarian NGOs or Marine Le Pen venting against the dull technocrats in Brussels, the populists go after a predictable, well-calculated set of targets. If anyone chooses their enemies well, it\u2019s them.</p> <p>But there\u2019s one issue on which there\u2019s no agreement between American rightwing populists and their peers in the rest of the world: what to make of Silicon Valley. On the one hand, its services and platforms have been a boon to the populists everywhere, greatly boosting their audience numbers and allowing them to target potential voters with highly personalized messages; the Cambridge Analytica fiasco has made it quite clear. Today, upstart and new rightwing parties like Spain\u2019s Vox instinctively understand the primacy of digital battles; Vox already <a href=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/12/actualidad/1544624671_005462.html\">leads</a> all other Spanish parties in terms of Instagram followers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Steve Bannon called people leading \u2018evil\u2019 Silicon Valley \u2018complete narcissists\u2019 and \u2018sociopaths\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This pragmatic embrace of digital platforms is where the populist consensus ends; the intellectual evaluation of Silicon Valley\u2019s significance is rather cacophonous. The American wing of the movement sees big tech as an attractive target of attack; for them, Silicon Valley is a bizarre mix of greedy capitalists and \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d, keen on indoctrinating their users into leftwing ideas while getting filthy rich off everyone\u2019s data. Populists in the rest of the world, in contrast, see Silicon Valley\u2019s platforms as their best chance of escaping the intellectual hegemony of their own domestic \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d, firmly ensconced in elite institutions, such as the media, the academia, and the Deep State.</p> <p>In an August 2018 <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/30/media/reliable-sources-08-29-18/index.html\">interview</a> with CNN, Steve Bannon called people leading \u201cevil\u201d Silicon Valley \u201ccomplete narcissists\u201d and \u201csociopaths\u201d; the data grabbed by their companies, he insisted, should be \u201cput in a public trust\u201d. He also predicted that big tech would be one of the main themes of the 2020 presidential election.</p> <p>Given that the anger towards Silicon Valley is also growing on the left \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the latest sensation of American leftist politics, memorably <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/22/amazon-hq-2-new-york-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-1012546\">attacked</a> New York City\u2019s $3bn welcome package to Amazon \u2013 it seems like a reasonable prediction.

      "bodyText": "The emerging global movement of rightwing populists is guilty of many things but ideological incoherence in choosing their enemies is generally not one of them. Whether it is Steve Bannon bashing Pope Francis, Matteo Salvini attacking the \u201cdo-gooders\u201d in humanitarian NGOs or Marine Le Pen venting against the dull technocrats in Brussels, the populists go after a predictable, well-calculated set of targets. If anyone chooses their enemies well, it\u2019s them. But there\u2019s one issue on which there\u2019s no agreement between American rightwing populists and their peers in the rest of the world: what to make of Silicon Valley. On the one hand, its services and platforms have been a boon to the populists everywhere, greatly boosting their audience numbers and allowing them to target potential voters with highly personalized messages; the Cambridge Analytica fiasco has made it quite clear. Today, upstart and new rightwing parties like Spain\u2019s Vox instinctively understand the primacy of digital battles; Vox already leads all other Spanish parties in terms of Instagram followers. This pragmatic embrace of digital platforms is where the populist consensus ends; the intellectual evaluation of Silicon Valley\u2019s significance is rather cacophonous. The American wing of the movement sees big tech as an attractive target of attack; for them, Silicon Valley is a bizarre mix of greedy capitalists and \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d, keen on indoctrinating their users into leftwing ideas while getting filthy rich off everyone\u2019s data. Populists in the rest of the world, in contrast, see Silicon Valley\u2019s platforms as their best chance of escaping the intellectual hegemony of their own domestic \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d, firmly ensconced in elite institutions, such as the media, the academia, and the Deep State. In an August 2018 interview with CNN, Steve Bannon called people leading \u201cevil\u201d Silicon Valley \u201ccomplete narcissists\u201d and \u201csociopaths\u201d; the data grabbed by their companies, he insisted, should be \u201cput in a public trust\u201d. He also predicted that big tech would be one of the main themes of the 2020 presidential election. Given that the anger towards Silicon Valley is also growing on the left \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the latest sensation of American leftist politics, memorably attacked New York City\u2019s $3bn welcome package to Amazon \u2013 it seems like a reasonable prediction. Silicon Valley appears to be a perfect enemy for non-centrist forces in America, as bashing it helps to delegitimize the legacy of Obama and Clinton, seen as its primary enablers. Others on the right endorse Bannon\u2019s opinions. Brad Parscale, the digital media director of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, has complained that \u201cBig tech monsters like Google and Facebook have become nothing less than incubators for far-left liberal ideologies and are doing everything they can to eradicate conservative ideas and their proponents from the internet.\u201d Recent bans on far-right and conservative personalities by social media and online fundraising platforms have only amplified such perceptions of Silicon Valley. Even Donald Trump complained that Google was \u201csuppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good\u201d \u2013 a \u201cvery serious situation\u201d that, he promised, \u201cwill be addressed\u201d. To see the sharp contrast with how rightwing populists elsewhere perceive Silicon Valley, one could turn to a viral clip from Bolsonaro\u2019s recent inauguration in Brazil, where a crowd of his supporters were filmed chanting \u201cWhatsApp, WhatsApp! Facebook, Facebook!\u201d This is hardly an atypical feeling. In 2017, when he was still a member of the European Parliament, Matteo Salvini delivered a feisty speech against attempts to crack down on fake news, declaring that the old elite ways of setting the public agenda were over. He concluded with \u201cLong Live Facebook!\u201d (he likewise thanked the site after the party did well in the 2018 elections). Salvini\u2019s coalition partners, the Five Star Movement, have distanced themselves from the likes of Bannon and Bolsonaro. But, as a movement started by a blogger and propelled by social media, they, too, are enamored of big tech. Its culture of disruption is precisely what they hope to emulate with their rhetoric of turning Italy into a \u201csmart nation\u201d \u2013 for example, by endorsing the further Italian expansion of Amazon justified on the grounds that the data of Italian enterprises handled by the firm will now be stored locally. Last year\u2019s battle about a controversial piece of legislation \u2013 the European Union Copyright Directive \u2013 nicely illustrates the bizarre friendship between Silicon Valley and European populists.

A neighbour, Annmarie Crossland, 36, said she heard Stevens\u2019 brother and her former partner \u201cscreaming and shouting\u201d in the alley behind the house before another neighbour rang 999 around 3.30pm. \u201cParamedics arrived first and shot off down the back, then another came and then just all police covered the whole street,\u201d she said. Crossland described Stevens as a \u201cbrilliant mum\u201d, adding: \u201cThey were gorgeous little kids. Great, really nice. She would take them to the park and into Bolton. They were very friendly.\u201d Margaret Knox, 62, a friend of the family who has known Tiffany since she was a baby, said she was devastated to hear about the deaths. She said: \u201cI have treated Tiffany like my own daughter throughout her life and for this to happen has shaken us. We loved them very much and we\u2019re all hurt. I have not slept since I found out what had happened. \u201cWe had Christmas with Tiffany and the girls. There\u2019s no way we could\u2019ve seen this coming. No one knows what has happened but we are waiting to hear more from the police.\u201d She added: \u201cHer mother is my best friend and she\u2019s coming from Manchester so hopefully we will know more by the time she arrives.\u201d Supt Rick Jackson, of GMP\u2019s Bolton borough, said: \u201cThis is an incredibly tragic incident and we have specialist officers supporting the family at this unimaginably difficult time. \u201cWe are keeping an open mind as to what happened to the woman and her children and the investigation is likely to take some time, however, based on what we know so far, we are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.\u201d He urged anyone with information to contact the police. Sean Hornby, the councillor for Little Lever and Darcy Lever, told the Bolton News the incident was \u201cdevastating\u201d. \u201cI have spoken to residents in the area, they are obviously shocked and very upset. I am saddened by the news, my thoughts are with close relatives of the family.\u201d",

The Czech has not lost more than five games in any of her matches so far and is through to the last four at a slam for the first time since winning her second Wimbledon title in 2014 and a little over two years after fearing she might never play again when she was stabbed in the hand by an intruder at her home. </p> <p>Kvitova\u2019s victory, meanwhile, ensures Simona Halep will be replaced as world No 1, although Naomi Osaka, Karolina Pliskova and Elina Svitolina are also in the frame. </p> <p>Kvitova began her on-court interview by apologising to the deflated crowd, saying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry guys. She\u2019s such a nice person and you should be very proud of her. It was a great match definitely. She came back well, she didn\u2019t give me anything for free and I really had to fight until the end.\u201d </p> <p>The 28-year-old became emotional when asked about the struggles she has been through, choking back tears as she said: \u201cI didn\u2019t really imagine to be back in this great stadium, it\u2019s great.\u201d </p> <p>Kvitova\u2019s comeback has been one of the sport\u2019s more remarkable stories but her failure to back up impressive form on the WTA Tour at the grand slams last year meant she arrived in Melbourne with little fanfare despite winning the warm-up tournament in Sydney. </p> <p>In the final a little over a week ago she defeated Barty in a tight tussle decided by a third-set tie-break after the Australian had won the opening set for the loss of only one game. Here it was Kvitova who raced through the opener, her clean power-hitting too much for Barty, who looked to be feeling the weight of expectation upon her shoulders.</p> <p>The 22-year-old dug in at the start of the second set and began to disrupt Kvitova\u2019s rhythm but chances to break came and went in the opening two games and, when the Czech seized her opportunity at 5-4, the end swiftly followed.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c46ec01e4b0197a614f7c83\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-22T10:10:19.545Z\">10.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the Nadal v Tiafoe liveblog.

Kvitova hits an unreturnable serve, but at 30-15 Barty\u2019s mishit loops and spins, lands just in and helps her win the point. 30-30 is a battle but one Kvitova wins, forcing Barty into a desperate defensive backhand that lands midcourt, and we all know what the Czech does with those.

Barty deals with that very impressively, with a fine first serve out wide followed by a powerful drive into the empty court, but Kvitova hits another backhand winner to set up another, and Barty having saved that one earns one more with a drop shot. And this one she wins with a vicious return to Barty\u2019s ankles!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c46d5cbe4b00173154a8e20\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-22T08:38:47.975Z\">8.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>First set: Kvitova* 1-0 Barty</strong> Kvitova won the coin toss, chose to serve, and does so.

      "bodyText": "From the Press Association: Petra Kvitova ended hopes of a home singles champion at the Australian Open with a crushing victory over Ashleigh Barty in the quarter-finals. Barty was the first Australian woman to reach the last eight for 10 years and there was optimism she could become the first home winner since Chris O\u2019Neil in 1978, but Kvitova was in devastating form in a 6-1, 6-4 victory. The Czech has not lost more than five games in any of her matches so far and is through to the last four at a slam for the first time since winning her second Wimbledon title in 2014 and a little over two years after fearing she might never play again when she was stabbed in the hand by an intruder at her home. Kvitova\u2019s victory, meanwhile, ensures Simona Halep will be replaced as world No 1, although Naomi Osaka, Karolina Pliskova and Elina Svitolina are also in the frame. Kvitova began her on-court interview by apologising to the deflated crowd, saying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry guys. She\u2019s such a nice person and you should be very proud of her. It was a great match definitely. She came back well, she didn\u2019t give me anything for free and I really had to fight until the end.\u201d The 28-year-old became emotional when asked about the struggles she has been through, choking back tears as she said: \u201cI didn\u2019t really imagine to be back in this great stadium, it\u2019s great.\u201d Kvitova\u2019s comeback has been one of the sport\u2019s more remarkable stories but her failure to back up impressive form on the WTA Tour at the grand slams last year meant she arrived in Melbourne with little fanfare despite winning the warm-up tournament in Sydney. In the final a little over a week ago she defeated Barty in a tight tussle decided by a third-set tie-break after the Australian had won the opening set for the loss of only one game. Here it was Kvitova who raced through the opener, her clean power-hitting too much for Barty, who looked to be feeling the weight of expectation upon her shoulders. The 22-year-old dug in at the start of the second set and began to disrupt Kvitova\u2019s rhythm but chances to break came and went in the opening two games and, when the Czech seized her opportunity at 5-4, the end swiftly followed. Here\u2019s the Nadal v Tiafoe liveblog. See you there. Bye! I\u2019ll shortly be switching to a totally new liveblog for the Nadal match. He and Tiafoe have never played before; Stefanos Tsitsipas awaits the winner. Here\u2019s Pat Cash\u2019s summary on Eurosport of the Kvitova v Barty match. He pretty much nails it: Kvitova was very close to unplayable today. Full credit to Petra Kvitova \u2013 she played unbelievably well. I think Ashleigh Barty threw a whole lot of stuff at her in the second set but once Petra gets going she\u2019s almost unstoppable. She was really going for her shots and they certainly went in today. Everyone in Australia is very proud of Ash and this is a benchmark for her at the Slams \u2013 there is definitely more to come. Anyway, on with the tennis. Frances Tiafoe and Rafael Nadal are coming onto the court now for their quarter-final. Kvitova hasn\u2019t dropped a set, and Danielle Collins won\u2019t have seen much today to give her any encouragement ahead of their semi-final. Kvitova was just phenomenal. It\u2019s worth reading this from a year or so ago if you\u2019re not aware of where those tears came from: Barty has had a great run, and there will be more to come from her. But Kvitova was a powerhouse tonight. She hit 25 winners to Barty\u2019s eight, which is the only statistic you need. Here\u2019s what she says: First, I\u2019m sorry guys. I beat Ashleigh. She\u2019s such a nice person and you should be very proud of her. It was a great match. I started better, I served well, I took the first break. In the second she came back, she didn\u2019t give me anything for free and I really had to fight until the end. When Jim Courier brings up the challenges Kvitova has had to face to return to a Slam semi-final, she gets a bit teary: I didn\u2019t really imagine being back on this great stadium and playing with the best. It\u2019s great. She\u2019s asked about Danielle Collins, who she beat in a gruelling three-setter in Brisbane not long ago: I won it, but it was over three hours. Hopefully it will be less than three hours here. She\u2019s very fearless and she\u2019s been very aggressive. I do remember the match from Sydney. I really need to be better this time. It\u2019s a semi-final so, who cares? Second set: Kvitova* 6-1, 6-4 Barty At 15-0 Barty comes to the net and for a while the pair exchange shots, Kvitova failing to find the pass and Barty failing to put away a volley, before the Australian dodges out of the way of a ball drive towards her body, which goes on to land long. Kvitova hits an unreturnable serve, but at 30-15 Barty\u2019s mishit loops and spins, lands just in and helps her win the point. 30-30 is a battle but one Kvitova wins, forcing Barty into a desperate defensive backhand that lands midcourt, and we all know what the Czech does with those. Match point, and facing the second serve Barty nets her return and it\u2019s all over! Second set: Kvitova 6-1, 5-4 Barty* Kvitova\u2019s shot-making from midcourt really is phenomenal. When she has a ball to put away, she does so with extreme vengeance. Just as Barty had hinted with her sliced backhand at discovering a method of beating Kvitova, the Czech turns on the power to take back control and in the end Kvitova breaks to 15 and will serve for the match! Second set: Kvitova* 6-1, 4-4 Barty At 30-15 Barty plays a lovely rally, won in the end with a backhand of vicious slice and spin. Kvitova keeps it in play, but swiftly loses the point. She wins the next couple, though, despite a time warning. Second set: Kvitova 6-1, 3-4 Barty* Another hold for Barty, wrapped up with an inch-perfect ace that drops on the angle of the T. The two best points in this game both involve Barty drop-shots. The first one Kvitova just reaches, but her attempt to lift the ball over Barty is underpowered and leaves an easy putaway volley. The second Kvitova reaches easily, puts back into play, Barty hits into what looks an empty court only for the Czech to roar across and volley a winner. Second set: Kvitova* 6-1, 3-3 Barty At 30-0 Barty attempts a drop-shot/lob double-whammy, which is eyecatching but fatally undermined by an overhit lob. Kvitova also holds to love. Second set: Kvitova 6-1, 2-3 Barty* Barty holds to love! She won 31% of all points on her first serve in the first set, and is winning 83% of those points in this one. Second set: Kvitova* 6-1, 2-2 Barty Barty comes to the net again, but Kvitova powers the ball down the line and Barty overhits her volley. Then at 15-15 there\u2019s an excellent rally, with Barty repeatedly hitting heavily sliced backhands just over the net. Kvitova wins that, only to giftwrap the following point with a wild forehand. Barty Australian takes it to deuce with perhaps her best shot of the match, a vicious crosscourt backhand return, and wins the next point to earn a chance of a break. Kvitova wins that, and eventually the game, but this set is an entirely different beast to the first. Second set: Kvitova 6-1, 1-2 Barty* Kvitova comes to the net on the back of a strangely tentative approach shot, and Barty punishes her for it. The crowd roars, and again when Barty hits a forehand winner to take the next point. She holds to 15, the game won when Kvitova\u2019s sliced backhand down the line return floats about three feet wide. Second set: Kvitova* 6-1, 1-1 Barty Kvitova starts with a double fault, and then goes 15-30 down when a mishit lands well long. She mistimes another shot in the next rally, but this one lands in and she resumes control from there. Barty, though, is not offput, and wins her first break point of the match with an excellent backhand down the line. Whereupon Kvitova comes up with her first ace of the match, follows it with her second ace of the match, and though she has to come through another deuce she holds from there. Second set: Kvitova 6-1, 0-1 Barty* A game of immense important for Barty, who desperately needed a foothold in this match. And she\u2019s got one, holding to 15 and winning the game with her, and the match\u2019s, first ace! First set: Kvitova* 6-1 Barty The first point is won with an absolutely phenomenal backhand, struck crosscourt and landing perfectly in the corner of the court. Barty was running in the other direction and got absolutely nowhere near it, so it would have been a clean winner even if it had been much less precise, but it was perfection. Barty tries to change things up by coming to the net, but doesn\u2019t really have the wingspan to trouble Kvitova from there, abandons that experiment pretty swiftly, and goes back to being beaten from the baseline. Kvitova wins the first set in double-quick time, and has looked fantastic doing so. First set: Kvitova 5-1 Barty* This is not at all what the whole of Australia were hoping it would be. Kvitova breaks again, to love this time, and will now serve for the set. First set: Kvitova* 4-1 Barty Kvitova is 9-2 up on winners (a statistic that hadn\u2019t changed for a couple of games until she smashed a straightforward forehand crosscourt to win this one), and 11-3 up on unforced errors. Barty has only taken 15 points, so she has only actually won 27% of those. First set: Kvitova 3-1 Barty* The first point goes thus: Barty serves, pretty well. Kvitova meets it at shoulder height from inside the baseline, and pummels a winner crosscourt. And so it goes. There are two types of point here: the ones Kvitova wins when she nails a phenomenal winner, and the ones she loses when she fails to nail her phenomenal winner. Barty is just hanging in there and hoping for the best, and on this occasion it\u2019s enough to win the game (though an excellent serve down the middle on game point wraps it up). First set: Kvitova* 3-0 Barty This has been a brilliant start from Kvitova, who is smashing winners around the court with terrifying ease. But then at 30-0 she hits a forehand wide and then another long, and follows that with a double fault. Barty finds herself with a break point, having not hit a winner all game. She very nearly wins it as well, but Kvitova saves herself with a fantastic defensive backhand, hit from a couple of feet behind her body, and reasserts herself from there. First set: Kvitova 2-0 Barty* An early break! A lovely crosscourt backhand drop-shot from Kvitova makes it 15-15, and then from a similar position she powers one down the line, another clean winner. She hits a return long to lose the next point, but then another backhand winner sets up break point. Barty deals with that very impressively, with a fine first serve out wide followed by a powerful drive into the empty court, but Kvitova hits another backhand winner to set up another, and Barty having saved that one earns one more with a drop shot. And this one she wins with a vicious return to Barty\u2019s ankles! First set: Kvitova* 1-0 Barty Kvitova won the coin toss, chose to serve, and does so. She\u2019s pretty much straight in the groove, hitting the first serves, and going 30-0 up with an excellent forehand. Barty passes well to make it 30-15 but her foothold in the game does not last long, and Kvitova wins it with an unreturnable serve down the middle. The warm-up is over. Action imminent. Barty walks out, to wild shrieks of appreciation. Kvitova is introduced to the crowd, and warmly received. Kvitova is backstage on the RLA, and ready for action. Looks like this is about to happen! The whole quite-tennis-to-play-cricket thing makes Barty\u2019s story really unique. Here she is on returning to tennis two years ago: I was very young, but I turn 20 this year and it\u2019s a different perspective on life and tennis in general. If it works, great. If it doesn\u2019t, I can\u2019t really complain. I\u2019ve had a phenomenal career for the short time that I did play. The evening session was due to start at 7pm local/8am GMT, but the day session went on a bit late, hence the slight delay. Something should actually happen shortly. Pat Cash is working for Eurosport, who unconventionally are doing without a studio and just chatting in the middle of a crowd outside the Rod Laver Arena. Here\u2019s what he\u2019s got to say about the sense of excitement in Australia for this match: It\u2019s been a long time since we could legitimately get excited about a player and get to a final, but I think she can do it, I really can. But also, her personality \u2013 people love her. After the controversy of the men\u2019s players, to see a player like this, it\u2019s just a really great story of someone who is doing great. That\u2019s what you want, a great story. Collins will play the winner of the Kvitova v Barty match in the semi-finals. She has a brief chat on-court: My first time playing on Rod Laver, and I didn\u2019t even practice on here before, so this was quite the experience. All the Australian fans have really made me at home here, it\u2019s just an incredible atmosphere here. And Collins wins! Although Pavlyuchenkova redoubles her efforts in the final minutes to make it a bit of a fight at the end, Collins takes it 2-6, 7-5, 6-1. On the Rod Laver Arena at the moment, Danielle Collins is smashing Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Having lost the first set 2-6, she\u2019s now 5-0 up in the third. Collins is 25, the world No35, and before this tournament had never won a Grand Slam match in five attempts over three years. Hello world! For the first time in a decade there is an Australian woman in the second week of the singles at the Australian Open. Ashleigh Barty, the 22-year-old from Ipswich, Queensland, is in her first Grand Slam quarter-final, having only once previously made it past the round of 32. She faces Petra Kvitova, veteran of five Grand Slam semi-finals, 10 quarter-finals, winner of two Wimbledon titles, and winner also of the only three previous matches between these two players. These matches have, though, been increasingly close. After a humdrum 6-1, 6-2 Kvitova victory in the 2012 French Open they would not meet again for five years, until Kvitova came through a three-setter at Edgbaston in 2017. Then just over a week ago they played an absolute snorter in the final of the Sydney International, Barty storming through the first set before losing the next two on the slenderest of margins. \u201cOne day,\u201d Kvitova said at the end, \u201cyou\u2019re going to make it for sure.\u201d Is this going to be that day? This would probably be a good place for a match report from Sydney: And here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s take on Barty\u2019s victory over Maria Sharapova in the last round: \u201cI know that I have to go out there and try and be as brave as possible,\u201d Barty said of this match. \u201cIf I get my opportunities, they\u2019ll be few and far between so I know I have to take them with both hands and try and really get stuck into her service games.\u201d It\u2019s bold talk. On this stage, under this pressure, with all this attention, in the biggest match of her career, can Barty blossom? She has already proven that she can trouble Kvitova; now she only has to beat her. Welcome, one and all. Let\u2019s see how she goes, shall we?",

I\u2019ve always considered myself lucky in the sense that I have never had a particularly hateful relationship with it, never had an eating disorder or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/06/the-ugly-truth-about-body-dysmorphia\" title=\"\">body dysmorphia</a>, and have what I consider to be a pretty healthy attitude to food.

In the immediate aftermath, I treated my body with the disrespect I felt it deserved. I ate crap, drank too much, put on more weight than I ever had, and generally displayed a total lack of care towards this vessel that carried me through the world.</p> <p>At the moment, I am more at peace with my body. Addressing feelings of dirtiness in therapy was crucial in helping me get over what I saw as a lack of purity, as was establishing a regular exercise pattern. I still have days where I feel an impulse to abuse my body, where I feel as if I could vomit and it might make me cleaner, but now \u2013 mostly \u2013 I have the good sense not to listen to the voice of my shame.</p> <h2>The people that love you most may not understand your suffering</h2> <p>There is nothing like watching the people you love suffer because of you. I am not being self-deprecating here, but stating the facts. I was and am lucky enough to have a large and stable support network, but the more people that love you, the more people hurt because of what happened to you. My family, my boyfriend, my closest friends, my cousins: I struggled, and still do, with the feeling of burdening them with this great pain. They were angry (I wasn\u2019t), they were confused, they were worried, they were grieving. Secondary trauma can be terrible. It\u2019s confusing to process other people\u2019s hurt when you are suffering as acutely as I was.</p> <p>What was more confusing was that as desperately as they wanted to help me, they couldn\u2019t actually understand what I was going through. Having no friends who had \u2013 to my knowledge \u2013 been assaulted increased the sense of isolation inherent to trauma. Making peace with an experience that you can\u2019t convey in words to your nearest and dearest is something that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop struggling with.</p> <h2>Relationships will suffer</h2> <p>This is one of the hardest things to accept. When something terrible happens to you, you will lose people. It\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not right and it\u2019s not nice. But trauma causes fractures. Sometimes, it\u2019s because people surprise you: they don\u2019t support you in ways you expected them to. They say insensitive things. It\u2019s usually not their fault, since sensitivity is so heightened in the sufferer.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/23/seven-ways-to-deal-with-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd\" title=\"\">PTSD</a> can also cause irrational and erratic behaviour that can drive people away. On a very basic level, no one wants to hang out with somebody who is always in pain \u2013 that\u2019s not immoral or insensitive, it\u2019s just human. We all need to protect ourselves. My relationship with my boyfriend broke down within months after I was raped \u2013 hardly surprising given the stamp of trauma that the assault had placed on our existence as a couple. It was hard to see past the dreadfulness of the situation, and I think we both began to associate each other with suffering.</p> <p>Having said that, there are some friendships that have become stronger than ever. And my family, though always close, has entered a new era of openness and emotional honesty. We\u2019ve become a family that discuss our feelings around the dinner table, that tell each other we love each other for no reason. Because who knows what might happen tomorrow?</p> <h2>There will be good days, and terrible days</h2> <p>This probably won\u2019t ever change. Some days I wake up, and for no particular reason, rise with it at the back of my mind and it stays there all day. Other days I wake up and feel as though my heart is a rock and my brain is barbed wire, and I can\u2019t even begin to think about what will happen next. Some days, I feel nothing at all. Those are the scariest, because that\u2019s when I worry I might not be myself any more. A large part of recovery is, I think, learning to live with the bad days. Learning how to stay level when you\u2019ve had a sleep plagued with nightmares and a day plagued with flashbacks, and then someone at work makes a joke about your skirt being too short: learning how to not fall off the cliff edge on these days?</p> <p>I\u2019ll get back to you on this; I haven\u2019t figured it out yet.</p> <h2>Life goes on</h2> <p>Knowing this is both my hope and my despair, my lifeline and my death sentence. Things happen all the time to everyone. Some people go through life experiencing nothing terrible, nothing objectively life-changing. Some bear on their shoulders pain meant for 10 people. Nothing is certain, and living with uncertainty is something human beings are bad at. It is something that going through a traumatic event makes you better at, but it never becomes easy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/08/women-men-curfew-danger-fear\">Imagine if men were afraid to walk home alone at night | Katy Guest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watching the people around me get on with their lives, while mine seems to have partially stalled, is hard.

Find your way through a pitch-black maze of underground stairs and corridors, and you\u2019ll arrive at a 21st-century techno mecca, and a potent symbol of political rupture in post-Soviet Georgia.</p> <p>In just a few years, Bassiani has become a catalyst for progressive politics in a conservative society. It has also helped make Tbilisi a dream destination for techno tourists, who complete their long weekends with a soak in the city\u2019s sulphurous hot springs and a few bracing shots of <em>chacha</em>. The club traces its roots to 2013, when co-founders Zviad Gelbakhiani, Tato Getia and Naja Orashvili held a rave in the city\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/nov/15/vanity-projects-and-kamikaze-loggias-tbilisi-architectural-disaster\">\u201ctubes\u201d \u2013 two worm-like structures designed as a concert hall but left unfinished</a> and abandoned. \u201cIt was the very first night of pure techno in town,\u201d says Gelbakhiani, who remembers it as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d. He goes on: \u201cMany [in our generation] would say that was the one. One year later, we began Bassiani.\u201d</p> <p>After starting out as a warehouse party, Bassiani \u2013 meaning \u201cone with the bass\u201d \u2013 moved into the stadium in 2014 thanks to a chance acquaintance with the director of the national football team. Sharing certain similarities with Berlin techno destination <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/12/berlins-berghain-nightclub-classed-as-culturally-significant-venue\">Berghain</a>, the club has two rooms with distinct personalities: there\u2019s Bassiani itself, the vast concrete cavern with its striking spotlights and incredible, pin-sharp sound. Then upstairs is Horoom (the name comes from a traditional dance), a more intimate space and one that is defiantly queer in a country where Orthodox Christian values prevail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"076a57fee435288b7272e00a24b9379c7bc5271f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/076a57fee435288b7272e00a24b9379c7bc5271f/0_0_960_639/500.jpg\" alt=\"The dark corners at Bassiani.\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cavern \u2026 the dark corners at Bassiani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bassiani</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition to its unique setting and permissive atmosphere, Bassiani has nurtured a cadre of resident DJs \u2013 including HVL, Kancheli and NDRX \u2013 who have since broken into the European scene. A certain kind of neck-deep, full-pelt techno is prevalent, but there\u2019s no house style; on any given night you might hear dirty ghetto house, 80s goth and roughneck breaks. Recent international bookings include Clone Records boss Serge, rising techno talent Anastasia Kristensen and scruffy house herbert Mall Grab.

      "bodyText": "Lurking below the hulking concrete cantilevers of Tbilisi\u2019s Dinamo Arena, an Olympic-sized doughnut near the banks of the Mtkvari river, is one of the greatest nightclubs in the world. Find your way through a pitch-black maze of underground stairs and corridors, and you\u2019ll arrive at a 21st-century techno mecca, and a potent symbol of political rupture in post-Soviet Georgia. In just a few years, Bassiani has become a catalyst for progressive politics in a conservative society. It has also helped make Tbilisi a dream destination for techno tourists, who complete their long weekends with a soak in the city\u2019s sulphurous hot springs and a few bracing shots of chacha. The club traces its roots to 2013, when co-founders Zviad Gelbakhiani, Tato Getia and Naja Orashvili held a rave in the city\u2019s \u201ctubes\u201d \u2013 two worm-like structures designed as a concert hall but left unfinished and abandoned. \u201cIt was the very first night of pure techno in town,\u201d says Gelbakhiani, who remembers it as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d. He goes on: \u201cMany [in our generation] would say that was the one. One year later, we began Bassiani.\u201d After starting out as a warehouse party, Bassiani \u2013 meaning \u201cone with the bass\u201d \u2013 moved into the stadium in 2014 thanks to a chance acquaintance with the director of the national football team. Sharing certain similarities with Berlin techno destination Berghain, the club has two rooms with distinct personalities: there\u2019s Bassiani itself, the vast concrete cavern with its striking spotlights and incredible, pin-sharp sound. Then upstairs is Horoom (the name comes from a traditional dance), a more intimate space and one that is defiantly queer in a country where Orthodox Christian values prevail. In addition to its unique setting and permissive atmosphere, Bassiani has nurtured a cadre of resident DJs \u2013 including HVL, Kancheli and NDRX \u2013 who have since broken into the European scene. A certain kind of neck-deep, full-pelt techno is prevalent, but there\u2019s no house style; on any given night you might hear dirty ghetto house, 80s goth and roughneck breaks. Recent international bookings include Clone Records boss Serge, rising techno talent Anastasia Kristensen and scruffy house herbert Mall Grab. Diversity is a guiding principle, from the music to the individuals in the crowd. To weed out troublemakers, ticket buyers must submit their Facebook profile for vetting. \u201cI don\u2019t really like the concept of \u2018face control\u2019 \u2013 it really categorises people \u2013 but the reason we\u2019re doing it is the safety of the audience,\u201d explains Gelbakhiani. \u201cWe really support LGBTQ people and there are many of them dancing in the club, so we don\u2019t want to see somebody being aggressive. Safety comes first.\u201d Away from the dancefloor, there\u2019s plenty more to explore: the warren of dark rooms that offer a rare space for sexual encounters in a country where many young people live with their parents, and a smoking area where tired clubbers can take a nap or, since last year, smoke a spliff. The decriminalisation of cannabis has been a confusing development in the standoff between Georgia\u2019s young, progressive generation and their conservative elders. In May last year, armed police raided Bassiani and made eight drug-related arrests; in response, thousands of clubbers protested outside parliament, sparking a dramatic weekend of counter-demonstrations and riot police intervention. Through its connections with the White Noise movement, which has campaigned for a relaxation of Georgia\u2019s harsh drug laws, Bassiani has become a flashpoint for changing attitudes to drugs. The years after the 2012 election of a pro-European government were \u201creally confusing for all of us\u201d, says Gelbakhiani. \u201cOne day the government is demonising the whole clubbing scene, and the next day they say that marijuana is not bad for your health and we should decriminalise it.\u201d After the raids, Bassiani remained closed for several weeks, which nearly bankrupted the business \u2013 but the drama ultimately served to galvanise the city\u2019s progressive factions. \u201cLast year was really hectic and stressful,\u201d says Gelbakhiani. \u201cWe became a really big part of the political processes in town.

This without the Orlando Pride fans is nothing for me.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to leave his hometown club, where he had worked for 13 years, mid-season, was not easy. Birmingham are fourth in the Women\u2019s Super League, the departure of Skinner perhaps a factor in the latest of their four losses that have left them six points off the top as it came after the announcement of his step across the pond. On top of that he has a new baby with his partner, the former England international Laura Bassett.</p> <p>But this was an opportunity he couldn\u2019t turn down. \u201cEverybody in England knows I love Birmingham,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cIt\u2019s my home city, and I wouldn\u2019t have left it for anything other than a project like this with such wonderful potential.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mesmerising. Just being here, it\u2019s a different level. I hope it doesn\u2019t affect Birmingham too much, we tried to leave Birmingham in a place where it would be able to be self sufficient and I hope that they show that over the last part of the season. They\u2019ve done so much and there\u2019s a lot of love for them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.<br></strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The love is mutual. It would have been easy for fans and players to be angry or irritated with their outgoing manager but instead, there is sorrow and well-wishing \u2013 something that has surprised Skinner. \u201cI think that\u2019s been the most surreal part. I\u2019m in awe of the outreach and outpouring and lovely comments that people have made. I think that\u2019s testament to Birmingham and the fans, they are genuinely happy for people that progress and, look, hopefully they saw the job that we did at Birmingham and think it\u2019s good.\u201d</p> <p>Orlando Pride turned to Skinner after a disappointing seventh\u2011place finish in the NWSL led to Tom Sermanni\u2019s departure, and the Englishman believes it is the similarity between the clubs and their ethos that attracted them to him. \u201cThere\u2019s such a wonderful vibe around this club. They are like Birmingham, they are family orientated. They have values as a club, it\u2019s not just a cutthroat business and that was really important for me. You have to pick your projects carefully and you have to pick something that fits in with your personality and then I really started to feel what I could bring here.\u201d</p> <p>Pride come with some big names.

I\u2019m going to get to know each individual, I\u2019m going to care for them like I did at Birmingham and once they know that I care for them, once they know that I want success for them, I think it would be a pretty stubborn person that wouldn\u2019t want to buy into that.\u201d</p> <p>Skinner has form. Before his two years as manager in the West Midlands, he spent 10 years as the club\u2019s technical director. \u201cI think that shaped me. I still think players need developing regardless of their stature, regardless of their experience within the game and their age. I\u2019ve done it before and I\u2019ll do it again. I\u2019m able to see the skill set they have and improve it.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI asked the guys if I could just spend a little bit of time in the middle of the pitch to visualise what the players go through.\u201d Standing in front of 25,500 purple seats, the new Orlando Pride manager Marc Skinner paused to drink it all in. It is a world away from Solihull Moors\u2019 3,050\u2011capacity Damson Park, where his former club, Birmingham City women, ply their trade. \u201cThere\u2019s a famous picture of Andr\u00e9s Iniesta on the pitch after his last game for Barcelona sitting in the middle of the field and I think he\u2019s just trying to take it in, all the emotions, and think about them and that was what I was trying to do,\u201d says the 35-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for me that we connect with the fans in the stands, give them an identity, I tried to do that at Birmingham, so they feel a part of what we\u2019re doing. This without the Orlando Pride fans is nothing for me.\u201d The decision to leave his hometown club, where he had worked for 13 years, mid-season, was not easy. Birmingham are fourth in the Women\u2019s Super League, the departure of Skinner perhaps a factor in the latest of their four losses that have left them six points off the top as it came after the announcement of his step across the pond. On top of that he has a new baby with his partner, the former England international Laura Bassett. But this was an opportunity he couldn\u2019t turn down. \u201cEverybody in England knows I love Birmingham,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cIt\u2019s my home city, and I wouldn\u2019t have left it for anything other than a project like this with such wonderful potential. \u201cIt\u2019s mesmerising. Just being here, it\u2019s a different level. I hope it doesn\u2019t affect Birmingham too much, we tried to leave Birmingham in a place where it would be able to be self sufficient and I hope that they show that over the last part of the season. They\u2019ve done so much and there\u2019s a lot of love for them.\u201d The love is mutual. It would have been easy for fans and players to be angry or irritated with their outgoing manager but instead, there is sorrow and well-wishing \u2013 something that has surprised Skinner. \u201cI think that\u2019s been the most surreal part. I\u2019m in awe of the outreach and outpouring and lovely comments that people have made. I think that\u2019s testament to Birmingham and the fans, they are genuinely happy for people that progress and, look, hopefully they saw the job that we did at Birmingham and think it\u2019s good.\u201d Orlando Pride turned to Skinner after a disappointing seventh\u2011place finish in the NWSL led to Tom Sermanni\u2019s departure, and the Englishman believes it is the similarity between the clubs and their ethos that attracted them to him. \u201cThere\u2019s such a wonderful vibe around this club. They are like Birmingham, they are family orientated. They have values as a club, it\u2019s not just a cutthroat business and that was really important for me. You have to pick your projects carefully and you have to pick something that fits in with your personality and then I really started to feel what I could bring here.\u201d Pride come with some big names. The six-time world player of the year Marta is on the roster, alongside her compatriot Camila and Alex Morgan. \u201cOne thing they all have in common is they all want to win,\u201d explains Skinner, whose arrival means six of the nine head coaches in the league are English. \u201cIf they want to win then I have to find out how they work together to bring them towards that common goal and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll make sure that I do. \u201cI\u2019m all about people before players. I\u2019m going to get to know each individual, I\u2019m going to care for them like I did at Birmingham and once they know that I care for them, once they know that I want success for them, I think it would be a pretty stubborn person that wouldn\u2019t want to buy into that.\u201d Skinner has form. Before his two years as manager in the West Midlands, he spent 10 years as the club\u2019s technical director. \u201cI think that shaped me. I still think players need developing regardless of their stature, regardless of their experience within the game and their age. I\u2019ve done it before and I\u2019ll do it again. I\u2019m able to see the skill set they have and improve it. That\u2019s shaped by my time developing players.\u201d He may have arrived during an international break, but Skinner has already started working. \u201cWhat I do is I send everyone a questionnaire. I want to get to know them before I meet them and then every player will have a one-to-one meeting before we come back to preseason. I\u2019ve already started the groundwork. There\u2019s nothing like standing in front of them and coaching but I\u2019ll get to know them as best I can so I understand what makes them tick.\u201d That is the most important thing for Skinner. \u201cWhen they are not feeling well who they would turn to? I need to know all the important people in their lives, the things they value. There are a lot of people that look up to these players but who looks after them? We forget about that, we look about them as commodities and not the people they are. Once we can get that right we\u2019ll be OK.\u201d Talking points \u2022 The 28-game unbeaten run of the US women\u2019s national team came to a grinding halt as the World Cup holders were defeated 3-1 by France.

      "body": "<p>This is an unexpected and unusual treat: a funny and clever collection of nonfiction stories that feels like a breath of fresh air. You could be forgiven for being unfamiliar with the name Keggie Carew if you missed her debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/26/dadlands-by-keggie-carew-dear-michael-love-dad-iain-maitland-review\" title=\"\"><em>Dadland: A Journey </em><em>Into Unchart</em><em>ed Territory</em></a>, about the extraordinary life story of her father as a complicated second world war hero. It was described by one literary prize judge as \u201cthe most unconventional biography I have ever read\u201d. Either because of or in spite of that, she won the Costa biography award in 2016 and <em>Dadland</em> became a bestseller.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to follow a win like that. And Carew has wisely taken a completely different direction, one more familiar for American writers of the <em>New Yorker</em> variety: a riot of fabulously eccentric autobiographical essays. The tone is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/david-sedaris\" title=\"\">David Sedaris</a>, without ever being as cynically arch or knowing as he is, with a hint of the gloriously awkward English comedy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/nina-stibbe\" title=\"\">Nina Stibbe</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/11/sue-townsend-1946-2014\" title=\"\">Sue Townsend</a>.</p> <p>The facts of Carew\u2019s life story are rarely stated explicitly in this collection but emerge by themselves. Carew is in her early 60s and was a visual artist for most of her life, exhibiting her work in New Zealand, Ireland and London. Overall, the writing has the presence and energy of someone who has come to writing late in life and has been burning to tell these stored-up tales for a long time. The world she evokes exudes a vibe of bohemian middle class occasionally fallen on hard times.</p> <p>In the introduction, she explains that <em>Quicksand Tales</em> is about celebrating \u201chuman fuck-ups\u201d: \u201cPerfect storms, incompetence, paranoia, insecurity, clumsiness, privileged lives and overfed white middle-class anxieties, dark deeds or pure bad luck at being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d She is straightforward and unpretentious. She tells you what she is going to do and then more than delivers on that promise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"393e2f65eca1c19f866c03677be4b8f48660c80c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/393e2f65eca1c19f866c03677be4b8f48660c80c/0_0_2749_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carew recounts her journey to California\u2019s Lake Tahoe as a teenager, in the 1970s, in the story The Late Visitor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carew recounts her journey to California\u2019s Lake Tahoe as a teenager, in the 1970s, in the story The Late Visitor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quicksand Tales: The Misadventures of Keggie Carew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What she also means is that she is one of those people that things happen to, no matter where she is (and she gets all over the place). Or, rather, she is good at remaking horrific incidents as entertaining anecdotes. In the story The Late Visitor, she recalls being a teenager in the late 1970s and travelling to Lake Tahoe in California. She can only afford to do this because she has worked for months as a forklift driver and pool hustler in Texas. (She is insistent, by the way, that all the stories are true. And I absolutely believe her.) At Lake Tahoe, she and her friend are accosted by a violent man who calls himself Animal and threatens her and her travelling companion with a knife. She builds up the tension until you almost feel sick. Then she punctures it. \u201cI tell Animal I need to pee.\u201d And so she escapes. The line between calamity and hilarity is always wafer-thin.</p> <p>A lot of the charm of the stories lies in the detail, especially the visual detail. In The Tidy House, she is trying to retrieve three trunkfuls of stolen items from a friend\u2019s girlfriend, including the Beatles cake decorations used on Carew\u2019s eighth birthday cake. The way she describes them, I feel as if I owned them myself. They have \u201cthe Beatles\u201d written on the drums and a miniature Ringo is playing them. It\u2019s obvious from the occasional illustrations, photos and journal extracts that she is someone who documents everything and keeps everything, otherwise the level of recall in this book would be impossible.</p> <p>In The Exciting Invitation, she meticulously describes a meeting with the actor Sam Neill, which happens because of a piece of art she is selling. She meets him but cannot be sure whether it really is Sam Neill and is too embarrassed and too much of a fan to ask. It\u2019s a brilliant scene, evoking the awkwardness when you\u2019ve passed a certain point in a social encounter and can no longer ask the question you should have asked at the beginning.</p> <p>The chapter that completely blew me away was The Invisible Story, which recounts a weekend in the company of a group of around 30 actors and creatives. It turns out to be some kind of unimaginably awful workshop where everyone must arrange themselves as a \u201cconstellation\u201d in order for the theme of a nebulous theatrical piece to emerge. Someone is appointed \u201cThe Boy\u201d, another person is \u201cNature\u201d, another is \u201cStory\u201d. Nothing useful emerges from any of this nonsense. And yet everyone except for Carew behaves as if they have experienced some kind of spiritual awakening. She captures the horror and the absurdity of it perfectly.</p> <p>Don\u2019t be put off by the slightly unwieldy title of this book. This is laugh-out-loud, delightful comedic writing. It captures a mood of escapism and nostalgia that I found incredibly reassuring and cheering.

      "bodyText": "This is an unexpected and unusual treat: a funny and clever collection of nonfiction stories that feels like a breath of fresh air. You could be forgiven for being unfamiliar with the name Keggie Carew if you missed her debut, Dadland: A Journey Into Uncharted Territory, about the extraordinary life story of her father as a complicated second world war hero. It was described by one literary prize judge as \u201cthe most unconventional biography I have ever read\u201d. Either because of or in spite of that, she won the Costa biography award in 2016 and Dadland became a bestseller. It\u2019s hard to follow a win like that. And Carew has wisely taken a completely different direction, one more familiar for American writers of the New Yorker variety: a riot of fabulously eccentric autobiographical essays. The tone is reminiscent of David Sedaris, without ever being as cynically arch or knowing as he is, with a hint of the gloriously awkward English comedy of Nina Stibbe or Sue Townsend. The facts of Carew\u2019s life story are rarely stated explicitly in this collection but emerge by themselves. Carew is in her early 60s and was a visual artist for most of her life, exhibiting her work in New Zealand, Ireland and London. Overall, the writing has the presence and energy of someone who has come to writing late in life and has been burning to tell these stored-up tales for a long time. The world she evokes exudes a vibe of bohemian middle class occasionally fallen on hard times. In the introduction, she explains that Quicksand Tales is about celebrating \u201chuman fuck-ups\u201d: \u201cPerfect storms, incompetence, paranoia, insecurity, clumsiness, privileged lives and overfed white middle-class anxieties, dark deeds or pure bad luck at being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d She is straightforward and unpretentious. She tells you what she is going to do and then more than delivers on that promise. What she also means is that she is one of those people that things happen to, no matter where she is (and she gets all over the place). Or, rather, she is good at remaking horrific incidents as entertaining anecdotes. In the story The Late Visitor, she recalls being a teenager in the late 1970s and travelling to Lake Tahoe in California. She can only afford to do this because she has worked for months as a forklift driver and pool hustler in Texas. (She is insistent, by the way, that all the stories are true. And I absolutely believe her.) At Lake Tahoe, she and her friend are accosted by a violent man who calls himself Animal and threatens her and her travelling companion with a knife. She builds up the tension until you almost feel sick. Then she punctures it. \u201cI tell Animal I need to pee.\u201d And so she escapes. The line between calamity and hilarity is always wafer-thin. A lot of the charm of the stories lies in the detail, especially the visual detail. In The Tidy House, she is trying to retrieve three trunkfuls of stolen items from a friend\u2019s girlfriend, including the Beatles cake decorations used on Carew\u2019s eighth birthday cake. The way she describes them, I feel as if I owned them myself. They have \u201cthe Beatles\u201d written on the drums and a miniature Ringo is playing them. It\u2019s obvious from the occasional illustrations, photos and journal extracts that she is someone who documents everything and keeps everything, otherwise the level of recall in this book would be impossible. In The Exciting Invitation, she meticulously describes a meeting with the actor Sam Neill, which happens because of a piece of art she is selling. She meets him but cannot be sure whether it really is Sam Neill and is too embarrassed and too much of a fan to ask. It\u2019s a brilliant scene, evoking the awkwardness when you\u2019ve passed a certain point in a social encounter and can no longer ask the question you should have asked at the beginning. The chapter that completely blew me away was The Invisible Story, which recounts a weekend in the company of a group of around 30 actors and creatives. It turns out to be some kind of unimaginably awful workshop where everyone must arrange themselves as a \u201cconstellation\u201d in order for the theme of a nebulous theatrical piece to emerge. Someone is appointed \u201cThe Boy\u201d, another person is \u201cNature\u201d, another is \u201cStory\u201d. Nothing useful emerges from any of this nonsense. And yet everyone except for Carew behaves as if they have experienced some kind of spiritual awakening. She captures the horror and the absurdity of it perfectly. Don\u2019t be put off by the slightly unwieldy title of this book. This is laugh-out-loud, delightful comedic writing. It captures a mood of escapism and nostalgia that I found incredibly reassuring and cheering.

      "body": "<p>The language of rugby has changed hugely in the past quarter of a century. What used to be a tackle is now a big hit and wingers have wheels or gas as opposed to pace. The term dummy scissors belongs in a museum, along with garryowens and argy-bargy. Naughty feet, game-changers, taking the learnings and going upstairs are rather more commonplace now than sidesteps, replacements, mud-baths or players drinking bottles of red to help them sleep better on the eve of major internationals.</p> <p>It partly explains why Stuart Barnes\u2019s new book, Sketches from Memory, is such a thought-provoking read. As a commentator and pundit, few wrestle with rugby\u2019s modern lexicon on a more regular basis than Barnesy, never one to employ a clich\u00e9 where a smart literary reference might do instead. The former Bath and England fly-half writes as he once played: dull orthodoxy remains his sworn enemy. His latest tome, typically, is not just any old rugby book. From Bob Dylan to Bath and Shakespeare to Sky, there is something for everyone in its honest, trenchant revealing and, occasionally, poetic pages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/21/rugby-union-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action-european-champions-cup\">Rugby union: talking points from the European Champions Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the Six Nations fast approaching, it could be worth today\u2019s players sticking a copy in their kitbags as they prepare for the all-consuming annual frenzy. The game has altered beyond recognition but Barnes is very good on how players \u2013 and particularly talented playmakers \u2013 think. The fear of failure, the sting of selectorial rejection, the joy of true mateship, the quest for personal fulfilment \u2026 all of it will strike a chord with anyone who views playing as something more \u2013 to borrow another glib phrase \u2013 than just trucking the ball up.</p> <p>Among the stories of great old Bath characters and the misty reminiscences of a sporting life well lived, there are two particularly salient messages. The first is the value of staying true to yourself. In Barnes\u2019s case this was famously illustrated when he was recalled by England to face Scotland at Twickenham in 1993 after a lengthy, partly self-imposed Test exile. Knowing his reputation was on the line he retreated rather nervously to his room at the Petersham Hotel on the Friday evening with a good book, only to be interrupted by a knock on the door. It was his friend and club-mate Jerry Guscott with an aforementioned nice bottle of red. \u201cThe hopes matured with the Bordeaux,\u201d remembers Barnes. \u201cWhat could have been a little sleep ended up a deep one.

      "bodyText": "The language of rugby has changed hugely in the past quarter of a century. What used to be a tackle is now a big hit and wingers have wheels or gas as opposed to pace. The term dummy scissors belongs in a museum, along with garryowens and argy-bargy. Naughty feet, game-changers, taking the learnings and going upstairs are rather more commonplace now than sidesteps, replacements, mud-baths or players drinking bottles of red to help them sleep better on the eve of major internationals. It partly explains why Stuart Barnes\u2019s new book, Sketches from Memory, is such a thought-provoking read. As a commentator and pundit, few wrestle with rugby\u2019s modern lexicon on a more regular basis than Barnesy, never one to employ a clich\u00e9 where a smart literary reference might do instead. The former Bath and England fly-half writes as he once played: dull orthodoxy remains his sworn enemy. His latest tome, typically, is not just any old rugby book. From Bob Dylan to Bath and Shakespeare to Sky, there is something for everyone in its honest, trenchant revealing and, occasionally, poetic pages. With the Six Nations fast approaching, it could be worth today\u2019s players sticking a copy in their kitbags as they prepare for the all-consuming annual frenzy. The game has altered beyond recognition but Barnes is very good on how players \u2013 and particularly talented playmakers \u2013 think. The fear of failure, the sting of selectorial rejection, the joy of true mateship, the quest for personal fulfilment \u2026 all of it will strike a chord with anyone who views playing as something more \u2013 to borrow another glib phrase \u2013 than just trucking the ball up. Among the stories of great old Bath characters and the misty reminiscences of a sporting life well lived, there are two particularly salient messages. The first is the value of staying true to yourself. In Barnes\u2019s case this was famously illustrated when he was recalled by England to face Scotland at Twickenham in 1993 after a lengthy, partly self-imposed Test exile. Knowing his reputation was on the line he retreated rather nervously to his room at the Petersham Hotel on the Friday evening with a good book, only to be interrupted by a knock on the door. It was his friend and club-mate Jerry Guscott with an aforementioned nice bottle of red. \u201cThe hopes matured with the Bordeaux,\u201d remembers Barnes. \u201cWhat could have been a little sleep ended up a deep one. I woke up as ready as I would ever be.\u201d That Saturday, by his own admission, altered his life forever. England supporters had been crying out for someone, or something, to refresh their jaded palates and Barnes duly provided it, turning a tricky pass from Dewi Morris just outside his 22 into a classic break and slick pass to Guscott that ultimately produced a try for Rory Underwood at the other end. \u201cOne jink off the right foot and a decent pass changed my life,\u201d writes Barnes. \u201cI woke up the next day, Prince Hamlet for the only time in an international career of bit-part attendant.\u201d Barely a year later Barnes was a Fleet Street columnist and soon after that he was being snapped up by Sky as their voice of rugby. If his flash of supposedly off-the-cuff skill was not quite as instinctive as it looked, honed as it had been during countless hours of practice on Bath\u2019s training field, it should serve as a timely reminder to today\u2019s players of the importance of seizing the moment \u2013 and being prepared to take a risk to do so \u2013 whenever it materialises. Long after people have forgotten the score of Scotland\u2019s Calcutta Cup win over England last season, for instance, they will celebrate the spectacular long pass by Finn Russell to Huw Jones that created the match-defining score. How swiftly we have all forgotten how close Ireland came to losing to France in the opening match of last year\u2019s Six Nations, until Johnny Sexton\u2019s remarkable match-winning drop goal pointed them in the direction of grand slam heaven. Twelve months on, Russell is a blossoming talent in Paris with Racing 92 while Sexton is the world player of the year. Had either of them settled for the mundane, the orthodox or the safe haven of their comfort zones, the magic would never have materialised. Of course top-level rugby is about winning but it is also about testing yourself, pushing the boundaries of what the majority think is possible and, in the process, enriching the lives of those lucky enough to be watching. Which leads us to the central thesis of Barnes\u2019s book, specifically his belief that facts are ultimately less crucial to personal fulfilment than feelings.

The 99 citizen members of the assembly were selected to be electorally representative and included people who were in favour of the change, some who were against and some who were undecided. The findings were published in a report at the end of 2017 and debated in parliament in 2018.

The Citizens\u2019 Assembly took the debate out of this realm of fearful self-interested calculation and into a forum where evidence and experience could take centre stage. Interest in the workings of the assembly meant that the media could report on this evidence, leading to a better-informed public and lessening the hysteria that circulates around debates based on dogma. It led to a growing realisation that the 8th amendment affected people in a wide variety of ways even during wanted pregnancies, and revealed the chilling effect it had on medical professionals\u2019 ability to provide necessary healthcare. The members of the assembly were faced with expert testimony on medical and legal matters but also testimony from their fellow citizens whose lives were deeply impacted by the 8th.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91eb70611fc5077fb4444d5f0b07744c064691b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91eb70611fc5077fb4444d5f0b07744c064691b0/0_176_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Citizens\u2019 Assembly meeting in 2016, including (from left) its secretary Sharon Finegan, chair Mary Laffoy and the then taoiseach, Enda Kenny.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It kept information flowing.\u2019 A Citizens\u2019 Assembly meeting in 2016, including (from left) its secretary Sharon Finegan, chair Mary Laffoy and the then taoiseach, Enda Kenny.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It meant that there was a long lead-in to the referendum during which debate was reasoned and detailed, before the inevitable agitation of the campaign itself.

The fact that it was made up entirely of my peers, and that through the assembly we the voters were exposed to the thoughts and opinions of experts from both sides, very much helped to establish a belief that this was a vote of the people and that we were being given all the information available in order to make up our minds. We weren\u2019t being preached at or lied to.",

It was, he said, \u201ca stepping stone\u201d on his team\u2019s journey to being \u201cback on top\u201d, but it has turned out to be a long and not consistently enjoyable slog for both player and country. He has not scored another Test century in 26 innings since, in which time there have been only two 50s. In 2018 he averaged a meagre 20.23 in nine Tests. But he remains a danger, so long as he can eradicate his habit of surrendering his wicket cheaply, and his form in one-day cricket, where he has three centuries and a score of 95 (plus two ducks) in his last seven innings, suggests it would be foolish to take him lightly.",

As inflation spiralled, new governors of the Angolan central bank have tried to rein in the local currency, the kwanza. Now there\u2019s a currency shortage and a disparity in value on the black market, which is driving crime and medicine shortages.</p> <p>Despite this, Luanda continues to expand south and east from the south Atlantic Ocean. The city is home to a population of about 7.8 million, which the UN estimates will double by 2030, giving Luanda megacity status.</p> <p>Luanda is expensive to visit and visas for journalists are hard to come by. Government bureaucracy is obstructive and relentless, and the chance to document ordinary life relatively rare. Angola was once looked to with hope: having shaken off the yoke of colonial Portuguese rule in 1975, could it use its clean slate to put socialist principles into practice? Decades on, inequality is stark: wealth has been hoarded by the elite and the rights of ordinary citizens are trampled on. Many are forcibly evicted to create new developments where they can\u2019t afford to live.</p> <p>In last year\u2019s election, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, the president for almost four decades, was replaced by Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, a former defence minister. There appears to be some appetite for reform in parts of the new government: most notably, several lucrative contracts given to Isabel dos Santos, the former president\u2019s daughter and Africa\u2019s richest woman, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/15/angolan-president-sacks-predecessors-daughter-as-state-oil-chief\">annulled</a> by the new president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"8141d52f4079da2d135c23bfba0ff3ccd3f83976\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8141d52f4079da2d135c23bfba0ff3ccd3f83976/0_0_5976_3992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The rooftop pool of the Epic Sana hotel in Luanda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The rooftop pool of the Epic Sana hotel, with the headquarters of the De Beers diamond company in the background</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Epic Sana hotel: the lap of luxury</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"32e9ac8d7d9d5103fac2fa571a7b707f9ec0f185\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32e9ac8d7d9d5103fac2fa571a7b707f9ec0f185/78_56_5883_3530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Airline staff arrive at the Epic Sana hotel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Airline staff arrive at the Epic Sana hotel</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"fb99c7f0095c1ae35f1bc59a8ea05367606f4f30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb99c7f0095c1ae35f1bc59a8ea05367606f4f30/0_721_4816_2890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sushi at the Epic Sana hotel restaurant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sushi at the hotel restaurant</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"524965c4f89b47c16f7f24708b05bee27df457ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/524965c4f89b47c16f7f24708b05bee27df457ec/0_0_5976_3984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Staff prepare a meal for a guest at the Epic Sana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff prepare a meal for a guest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Scenes from the Epic Sana, one of Luanda\u2019s top hotels</p></li> </ul> <p>The modestly titled Epic Sana is a Luanda landmark, one of the city\u2019s top luxury hotels located in the heart of the downtown district.

      "bodyText": "The route from London to Luanda, the capital of Angola, used to be one of British Airways\u2019 most profitable, ferrying people involved in the country\u2019s lucrative oil and diamond trades during a remarkable expansion of the city from 2002, after nearly three decades of civil war. In recent years it has competed with Hong Kong and Tokyo for the title of world\u2019s most expensive city for expatriates. Cranes dominated the downtown skyline and homes in the surrounding areas were demolished to make way for Chinese-backed housing projects. Wealthy firms reportedly paid millions to fly in pop stars such as Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj for private concerts. Examples of stark inequality abound in Luanda In June British Airways closed the route, the latest sign of a downturn that has rocked the city since the price of oil began to crash in 2014. As inflation spiralled, new governors of the Angolan central bank have tried to rein in the local currency, the kwanza. Now there\u2019s a currency shortage and a disparity in value on the black market, which is driving crime and medicine shortages. Despite this, Luanda continues to expand south and east from the south Atlantic Ocean. The city is home to a population of about 7.8 million, which the UN estimates will double by 2030, giving Luanda megacity status. Luanda is expensive to visit and visas for journalists are hard to come by. Government bureaucracy is obstructive and relentless, and the chance to document ordinary life relatively rare. Angola was once looked to with hope: having shaken off the yoke of colonial Portuguese rule in 1975, could it use its clean slate to put socialist principles into practice? Decades on, inequality is stark: wealth has been hoarded by the elite and the rights of ordinary citizens are trampled on. Many are forcibly evicted to create new developments where they can\u2019t afford to live. In last year\u2019s election, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, the president for almost four decades, was replaced by Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, a former defence minister. There appears to be some appetite for reform in parts of the new government: most notably, several lucrative contracts given to Isabel dos Santos, the former president\u2019s daughter and Africa\u2019s richest woman, were annulled by the new president. The Epic Sana hotel: the lap of luxury Scenes from the Epic Sana, one of Luanda\u2019s top hotels The modestly titled Epic Sana is a Luanda landmark, one of the city\u2019s top luxury hotels located in the heart of the downtown district. During the oil boom it was teeming with business people; oil companies used to block-book dozens of rooms for their employees. The hotel boasts several restaurants with chefs from Portugal; sushi appears to be the current fad. Thanks to the economic crisis, the hotel is quieter these days. Some airlines and diamond companies put their staff up there, but the high-rollers have gone. Zango: farmland seized for pricey apartments A former farming community now lives in makeshift homes after their land was seized for a housing development These shanty homes in Zango, in the south of the city, belong to former farmers whose land was taken in 2006 for the housing development in the background. They were given a week\u2019s notice. They have a constitutional right to compensation and rehousing, and were advised to stay close to the new development or risk being forgotten. But communication from officials and developers is poor, and the former residents have no certainty about their fate. Legal battles over rehousing can sometimes take more than a decade. SOS Habitat, a group supported by Christian Aid, works with those who have lost their homes and livelihoods. The Mangais golf course: a surreal green oasis The exclusive Mangais golf resort, where Luanda\u2019s elite while away their weekends The Mangais golf resort is also in the city\u2019s south, next to the Cuanza river, and is where rich locals and foreign businessmen spend their weekends. It is a surreal place \u2013 lush and green. During my visit, a group of Korean businessmen were playing a round, caddied by young men from the area. There was also a group of wealthy locals playing; the women in the group seemed to have dressed up for the occasion. The lagoon: displaced families face health crisis The Areia Branca shanty village, where fishermen have been forcibly moved and their houses bulldozed to make way for a development Nearly all of the men I met living at the Aiera Branca shanty village, to the south of the city, were fisherman. The man in the main photo is looking for worms among the plastic trash to use as bait. The men fish the black waters of the lagoon, with their children playing next to them. Children living by the lagoon The child in the final photograph has pneumonia. There is a severe shortage of basic medicine that, years ago, would have been available at clinics. Now they can only be found on the black market and most people can\u2019t afford them. Malaria has also become a huge problem, with infection rates rising alarmingly. Under the country\u2019s constitution, people have the right to running water and electricity. Clearly there\u2019s a disparity between the official promise and the reality, and that gap is where many ordinary Luandans are forced to live. Kilamba: a ghost estate comes to life Police and students at the Kilamba housing development A new housing development in Kilamba, to the south of the city, is one of many neighbourhoods constructed by Chinese developers. Existing homes were razed, with former residents offered spaces in the new buildings. In one development we visited, the rent was four times the average monthly wage. For a while developments like these lay empty, dubbed ghost towns. Now, they are beginning to be occupied by skilled professionals working for the government. By local standards, those people are wealthy. Saturday night: how rich and poor unwind Dancing to kizomba music at the Povoado bar in Bita The Povoado bar is in the old neighbourhood of Bita, not far from Kilamba. It is the type of place most people earning normal wages can head to on a Friday or Saturday night to unwind without breaking the bank. Kizomba music blares from its speakers \u2013 it is the most popular modern Angolan dance music. It became a craze in French-speaking countries and parts of South America. The upmarket Docks nightclub has been hit by the downturn In the city centre there are upmarket nightclubs such as Docks, where the wealthy go. During the boom years, business was good here. But they are feeling the financial squeeze now too. Weapons of war: leftover AK-47s drive crime Police on a Friday night patrol Luanda has a crime problem. It is difficult to get any official statistics, but everyone talks about frequent armed robberies. There are a lot of weapons around, mostly AK-47s left over from the civil war. At the time, they were handed out to people to defend themselves. A police officer stops a car to look for weapons or drugs I went out with a police patrol on a Friday night. They would stop cars, searching for weapons or drugs, or to see if the driver had been drinking. I noticed the police always travelled in groups at night. One man they stopped was a bit affronted and asked why he had been stopped; generally though, people seemed to be polite and wary of the police, but not intimidated by them. The great leveller: beloved beach unites the city Scenes from Ilha do Cabo, the main beach, which draws Luandans of all stripes Ilha do Cabo is the real heart of the city, where everyone goes to relax: rich, poor, homeless. It is mostly a weekend spot, but during the week you might find students having picnics or celebrating a birthday.

Little detail has been made public as to the specific reasons for Stajcic\u2019s dismissal, and on Monday all Gallop would reveal was that the survey results were not the only factor in play, and that \u201cthese matters are cumulative\u201d. At the meeting on Monday, the players were reminded of FFA\u2019s desire for confidentiality on the matter. The ABC on Tuesday reported the survey, undertaken by the women\u2019s advocacy group, Our Watch, highlighted \u201ca culturally unsustainable environment\u201d. The full results of the survey would be delivered to FFA later this week. The survey was conducted alongside a second review \u2013 a wellbeing audit \u2013 that was commissioned by FFA in partnership with the PFA to ensure optimal conditions heading into the World Cup. Instead, the Matildas, tipped as a genuine chance to enjoy a deep run at the tournament in France, are searching for a new coach just five months out from their opening kick-off, against Italy on 9 June.",

We are at a cliff edge. There are more than 300,000 additional pupils in the system since 2015, the education services grant for academies has been scrapped to the tune of \u00a3600m, and almost a third of local authority secondary schools <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/dec/06/third-of-maintained-english-secondary-schools-in-the-red\" title=\"\">are in deficit</a>. Not to mention the increase in pensions and national insurance contributions.</p> <p>\u201cThat said, the solution to the problem seems obvious \u2013 fairer funding for schools so that heads won\u2019t be forced to make such decisions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If my dentist wasn\u2019t being paid,  I\u2019d go elsewhere</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Morrish</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIronically, of course, the role of the volunteer has been the bedrock of the school system for generations, whether it\u2019s going on school trips, listening to children read, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/22/schools-raise-1-million-a-year-fundraiser-budget\" title=\"\">fundraising</a>, or sitting on a governing body. You want your parents to volunteer because it\u2019s also a way for you to engage with them and demonstrate that you value them.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue here is that for the first time we are seeing this creeping into key strategic posts. This is a worrying trend that needs to stop as it undermines the work of those highly skilled and trained professionals that have been doing the job for years.</p> <p>\u201cThere are issues then around confidentiality and safeguarding. It\u2019s about public confidence as well \u2013 I could probably live with going to my dental surgery knowing some of the backroom posts are being covered by volunteers, but if my dentist or assistant was not being paid, I\u2019d probably go elsewhere. Running schools is no different.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"300fa722d557d09b4e1e4067fcf162c8cb589a38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/300fa722d557d09b4e1e4067fcf162c8cb589a38/114_528_3044_3043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Jagger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chris Jagger</strong></h2> <p><strong> parent volunteer at a state primary school in Cambridge</strong></p> <p>\u201cYes, I think schools absolutely need to rely on volunteers to do certain kinds of work. If the teacher spent her time listening to children reading, it would take her an entire day to hear each child read for just 10 minutes a week. Yet that\u2019s nowhere near enough to improve children\u2019s reading. So I think it\u2019s good for parents to be involved. I have found it very rewarding, helping children who were struggling and seeing them improve.</p> <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t bother me if my school advertised for a full-time volunteer to fill a key role. I think if a willing volunteer would do a good job and it would save the school money, why not? But at the same time, it\u2019s not ideal. Volunteers can usually only commit to a small numbers of hours a week and I\u2019d be concerned an unpaid worker wouldn\u2019t be able to spend as much time doing the role as is needed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f8ac9b3a502cc1286e9bb076ce08bf85825705f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f8ac9b3a502cc1286e9bb076ce08bf85825705f/0_246_1462_1461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raj Unsworth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Raj Unsworth</strong></h2> <p><strong> chair of trustees, Pride Multiple Academy Trust, Barnsley </strong></p> <p>\u201cThe simple answer is no. We are all aware funding is an issue, especially in small schools. But there are other options. Top of my list would be to look at staffing structure and collaboration with other schools. The board should ensure money is not wasted on top-heavy leadership. As for collaboration, this could mean sharing a business manager or even a headteacher.</p> <p>\u201cThe pool of people you are going to attract to volunteer will be limited. These people will still need to be managed and trained in statutory responsibilities, such as safeguarding and confidentiality. Are you going to accept a lower level of performance from an administrator who is not paid compared to another in the school who is?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"502b1df580fc73bec234859a2a591ae58b0bf43a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/502b1df580fc73bec234859a2a591ae58b0bf43a/139_363_1006_1006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lorna Jackson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Lorna Jackson</strong></h2> <p><strong> headteacher, Maryland primary school, east London</strong></p> <p>\u201cNo. At Maryland, we use volunteers \u2013 parents and other family members \u2013 to enhance the experiences of our children, but not as free labour.

      "bodyText": "News that an academy trust founded by the Conservative peer Lord James O\u2019Shaughnessy is advertising for unpaid volunteers to fill key roles in its two primary schools was met with disbelief and dismay by teachers earlier this month. The Floreat Education Academies Trust is looking for full-time and part-time volunteers to fill the jobs of finance assistant, office administrator and personal assistant to the chief executive, Janet Hilary, who was paid \u00a3128,768 in 2018. Andrew Morrish chief executive, Victoria Academies Trust, West Midlands \u201cNo, schools shouldn\u2019t rely on volunteers \u2013 although with funding levels at an all-time low, I can understand why school leaders are having to make such difficult decisions. We are at a cliff edge. There are more than 300,000 additional pupils in the system since 2015, the education services grant for academies has been scrapped to the tune of \u00a3600m, and almost a third of local authority secondary schools are in deficit. Not to mention the increase in pensions and national insurance contributions. \u201cThat said, the solution to the problem seems obvious \u2013 fairer funding for schools so that heads won\u2019t be forced to make such decisions. \u201cIronically, of course, the role of the volunteer has been the bedrock of the school system for generations, whether it\u2019s going on school trips, listening to children read, fundraising, or sitting on a governing body. You want your parents to volunteer because it\u2019s also a way for you to engage with them and demonstrate that you value them. \u201cThe issue here is that for the first time we are seeing this creeping into key strategic posts. This is a worrying trend that needs to stop as it undermines the work of those highly skilled and trained professionals that have been doing the job for years. \u201cThere are issues then around confidentiality and safeguarding. It\u2019s about public confidence as well \u2013 I could probably live with going to my dental surgery knowing some of the backroom posts are being covered by volunteers, but if my dentist or assistant was not being paid, I\u2019d probably go elsewhere. Running schools is no different.\u201d Chris Jagger parent volunteer at a state primary school in Cambridge \u201cYes, I think schools absolutely need to rely on volunteers to do certain kinds of work. If the teacher spent her time listening to children reading, it would take her an entire day to hear each child read for just 10 minutes a week. Yet that\u2019s nowhere near enough to improve children\u2019s reading. So I think it\u2019s good for parents to be involved. I have found it very rewarding, helping children who were struggling and seeing them improve. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t bother me if my school advertised for a full-time volunteer to fill a key role. I think if a willing volunteer would do a good job and it would save the school money, why not? But at the same time, it\u2019s not ideal. Volunteers can usually only commit to a small numbers of hours a week and I\u2019d be concerned an unpaid worker wouldn\u2019t be able to spend as much time doing the role as is needed.\u201d Raj Unsworth chair of trustees, Pride Multiple Academy Trust, Barnsley \u201cThe simple answer is no. We are all aware funding is an issue, especially in small schools. But there are other options. Top of my list would be to look at staffing structure and collaboration with other schools. The board should ensure money is not wasted on top-heavy leadership. As for collaboration, this could mean sharing a business manager or even a headteacher. \u201cThe pool of people you are going to attract to volunteer will be limited. These people will still need to be managed and trained in statutory responsibilities, such as safeguarding and confidentiality. Are you going to accept a lower level of performance from an administrator who is not paid compared to another in the school who is?\u201d Lorna Jackson headteacher, Maryland primary school, east London \u201cNo. At Maryland, we use volunteers \u2013 parents and other family members \u2013 to enhance the experiences of our children, but not as free labour. To put volunteers in places to fill employment gaps, especially where there is a high level of skill needed, is misguided. \u201cOur volunteers are trained, supervised and treated as part of the school\u2019s welfare team. We carefully select the activities we need them to support us with. For example, not just listening to children read but also reading to children, as this is very important for children whose first language is not English. \u201cThe \u2018elephant in the room\u2019 is that funding for schools is diabolical and has been cut year on year. Clearly, anyone turning to unpaid volunteers to fill jobs that qualified people should be doing is desperate. \u201cWe need to address the funding, not fill the gaps.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s plan B is to try to get her plan A through the Commons with some tweaks on the Irish backstop. But are there other options that could command a Commons majority \u2013 and who would support them? Here\u2019s a quick guide to what MPs could vote for, based on dividing the Commons into various groupings, explained below. The numbers of those groups are roughly estimated using public records and voting histories, although these factions could easily splinter further in any of these scenarios. The groupings explained Tories for a second referendum \u2013 9 These are the Conservative MPs like Dominic Grieve, Sarah Wollaston, Anna Soubry, Phillip Lee, Sam Gyimah, Guto Bebb, Justine Greening and Jo Johnson who will back any moves for a second referendum and stopping no deal. Conservatives who will block no deal \u2013 12 These MPs are not in favour of a second referendum and mostly voted for May\u2019s deal, but will put as many roadblocks as they can in the way of a no-deal Brexit. They include former minister Nick Boles, Nicky Morgan and Sir Oliver Letwin. Brexiters who oppose May\u2019s deal \u2013 109 These are the Tory MPs who have voted against the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal. Many are hard Brexiters who would be comfortable with no deal, but others are ex-remainers uncomfortable with the backstop. Should May manage to deliver a firm end date to the backstop, she could win back most of their votes. A minority would also like to see the backstop removed entirely and a reduction of the \u00a339bn payment to the EU. Conservative loyalists and payroll \u2013 186 This group include ministers, whips and other frontbenchers, as well as Tory loyalists who are happy to vote for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal as it currently stands. Democratic Unionist party MPs \u2013 10 The Northern Irish party voted against the government\u2019s Brexit deal because of the backstop arrangement, and could be won over if there are some changes to it. Labour for a second referendum \u2013 71 Support for a second referendum is likely to be more widespread than this but not all Labour MPs who hold frontbench position have publicly declared support. These 71 MPs are those who have publicly declared their support and would vote for a referendum even if they were whipped to oppose. Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum \u2013 30 Labour MPs who do not want the party to back a second vote have been privately keeping track of the number who would actively oppose it, even if it was whipped by the Labour frontbench. Sources claim about 30 would be actively prepared to rebel. Labour loyalists and independents \u2013 150 These include Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s frontbench and the majority of Labour MPs who are likely to follow the Labour whip. Labour Brexiters and MPs who back May\u2019s deal \u2013 3 Only three Labour MPs have backed May\u2019s deal as it currently stands though this number would be likely to grow if it became a softer Brexit or if no deal became a more likely possibility. Others could merge into this group depending on the question, including Labour hard Brexiter Kate Hoey. The SNP, Lib Dems and other parties \u2013 51 These MPs, who also include Plaid Cymru and the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas, are all supporters of a second referendum. Independents \u2013 8 These MPs are not easy to place. Ex-Labour MPs Ivan Lewis and Jared O\u2019Mara have tended to vote with their former party. Independent MP Sylvia Hermon, former Labour MP Frank Field and the former Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd have tended to vote with the government on Brexit issues.

But gobsmacked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/21/we-will-not-renegotiate-brexit-backstop-eu27-members-say\">EU ministers made plain</a> that the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated \u2013 although the political declaration on future relations could be tweaked \u2013 and that no progress would be made towards an orderly Brexit until the deal had majority support in the UK parliament.</p> <p>Paying at least lip service to that notion, May and others met senior opposition figures to discuss a Brexit compromise, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/no-10-rules-out-customs-union-before-cross-party-talks-begin\">ruled out softening the government\u2019s red lines</a> on the customs union and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/theresa-may-fails-to-reach-out-to-jeremy-corbyn-to-strike-brexit-compromise\">would not to talk to Corbyn</a>, who said he didn\u2019t want to anyway until she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/corbyn-no-talks-with-may-until-no-deal-brexit-is-off-table\">took a no-deal Brexit off the table</a>, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/corbyn-defends-refusal-to-talk-to-may-without-no-deal-pledge\">yah boo sucks</a>.</p> <p>As the prime minister consulted her cabinet before presenting plan B to parliament this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/18/mordaunt-urges-may-to-prepare-for-no-deal-as-pm-consults-cabinet\">hardliners urged her to prepare for no deal</a>, warning that she must <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/brexiters-optimistic-that-may-will-stand-firm-on-customs-union\">stand firm on the customs union</a> or risk a Tory party split.

If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And catch our monthly Brexit Means\u2026 podcast here. Producing the Guardian\u2019s independent, in-depth journalism takes time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian supporter. Thank you. Top stories Well, that was quite a week. As widely expected, the withdrawal agreement that Theresa May negotiated with the EU27 was crushed in the House of Commons, suffering \u2013 not quite so widely expected \u2013 the heaviest defeat in UK parliamentary history. The prime minister then survived a no-confidence motion tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader. But gobsmacked EU ministers made plain that the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated \u2013 although the political declaration on future relations could be tweaked \u2013 and that no progress would be made towards an orderly Brexit until the deal had majority support in the UK parliament. Paying at least lip service to that notion, May and others met senior opposition figures to discuss a Brexit compromise, but ruled out softening the government\u2019s red lines on the customs union and would not to talk to Corbyn, who said he didn\u2019t want to anyway until she took a no-deal Brexit off the table, so yah boo sucks. As the prime minister consulted her cabinet before presenting plan B to parliament this week, hardliners urged her to prepare for no deal, warning that she must stand firm on the customs union or risk a Tory party split. She gave in. All this left May with nowhere to go and \u201cno actual solutions\u201d in her plan B update to the Commons. And indeed, plan B turned out to be a repeat of plan A: Brussels would have to change the terms of the backstop, which it has repeatedly refused to do. Apart from waiving the \u00a365 fee for EU citizens registering for settled status and promising to consult more widely, the prime minister rejected both a second referendum and an extension to article 50, entrenching her existing positions. Parliamentary guerrilla warfare continued, meanwhile, with MPs including Yvette Cooper, Sarah Wollaston and Nick Boles drawing up a raft of amendments aimed at stopping a no-deal Brexit, as well as paving the way for \u201cindicative votes\u201d. No 10 was unimpressed. The position of Labour \u2013 whose Commons votes will be crucial if any solution is to emerge with parliamentary backing \u2013 remained complicated. Despite calls for Labour to keep the second referendum option open, Corbyn could face up to a dozen frontbench resignations if he backs a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. EU member states, fearing the worst, began pushing through their no-deal contingency measures as a matter of urgency. What next MPs will have a full day to debate May\u2019s \u201cneutral\u201d plan B motion on 29 January and will then vote on several amendments to it \u2013 probably including on holding a second referendum and on ruling out no-deal. May\u2019s strategy remains to use the no-deal threat to persuade MPs to back her plan. In that sense, amendments aiming to extend article 50 to avoid no-deal might help her: if she can confront the Commons with a choice between her deal, ie Brexit, and a long extension to article 50, ie possibly no Brexit, Tory rebels could think twice. In theory, the government is therefore looking for further talks with the EU, followed by another \u201cmeaningful\u201d vote on a \u2013 hopefully, it must presume, suitably amended \u2013 version of the PM\u2019s Brexit plan in February.

      "bodyText": "Pat Haskins steers his tanker towards the river Blackwater, a murky waterway that in theory will soon mark the frontier between the United Kingdom and the European Union. A narrow sliver separating rolling hills in County Monaghan in the Irish Republic from rolling hills in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, it is not much to look at. Blink and you miss the drive across the short two-lane bridge. On Haskins\u2019s left, two donkeys graze in a field. On his right, trucks roll south. His 46-tonne rig is headed north. The only indication he has entered the UK is a road sign giving the speed limit in miles rather than kilometres. \u201cI remember what it was like before the border went,\u201d says Haskins, 61. \u201cYou had to go to Dundalk to get clearance from the south to go north. Then you had to go to Newry to get clearance to go into the north. It was a bloody nightmare.\u201d The tanker carries 27,500 litres of milk from southern farms for Strathroy dairy in Omagh, 20 miles inside Northern Ireland, which will process and bottle the milk before sending it back to the Republic \u2013 a frictionless criss-crossing to use Brexit terminology. That may all change on 29 March when the UK is due to leave the EU. Or it may not change at all. Or change just a bit. It depends on whether the UK actually leaves, whether there is a deal and what sort of deal plus technical questions about customs, taxes and currencies, all currently unanswerable. For Strathroy, one of the biggest dairies on the island of Ireland with 220 employees and an \u00a380m annual turnover, the uncertainty could add up to a sense of looming disaster. It is not just about economics. A bomb killed 29 people and wounded more than 200 in Omagh in 1998, one of the last and worst atrocities of the Troubles. Brexit has destabilised the Good Friday agreement which has since kept the peace. Ruairi Cunningham, a managing director of Strathroy, thinks Brexit is a colossal mistake. He echoes his tanker driver\u2019s bad dream analogy, saying: \u201cForward planning is a nightmare. It stops you doing your day to day work and growing the business.\u201d The family-owned company has a fleet of trucks that crosses the border dozens of times a day, taking milk from 250 Irish and Northern Irish farms that ends up in about 2,400 retailers on both sides of the border. Last week\u2019s Brexit headlines included warnings that, in the event of no-deal, vehicles would need insurance \u201cgreen cards\u201d to cross the border, there would be mandatory EU and World Trade Organization (WTO) border checks and that Ireland could, according to the head of the Irish Exporters Association, be \u201cscrewed\u201d. At the Blackwater border crossing. it is easy to envisage a dark surge thundering towards the island of Ireland\u2019s agri-food sector. Many of those who produce and transport cheese and beef may indeed be swept away. But whatever happens in the Brexit lottery, Cunningham is quietly confident that his dairy will adapt. \u201cWe may take a financial hit in the short to medium term but we\u2019re fairly content that it\u2019s manageable,\u201d he says. While Westminster has lurched from drama to drama, leaving Brexit in limbo, Cunningham has been busy devising a survival strategy, the result of swotting up on trade rule arcana, lobbying officials, soothing skittish suppliers and customers and scouting locations for a potential new dairy in the Republic. The strategy may not be needed. If Westminster ends up passing a version of Theresa May\u2019s deal or delaying or cancelling the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, Strathroy\u2019s trucks will continue trundling over the river unimpeded. A hard border or crashing out without a deal, however, could trigger checkpoints and stiff tariffs. But probably not overnight, giving time for plan A: apply for inward processing relief from customs duty and import VAT to avoid making Strathroy\u2019s milk uncompetitive in the Republic. The scheme would require a bilateral accord between Britain and Ireland, so Cunningham has been lobbying officials in Dublin and Belfast. \u201cIt\u2019s looking positive but we need to make sure all our ducks are lined up in a row,\u201d he says. If that falls through the milk will be subject to a 30% WTO dairy tariff. \u201cNo way we could absorb that.

As the economy becomes worse, people from all walks of the society can become opponents.\u201d Earlier this month, China\u2019s public security minister, Zhao Kezhi, said the police must focus on stamping out any mass political movements, or \u201ccolour revolutions\u201d. China\u2019s security forces must \u201cstress the prevention and resistance of colour revolutions and firmly fight to protect China\u2019s political security,\u201d Zhao said. Xi added that economic security would also be a priority, warning his party to be on guard against \u201cblack swans\u201d \u2013 unpredictable events that can derail an economy \u2013 as well as \u201cgrey rhinoceroses\u201d, known risks that go ignored until too late. \u201cIn the face of a turbulent international situation, a complex and sensitive environment, and the arduous task of reform ... We must be highly vigilant against \u2018black swan\u2019 and \u2018grey rhinoceros\u2019 incidents,\u201d he said. Xi said the government would dissolve zombie companies, those with too much debt, give support to businesses to stabilise jobs, and shore up a weakening property market, the largest store of wealth for Chinese households. The workshop for provincial and ministerial leaders is held in Beijing usually at the beginning of each year, and scheduled to avoid local legislative meetings. But this year, some provinces were ordered to change their schedules to accommodate the meeting. Additional reporting by Wang Xueying",

      "bodyText": "Indigenous leader Warren Mundine will be parachuted in to contest the marginal seat of Gilmore under a Scott Morrison-endorsed plan being considered by the New South Wales Liberal party executive. On Tuesday the state executive voted to block the preselection of real-estate agent Grant Schultz, who had been picked by local members to contest the seat held by the retiring MP Ann Sudmalis. Schultz reacted angrily to the decision and vowed to run in the seat as an independent. \u201cI can no longer be a member of a party that does not support democracy, or act with integrity,\u201d he said in a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. The move would complete a lifelong political journey by Mundine from the Labor party, of which he was national president in 2006, to the conservative side of politics, via a stint as the chairman of Tony Abbott\u2019s Indigenous Advisory Council. Mundine has only just applied for Liberal party membership. Morrison said that Mundine is a \u201ctop bloke\u201d who has \u201cgot a lot to offer \u2013 and he\u2019s already been offering quite a bit\u201d. \u201cWhen I have more to say about our candidate in Gilmore, I\u2019ll say it then,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Cooktown. A series of executive votes will be held to overcome procedural hurdles, including waiver of the six-month waiting period before a new member can be selected as a candidate. NSW Liberal president Philip Ruddock told Guardian Australia the party had \u201celected not to proceed with [Schultz\u2019s] endorsement\u201d because he had \u201cnominated against a sitting member who later withdrew\u201d. \u201cThe party should be able to consider the best candidate to represent voters, their aspirations and concerns in each community,\u201d he said. When asked about female representation Morrison paid tribute to Sudmalis and said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d a woman would replace Kelly O\u2019Dwyer in the seat of Higgins, but declined to endorse a female candidate for the seat of Gilmore. Mundine has refused to confirm or deny his intention to run for the Liberals, but told Channel Nine news that an announcement would be made \u201cone way or the other within the next 24 hours\u201d. Gilmore is one of the most marginal seats in the country, won by Sudmalis at the 2016 election by just 1,503 votes, or 0.73%. Mundine is reportedly favoured by Morrison as the best chance to hold the seat, where he has family and ancestral ties despite living in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. Mundine attempted to enter federal parliament in 2001, when he was selected third on Labor\u2019s NSW Senate ticket, and 2004, when he contested preselection for the seat of Fowler, but was unsuccessful on both occasions. He left Labor in 2012 after almost 20 years, saying it was \u201cno longer the party I joined\u201d. At a press conference in Rockhampton, Bill Shorten noted that Mundine was \u201cunsuccessful in the Labor party\u201d but added \u201cit\u2019s a free country, you can run for whatever party will have you\u201d. Shorten noted that in Gilmore the Liberal party had \u201creplaced a woman with a man\u201d, and highlighted Mundine\u2019s support for nuclear power by describing him as \u201ca man who wants to put nuclear reactors into Australia, including Jervis Bay\u201d. \u201cI just don\u2019t think [the Liberals] get how everyday Australians think.\u201d The deputy Liberal leader, Josh Frydenberg, said the selection of candidates is a matter for the NSW division and local branches. \u201cWe attract people from all walks of life \u2013 people who want to make Australia better, people who believe in the \u2026 values of supporting the individual and their enterprise,\u201d he told reporters in Melbourne.",

      "bodyText": "Experts have revealed an undeclared site that reportedly serves as the headquarters of one of North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile programmes, weeks before the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump are expected to meet to discuss denuclearisation. The Sino-ri site, one of 20 North Korea is suspected of failing to declare, houses medium-range Nodong missiles that could be used in nuclear or conventional attacks on South Korea, Japan and the US territory of Guam, according to the report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington. \u201cThe Sino-ri missile operating base and the Nodong missiles deployed at this location fit into North Korea\u2019s presumed nuclear military strategy by providing an operational-level nuclear or conventional first-strike capability,\u201d said the report, co-written by analyst Victor Cha. The discovery has called into question North Korea\u2019s intentions as officials met in Sweden this week to discuss the arrangements for Kim\u2019s second meeting with Trump, which is expected to take place near the end of February, possibly in Vietnam. The leaders have made little progress since Kim signed a vaguely worded statement committing him to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in exchange for security guarantees from Washington during their first summit, in Singapore last June. The CSIS report said the base had never been declared by the North and as a result \u201cdoes not appear to be the subject of denuclearisation negotiations\u201d. Noting that missile bases would presumably have to be part of any agreement committing North Korea to \u201ccomplete, verifiable, and irreversible\u201d denuclearisation, Cha warned: \u201cThe North Koreans are not going to negotiate over things they don\u2019t disclose. It looks like they\u2019re playing a game. They\u2019re still going to have all this operational capability\u201d even if they destroy their disclosed nuclear facilities. Located 132 miles (212km) north of the demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas, the Sino-ri complex is a seven-square-mile (18sq km) base that houses a regiment-sized unit equipped with Nodong-1 medium-range missiles, the report said. It might have also played a part in developing the Pukkuksong-2 ballistic missile that was first tested in February 2017, shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Satellite images of the base from 27 December last year show an entrance to an underground bunker, reinforced shelters and a headquarters, the report said. Kim Joon-rak, a spokesman for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South Korean and US militaries had been monitoring Sino-ri and other undeclared missile bases. Sweden\u2019s foreign ministry described talks on the forthcoming summit between representatives from North and South Korea and the US as \u201cconstructive\u201d, adding that they had covered \u201cdevelopments on the Korean peninsula, including confidence building, economic development and long-term engagement\u201d.

After Theresa May told MPs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/21/may-claims-second-referendum-on-brexit-would-threaten-uks-social-cohesion\">Britain\u2019s social fabric could be at risk</a> if people are asked to vote on the matter again, Labour tabled an amendment to her Brexit deal motion calling on the government to hold a vote on two options. The first would be Labour\u2019s own alternative Brexit plan and the second would be whether to legislate \u201cto hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition\u201d that is supported by a majority in the Commons. It is the first time the party has asked MPs to formally consider a second poll but did not satisfy a cross-party group of MPs who fear Corbyn\u2019s Brexit plan has \u201clittle regard for what could actually be delivered\u201d. May\u2019s Brexit motion faces amendments from across the Commons and our correspondent Jessica Elgot has handily summarised them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/21/from-backstop-tweaks-to-no-no-deal-possible-amendments-to-mays-next-brexit-motion\">here</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the CBI stepped up its anti-Brexit campaign with a report today on the impact of a no-deal exit on Britain\u2019s regions.

Inspectors discovered a litany of other problems at the facility and a report published today says cells were \u201cfilthy and decrepit\u201d, toilets did not flush properly, and an amputee was in a cell with no adaptations and a wheelchair that he could not propel himself. Pest control work had failed to eradicate the infestation, the report said, and described a notice on a door which read: \u201cPlease ensure doors remain shut to prevent rats entering the wing!!!\u201d.

He also said a second woman was carrying a gene-edited baby and state media reports on Monday appear to confirm his claim.

Glaciers on the island are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic ocean, where it melts. But scientists have found that the largest ice loss in the decade from 2003 occurred in the south-west region, which is largely glacier-free. They believe this means that surface ice is melting as global temperatures rise, causing gushing rivers of meltwater to flow into the ocean and push up sea levels. Michael Bevis, lead author of the paper and a professor of geodynamics at Ohio State University, said: \u201cThe only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming \u2013 it\u2019s too late for there to be no effect.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018You\u2019re a feminist?\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Victoria Derbyshire has created a stir in New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/22/jacinda-ardern-asked-in-bbc-interview-if-she-plans-to-propose-to-her-partner\">by asking the country\u2019s progressive prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, if she is a feminist</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: May warns another poll could damage \u2018social cohesion\u2019 Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the stories you need to know about this morning. Jeremy Corbyn has opened the door for MPs to vote for a second referendum as the fight over the shape of Brexit gathered pace at Westminster. After Theresa May told MPs that Britain\u2019s social fabric could be at risk if people are asked to vote on the matter again, Labour tabled an amendment to her Brexit deal motion calling on the government to hold a vote on two options. The first would be Labour\u2019s own alternative Brexit plan and the second would be whether to legislate \u201cto hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition\u201d that is supported by a majority in the Commons. It is the first time the party has asked MPs to formally consider a second poll but did not satisfy a cross-party group of MPs who fear Corbyn\u2019s Brexit plan has \u201clittle regard for what could actually be delivered\u201d. May\u2019s Brexit motion faces amendments from across the Commons and our correspondent Jessica Elgot has handily summarised them here. Meanwhile, the CBI stepped up its anti-Brexit campaign with a report today on the impact of a no-deal exit on Britain\u2019s regions. It says the north-east of England would suffer the most because its large manufacturing sector depends more than any other region on exports to the EU. * * * Prison squalor \u2013 An inmate at Bedford prison caught and killed rats in his cell during an inspection that found shocking conditions at the jail. Inspectors discovered a litany of other problems at the facility and a report published today says cells were \u201cfilthy and decrepit\u201d, toilets did not flush properly, and an amputee was in a cell with no adaptations and a wheelchair that he could not propel himself. Pest control work had failed to eradicate the infestation, the report said, and described a notice on a door which read: \u201cPlease ensure doors remain shut to prevent rats entering the wing!!!\u201d. The collapse in standards at the jail was \u201cas sad as it is inexcusable\u201d, the report said. * * * \u2018Baby editing\u2019 claim \u2013 A Chinese researcher who claimed to have created the world\u2019s first genetically edited babies faces a police investigation as authorities in China confirmed that a second woman fell pregnant during the experiment. He Jiankui caused a sensation when he announced last year that he had altered the genes of twin girls to prevent them contracting HIV. He also said a second woman was carrying a gene-edited baby and state media reports on Monday appear to confirm his claim. Such gene-editing work is illegal in China, as it is in most countries, and state media said He had kept his research hidden from authorities with the intention of \u201cpursuing personal fame\u201d. * * * Greenland meltdown \u2013 Alarming new research suggests that Greenland is melting four times faster than it was 15 years ago. Glaciers on the island are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic ocean, where it melts. But scientists have found that the largest ice loss in the decade from 2003 occurred in the south-west region, which is largely glacier-free. They believe this means that surface ice is melting as global temperatures rise, causing gushing rivers of meltwater to flow into the ocean and push up sea levels. Michael Bevis, lead author of the paper and a professor of geodynamics at Ohio State University, said: \u201cThe only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming \u2013 it\u2019s too late for there to be no effect.\u201d * * * \u2018You\u2019re a feminist?\u2019 \u2013 Victoria Derbyshire has created a stir in New Zealand by asking the country\u2019s progressive prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, if she is a feminist. In an interview on Monday, the BBC star asked Ardern on a visit to the UK whether she had any plans to propose marriage to her partner. She said she hadn\u2019t, to which Derbyshire said: \u201cYou\u2019re a feminist?\u201d Ardern, who gave birth to her first child while in office last year, replied: \u201cOh absolutely, absolutely I am a feminist.\u201d The exchange questioning her credentials prompted surprise in New Zealand, where a leading political commentator said people would find the line of questioning \u201cinappropriate\u201d. * * * Infra dig \u2013 A man who drove a digger into a brand new Travelodge hotel in Liverpool is being sought by police after an attack thought to be over unpaid wages. Builders were putting the final touches to the Travelodge when the man repeatedly drove the digger into the building in a rampage lasting more than 20 minutes. \u201cWe\u2019d put the last tile in, cleaned up and made sure everything was perfect,\u201d said Samuel White, a ceiling fixer. \u201cThen some idiot in a mini digger decided to drive through the middle of the building.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: How Ukip embraced the far right With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, our political correspondent Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again. But how did the party come to fully embrace the far right in Britain? And do its supporters know how extreme it has become?

      "bodyText": "A $1.1bn plan announced by Labor to build up Australia\u2019s hydrogen industry has been welcomed by environmental groups, so long as it is backed by renewable power. Labor said on Tuesday its national hydrogen plan would \u201csupercharge\u201d Australia\u2019s renewable energy industry and create thousands of regional blue-collar jobs, particularly in Queensland. Under the proposal, a Labor government would allocate $1bn in funding from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for clean hydrogen development and invest up to $90m from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency for research, demonstration and pre-commercial deployment of hydrogen technologies. It would also establish a $10m Arena funding round for hydrogen refuelling infrastructure and set up a hydrogen \u201cinnovation hub\u201d in Gladstone with an initial investment of $3m. Labor said that the direct investment from the policy was focused on the production of hydrogen gas using renewable energy, but the platform did include regulatory reforms and infrastructure investment that could assist hydrogen production from non-renewable sources. Arena is restricted from supporting non-renewables technology and the legislation for the CEFC prevents it from investing in carbon capture and storage. \u201cDeveloping a hydrogen industry will deliver new opportunities for manufacturing, transport and electricity generation,\u201d Shorten said in a joint statement with other Labor ministers. \u201cAs the global demand for hydrogen surges to an expected $215bn market by 2022, Australia is uniquely placed to benefit from the development of this new, job-generating industry.\u201d Hydrogen gas can be made from water, coal or natural gas. While the definitions vary, generally \u201cgreen\u201d or clean hydrogen is made from water through electrolysis using electricity from renewable energy. \u201cBlue\u201d hydrogen is made from natural gas and \u201cbrown\u201d hydrogen is made from coal. Both blue and brown hydrogen production usually uses electricity from fossil fuels and, for this to be zero-carbon, the process must use carbon capture and storage to offset the resulting greenhouse gases. Some of the proposed regulatory reforms from Labor would support the use of existing gas pipelines for hydrogen, support the shipping of hydrogen, and the storage of CO2 from blue and brown hydrogen production. Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said the CEFC was well placed to support clean hydrogen development and that hydrogen made using water and renewable energy was \u201ca rare and opportune industry for Australia to transition its energy exports\u201d. But he said it would \u201cbe disappointing if any proposed support for the new industry would go to hydrogen made using gas or coal, on the basis of businesses making dubious promises to capture and bury resulting greenhouse gases\u201d. \u201cAustralia Institute research has shown the federal government has committed over $1.3bn to carbon capture and storage and has nothing to show for it, with most projects failing,\u201d he said. \u201cSolar, wind and hydro energy should be powering the hydrogen industry and we see no role for coal with carbon capture and storage.\u201d The Australian Conservation Foundation said a $1.1bn commitment to the industry was \u201ca win for the environment, regional communities and job creation so long as it backed by renewable power\u201d. \u201cAustralia has an enormous opportunity to export our virtually limitless wind and solar energy to power-hungry neighbours, particularly across the Asia-Pacific region, through green hydrogen,\u201d said Suzanne Harter, the ACF\u2019s climate change campaigner. She said Australia had some of the best clean energy sources in the world and the cost of producing hydrogen with renewables had fallen dramatically in recent years. \u201cBut in a world where we must urgently stop climate pollution to limit the damage from global warming, only hydrogen produced from clean energy sources, not polluting coal and gas, is acceptable,\u201d Harter said.",

      "body": "<p>Rio Ferdinand has experienced terrible loss in recent years. In 2015, his wife and the mother of his three children, Rebecca Ellison, died of cancer aged 34. Then in 2017 his mother, Janice St Fort, died from cancer too, aged 58. Now, he says, he is doing anything he can to ensure he and his children are not prematurely bereaved again.</p> <p>So perhaps it is not surprising to find the former footballer promoting a DNA kit that claims to pinpoint the personalised exercise and nutrition needed for a longer life. Ferdinand is 40 now, and looks even stronger than he did when he was one of the best defenders in the world, an imposing, beautifully balanced ball-playing centre back who won 81 England caps and six Premier League titles with Manchester United. He is certainly bigger \u2013 16kg (2st 7lb) heavier, a brick wall of a man, with arms like surfboards.</p> <p>He may have been a supremely fit athlete, but now he says that throughout his playing career he was so skinny, he often felt weak. \u201cYou could see the fibres in my body when I was walking about when I played \u2019cos I was so lean.\u201d The first thing he wanted to do after he quit football was bulk up \u2013 not least because he fancied becoming a professional boxer. He was refused a licence last year and gave up on that ambition.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t much that Ferdinand has not tried his hand at since he retired. He made a desperately moving documentary about life after the death of Rebecca, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/28/rio-ferdinand-being-mum-and-dad-loss-grief-death-wife\" title=\"\">Being Mum and Dad</a>; wrote an <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/thinking-out-loud-570163.html\" title=\"\">equally moving book</a> about it with the journalist Decca Aitkenhead; started a <a href=\"https://five.supply/\" title=\"\">clothing line</a>; became a football pundit; campaigned against leaving the EU and knife crime; visited schools and prisons.</p> <p>As well as the campaigning side, Ferdinand has always had a touch of the Del Boy about him. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish between Rio the crusader and Rio the wheeler-dealer. And today is such an occasion. He is flanked by a member of his sports management team and a publicist representing DNAFit, a nutrigenetics company that has created a simple saliva swab test it claims will transform lives. Nutrigenetics is an emerging \u2013 and as yet largely unproven \u2013 science that studies the interaction between genes and nutrition, with the hope of preventing disease.</p> <p>We are in a small, claustrophobic office near London Bridge. Ferdinand seems to fill the room by himself. He is long and languid, tanned, with an immaculately strimmed beard. Suddenly, the room is even more crowded, as we are joined by a verbose businessman who speaks faster than anybody I\u2019ve ever met.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Avi,\u201d says the publicist. \u201cHe\u2019s here to explain all the technical stuff.\u201d It suddenly feels as if I\u2019ve been interview-bombed; I have a funny feeling that Avi is going to try to make this all about him.</p> <p>Avrom Lasarow is a 43-year-old entrepreneur. His fulsome Wikipedia entry states that he left South Africa for the UK \u201cwhere he began his career which ultimately led to a string of multinational companies\u201d. Last April, DNAFit was bought by a Hong Kong-based genetics company, Prenetics, for $10m (\u00a37.8m), and it appointed Lasarow CEO of Prenetics International. But enough of Avi. For now.</p> <p>Ferdinand tells me of the enormous benefits he has reaped since being DNA tested. When he was trying to bulk up, he soon reached a ceiling, he says, and it was only after getting the DNAFit results that he realised he was doing everything wrong. \u201cI wanted to gain weight, gain muscle mass and retain it. But I quickly hit a ceiling. I was knocking my head thinking: what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>So what did he discover? \u201cI was eating huge carbs and not enough protein and now my diet is much more balanced. Now I\u2019m 101kg (15st 13lb), but comfortable. When I was playing I was 85kg (13st 5lb).\u201d He also started to do more power than endurance work in the gym. I\u2019m no expert, but surely you don\u2019t need a DNA test to tell you a protein boost and lifting weights is an effective means of muscling up?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c885f48545e76e6c21d704538f2a3b79a05e6af7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c885f48545e76e6c21d704538f2a3b79a05e6af7/0_166_1938_1162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playing for Manchester United in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing for Manchester United in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Rowley/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many scientists believe we simply don\u2019t know enough about nutrigenetics for companies such as DNAFit to deliver on its promises. Prof Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and a world leader in personalised nutrition, says: \u201cAlthough this is an area of research that has potential, it is unclear whether the science is already there and thus far there is no evidence that it works.\u201d But Ferdinand is convinced if he\u2019d had this information when he was playing, he would have had an even more distinguished career. \u201cTrust me, I would have been able to play longer, I would have got 100 caps.\u201d</p> <p>How else has the DNA test helped him?\u201c Alcohol,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing it in moderation \u2026 \u201d He looks at Lasarow. \u201cWhat is it, a drink a day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA glass of wine a day is good for you,\u201d Lasarow says. \u201cFor instance, in Rio\u2019s case he has a certain genome type, so alcohol in moderation increases good cholesterol.\u201d</p> <p>Ferdinand says that while he and his fiance, the former Towie star Kate Wright, like to set a good example to his kids by eating healthily, he has in no way become a food fascist. \u201cI go to a kebab shop on a Friday and I like a pint of Guinness, a whisky or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>How much Guinness can he get through on a good night? He grins. \u201cI used to get through a load when I was younger.\u201d How many pints? \u201cI could probably do eight, nine, 10.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThen I\u2019d move on to the vodkas.\u201d He giggles. \u201cI could go through loads. I could go all day drinking, then wake up and go again when I was younger.\u201d</p> <p>Blimey, you were drinking all that as a professional footballer? He nods. \u201cI always say to people who ask if I have any regrets about playing, I wouldn\u2019t have drunk alcohol.\u201d Did he drink more than most footballers? \u201cNo.\u201d He quickly changes his mind. \u201cWhen I was younger I did. I was a lunatic. When I was at West Ham \u2026 elements of my career are a blur. People talk about performances and results at certain times in them games and I just sit and nod my head. I haven\u2019t got a clue what they\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p> <p>Would he drink on a Friday night? \u201cNo, that would be after a game. Saturday or Sunday. It was a different culture. Crazy. The culture I was in at West Ham was a drinking culture. Football and drinks and nightclubs, that\u2019s the way it was. And that\u2019s the way I lived at that time.\u201d</p> <p>When he went to Manchester United, he says, he pretty much stopped drinking during the season. But he would make up for it in the off season. \u201cIn the summers I\u2019d drink for two weeks. Bang. Just keep drinking.\u201d</p> <p>He could so easily have destroyed his health and career.

Simple, he says \u2013 the loss of his wife and mother to cancer. \u201cI\u2019ve got a young family who have seen more than enough trauma for anyone\u2019s lifetime, and I want to be best placed to help prevent anything like that happening if I can.

I ask Ferdinand if it is affordable, but Lasarow answers on his behalf. \u201cHow much do you spend a month at the gym? You might go to the gym and pay your fees for six months but not get the right results because you\u2019re not doing the right things. Of course, there\u2019s a price because it\u2019s a science; there\u2019s a commercial aspect. There\u2019s a small price to pay.\u201d How much? \u201c\u00a399.\u201d</p> <p>Ferdinand remains a hero in Peckham, where he had a fascinating childhood. As well as the football, he was a promising gymnast and ballet dancer, attending the Central School of Ballet for four years. \u201cI went one day as an adventure, and then I was there four years \u2013 two days a week, then three days.\u201d Could he have become a professional dancer? \u201cNo. At the end they said my hamstrings are not long enough.\u201d Did it improve him as a footballer? \u201cOne hundred per cent yeah. Balance, fluidity in terms of my movement, 100%.\u201d</p> <p>Ferdinand went to Blackheath Bluecoat, the secondary school attended by Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in a racist attack at the age of 18. Did he know Lawrence? Yes, he says. He was four years younger than Lawrence, but because he was a big, confident boy he played football with him and his best friend Duwayne Brooks, who was also attacked on that night in Eltham. \u201cIt\u2019s mad what happened. When it happened it was like your life just comes to a standstill. I\u2019d always seen knives or people get shot or whatever, but a young boy at school getting stabbed to death \u2026 it\u2019s like, fucking hell. When the news came the first question I had was: where was it, where was it? Then we heard it was in Eltham. The first thing all of us were saying was: what the fuck is he doing there, in that area, at that time \u2013 it\u2019s a racist area, don\u2019t go there at that time.\u201d</p> <p>When given the chance, Ferdinand talks touchingly and honestly about his past.

But I was aware of that already. I was used to seeing violence.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it was inevitable that Ferdinand would go on to campaign about knife crime, and was vocal about racism in football. (After John Terry allegedly racially abused his football player brother, Anton Ferdinand, on the pitch, Rio stopped talking to Terry, even though they were defensive partners in the England team. Terry was banned for four matches and fined by the FA.) But he says his values, his willingness to speak out, came more from his parents than his experiences. \u201cMy mum and dad are really community-driven people.\u201d He still sometimes talks about his mother in the present tense. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the reason me and Kate are the way we are with the kids because my mum and dad were doers. They didn\u2019t have to tell me a lot about being part of the fabric of the community and being vocal about things. They did it, and I\u2019ve seen it, and that\u2019s why I am the way I am.\u201d</p> <p>Ferdinand also campaigned for the UK to remain in Europe.

You look at our team, we had probably the best bunch of midfielders in the world at the time \u2013 Scholes, Gerrard, Lampard, Beckham, Hargreaves, Carrick etc \u2013 but we didn\u2019t have a manager who could find the formation that could fit them in and get the best out of each and every one of them. We played a very rigid 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1, and that was the most intricate it got after Glenn Hoddle. Then we got beat by teams with not as good players, specially in tournaments. So you\u2019ve got to be coached right, and the players have got to believe in what they\u2019re being coached, which this group of players do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe helped the Egyptian team to get to the World Cup for the first time in 28 years,\u201d Lasarow says proudly. \u201cI\u2019m not saying genetics is everything, it certainly isn\u2019t \u2026 \u201d Egypt lost all three games they played at the 2018 World Cup.</p> <p>In the past, Ferdinand has said that as a player he prided himself on his iciness. Does he think he has changed since retiring? \u201cI\u2019m still quite an intense person but I\u2019m a lot more open. I had the blinkers on. I didn\u2019t see a lot of things emotionally to do with relationships, with friends or family.\u201d I tell him how refreshing it was to see him weeping openly about Rebecca in the documentary and talking about panic attacks \u2013 a good example to all the boys and men who suppress their feelings. \u201cYes, that\u2019s a big thing that came out of it. Everyone\u2019s had a mental health problem in some shape or form, it\u2019s just identifying it and then hitting it head on and meeting it, but again, it\u2019s a cultural shift.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Ferdinand what he thinks of himself as now, primarily \u2013 a football pundit, entrepreneur or campaigner? \u201cI\u2019ve never been anyone who\u2019s wanted to be pigeon-holed. So, for instance, when I did ballet, all my mates from the estate took the piss. But I wasn\u2019t fazed by stuff like that. I\u2019ve been comfortable in my own skin since I was young so I never really cared about what anyone had to say. That\u2019s why, as a footballer, I was comfortable creating a digital magazine, getting a restaurant, going into different fields.\u201d</p> <p>You were also one of the few footballers prepared to say what you think. \u201cWell, you\u2019re taught not to, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Was he pleased that the England international Raheem Sterling recently talked about the racism he has experienced. \u201cYes, it\u2019s been hard work for him but he\u2019s hitting the right notes, not only on the pitch \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>But Lasarow has had enough of the football talk. \u201cMy mission today is to make sure you leave with a DNA test,\u201d he tells me. He turns to Ferdinand. \u201cI think you want to wrap up now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rio Ferdinand has experienced terrible loss in recent years. In 2015, his wife and the mother of his three children, Rebecca Ellison, died of cancer aged 34. Then in 2017 his mother, Janice St Fort, died from cancer too, aged 58. Now, he says, he is doing anything he can to ensure he and his children are not prematurely bereaved again. So perhaps it is not surprising to find the former footballer promoting a DNA kit that claims to pinpoint the personalised exercise and nutrition needed for a longer life. Ferdinand is 40 now, and looks even stronger than he did when he was one of the best defenders in the world, an imposing, beautifully balanced ball-playing centre back who won 81 England caps and six Premier League titles with Manchester United. He is certainly bigger \u2013 16kg (2st 7lb) heavier, a brick wall of a man, with arms like surfboards. He may have been a supremely fit athlete, but now he says that throughout his playing career he was so skinny, he often felt weak. \u201cYou could see the fibres in my body when I was walking about when I played \u2019cos I was so lean.\u201d The first thing he wanted to do after he quit football was bulk up \u2013 not least because he fancied becoming a professional boxer. He was refused a licence last year and gave up on that ambition. There isn\u2019t much that Ferdinand has not tried his hand at since he retired. He made a desperately moving documentary about life after the death of Rebecca, Being Mum and Dad; wrote an equally moving book about it with the journalist Decca Aitkenhead; started a clothing line; became a football pundit; campaigned against leaving the EU and knife crime; visited schools and prisons. As well as the campaigning side, Ferdinand has always had a touch of the Del Boy about him. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish between Rio the crusader and Rio the wheeler-dealer. And today is such an occasion. He is flanked by a member of his sports management team and a publicist representing DNAFit, a nutrigenetics company that has created a simple saliva swab test it claims will transform lives. Nutrigenetics is an emerging \u2013 and as yet largely unproven \u2013 science that studies the interaction between genes and nutrition, with the hope of preventing disease. We are in a small, claustrophobic office near London Bridge. Ferdinand seems to fill the room by himself. He is long and languid, tanned, with an immaculately strimmed beard. Suddenly, the room is even more crowded, as we are joined by a verbose businessman who speaks faster than anybody I\u2019ve ever met. \u201cThis is Avi,\u201d says the publicist. \u201cHe\u2019s here to explain all the technical stuff.\u201d It suddenly feels as if I\u2019ve been interview-bombed; I have a funny feeling that Avi is going to try to make this all about him. Avrom Lasarow is a 43-year-old entrepreneur. His fulsome Wikipedia entry states that he left South Africa for the UK \u201cwhere he began his career which ultimately led to a string of multinational companies\u201d. Last April, DNAFit was bought by a Hong Kong-based genetics company, Prenetics, for $10m (\u00a37.8m), and it appointed Lasarow CEO of Prenetics International. But enough of Avi. For now. Ferdinand tells me of the enormous benefits he has reaped since being DNA tested. When he was trying to bulk up, he soon reached a ceiling, he says, and it was only after getting the DNAFit results that he realised he was doing everything wrong. \u201cI wanted to gain weight, gain muscle mass and retain it. But I quickly hit a ceiling. I was knocking my head thinking: what\u2019s going on?\u201d So what did he discover? \u201cI was eating huge carbs and not enough protein and now my diet is much more balanced. Now I\u2019m 101kg (15st 13lb), but comfortable. When I was playing I was 85kg (13st 5lb).\u201d He also started to do more power than endurance work in the gym. I\u2019m no expert, but surely you don\u2019t need a DNA test to tell you a protein boost and lifting weights is an effective means of muscling up? Many scientists believe we simply don\u2019t know enough about nutrigenetics for companies such as DNAFit to deliver on its promises. Prof Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and a world leader in personalised nutrition, says: \u201cAlthough this is an area of research that has potential, it is unclear whether the science is already there and thus far there is no evidence that it works.\u201d But Ferdinand is convinced if he\u2019d had this information when he was playing, he would have had an even more distinguished career. \u201cTrust me, I would have been able to play longer, I would have got 100 caps.\u201d How else has the DNA test helped him?\u201c Alcohol,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing it in moderation \u2026 \u201d He looks at Lasarow. \u201cWhat is it, a drink a day?\u201d \u201cA glass of wine a day is good for you,\u201d Lasarow says. \u201cFor instance, in Rio\u2019s case he has a certain genome type, so alcohol in moderation increases good cholesterol.\u201d Ferdinand says that while he and his fiance, the former Towie star Kate Wright, like to set a good example to his kids by eating healthily, he has in no way become a food fascist. \u201cI go to a kebab shop on a Friday and I like a pint of Guinness, a whisky or whatever.\u201d How much Guinness can he get through on a good night? He grins. \u201cI used to get through a load when I was younger.\u201d How many pints? \u201cI could probably do eight, nine, 10.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThen I\u2019d move on to the vodkas.\u201d He giggles. \u201cI could go through loads. I could go all day drinking, then wake up and go again when I was younger.\u201d Blimey, you were drinking all that as a professional footballer? He nods. \u201cI always say to people who ask if I have any regrets about playing, I wouldn\u2019t have drunk alcohol.\u201d Did he drink more than most footballers? \u201cNo.\u201d He quickly changes his mind. \u201cWhen I was younger I did. I was a lunatic. When I was at West Ham \u2026 elements of my career are a blur. People talk about performances and results at certain times in them games and I just sit and nod my head. I haven\u2019t got a clue what they\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Would he drink on a Friday night? \u201cNo, that would be after a game. Saturday or Sunday. It was a different culture. Crazy. The culture I was in at West Ham was a drinking culture. Football and drinks and nightclubs, that\u2019s the way it was. And that\u2019s the way I lived at that time.\u201d When he went to Manchester United, he says, he pretty much stopped drinking during the season. But he would make up for it in the off season. \u201cIn the summers I\u2019d drink for two weeks. Bang. Just keep drinking.\u201d He could so easily have destroyed his health and career. Does he look back and think he was lucky? \u201cYes. I was lucky. I had a natural ability that could get me through that period of my life. But I got to a point where I had to make a decision to be more professional.\u201d Ferdinand\u2019s boozing confessions are certainly a good example of a life lived less healthily, but Lasarow is keen to get back to DNAFit. \u201cHave you ever done preventive testing?\u201d he asks me. I tell him I\u2019m not proud of this, but I\u2019m more of the less-you-know-the-better school. Ferdinand says he used to be the same. What changed him? Simple, he says \u2013 the loss of his wife and mother to cancer. \u201cI\u2019ve got a young family who have seen more than enough trauma for anyone\u2019s lifetime, and I want to be best placed to help prevent anything like that happening if I can. I want all the information I can get from the DNA kit for myself so hopefully my kids won\u2019t have to see any more trauma earlier than they should.\u201d DNAFit and Ferdinand began their campaign in Peckham, a deprived district of south-east London where the former footballer grew up on a council estate. \u201cWe went into a couple of schools, and all the children said: I\u2019d love my parents to do this.\u201d (You have to be 18 or over to do the test.) I ask Ferdinand if it is affordable, but Lasarow answers on his behalf. \u201cHow much do you spend a month at the gym? You might go to the gym and pay your fees for six months but not get the right results because you\u2019re not doing the right things. Of course, there\u2019s a price because it\u2019s a science; there\u2019s a commercial aspect. There\u2019s a small price to pay.\u201d How much? \u201c\u00a399.\u201d Ferdinand remains a hero in Peckham, where he had a fascinating childhood. As well as the football, he was a promising gymnast and ballet dancer, attending the Central School of Ballet for four years. \u201cI went one day as an adventure, and then I was there four years \u2013 two days a week, then three days.\u201d Could he have become a professional dancer? \u201cNo. At the end they said my hamstrings are not long enough.\u201d Did it improve him as a footballer? \u201cOne hundred per cent yeah.

Did Lawrence\u2019s murder give Ferdinand a sense of how precarious life could be? \u201cIt made me aware that if you get into a problem it could be a big problem. But I was aware of that already. I was used to seeing violence.\u201d Maybe it was inevitable that Ferdinand would go on to campaign about knife crime, and was vocal about racism in football.

I didn\u2019t see a lot of things emotionally to do with relationships, with friends or family.\u201d I tell him how refreshing it was to see him weeping openly about Rebecca in the documentary and talking about panic attacks \u2013 a good example to all the boys and men who suppress their feelings. \u201cYes, that\u2019s a big thing that came out of it. Everyone\u2019s had a mental health problem in some shape or form, it\u2019s just identifying it and then hitting it head on and meeting it, but again, it\u2019s a cultural shift.\u201d I ask Ferdinand what he thinks of himself as now, primarily \u2013 a football pundit, entrepreneur or campaigner? \u201cI\u2019ve never been anyone who\u2019s wanted to be pigeon-holed. So, for instance, when I did ballet, all my mates from the estate took the piss. But I wasn\u2019t fazed by stuff like that. I\u2019ve been comfortable in my own skin since I was young so I never really cared about what anyone had to say. That\u2019s why, as a footballer, I was comfortable creating a digital magazine, getting a restaurant, going into different fields.\u201d You were also one of the few footballers prepared to say what you think. \u201cWell, you\u2019re taught not to, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d Was he pleased that the England international Raheem Sterling recently talked about the racism he has experienced. \u201cYes, it\u2019s been hard work for him but he\u2019s hitting the right notes, not only on the pitch \u2026 \u201d But Lasarow has had enough of the football talk. \u201cMy mission today is to make sure you leave with a DNA test,\u201d he tells me. He turns to Ferdinand. \u201cI think you want to wrap up now, don\u2019t you?\u201d",

The woman claimed to have been \u201cseverely beaten up\u201d by security guards and the HR and compliance management at the factory, which is used by the brand Stanley/Stella. She said she was robbed of her severance pay and told that if she protested she would be \u201ckilled and her body put in a cardboard box\u201d, an industry watchdog report that endorses her account states. On Sunday the Guardian revealed that at a separate factory used by Stanley/Stella, Spice Girls T-shirts designed to raise money for Comic Relief\u2019s \u201cgender justice\u201d campaign were made by female workers paid just 35p an hour. The report in which the incident is detailed does not name the factory, but Stanley/Stella confirmed that it occurred at Dird Composite Textiles, its largest supplier. The factory was also used by M&amp;S until October last year. The worker, who sat on the factory\u2019s anti-harassment committee, was among 20 employees sacked last year after being accused of attacking factory management in an earlier incident, it is claimed. The revelations are detailed in a report by the Fair Wear Foundation (FWF), a membership organisation paid by brands to \u201cverify and improve workplace conditions for garment workers\u201d. The factory initially denied the allegations but later sacked the HR manager and paid the woman 68,250Tk (\u00a3630) in compensation after pressure from FWF. In response to the revelations about the other factory producing their charity T-shirts, the Spice Girls said they were \u201cdeeply shocked and appalled\u201d and would personally fund an investigation into the factory\u2019s working conditions. Comic Relief said it was \u201cshocked and concerned\u201d.

To help the government implement its policies. But with Brexit \u2013 the most important constitutional issue for decades \u2013 every cabinet minister has his or her own policy. Without a written constitution and with only norms, traditions and precedents to guide us, this unprecedented situation has made everyone in government into a headless chicken.</p> <p>\u201cI was merely a humble vessel into which ministers, the people\u2019s representatives, poured their thoughts and hopes. My job was to help turn this jumble into workable policies \u2013 no mean task.

There is no longer any collective policy. It is every man for himself, as we saw with Michael Gove, who said he was behind his fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson and then stabbed him in the back. I have always been careful of people who say they are behind me because that\u2019s where you need to be if you are going to stab them in the back. But none of them dare deliver the coup de grace to Mrs May because that may result in a general election.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018A dog\u2019s obeyed in office,\u2019 said King Lear. But not, sadly, Mrs May. Without even the extremely limited authority of a dog, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/21/brexit-open-border-theresa-may-irish-tories\" title=\"\">she moves slowly and inflexibly sideways, stubborn as a crab</a>. Never backwards, but never forwards. When I worked for prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/20/in-praise-of-yes-minister\" title=\"\">Jim Hacker</a>, I thought his government was scraping the bottom of the barrel. How wrong I was! Now I see that the barrel is bottomless. Mrs May was recently reduced to telling MPs that it is their \u2018sacred duty\u2019 to vote for her plan. If so, that would be a Church of England matter. Which plainly it is not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d658e441868d9cda164f3c8ec2dd6398c610c69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d658e441868d9cda164f3c8ec2dd6398c610c69/0_121_1866_1120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Ian McKellen in an RSC production of King Lear, 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Ian McKellen in an RSC production of King Lear, 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo the question arises: whom should civil servants serve if their department\u2019s secretary of state is not loyal to the prime minister? With the concept of collective responsibility out of style, is their loyalty to their secretary of state, the prime minister or (if it takes control next week) the House of Commons?</p> <p>\u201cOliver Robbins, the former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, chose loyalty to Mrs May by becoming her adviser on Europe. Apparently he has been nicknamed \u2018Sir Humphrey\u2019, which is gratifying in that it suggests I am a legend within Whitehall. But \u2013 alas! \u2013 no one, not even young Olly, is either as charming or as Machiavellian as I.</p> <p>\u201cBut here are some thoughts for him to consider. First, the Irish border: there are 300 potential crossing points. If we leave the EU without a customs agreement there will have to be border controls. It would only take one man taking a pot shot at a customs post to bring back soldiers, tanks, barbed wire, helicopters \u2013 and worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/21/brexit-latest-news-mays-statement-mps-commons-deal-will-be-absolute-disaster-says-business-minister-as-may-prepares-to-address-mps-politics-live\">Cameron told me privately Lib Dems would block referendum he promised, Tusk claims - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The leavers, English nationalists deluded by their own rhetoric, naturally gave little or no thought to Scotland or Ireland when they campaigned, and Karen Bradley, the current secretary of state for Northern Ireland, is such a know-nothing that when she was appointed she did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/07/karen-bradley-admits-not-understanding-northern-irish-politics\" title=\"\">not know that voters in Northern Ireland tend to vote on sectarian lines</a>. Olly should encourage Mrs May to make a free-trade agreement for goods, which would make controls on the Irish border unnecessary. This would solve the biggest obstacle to Brexit. However, this would require some flexibility in Mrs May, a quality not yet revealed.</p> <p>\u201cWe are told that parliament will try to take control. I\u2019m not sure how that will help.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat is the function of the civil service? To help the government implement its policies. But with Brexit \u2013 the most important constitutional issue for decades \u2013 every cabinet minister has his or her own policy. Without a written constitution and with only norms, traditions and precedents to guide us, this unprecedented situation has made everyone in government into a headless chicken. \u201cI was merely a humble vessel into which ministers, the people\u2019s representatives, poured their thoughts and hopes. My job was to help turn this jumble into workable policies \u2013 no mean task. We were loyal to each government and each prime minister in turn, supporting their manifestos, their hopes and their dreams where practicable, whatever our private opinions. \u201cBut since Mr Cameron allowed his cabinet to campaign on both sides of that disastrous referendum, cabinet government has been defenestrated. There is no longer any collective policy. It is every man for himself, as we saw with Michael Gove, who said he was behind his fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson and then stabbed him in the back. I have always been careful of people who say they are behind me because that\u2019s where you need to be if you are going to stab them in the back. But none of them dare deliver the coup de grace to Mrs May because that may result in a general election. \u201c\u2018A dog\u2019s obeyed in office,\u2019 said King Lear. But not, sadly, Mrs May. Without even the extremely limited authority of a dog, she moves slowly and inflexibly sideways, stubborn as a crab. Never backwards, but never forwards. When I worked for prime minister Jim Hacker, I thought his government was scraping the bottom of the barrel. How wrong I was! Now I see that the barrel is bottomless. Mrs May was recently reduced to telling MPs that it is their \u2018sacred duty\u2019 to vote for her plan. If so, that would be a Church of England matter. Which plainly it is not. \u201cSo the question arises: whom should civil servants serve if their department\u2019s secretary of state is not loyal to the prime minister? With the concept of collective responsibility out of style, is their loyalty to their secretary of state, the prime minister or (if it takes control next week) the House of Commons? \u201cOliver Robbins, the former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, chose loyalty to Mrs May by becoming her adviser on Europe. Apparently he has been nicknamed \u2018Sir Humphrey\u2019, which is gratifying in that it suggests I am a legend within Whitehall. But \u2013 alas! \u2013 no one, not even young Olly, is either as charming or as Machiavellian as I. \u201cBut here are some thoughts for him to consider. First, the Irish border: there are 300 potential crossing points. If we leave the EU without a customs agreement there will have to be border controls. It would only take one man taking a pot shot at a customs post to bring back soldiers, tanks, barbed wire, helicopters \u2013 and worse. The leavers, English nationalists deluded by their own rhetoric, naturally gave little or no thought to Scotland or Ireland when they campaigned, and Karen Bradley, the current secretary of state for Northern Ireland, is such a know-nothing that when she was appointed she did not know that voters in Northern Ireland tend to vote on sectarian lines. Olly should encourage Mrs May to make a free-trade agreement for goods, which would make controls on the Irish border unnecessary. This would solve the biggest obstacle to Brexit. However, this would require some flexibility in Mrs May, a quality not yet revealed. \u201cWe are told that parliament will try to take control. I\u2019m not sure how that will help. On the BBC on Saturday morning I heard two parliamentarians (Lord Somebody and Lady Somebody Else) admitting that they couldn\u2019t see a way through the various entrenched positions. We must avoid \u2018no deal\u2019, and the only option at this late stage is to achieve a dramatic shift in public opinion. This might be done by exploiting our traditional competitive attitude to the French. \u201cSo I would discreetly phone Michel Barnier. He is French, and the Tories resent that we have never got our way with the French since the Battle of Waterloo. The chief of the defence staff once told me that we don\u2019t have an independent nuclear deterrent because of the Russians \u2013 we have it because the French have one. \u201cI would ask Barnier to do two things: 1. Make it clear that the UK\u2019s departure from the EU would also involve our being excluded from the Uefa League and Cup; 2. Clarify that we would also be excluded from the Eurovision song contest. \u201cThese exclusions would greatly enhance the prospects of the French winning both in future. \u201cThen I would telephone President Macron and ask him to make a speech saying that De Gaulle had been right all along: the British are not to be trusted and should not have been admitted to Europe; that the French have been planning for years for us to depart and are delighted that they and the Germans will now be free to run things the way they want. \u201cWith luck, this would so provoke the people that they would rise en masse and demand another referendum to stop the French from once more getting the better of us.\u201d \u2022 Jonathan Lynn was co-creator and co-writer of Yes Minister",

Coming after the departure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/07/vanity-fair-editor-graydon-carter-to-step-down-after-25-years\">Graydon Carter</a> at Vanity Fair, and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/23/business/media/the-not-so-glossy-future-of-magazines.html\">financial struggles</a> of the big powerhouses Hearst and Cond\u00e9 Nast, Moss\u2019s exit felt more like a wake than a new beginning.</p> <p>So is that how he sees it? Is it really the end for the magazine business?</p> <p>\u201cNo it isn\u2019t,\u201d he replies emphatically. \u201cThe magazine business is doing fine.

Stronger.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6bf99253938261e969ab6f30b60fd610fcd014b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bf99253938261e969ab6f30b60fd610fcd014b5/0_0_2079_2772/750.jpg\" alt=\"New York Magazine, featuring 35 women who have accused Bill Crosby of sexual assault.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York Magazine, featuring 35 women who have accused Bill Crosby of sexual assault.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AMANDA DEMME / HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though he is too old \u2013 born in 1957 \u2013 to have digital as his first media language, he wholeheartedly embraced its potential from day one, helping New York steer a more successful path into the modern world than many of its rivals.</p> <p>Under Moss, the magazine retains its print edition and has added five digital verticals \u2013 Intelligencer (news), the Cut (aimed at women), Vulture (entertainment), Grub Street (food), Strategist (e-shopping) \u2013 each of which is growing into a powerhouse of its own within the extended New York family. Between them they reach almost 50 million users a month.</p> <p>Moss made sure to immerse himself in each vertical, taking a three-month \u201cresidency\u201d with each in turn to learn the digital craft. \u201cOver time I began to love what digital could do. I began to love the speed of it, the looser, more colloquial and playful voice you could deploy, how you could make it interactive, animate it, apply audio to it, change narrative structure.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the adjectives that can be applied to Moss\u2019s editing style, \u201cplayful\u201d is key. In his note to the magazine\u2019s staff explaining his decision to quit on 31 March, he said the best thing about magazines is that they are \u201cmore like a kindergarten project than anything else, and that\u2019s what I am saddest about giving up. I\u2019ll miss playing with you all.\u201d</p> <p>Moss says that play, closely aligned with curiosity, is at the core of his editing style. \u201cThere is a child-like wonder to the journalism I\u2019ve always loved, long before I was in this business.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up in the 60s and 70s on Long Island, he was awed by the stable of writers assembled by Milton Glaser and Clay Felker when they founded New York in 1968. Among the stars they cultivated were Tom Wolfe, Nora Ephron, Jimmy Breslin and Gloria Steinem. Moss was drawn to what he calls the \u201cboundless playfulness\u201d of the writing and editing, as well as a \u201ckind of confidence which journalism later lost some of. It was a powerful medium, taken very seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Under Moss, New York has continued to pull off the same complex, exhilarating notes \u2013 playful, serious, both. One minute he will be publishing a piece on the <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/we-asked-a-gyno-about-that-fifty-shades-ice-cream-scene.html\">gynecological perils</a> of emulating the uses of ice cream in Fifty Shades of Grey, the next he will be revealing the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/berniemadoff-2011-3/\">prison life of Bernie Madoff</a> or adding rocket fuel to the #MeToo movement with astounding work on <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2015/07/bill-cosbys-accusers-speak-out.html\">Bill Cosby\u2019s accusers</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a child-like wonder to the journalism I\u2019ve always loved, long before I was in this business</p> <footer> <cite>Adam Moss</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Moss is not without his apprehensions about the state of modern magazine journalism. As someone who fell in love with narrative storytelling as a teen, he is fearful that some of the energy, some of the confidence of the form has slipped.</p> <p>He stresses that in his view New York has continued to create high-quality storytelling, pointing to the magazine\u2019s success in occupying three of the top 10 positions in the <a href=\"http://2018.chartbeat.com/stories\">Chartbeat list</a> of the most engaging articles of 2018 \u2013 all for <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/quincy-jones-in-conversation.html\">glorious</a> <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html\">narrative</a> <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html?gtm=top\">reads</a>. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve been haranguing my staff about it is that we need to get back to the business of telling stories.\u201d</p> <p>But he is anxious for the industry as a whole about a new cadre of writers emerging with much less grounding in the shoe-leather craft of reporting. \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault. Having grown up in a commentary-soaked internet and absent of things like small newspapers where they could get proper training, reporting is not something they do. They don\u2019t pick up the phone or think to go out and find stuff out. That\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p> <p>His other preoccupation relates to the ceaseless onslaught of social media, and the way it acts as a giant focus group which he fears is sapping the risk-taking energy and creativity of editors and writers by making them hyper-aware of popular reaction. You can see just how worried he is about this by turning to his Twitter feed. Correction. He doesn\u2019t have one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90dc5c5bd2a010bcc1e26a12f87b41eb1d2a391b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90dc5c5bd2a010bcc1e26a12f87b41eb1d2a391b/29_24_648_879/369.jpg\" alt=\"New York magazine cover election issue featuring Donald Trump.\" width=\"369\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York magazine cover election issue featuring Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Peterson / Redux</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>(His successor as editor-in-chief, whose promotion to the top job was also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/business/media/david-haskell-new-york-magazine-editor.html\">announced</a> last week, David Haskell, 39, does have a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidGHaskell?lang=en\">Twitter feed</a> but has tweeted only once. So much for the shift to a younger generation. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty active on Instagram,\u201d Moss protests hurriedly.)</p> <p>Moss sees it as a real problem that journalists have come to feel dependent on the approval of the Twittersphere. \u201cPeople are afraid to make enemies. They don\u2019t want to encounter hostility. Some people are very courageous, but I\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019ve asked writers to do a story that make some trouble and they shrug and say they\u2019re not comfortable with it. That\u2019s a danger.\u201d</p> <p>Moss has felt that wind of change blow in his own face in recent years. Though the magazine retains a \u201cgreat deal of confidence in what we publish, even swagger\u201d, he says, \u201cit is harder to publish against the grain. That\u2019s important to me, because challenging people\u2019s thinking is our fundamental role, it\u2019s what we\u2019re in business to do \u2013 intelligently to force people to think. Sometimes that view is not shared by younger journalists who believe journalism should validate a point of view rather than challenge it.\u201d</p> <p>Which brings us, with heavy heart, to Donald Trump. As Moss points out, throughout the entirety of his life in magazines \u2013 from Esquire where he cut his teeth as an editor, through the short-lived 7 Days and the New York Times magazine to New York \u2013 he has been followed around by one character: Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived with him for years. I\u2019ve actually banned him any number of times and said we are not going to publish another word on Donald Trump. And then, frustratingly, I\u2019ve had to row back and start talking about him again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is harder to publish against the grain. That\u2019s important to me, because challenging people\u2019s thinking is our fundamental role</p> <footer> <cite>Adam Moss</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump is splattered disconcertingly around Moss\u2019s office in Lower Manhattan. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/317350918607740928?lang=en\">blow-up of a 2013 Trump tweet</a> on the wall in which the then Apprentice reality TV star dismissed the magazine as \u201cboring and irrelevant\u201d after it published a photo of him <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2013/03/donald-trump-cpac-speech-empty-seat-photos.html\">speaking before a half-empty ballroom</a> at a conservative conference.</p> <p>There\u2019s also on Moss\u2019s magazine stand a back-copy of New York dating from September 2015, early on in Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, which has a cover of the candidate mocked up as George Washington. It related to a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/09/frank-rich-in-praise-of-donald-trump.html?gtm=top\">piece by Frank Rich</a> that argued that by tearing up antiquated norms, Trump was acting as a positive force, with the cover line: \u201cDonald Trump is saving our democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Ouch. Do you remind Rich of that article often, I ask. \u201cHe reminds himself all the time,\u201d Moss fires back.</p> <p>So what does he think is at stake for magazines like New York amid the Trump insurgency? \u201cThere\u2019s so much at stake, our relationship to truth, to our values \u2013 all these things are truly up for grabs. As a citizen I find that very scary, as a journalist it\u2019s fantastic. The ideas that are in play make this an amazingly interesting time to be a journalist.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks Trump, and the political period leading up to him, has allowed New York to put some of its finest writing on display, from Rich to Rebecca Traister and Jonathan Chait. It has also pushed the magazine to the left, the result of \u201cthe Trump administration forcing you to pick sides\u201d.</p> <p>But there\u2019s also a sense of impotency amid the tussle between journalism and the current White House. \u201cOn the one hand, journalism matters now more than it has ever mattered, and publications including ours are better than they have ever been. Yet there\u2019s a frustration that we can\u2019t matter as much as we need to, that when everybody is in their own self-contained world it\u2019s hard to break through and say something with consequence.\u201d</p> <p>He speaks like a person with unfinished business. Though he insists he has no idea what he\u2019ll do next, one thing is certain: Adam Moss hasn\u2019t finished playing yet.</p>",

Speaking for New York alone, our journalism is richer, is better in many ways, we are publishing more of it to more people. This magazine is as strong as it\u2019s ever been. Stronger.\u201d Though he is too old \u2013 born in 1957 \u2013 to have digital as his first media language, he wholeheartedly embraced its potential from day one, helping New York steer a more successful path into the modern world than many of its rivals. Under Moss, the magazine retains its print edition and has added five digital verticals \u2013 Intelligencer (news), the Cut (aimed at women), Vulture (entertainment), Grub Street (food), Strategist (e-shopping) \u2013 each of which is growing into a powerhouse of its own within the extended New York family. Between them they reach almost 50 million users a month. Moss made sure to immerse himself in each vertical, taking a three-month \u201cresidency\u201d with each in turn to learn the digital craft. \u201cOver time I began to love what digital could do. I began to love the speed of it, the looser, more colloquial and playful voice you could deploy, how you could make it interactive, animate it, apply audio to it, change narrative structure.\u201d Of all the adjectives that can be applied to Moss\u2019s editing style, \u201cplayful\u201d is key. In his note to the magazine\u2019s staff explaining his decision to quit on 31 March, he said the best thing about magazines is that they are \u201cmore like a kindergarten project than anything else, and that\u2019s what I am saddest about giving up. I\u2019ll miss playing with you all.\u201d Moss says that play, closely aligned with curiosity, is at the core of his editing style. \u201cThere is a child-like wonder to the journalism I\u2019ve always loved, long before I was in this business.\u201d Growing up in the 60s and 70s on Long Island, he was awed by the stable of writers assembled by Milton Glaser and Clay Felker when they founded New York in 1968. Among the stars they cultivated were Tom Wolfe, Nora Ephron, Jimmy Breslin and Gloria Steinem. Moss was drawn to what he calls the \u201cboundless playfulness\u201d of the writing and editing, as well as a \u201ckind of confidence which journalism later lost some of. It was a powerful medium, taken very seriously.\u201d Under Moss, New York has continued to pull off the same complex, exhilarating notes \u2013 playful, serious, both. One minute he will be publishing a piece on the gynecological perils of emulating the uses of ice cream in Fifty Shades of Grey, the next he will be revealing the prison life of Bernie Madoff or adding rocket fuel to the #MeToo movement with astounding work on Bill Cosby\u2019s accusers. But Moss is not without his apprehensions about the state of modern magazine journalism. As someone who fell in love with narrative storytelling as a teen, he is fearful that some of the energy, some of the confidence of the form has slipped. He stresses that in his view New York has continued to create high-quality storytelling, pointing to the magazine\u2019s success in occupying three of the top 10 positions in the Chartbeat list of the most engaging articles of 2018 \u2013 all for glorious narrative reads. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve been haranguing my staff about it is that we need to get back to the business of telling stories.\u201d But he is anxious for the industry as a whole about a new cadre of writers emerging with much less grounding in the shoe-leather craft of reporting. \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault. Having grown up in a commentary-soaked internet and absent of things like small newspapers where they could get proper training, reporting is not something they do. They don\u2019t pick up the phone or think to go out and find stuff out. That\u2019s frustrating.\u201d His other preoccupation relates to the ceaseless onslaught of social media, and the way it acts as a giant focus group which he fears is sapping the risk-taking energy and creativity of editors and writers by making them hyper-aware of popular reaction. You can see just how worried he is about this by turning to his Twitter feed. Correction. He doesn\u2019t have one. (His successor as editor-in-chief, whose promotion to the top job was also announced last week, David Haskell, 39, does have a Twitter feed but has tweeted only once. So much for the shift to a younger generation. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty active on Instagram,\u201d Moss protests hurriedly.) Moss sees it as a real problem that journalists have come to feel dependent on the approval of the Twittersphere. \u201cPeople are afraid to make enemies. They don\u2019t want to encounter hostility. Some people are very courageous, but I\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019ve asked writers to do a story that make some trouble and they shrug and say they\u2019re not comfortable with it. That\u2019s a danger.\u201d Moss has felt that wind of change blow in his own face in recent years. Though the magazine retains a \u201cgreat deal of confidence in what we publish, even swagger\u201d, he says, \u201cit is harder to publish against the grain. That\u2019s important to me, because challenging people\u2019s thinking is our fundamental role, it\u2019s what we\u2019re in business to do \u2013 intelligently to force people to think. Sometimes that view is not shared by younger journalists who believe journalism should validate a point of view rather than challenge it.\u201d Which brings us, with heavy heart, to Donald Trump. As Moss points out, throughout the entirety of his life in magazines \u2013 from Esquire where he cut his teeth as an editor, through the short-lived 7 Days and the New York Times magazine to New York \u2013 he has been followed around by one character: Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve lived with him for years. I\u2019ve actually banned him any number of times and said we are not going to publish another word on Donald Trump. And then, frustratingly, I\u2019ve had to row back and start talking about him again.\u201d Trump is splattered disconcertingly around Moss\u2019s office in Lower Manhattan. There\u2019s a blow-up of a 2013 Trump tweet on the wall in which the then Apprentice reality TV star dismissed the magazine as \u201cboring and irrelevant\u201d after it published a photo of him speaking before a half-empty ballroom at a conservative conference. There\u2019s also on Moss\u2019s magazine stand a back-copy of New York dating from September 2015, early on in Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, which has a cover of the candidate mocked up as George Washington. It related to a piece by Frank Rich that argued that by tearing up antiquated norms, Trump was acting as a positive force, with the cover line: \u201cDonald Trump is saving our democracy.\u201d Ouch. Do you remind Rich of that article often, I ask. \u201cHe reminds himself all the time,\u201d Moss fires back. So what does he think is at stake for magazines like New York amid the Trump insurgency? \u201cThere\u2019s so much at stake, our relationship to truth, to our values \u2013 all these things are truly up for grabs. As a citizen I find that very scary, as a journalist it\u2019s fantastic. The ideas that are in play make this an amazingly interesting time to be a journalist.\u201d He thinks Trump, and the political period leading up to him, has allowed New York to put some of its finest writing on display, from Rich to Rebecca Traister and Jonathan Chait. It has also pushed the magazine to the left, the result of \u201cthe Trump administration forcing you to pick sides\u201d. But there\u2019s also a sense of impotency amid the tussle between journalism and the current White House. \u201cOn the one hand, journalism matters now more than it has ever mattered, and publications including ours are better than they have ever been. Yet there\u2019s a frustration that we can\u2019t matter as much as we need to, that when everybody is in their own self-contained world it\u2019s hard to break through and say something with consequence.\u201d He speaks like a person with unfinished business. Though he insists he has no idea what he\u2019ll do next, one thing is certain: Adam Moss hasn\u2019t finished playing yet.",

We knew that the company needed to evolve, and that it can evolve, but I had to take a jump in my heart because I have so much love for Pina\u2019s work and have done it for so many years.

I was reminiscing about moments from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/apr/02/kontakthof-review\">Kontakthof</a>: there\u2019s a Marlene Dietrich-type expression we have that combines looking far away and far within.</p> <p>Dimitris was very eloquent about what he wanted.

He was very precise, both about how you worked with an object and with each other.

More than anything they\u2019re a part of the soundscape. We use other materials on stage to create sounds and enhance the score, which is similar to the eclectic music that Pina often used. One particular piece of music, Aram Khachaturian\u2019s Masquerade, was also used by her in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/09/viktor-review-tanztheater-wuppertal-pina-bausch\">Viktor</a>.

I thought: who are these people on stage? Are they dancers, actors or pantomime artists? I went to audition for the company just to meet this woman. In the audition we learned phrases from her choreography for <a href=\"http://www.pina-bausch.de/en/works/complete-works/show/das-fruehlingsopfer/\">The Rite of Spring</a>. Pina had such eyes. You felt that she could see every individual in an audition of more than 100 dancers. She invited my partner Janusz and I to join the company. We thought we\u2019d stay for one year. That was in 1979!</p> <p>I created a lot of new pieces with Pina and loved her process. I didn\u2019t really think it would be possible to go into another creative universe, taking my own baggage with me.

Eventually I got an audition with Pina. I\u2019ve been in Wuppertal for 33 years now. Creating Since She felt like going into unknown ground. It\u2019s more than nine years since Pina died.

We could extend a pipeline to take that water.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/22/murray-darling-river-aboriginal-culture-dry-elders-despair-walgett\">For centuries the rivers sustained Aboriginal culture. Now they are dry, elders despair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Dharriwaa elders in Walgett asked University of NSW associate professor Jackie Webster to test the salt content.</p> <p>\u201cThe sodium levels are concerning,\u201d Webster said. \u201c300mg a litre is much higher than the Australian drinking water guideline of 180mg/L, and this guideline is based on palatability, not health.</p> <p>\u201cNo health-based guideline value is proposed for sodium. However, the guideline does state that \u2018medical practitioners treating people with severe hypertension or congestive heart failure should be aware if the sodium concentration in the patient\u2019s drinking water exceeds 20 mg/L.</p> <p>\u201cThe sodium content of the Walgett tap water is 15 times this amount.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, the town\u2019s bore pump failed and there was no running water at all. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/walgett?lang=en\">Crowdfunding campaigns</a> sprang up across NSW to send fresh water to Walgett.</p> <p>The pump was repaired, and the bore water is back, but locals are losing patience.</p> <p>\u201cWe appreciate the water that people are bringing us,\u201d Dhariwaa elder Virginia Robinson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the solution. We want to advocate for better water management. This is not the drought. It\u2019s worse than that.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a triple whammy \u2013 drought, land clearing and climate change \u2013 that means no water.\u201d</p> <p>However, Blair insists drought is to blame.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is Lake Keepit is empty and farming communities have zero allocation, they\u2019ve got no water either,\u201d Blair said.</p> <p>Lake Keepit is the dam upstream on the Namoi river and is currently at 0.5% capacity. Three weeks ago, a series of environmental releases were sent down the Namoi but \u201cit took three releases, four actually, for any water to arrive because the river is so dry, it all soaked into the ground\u201d, Blair said.</p> <p>Construction to raise the town weir by a metre is going out to tender in coming weeks. This too is a source of tension in the town. At a meeting of several hundred locals last week, there was disagreement.

      "bodyText": "The state government says it is considering options to help resolve the water crisis in the western New South Wales town of Walgett, including installing a desalination system for the town\u2019s bore water supply. Walgett has been forced to survive on bore water for almost 18 months as the Barwon and Namoi rivers are both dry. One expert said the levels of sodium in the bore water was \u201cconcerning\u201d, while locals say it smells and tastes bad. The minister for primary industries and regional water, Niall Blair, has asked for \u201ca full report\u201d from water and public health officials this week, while locals are calling for a royal commission into the mismanagement of water in the Murray-Darling basin. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to support the shire,\u201d Blair said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the option of helping them take water from environmental flows upstream. We could extend a pipeline to take that water.\u201d The Dharriwaa elders in Walgett asked University of NSW associate professor Jackie Webster to test the salt content. \u201cThe sodium levels are concerning,\u201d Webster said. \u201c300mg a litre is much higher than the Australian drinking water guideline of 180mg/L, and this guideline is based on palatability, not health. \u201cNo health-based guideline value is proposed for sodium. However, the guideline does state that \u2018medical practitioners treating people with severe hypertension or congestive heart failure should be aware if the sodium concentration in the patient\u2019s drinking water exceeds 20 mg/L. \u201cThe sodium content of the Walgett tap water is 15 times this amount.\u201d Earlier this month, the town\u2019s bore pump failed and there was no running water at all. Crowdfunding campaigns sprang up across NSW to send fresh water to Walgett. The pump was repaired, and the bore water is back, but locals are losing patience. \u201cWe appreciate the water that people are bringing us,\u201d Dhariwaa elder Virginia Robinson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the solution. We want to advocate for better water management. This is not the drought. It\u2019s worse than that. \u201cIt\u2019s a triple whammy \u2013 drought, land clearing and climate change \u2013 that means no water.\u201d However, Blair insists drought is to blame. \u201cThe problem is Lake Keepit is empty and farming communities have zero allocation, they\u2019ve got no water either,\u201d Blair said. Lake Keepit is the dam upstream on the Namoi river and is currently at 0.5% capacity. Three weeks ago, a series of environmental releases were sent down the Namoi but \u201cit took three releases, four actually, for any water to arrive because the river is so dry, it all soaked into the ground\u201d, Blair said. Construction to raise the town weir by a metre is going out to tender in coming weeks. This too is a source of tension in the town. At a meeting of several hundred locals last week, there was disagreement. Local Gamilaraay people would rather the weir was removed to allow a free flow of the river while other townspeople say a metre isn\u2019t high enough to trap enough water for the town\u2019s long-term sustainability. \u201cI know there\u2019s an internal debate about height of the weir,\u201d Blair said. \u201cBut the funding is to put another metre on. Anything higher would need us to redesign and reengineer the weir and would need further funding. The shire was adamant that funding for weir for extra 1m was adequate. The locals can debate that.\u201d Yuwalaraay man Ted Fields has been involved in cultural heritage management for decades and is calling for a royal commission in to the Murray-Darling basin. \u201cIt\u2019s not just climate change, it\u2019s not just drought, there\u2019s something else going on and more has to be done around the security of water,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a government-created problem. It\u2019s a a flawed system and everyone knows the system is over-allocated. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the upper catchment. Keepit dam is empty but strangely enough I\u2019ve been driving back and forth from Walgett to Tamworth for two years and there\u2019s some beautiful cotton paddocks up near Narrabri being irrigated. \u201cWe drove past a cotton farm this morning that had the sprinklers on, irrigating their crops, just outside Narrabri.

The Productivity Commission\u2019s report on government services, released on Tuesday, was labelled a \u201cdamning insight into many years of neglect\u201d from both state and federal governments. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the report\u2019s findings were bleakest in Victoria, which was recorded as spending $530m on social housing last financial year, below NSW ($1.37bn), Western Australia ($829m) and Queensland ($628m). Taking into account its growing population, the commission said Victoria\u2019s expenditure equated to just $82.94 per person, compared with $173.35 in NSW. The national average in 2016-17 stood at $166.93. Victoria\u2019s per person spending on social housing has also fallen each year since 2014-15, down from $95.92 per person, the report showed. During last year\u2019s election campaign, Daniel Andrews\u2019s government faced a campaign from social services groups to build 30,000 social houses over a decade. It responded by pledging $209m to build 1,000 new public housing units over the next three years. On Tuesday, Victoria\u2019s peak homelessness body seized on the report to call for an emergency commitment to social housing in the state budget. The Council To Homeless Persons cited figures showing Victoria\u2019s social housing stock had fallen by 200 units since Labor came to power in 2014. \u201cThe report is a damning insight into many years of neglect of our social housing safety net from both the state and federal governments,\u201d said Jenny Smith, the chief executive of the Council to Homeless Persons. \u201cIt\u2019s patently obvious that homelessness will continue to increase without an ambitious plan to grow public and community housing in Victoria.\u201d Smith said social housing levels had been historically low in Victoria, meaning agencies were forced to \u201cchurn families, single women and young people through motels, rooming houses and refuges\u201d. \u201cOur services have an ever-increasing number of people coming to them for help, and fewer social housing units in which to put them. It\u2019s not rocket science \u2013 we just need more housing that is affordable to people on the lowest incomes. That is a job for government.\u201d Government data showed in July last year that there were 82,000 on the social housing waiting list in Victoria. The Victorian government was contacted for comment on Tuesday. The Productivity Commission report also reveals the proportion of homeless people being turned away from accommodation services has increased steadily over the past five years. On average across each state and territory, 32.7% of clients identified as being in need of accommodation were unable to be assisted by an agency, according to previously unpublished data cited by the report. In 2013-14, only 24.1% of people who needed a service could not be helped. The total number of people deemed in need of accommodation has increased from 140,000 in 2013-14 to 160,000 last financial year. In 2017-18, there were 53,286 homeless people who were turned away from a service, the report said. Sarah Henderson, the Coalition\u2019s federal assistant housing minister, said the Victorian government had to \u201cfix the disconnect between its low expenditure on social housing and its massive waiting list\u201d. \u201cAccording to its own estimates, 1,700 new homes are needed each year for the next 20 years to simply keep up,\u201d she said. The Victorian Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, accused the Victorian government of ignoring the state\u2019s housing crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Labor to admit that its approach to public housing has failed the community, and go back to the drawing board,\u201d she said.",

He knows [my husband] needs good treatment in Australia.\u201d</p> <p>Harjinder has complained to the Fair Work ombudsman, and sent detailed records of her work history. The case exposes a disconnect between the operation of workplace law and immigration law. Migrant workers are often wholly reliant on their employer for visa sponsorship. It is a situation that is known to lead to exploitation. Those who stand up for their rights often lose their visa, and then have just 28 days to leave the country.</p> <p>\u201cIt happens more often than people realise,\u201d says Giri Sivaraman, the head of employment law at Maurice Blackburn. Sivaraman headed an underpayment case against 7-Eleven, which included representing several migrant workers.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue is that these workers are particularly vulnerable. They need the visa to be able to work and they\u2019re desperate to keep the visa. They\u2019re under enormous pressure and can be manipulated by the employer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve certainly encountered situations of passports being confiscated off employees. \u2018If you complain about it, I\u2019ll just revoke the visa and you\u2019ll be deported.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sivaraman says immigration authorities are often unconcerned about employment problems.</p> <p>\u201cThe only oversight from the [immigration] department\u2019s perspective is whether they\u2019ve got a valid visa. There\u2019s no compulsory investigation or monitoring. By the time any complaint they make is investigated, they probably have to leave.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/29/a-third-of-australias-foreign-workers-paid-less-than-half-minimum-wage-study\">A third of Australia's foreign workers paid less than half minimum wage \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the case was also a strong example of the need for criminal wage theft laws.</p> <p>\u201cA worker gets severely underpaid and then has to work in excess of their visa conditions.

He knows [my husband] needs good treatment in Australia.\u201d Harjinder has complained to the Fair Work ombudsman, and sent detailed records of her work history. The case exposes a disconnect between the operation of workplace law and immigration law. Migrant workers are often wholly reliant on their employer for visa sponsorship. It is a situation that is known to lead to exploitation. Those who stand up for their rights often lose their visa, and then have just 28 days to leave the country. \u201cIt happens more often than people realise,\u201d says Giri Sivaraman, the head of employment law at Maurice Blackburn. Sivaraman headed an underpayment case against 7-Eleven, which included representing several migrant workers. \u201cThe issue is that these workers are particularly vulnerable. They need the visa to be able to work and they\u2019re desperate to keep the visa. They\u2019re under enormous pressure and can be manipulated by the employer. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly encountered situations of passports being confiscated off employees. \u2018If you complain about it, I\u2019ll just revoke the visa and you\u2019ll be deported.\u2019\u201d Sivaraman says immigration authorities are often unconcerned about employment problems. \u201cThe only oversight from the [immigration] department\u2019s perspective is whether they\u2019ve got a valid visa. There\u2019s no compulsory investigation or monitoring. By the time any complaint they make is investigated, they probably have to leave.\u201d He said the case was also a strong example of the need for criminal wage theft laws. \u201cA worker gets severely underpaid and then has to work in excess of their visa conditions. And they [often] work in breach of their visa conditions just to make ends meet. \u201cPeople think about slavery as being locked up in chains, but we\u2019re pretty close to slavery here. It\u2019s bonded labour.\u201d Guardian Australia attempted to contact Harjinder\u2019s former employer, but he did not return calls. Harjinder and her husband had flights to India booked for 20 January. A Fair Work investigation into the employer will continue once they\u2019ve left the country. \u201cBut we have to go,\u201d Harjinder says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any other option to stay. The rules are we have 28 days.\u201d * Surname withheld.",

There are more numbers on people coming but we know for the moment around 11 people are dead and some places we can\u2019t access.\u201d The ULMWP, which is the umbrella organisation for West Papuan independence organisations, said: \u201cWithout urgent action by international humanitarian, aid and human rights organisations, more Papuan civilians will be at risk. \u201cInternational observers and the West Papua people are lobbying for urgent access to West Papua to provide immediate medical treatment, food aid, medical support, documentation and resources to villagers; and to investigate the illegal use of chemical weapons.\u201d Indonesia was accused of using the internationally banned white phosphorus chemical weapon against civilians, a charge it denied. It also denied TNI has targeted civilians, and said it had provided protection for them to return to their homes. Wenda said the ULMWP believed at least 11 people were dead as a result of the TNI crackdown, and a number of people were missing or in hiding. \u201cThey are scared to come out because Indonesia is bombing through helicopters. People are really scared,\u201d Wenda said. \u201cThis is like my childhood in 1977, with the bombs on my village, and a lot of people missing and scared to come home.\u201d The Indonesian military operation was sent in after at least 17 people were killed on 4 December at a construction site by the liberation army \u2013 the armed wing of the domestic separatist movement known as OPM. Indonesia said the victims were civilian workers but the OPM \u2013 which has not been known historically to target civilians \u2013 maintains all were TNI. The deputy secretary-general of the OPM, Octo Mote, told Radio NZ his was a \u201cprofessional military organisation\u201d. \u201cDirect or indirect, these, the ones that were killed are related to military,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cThe OPM conducted investigations before they killed them.\u201d West Papuan separatists have said growing support for their cause among Indonesian nationals has also prompted crackdowns. More than 500 protesters were arrested in 1 December at rallies across the archipelago, including Indonesians, they claim. Further protests have been held this week calling for an end to the Nduga operation. Indonesian authorities have also raided and destroyed a number of headquarters of the domestic movement, the West Papua National Committee, and at least three people \u2013 including the previously imprisoned activist Yanto Awerkion \u2013 are facing \u201crebellion\u201d charges after holding a prayer meeting they had notified authorities about.",

Ardern met with UK prime minister Theresa May early this week and is now making her way to Switzerland to attend the world economic forum in Davos. During a wide-ranging interview with the BBCs Victoria Derbyshire, Ardern discussed her hopes for a future trade deal with the UK post-Brexit, the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane, and the changing global world order. Concluding the interview Derbyshire asked Ardern whether she had any plans to propose to her long-term partner Clarke Gayford, who is the father to their child, and a fishing presenter on New Zealand television. The prime minister laughed loudly at the awkward question, seemingly surprised, and then answered: \u201cNo I would not ask, no.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a feminist?\u201d replied Derbyshire. \u201cOh absolutely, absolutely I am a feminist\u201d said Ardern. \u201cBut no, I want to put him through the pain and torture of having to agonise about that question himself, that\u2019s letting him off the hook, absolutely not.\u201d \u201cOk, fair enough,\u201d said Derbyshire. \u201cWe await that day.\u201d Ardern was also questioned on how she juggles running a country and being a new Mum, and whether she experiences \u201cguilt\u201d regarding the balancing act. Ardern said it was \u201csometimes a struggle\u201d but it was giving her a valuable and \u201cinsightful\u201d experience that was more closely akin to how regular women juggled their work and family responsibilities.

Ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions: all of these, and other indicators, shot violently upward from the late 1940s on.</p> <p>The periodisation highlights a fundamental problem in the fight against climate change today.</p> <p>We know now that scientists understood all the key principles of global warming decades ago. Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html\">as Nathaniel Rich notes</a>, back in the 1980s a real response seemed eminently feasible as \u201cmany prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: non-partisan and of the highest possible stakes\u201d.</p> <p>But the early consensus for climate action coincided with what Naomi Klein dubs \u201c<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/08/03/climate-change-new-york-times-magazine/?fbclid=IwAR1yFvf-ZbSzmMihh3vGn4S9NwAQidkJedYZg9N8e-miIF9FNumVZcdUoWk\">the absolute zenith of the neoliberal crusade</a>\u201d. As a result, the leaders who committed to fighting warming also ruled out any response to emissions incompatible with their free market dogma.</p> <p>Thus, in the negotiations that led to the Kyoto Protocol, the US, with the backing of companies like Enron, insisted that international efforts for climate change mitigation rely on business-friendly, market-based mechanisms such as cap and trade schemes. Even though Washington eventually refused to ratify Kyoto, the methodology championed by it (and institutions like the World Bank) became, by the early 2000s, an unassailable political orthodoxy.</p> <p>Again, the notion that the market offered the best (or indeed the only) mechanism for fighting climate change was always pure ideology. For instance governments can shut down coal-fuelled power stations whenever they like \u2013 they don\u2019t need price signals to pass legislation. In the real world, as researcher <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/climate/carbon-tax-united-nations-report-nordhaus.html\">Jesse Jenkins explained to the New York Times</a> \u201cpolicies other than carbon pricing have driven the majority of emissions reductions to date\u201d.</p> <p>The ideologically-determined attempts to generate environmental outcomes through market action thus resembled huge <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine\">Rube Goldberg machines</a>, dependent on ultra-convoluted systems for results that can also be produced by non-market means.</p> <p>But those fossil fuel corporations who supported (and sometimes led) the early campaigns for emissions trading systems saw the redundant complexity of market environmentalism as a feature, not a bug. Companies like BP and Shell understood \u2013 better than many environmentalists \u2013 that, in practice, a trading system could amount to a massive subsidy for big polluters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/27/industry-abusing-ets-carbon-trading\">since they could profit hugely by \u201cselling\u201d emissions they didn\u2019t actually require.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/24/is-socialism-the-answer-to-the-climate-catastrophe\">Is socialism the answer to the climate catastrophe? | Jeff Sparrow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, because a trade in carbon allowed the purchase of credits associated with carbon offsets (usually in the developing world), tremendous opportunities opened up for creative (and sometimes blatantly dishonest) accounting. An EU study from 2017 found that a <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/news/85-offsets-failed-reduce-emissions-says-eu-study\">full 85% of offset projects actually failed to reduce emissions at all</a>.</p> <p>Many progressives reluctantly embraced free market environmentalism, judging any action to be better than none \u2013 particularly as overt climate change denialism grew.</p> <p>But that missed something else that the corporates grasped: namely, that the \u201cput a price on carbon\u201d slogan accepted, by definition, the commodification of the environment.</p> <p>That was, after all, the goal of pricing: transforming nature, in all its complexity and diversity, into an asset legible within a corporate ledger.</p> <p>Fixing a market value on carbon was never supposed to halt the economic activity underpinning the Great Acceleration. On the contrary, it was intended to speed it up. Even if trading schemes do cut greenhouse gases (which, by and large, they don\u2019t), they\u2019re designed, as pro-business measures, not to limit industrial expansion but to foster it. They\u2019re meant explicitly to encourage more economic growth \u2013 and that\u2019s something that\u2019s no longer compatible with the preservation of nature.</p> <p>As Foster points out, a continuous 3% average annual rate of growth means that world industry doubles every twenty-five years, grows by a factor of sixteen every century, and 4,000 times every three centuries. Given the current state of the planet, how would that not bring utter ruination? The World Wildlife Fund says that populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/10/30/two-generations-humans-have-killed-off-more-than-half-worlds-wildlife-report-finds/?utm_term=.75fa070aebd0\">have declined by 60% since 1970</a>. What will be left if we continue economic metastasisation for another half century?</p> <p>In political terms, the embrace by progressives of mitigation schemes so closely associated with big business has proved utterly disastrous. Over the last decades, an \u201cenvironmentalism\u201d that rewarded rapacious corporations seemed to many ordinary people less a strategy for preserving the planet they depended upon and more a rhetorical bludgeon wielded by an out-of-touch political class.</p> <p>Take the experience in France, where President Emmanuel Macron, pledging to <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-moment-to-make-the-planet-great-again-climate-change-paris-one-planet-summit/\">Make the Planet Great Again</a>, introduced another neoliberal nostrum \u2013 a carbon tax.</p> <p>A recent study revealed that <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/carbon-prices-are-too-low-to-reduce-emissions/\">carbon taxes don\u2019t make a meaningful difference to the climate</a> because governments invariably set them at too low a rate. Why? Well, carbon taxes are <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/february/kolstad-carbon-tax-022814.html\">innately regressive</a> \u2013 they pass the cost of reform onto the consumers who can least afford it \u2013 and thus are rarely popular.</p> <p>In France Macron implemented his levy on fuel as part of a broader austerity package \u2013 and spurred the Yellow Vest revolt, a rebellion led by workers living outside the metropolitan centres, and with no choice but to use cars.</p> <p>In other words, in the name of environmentalism, Macron managed to alienate France\u2019s poorest \u2013 the very people who will suffer most in a warming future and so should have been a key constituency for change.</p> <p>That\u2019s why Thoughts on the Common Toad repays re-reading.</p> <p>In his essay, Orwell takes for granted an affinity between everyday nature and working class people, who can, he suggests, find an alternative to oppression and exploitation in the environment around them.</p> <p>\u201cEven in the most sordid street the coming of spring will register itself by some sign or other, if it is only a brighter blue between the chimney pots or the vivid green of an elder sprouting on a blitzed site. Indeed it is remarkable how Nature goes on existing unofficially, as it were, in the very heart of London.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, Orwell celebrates an uncommodified environment, explicitly because it doesn\u2019t obey the rules of the market.</p> <p>\u201c[T]he pleasures of spring are available to everybody, and cost nothing,\u201d he explains, before exulting at the thought of birds, in the midst of bourgeois Britain, flagrantly avoiding rent.</p> <p>The Great Deceleration we require today means deploying our scientific and technical knowledge to undo the damage we\u2019ve wreaked. It means embracing economic planning, so that we use scarce resources for human need rather than corporate profit; it means confronting the military-industrial complex and abandoning the fossil economy; it means involving ordinary people in the decisions that shape their lives.</p> <p>It means, in other words, constructing a non-market society, as scary as that idea will seem to some</p> <p>In 1946 Orwell, a lifelong socialist, defended an appreciation of nature as something that made \u201ca peaceful and decent future a little more probable\u201d. The joy that he took in toads and kestrels and other creatures that evaded the market\u2019s invisible hand hinted at an older kind of society \u2013 and potentially, a newer one.</p> <p>The dictators and bureaucrats might be ruining spring, as they force every living organism to bear the consequences for their profits. But for most of human history we did not live under generalised commodity production, an economic order that\u2019s remarkably recent. And if the past was different, the future can be, too.</p> <p>As we struggle to preserve our only planet, that insight matters more than ever.</p> <p>\u2022 Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist</p>",

The atom bombs, the police, the dictators and the bureaucrats remain with us and, God knows, so do the lies streaming from the loudspeakers. But, as the sociologist John Bellamy Foster noted back in 2002, Orwell\u2019s beloved toads are now vanishingly rare, with some 200 different species of amphibians driven to extinction in the last few decades. Some Thoughts on the Common Toad appeared in the socialist newspaper Tribune in 1946 just as the planet entered what environmentalists call \u201cThe Great Acceleration\u201d: the period in which the human boot, weighing heavily since the industrial revolution, began to stamp on the face of nature. Throughout the post-war boom, the tremendous expansion of the global economy drew more and more of the world into the circuit of capital. Ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions: all of these, and other indicators, shot violently upward from the late 1940s on. The periodisation highlights a fundamental problem in the fight against climate change today. We know now that scientists understood all the key principles of global warming decades ago. Furthermore, as Nathaniel Rich notes, back in the 1980s a real response seemed eminently feasible as \u201cmany prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: non-partisan and of the highest possible stakes\u201d. But the early consensus for climate action coincided with what Naomi Klein dubs \u201cthe absolute zenith of the neoliberal crusade\u201d. As a result, the leaders who committed to fighting warming also ruled out any response to emissions incompatible with their free market dogma. Thus, in the negotiations that led to the Kyoto Protocol, the US, with the backing of companies like Enron, insisted that international efforts for climate change mitigation rely on business-friendly, market-based mechanisms such as cap and trade schemes. Even though Washington eventually refused to ratify Kyoto, the methodology championed by it (and institutions like the World Bank) became, by the early 2000s, an unassailable political orthodoxy. Again, the notion that the market offered the best (or indeed the only) mechanism for fighting climate change was always pure ideology. For instance governments can shut down coal-fuelled power stations whenever they like \u2013 they don\u2019t need price signals to pass legislation. In the real world, as researcher Jesse Jenkins explained to the New York Times \u201cpolicies other than carbon pricing have driven the majority of emissions reductions to date\u201d. The ideologically-determined attempts to generate environmental outcomes through market action thus resembled huge Rube Goldberg machines, dependent on ultra-convoluted systems for results that can also be produced by non-market means. But those fossil fuel corporations who supported (and sometimes led) the early campaigns for emissions trading systems saw the redundant complexity of market environmentalism as a feature, not a bug. Companies like BP and Shell understood \u2013 better than many environmentalists \u2013 that, in practice, a trading system could amount to a massive subsidy for big polluters since they could profit hugely by \u201cselling\u201d emissions they didn\u2019t actually require. Furthermore, because a trade in carbon allowed the purchase of credits associated with carbon offsets (usually in the developing world), tremendous opportunities opened up for creative (and sometimes blatantly dishonest) accounting. An EU study from 2017 found that a full 85% of offset projects actually failed to reduce emissions at all. Many progressives reluctantly embraced free market environmentalism, judging any action to be better than none \u2013 particularly as overt climate change denialism grew. But that missed something else that the corporates grasped: namely, that the \u201cput a price on carbon\u201d slogan accepted, by definition, the commodification of the environment. That was, after all, the goal of pricing: transforming nature, in all its complexity and diversity, into an asset legible within a corporate ledger. Fixing a market value on carbon was never supposed to halt the economic activity underpinning the Great Acceleration. On the contrary, it was intended to speed it up. Even if trading schemes do cut greenhouse gases (which, by and large, they don\u2019t), they\u2019re designed, as pro-business measures, not to limit industrial expansion but to foster it. They\u2019re meant explicitly to encourage more economic growth \u2013 and that\u2019s something that\u2019s no longer compatible with the preservation of nature. As Foster points out, a continuous 3% average annual rate of growth means that world industry doubles every twenty-five years, grows by a factor of sixteen every century, and 4,000 times every three centuries. Given the current state of the planet, how would that not bring utter ruination? The World Wildlife Fund says that populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians have declined by 60% since 1970. What will be left if we continue economic metastasisation for another half century? In political terms, the embrace by progressives of mitigation schemes so closely associated with big business has proved utterly disastrous. Over the last decades, an \u201cenvironmentalism\u201d that rewarded rapacious corporations seemed to many ordinary people less a strategy for preserving the planet they depended upon and more a rhetorical bludgeon wielded by an out-of-touch political class. Take the experience in France, where President Emmanuel Macron, pledging to Make the Planet Great Again, introduced another neoliberal nostrum \u2013 a carbon tax. A recent study revealed that carbon taxes don\u2019t make a meaningful difference to the climate because governments invariably set them at too low a rate. Why? Well, carbon taxes are innately regressive \u2013 they pass the cost of reform onto the consumers who can least afford it \u2013 and thus are rarely popular. In France Macron implemented his levy on fuel as part of a broader austerity package \u2013 and spurred the Yellow Vest revolt, a rebellion led by workers living outside the metropolitan centres, and with no choice but to use cars. In other words, in the name of environmentalism, Macron managed to alienate France\u2019s poorest \u2013 the very people who will suffer most in a warming future and so should have been a key constituency for change. That\u2019s why Thoughts on the Common Toad repays re-reading. In his essay, Orwell takes for granted an affinity between everyday nature and working class people, who can, he suggests, find an alternative to oppression and exploitation in the environment around them. \u201cEven in the most sordid street the coming of spring will register itself by some sign or other, if it is only a brighter blue between the chimney pots or the vivid green of an elder sprouting on a blitzed site. Indeed it is remarkable how Nature goes on existing unofficially, as it were, in the very heart of London.\u201d In other words, Orwell celebrates an uncommodified environment, explicitly because it doesn\u2019t obey the rules of the market. \u201c[T]he pleasures of spring are available to everybody, and cost nothing,\u201d he explains, before exulting at the thought of birds, in the midst of bourgeois Britain, flagrantly avoiding rent. The Great Deceleration we require today means deploying our scientific and technical knowledge to undo the damage we\u2019ve wreaked. It means embracing economic planning, so that we use scarce resources for human need rather than corporate profit; it means confronting the military-industrial complex and abandoning the fossil economy; it means involving ordinary people in the decisions that shape their lives. It means, in other words, constructing a non-market society, as scary as that idea will seem to some In 1946 Orwell, a lifelong socialist, defended an appreciation of nature as something that made \u201ca peaceful and decent future a little more probable\u201d. The joy that he took in toads and kestrels and other creatures that evaded the market\u2019s invisible hand hinted at an older kind of society \u2013 and potentially, a newer one. The dictators and bureaucrats might be ruining spring, as they force every living organism to bear the consequences for their profits. But for most of human history we did not live under generalised commodity production, an economic order that\u2019s remarkably recent. And if the past was different, the future can be, too. As we struggle to preserve our only planet, that insight matters more than ever. \u2022 Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist",

The cause of death has not yet been released. Truaxe was best known for setting up Canada-based skincare brand The Ordinary, which sells \u201cluxury\u201d products at affordable prices and has been endorsed by celebrities including Kim Kardashian West. \u201cBrandon, our founder and friend.

May you finally be at peace.\u201d Deciem\u2019s acting CEO Nicola Kilner confirmed the death in an email to staff, according to Vox, saying Truaxe died over the weekend: \u201cHeartbroken doesn\u2019t come close to how I, and how I know many of you will be feeling. All offices, warehouses, factories and stores please close today and take the time to cry with sadness, smile at the good times we had, reflect on what his genius built and hug your loved ones that little harder.\u201d Kilner added, \u201cWe are all in disbelief and shock.\u201d His death comes not long after he was removed from his role at the company after months of erratic online behaviour.

Content such as graphic images or video can be uploaded and attached to any farm by anonymous users.\u201d</p> <p>The National Farmers\u2019 Federation president, Fiona Simson, said the map was unacceptable and posed a security risk.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about people going about their average daily business \u2026 and having vigilantes burst in on them supposedly just to check that everything is OK,\u201d she told ABC Radio on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Asked what evidence there was that vigilantes were bursting in on farms, Simpson cited two examples by unknown activists \u2013 one at a property in the Glass House Mountains in Queensland and at the Gippy Goat cafe in west Gippsland Victoria.

That\u2019s what we are asking here now,\u201d she told ABC Radio National. \u201cBy putting online people\u2019s private details, by exposing people to anybody who wants to look it up online \u2026 We are crossing a line here.\u201d</p> <p>The group has been around since 2014 and is based out of Ryde, New South Wales.</p> <p>Its objective is to \u201cend commercialised animal abuse and exploitation in Australian animal agriculture facilities by increasing industry transparency and educating the public about modern farming and slaughtering practices\u201d.</p> <p>Simson insisted family farms were adhering to strict welfare standards and said activists caused stress to animals by coming in the middle of the night and shining lights on them and waking them up.</p> <p>She defended the federation\u2019s efforts to stamp out exploitation and said it would work with legitimate animal welfare groups.</p> <p>Aussie Farms has defended its tactics. The map project was developed over eight years shows the location of \u201cfactory farms, slaughterhouses and other animal exploitation facilities across Australia\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNaturally we\u2019re receiving a lot of backlash from farmers already, because for so long they\u2019ve been able to operate as they please, without scrutiny,\u201d the group said on Facebook.</p> <p>A spokesman for Aussie Farms, Chris Delforce, dismissed the controversy, saying animal activists were peaceful and non-violent people and the map information was publicly available anyway.</p> <p>\u201cAll we trying to do is show the public, consumers of products, exactly what they are purchasing when they buy animal products,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where they come from and this is what those animals go through.\u201d</p> <p>He said every photo or video clip uploaded to the site was moderated first by a team of 10 people, unless it was from a trusted account.</p> <p>Delforce said the organisation contacted the suppliers of photos for verification purposes.</p> <p>\u201cActivists have no interest in the homes of these farmers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re interested in is the giant sheds where sometimes tens of thousands of animals are housed in horrible conditions for a very short life before brutal slaughter.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The agriculture minister has appealed to an animal activist group to pull down a website showing the location of hundreds of farms and abattoirs across Australia over concerns it will promote vigilantism and trespassing. A group called Aussie Farms has published a satellite map showing the location of hundreds of farms and abattoirs and is encouraging people to upload photos and videos of animal exploitation. David Littleproud, has dismissed the group\u2019s activities as an \u201canonymous farm-shaming website\u201d with no real outcomes for animal welfare. \u201cThe reality is farmers are doing nothing wrong. They are doing what is well within their legal rights and shouldn\u2019t have this hanging over them,\u201d the minister told reporters in Toowoomba. Littleproud has sought advice about the legality of the map from his department, but early indications show that it may be within the law. \u201cThe reality is that the federal government may have little recourse,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask them to look into their own soul and do the right thing.\u201d He flagged a possible investigation into the group\u2019s charity status. \u201cPutting the locations of farms online could be creating an attack map for activists \u201cThis will potentially result in illegal behaviour by activists,\u201d Littleproud said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the footage posted on this website is actually from the farm it is attributed to. Content such as graphic images or video can be uploaded and attached to any farm by anonymous users.\u201d The National Farmers\u2019 Federation president, Fiona Simson, said the map was unacceptable and posed a security risk. \u201cIt\u2019s about people going about their average daily business \u2026 and having vigilantes burst in on them supposedly just to check that everything is OK,\u201d she told ABC Radio on Tuesday morning. Asked what evidence there was that vigilantes were bursting in on farms, Simpson cited two examples by unknown activists \u2013 one at a property in the Glass House Mountains in Queensland and at the Gippy Goat cafe in west Gippsland Victoria. She did not suggest the Aussie Farms website was linked to those incidents. She said trespassing activists would also pose a biosecurity risk. Simson said the federation was exploring the legality of the map and wanted Facebook to shut down the group. \u201cWhere I think the line blurs is, when does activism turn into terrorism? That\u2019s what we are asking here now,\u201d she told ABC Radio National. \u201cBy putting online people\u2019s private details, by exposing people to anybody who wants to look it up online \u2026 We are crossing a line here.\u201d The group has been around since 2014 and is based out of Ryde, New South Wales. Its objective is to \u201cend commercialised animal abuse and exploitation in Australian animal agriculture facilities by increasing industry transparency and educating the public about modern farming and slaughtering practices\u201d. Simson insisted family farms were adhering to strict welfare standards and said activists caused stress to animals by coming in the middle of the night and shining lights on them and waking them up. She defended the federation\u2019s efforts to stamp out exploitation and said it would work with legitimate animal welfare groups. Aussie Farms has defended its tactics. The map project was developed over eight years shows the location of \u201cfactory farms, slaughterhouses and other animal exploitation facilities across Australia\u201d. \u201cNaturally we\u2019re receiving a lot of backlash from farmers already, because for so long they\u2019ve been able to operate as they please, without scrutiny,\u201d the group said on Facebook. A spokesman for Aussie Farms, Chris Delforce, dismissed the controversy, saying animal activists were peaceful and non-violent people and the map information was publicly available anyway. \u201cAll we trying to do is show the public, consumers of products, exactly what they are purchasing when they buy animal products,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where they come from and this is what those animals go through.\u201d He said every photo or video clip uploaded to the site was moderated first by a team of 10 people, unless it was from a trusted account. Delforce said the organisation contacted the suppliers of photos for verification purposes. \u201cActivists have no interest in the homes of these farmers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re interested in is the giant sheds where sometimes tens of thousands of animals are housed in horrible conditions for a very short life before brutal slaughter.\u201d",

On Tuesday the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Alice Thompson, Turnbull\u2019s cities and infrastructure adviser, had resigned from her role at KPMG to contest the seat. Thompson confirmed her candidacy via a comment on LinkedIn that she is \u201cnot just doing this to stop Tony\u2019s mission to be leader of the Liberals and prime minister\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m running because I have good ideas for Warringah and the nation and a track record of getting things done in government for the public interest,\u201d she said. Thompson said she will focus on infrastructure, the environment and the economy, and had learned from other independents who can \u201cdeliver for communities in safe seats and unblock reforms that got stuck in our binary two-party-preferred system\u201d. \u201cFor 25 years Warringah has missed out on vital infrastructure while population grew,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how to do this and will get Warringah\u2019s fair share of attention and funding.\u201d Thompson joins Indigenous broadcaster Susan Moylan-Coombs in planning an independent run for the seat. The public education advocate and social commentator Jane Caro has also expressed an interest in running but warned against splitting the vote in the usually safe Liberal seat. Abbott is being targeted by GetUp and local grassroots groups who object to his conservatism on issues including climate change and same-sex marriage. Despite working for Turnbull from November 2015 to October 2017, Thompson is not regarded as having deep links in the Liberal party, having come from a public service background. Before working for Turnbull, Thompson worked in the Department of Premier and Cabinet, Infrastructure Australia, UrbanGrowth NSW, the Department of Infrastructure and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Liberals are concerned that Moylan-Coombs and Thompson may not be the last independents to put up their hand for the seat, with Warringah mayor Michael Regan topping the list of potential candidates. Surfing legend Layne Beachley is unlikely to run but has urged Abbott to leave and accused him of projecting his own beliefs on to the more moderate lower north shore Sydney electorate. Abbott retained Warringah at the 2016 election with an 11.5% margin after a last-minute intervention from Turnbull in the form of a robocall, due to fears the Liberals could lose the seat.",

Julien Faubert, West Ham to Real Madrid 2009 When Europe\u2019s most successful club come calling, it takes a lot to say no. Despite making only eight appearances for West Ham after moving from Bordeaux in 2007, the Frenchman was identified as an alternative option for Madrid after a move for Wigan\u2019s Antonio Valencia broke down. He ended up playing 54 minutes for the first team having missed training when he mistakenly thought he had the day off and fell asleep on the bench during a match against Villarreal. Nicklas Bendtner, Arsenal to Juventus 2012 The striker\u2019s relatively successful spell on loan at Sunderland ensured he was a wanted man in the summer of 2012, although it took until the final day of the transfer window to sign off his move to Juventus. After 339 minutes in Serie A and no goals, they probably wondered why they had bothered and decided against making his move to Turin permanent.",

      "bodyText": "One of five recent suspected drug overdose deaths at music festivals in New South Wales came after the victim took between six and nine MDMA pills with \u201ca very high rate of purity\u201d, the state\u2019s coroner has heard. The NSW coroner will hold an inquest later this year into five suspected drug overdoses at music festivals in the state since September. At a directions hearing on Tuesday, magistrate Teresa O\u2019Sullivan described the deaths as \u201ctragic\u201d and a \u201cterrible loss for their loved ones and for our community\u201d. She said the upcoming inquest would look for ways to prevent further deaths at music festivals. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see any more deaths,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. The coroner\u2019s office announced it would conduct an inquest into the five suspected drug overdose deaths last week. The five deaths to be scrutinised by the coroner include Alex Ross-King, 19, who became the latest victim following the Fomo festival at Parramatta Park on 12 January. Her death followed Joseph Pham, 23, and Diana Nguyen, 21, who attended the Defqon.1 festival in Penrith on 15 September. Nineteen-year-old Callum Brosnan died at the Knockout Games of Destiny at Sydney Olympic Park on 9 December and Josh Tam, 22, at the Lost Paradise festival on the central coast on 29 December. At the hearing on Tuesday, counsel assisting the coroner, Peggy Dwyer, told the court two further deaths of young people at music festivals in recent years could be added to the inquest. Dwyer also revealed to the court that there were major differences in the circumstances leading to the deaths. \u201cThere are some things we know already that are important to share at this early stage,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on the evidence the court has already received the quantity of the pills consumed by the five young people who died appears to be very different,\u201d she said. While one victim appeared to have only consumed one MDMA pill, in another case there was evidence the victim consumed between six and nine MDMA pills with 77% purity. Dwyer called it \u201ca very high rate of purity\u201d. \u201cThat young person consumed between six and nine pills throughout the course of the day, in other cases, your honour is still waiting on toxicology results,\u201d she said. \u201cIn one case a young person who died was drinking as well as consuming what appears to be MDMA. \u201cIn other cases there was no alcohol involved. Some young people sought medical attention and others did not. The court will look at a range of issues relevant to the circumstances of these deaths which all occurred at music or dance festivals.\u201d Dwyer said the inquest \u2013 which will likely be heard in the first half of 2019 \u2013 would look at a range of issues relating to drug deaths, including the provision of medical services at music festivals. Deputy state coroner Harriet Grahame will oversee the inquest, and Dwyer said it would be open for her to make recommendations she \u201cconsiders necessary or desirable in order to prevent similar deaths occurring in the future\u201d. \u201cAn issues list is yet to be settled [but there are] a range of issues relevant to the circumstances of these deaths [including] the availability of water and refreshments at these festivals, the provision of shade and rest areas and the adequacy of the medical services available at the relevant venues,\u201d she said. The NSW government has been under increasing pressure to consider allowing pill testing at music festivals following the deaths. Last week the Royal Australasian College of Physicians joined the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners as well as the former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Palmer in calling for pill testing to be allowed at festivals. However the government has so far resisted those calls, with the state\u2019s premier Gladys Berejiklian instead urging young people not to take drugs. On Tuesday magistrate O\u2019Sullivan said she wanted to reiterate warnings from health professional for young people to take care at music festivals. \u201cThe hot weather in Australia is set to continue and this summer NSW and other states and territories have experienced the hottest days on record,\u201d she said.",

Juan Guaid\u00f3, an opposition leader who recently declared himself ready to assume Venezuela\u2019s presidency, described the mutiny as an indication of widespread hostility to Maduro within Venezuela\u2019s armed forces. He called on the military to put itself \u201con the side of the people, the constitution and against [Maduro\u2019s] usurpation\u201d of power. In recent weeks, Guaid\u00f3, the president of Venezuela\u2019s national assembly, has emerged as a key figure in attempts to unseat Maduro, with the Brazilian, Colombian and US governments offering him their support. Writing in the Washington Post last week, Guaid\u00f3 denounced Maduro as a \u201cusurper\u201d and called on the military \u2013 whose members are being offered amnesty by Venezuela\u2019s opposition \u2013 to turn on him. \u201cThe chain of command has been broken and there\u2019s no commander in chief \u2013 it\u2019s time to get on the right side of history,\u201d he wrote.",

      "bodyText": "The serial photobomber who stole the show and became a meme after this year\u2019s Golden Globes has made a new splash with a cameo on The Bold and the Beautiful. Canadian model Kelleth Cuthbert became known as Fiji Water Girl after popping up in the background of a series of celebrity portraits taken during the 72nd Golden Globes awards in January. She was at the event as one of a number of promotional staff for the water company, a Globes sponsor, but went viral after Twitter users noticed her face and distinctive blue dress turning up in shot after shot. Rumours about Cuthbert\u2019s link to the long-running CBS soap opera began circulating after she posted a picture of herself with actors from The Bold and the Beautiful on Instagram last week, thanking the production team for having her on set. CBS haven\u2019t confirmed her role as yet, or whether it will be an ongoing one, but the official Instagram account for The Bold and the Beautiful also posted a picture of Cuthbert on set, in the background, wearing a black dress and carrying \u2026 a tray of water. The Bold and the Beautiful appearance comes after stints on the Late Late Show With James Corden and E! News, among others, in the wake of her Golden Globes notoriety. IMDB currently lists her appearance at the Globes as \u201cFiji Water Girl\u201d. Not everyone found Cuthbert\u2019s knack for getting in the frame endearing: Jamie Lee Curtis said in a tweet that she had deliberately tried to move away from the promotional staff for the Globes sponsors, Fiji and Moet. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be doing advertising for either.

The chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, issued an urgent notification protocol \u2013 the most severe course of action at his disposal \u2013 over HMP Bedford last year. In a damning report on the dire conditions at the prison published on Tuesday, Clarke said standards had continued to decline despite two years of prison service efforts to improve it. One amputee was in a cell with no adaptations, with a wheelchair that could not be user-propelled. Pest control work had failed to eradicate a significant rat infestation, the report found. One notice on a door said \u201cPlease ensure doors remain shut to prevent rats entering the wing!!!\u201d and conditions in the segregation unit were described as appalling. The report said there was an infestation of vermin, adding that one segregated prisoner \u201ccaught and killed a number of rats in his cell during the inspection\u201d. The report described cells as \u201cfilthy and decrepit\u201d, and said toilets did not flush properly. Clarke said: \u201cThis inspection found that the prison has continued on a seemingly inexorable decline that is evident through the results of the four inspections carried out since 2009.

Many prisoners felt unsafe, with 49% saying they felt that way on their first night. Inspectors said they witnessed a \u201cserious lack of order and control on the wings\u201d, adding that the many inexperienced wing staff struggled to exert their authority over prisoners, who did not obey basic rules or conform to expected behaviour. The report said self-harm had increased substantially and there had been five self-inflicted deaths since the previous inspection in 2016. Almost half of prisoners surveyed said it was easy to get illicit drugs, and a fifth said that they had developed a drug problem while in the jail. The report said the smell of cannabis and other burning substances pervaded some wings, with one officer saying: \u201cIf it\u2019s just cannabis, it\u2019s a good day.\u201d The facility for adult men was hit by a major disturbance that reportedly caused \u00a31m of damage in November 2016.

Benefits claimants who have a psychiatric condition are 2.4 times more likely than those with diabetes, back pain or epilepsy to lose their entitlement to disability living allowance. The findings are based on government data about 327,000 people with either type of health condition who switched from receiving DLA to personal independence payments (PIP) between April 2013 and October 2016. The findings raise fresh questions over whether people who are struggling with mental ill health are at a disadvantage when they have to negotiate the benefits system.

The Confederation of British Industry said the region could be among the hardest hit by a no-deal Brexit in less than 70 days\u2019 time given the high percentage of exports of goods to the EU compared with other parts of the country. Should Britain either choose to exit without a deal or fail to agree a compromise with Brussels, the gross value added (GVA) \u2013 a measure of the economic value of goods and services \u2013 could be reduced by 10.5% in the north-east by 2034 compared with the UK\u2019s current arrangements. The CBI said this would be equivalent to a loss of output worth \u00a37bn, which is about twice the amount spent on schools and education in the region each year. The lobby group said that high levels of manufacturing activity, including thousands of workers in the car industry, meant north-east England was \u201cparticularly exposed to the risk of higher tariffs and trade costs\u201d in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. Goods exports to the EU from the region, as a percentage of total exports, are as high as 59%, meaning border delays, additional customs checks and other costs would hit it hard. Josh Hardie, the deputy director general of the CBI, said: \u201cThe projected impact on the UK economy would be devastating and, while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no-deal scenario is unmanageable.\u201d While the north-east would see the biggest proportional impact, the CBI said that the biggest reduction in economic output by value would come in London. GVA would be about 6% lower by 2034, the lowest of any region, but the scale of the capital\u2019s economy means the value lost would be about \u00a340bn. Some pro-Brexit economists argue that a no-deal exit would have little impact, and could even boost economic growth, although their findings are often disputed. The analysis from the CBI, which had previously argued for MPs to support Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan because there was a lack of alternative options, provides a breakdown by region for the potential hit from a no-deal departure. GVA could be 8.1% by 2034 in Scotland, worth about \u00a314bn in lost economic output per year by 2034. Wales would also see the loss of \u00a37bn and Northern Ireland the loss of \u00a35bn.
