That would allow the UK to leave at any point within that period that it decides to do so, he says.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1115660118882947072\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are times when you need to give time time.<br>My letter to EU leaders ahead of tomorrow\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUCO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EUCO</a>: <a href=\"https://t.co/bAsz4Qx36s\">https://t.co/bAsz4Qx36s</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a></p>\u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1115660118882947072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The leaders are due to meet to discuss Brexit on Wednesday and the release of Tusk\u2019s letter coincides with Parliament\u2019s acceptance of <strong>Theresa May\u2019s</strong> plan to ask for a delay to 30 June this year. But Tusk tells European leaders it is highly unlikely the UK can get a deal signed, sealed and delivered by that date.</p> \n  <p>And Tusk insists the price of any such deal must be the UK\u2019s acceptance that the withdrawal agreement stays as it is, though he says he would be open to further negotiation on the political declaration \u2013 the framework for the future relationship between the bloc and the UK.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our experience so far, as well as the deep divisions within the House of Commons, give us little reason to believe that the ratification process can be completed by the end of June. In reality, granting such an extension would increase the risk of a rolling series of short extensions and emergency summits, creating new cliff-edge dates. This, in turn, would almost certainly overshadow the business of the EU27 in the months ahead. The continued uncertainty would also be bad for our businesses and citizens. Finally, if we failed to agree on any next extension, there would be a risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He recommends that the European Council discuss alternative arrangements, including a flexible extension that would last \u201conly as long as necessary and no longer than one year, as beyond that date we will need to decide unanimously on some key European projects\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The flexibility would allow to terminate the extension automatically, as soon as both sides have ratified the withdrawal agreement. The UK would be free to leave whenever it is ready. And the EU27 would avoid repeated Brexit summits. Importantly, a long extension would provide more certainty and predictability by removing the threat of constantly shifting cliff-edge dates. Furthermore, in the event of a continued stalemate, such a longer extension would allow the UK to rethink its Brexit strategy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UK would remain a full, if departing, EU member and Tusk acknowledged some concerns among EU27 leaders \u2013 notably expressed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/apr/09/brexit-latest-developments-news-theresa-may-visits-berlin-and-paris-as-gauke-plays-down-prospect-of-early-breakthrough-in-talks-with-labour-live-news?page=with:block-5cacb8ad8f08ce46f07ebf99#block-5cacb8ad8f08ce46f07ebf99\">4.29pm</a>) \u2013 that that would \u201cpose risks for the functioning\u201d of the bloc.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To address them, we would need to agree on a number of conditions: No re-opening of the withdrawal agreement; no start of the negotiations on the future, except for the political declaration; the UK would have to maintain its sincere cooperation also during this crucial period, in a manner that reflects its situation as a departing member state. We should remember, however, that the United Kingdom will remain a member state with full rights and obligations. And, in any event, the UK can revoke article 50 at any time, as stated by the European Court of Justice.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Finally, Tusk said the EU27 must approach the UK with a fraternal attitude, saying the two \u201cwant to remain friends and close partners ...

Michael Gove had been due, but pulled out.</p> \n  <p>While we learned nothing substantially new about what they stand for, it did become fairly apparent all of them would probably like the top job, giving what you might call wide-ranging responses to the questions on offer.</p> \n  <p>One of Mordaunt\u2019s most interesting messages was to reach beyond her usual pro-leave constituency to praise remain voters for their \u201cgreatest act of patriotism\u201d in accepting the Brexit referendum result.</p> \n  <p>Tugendhat, answering a question about whether the Tories needed a generational change in leader, predicted May\u2019s replacement would be \u201csomeone under 50\u201d.

He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is one point that needs to be stated quite clearly; that these ambitions, with regard to future relations, which could for example consist of adding to a free trade agreement ... for example a customs union - we are willing to improve and amend the political declaration rapidly, within a few hours or days.</p> \n   <p>But the request we await and expect from the UK as a result of this cross-party dialogue is one that needs to respect the principles underlying the approach of the European council and the European parliament, and respect what we are and what we will continue to be. This is something worth recalling; we are talking about the integrity of the internal market, the decision making autonomy of the 27 and the indivisibility of the four freedoms ... </p> \n   <p>That\u2019s a point that needs to be understood very clearly. And if that is the case, then we are willing straight away ... to get down to amending and improving the providing more ambition to the political declaration which will set the framework for future relations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Then Barnier suggested that the decision of this kind by the UK, to accept a customs union, was exactly the sort of \u201croadmap\u201d the EU needed to hear to justify a long extension. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Now, why am I stressing this particular point, and these new elements in the process which we hope will allow for a new process to emerge in the House of Commons and will allow ultimately for a new majority to emerge with regard to this agreement and this new political declaration?</p> \n   <p>Why am I stressing this so much? Clearly it\u2019s because this is what would provide meaning to the request that the UK prime minister has submitted for an extension. And this is all I wish to say on this for today. Forgive me for not dwelling on this further, but this is a matter for the leaders of the European Union tomorrow.</p> \n   <p>This extension has to serve a purpose. It has got to serve a purpose to provide more time if necessary to ensure that the political process I\u2019ve described can be crowned with success, and that this majority can be attained.</p> \n   <p>The issue of the length of the extension, which has been discussed at great length with its possible pros and cons - I\u2019m not going to make a statement on that. From my vantage point, it is not up to me to do so.</p> \n   <p>But the duration of the extension has got to in line in any case with the purpose being striven for. That is what I would say right now. It has got to serve a purpose or an aim. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It is worth remembering that May is not requesting a long article 50 extension. She is only asking for one until 30 June. But the EU has refused this request once before, and it does not want the UK to remain in the EU until 30 June if European elections get cancelled in the UK, just in case the UK decides to revoke article 50 in June, leaving the UK a member of the EU but with no MEPs, and the European institutions in legal chaos. That is why many observers think the EU is more likely to offer a long extension.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Barnier dismissed Andrea Leadsom\u2019s suggestion (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/apr/09/brexit-latest-developments-news-theresa-may-visits-berlin-and-paris-as-gauke-plays-down-prospect-of-early-breakthrough-in-talks-with-labour-live-news?page=with:block-5cac55868f08ce46f07ebb14#block-5cac55868f08ce46f07ebb14\"> 9.35am)</a> that the withdrawal agreement might be reopened. </strong>That was not going to happen, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1115558259664883712\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"You will have heard me say on a number of occasions - the withdrawal agreement is not going to be reopened\"<br><br>Chief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> negotiator Michel Barnier repeats EU's position, after senior minister Andrea Leadsom makes new call for a renegotiation<a href=\"https://t.co/A6Zn98PTx8\">https://t.co/A6Zn98PTx8</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HjSb9l4Vfr\">pic.twitter.com/HjSb9l4Vfr</a></p>\u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1115558259664883712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Barnier said, if there was a no-deal Brexit, it would be the UK\u2019s fault, not the EU\u2019s. </strong>(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/apr/09/brexit-latest-developments-news-theresa-may-visits-berlin-and-paris-as-gauke-plays-down-prospect-of-early-breakthrough-in-talks-with-labour-live-news?page=with:block-5cac61e28f08ce46f07ebb73#block-5cac61e28f08ce46f07ebb73\">10.21am.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-09T11:43:59.853Z\">at 12.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cac65d58f08ce46f07ebbb5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-09T09:31:31.198Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Barnier says the length of an article 50 extension would have to be linked to its purpose.</p> \n  <p><strong>George Ciamba</strong>, the Romanian foreign affairs minister, says the EU will take two things into account; the fact that the UK is holding European elections, and the talks with Labour.</p> \n  <p>Barnier says the EU has prepared for all options.

In a speech in 2016 during the EU referendum campaign <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, the co-leader of Vote Leave who is now environment secretary, declared: \u201cThe day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want.\u201d Today, as May visits Germany and France in the role of supplicant, she will demonstrate quite how monumentally wrong Gove\u2019s prediction turned out to be.</p> \n  <p>Here is a preview story from my colleague <strong>Daniel Boffey.</strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/08/pm-leaving-no-stone-unturned-in-effort-to-get-deal-says-hunt\">UK's new Brexit date could be fixed by small group of EU leaders</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And here is a Guardian analysis of what Berlin and Paris are both looking for.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/08/merkel-and-macron-under-pressure-as-may-seeks-new-brexit-delay\">Merkel and Macron under pressure as May seeks new Brexit delay</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Merkel and Macron, and other EU leaders, want the UK to agree a Brexit deal, and they will be asking May about the chances of her talks with Labour producing a compromise solution that could get through parliament.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. Thanks for reading and for all the comments. Here\u2019s a summary of the afternoon\u2019s events: MPs backed Theresa May\u2019s plan to ask for a Brexit extension until 30 June 2019. May was forced to bring her proposal to the Commons for a vote by the passage of legislation put forward by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and others. The Commons backed the prime minister by a majority of 310. But the president of the EU Council, Donald Tusk, urged EU leaders to offer a much longer extension. Tusk said the UK should be given up to a year to get Brexit sorted, claiming there was little chance of arrangements being made by 30 June. A draft EU Council document suggested such proposals were being drawn up. Labour has said it will back any \u201creasonable\u201d delay beyond 30 June. Some European leaders are uneasy with such a move. France has been outspoken in its belief that a year would be \u201ctoo long\u201d and EU leaders will want to see a series of commitments from the UK before any such delay is to be agreed. Brexit talks between Labour and the Tories are due to resume on Thursday \u2013 after the EU Council\u2019s Brexit meeting. Discussions ended on Tuesday with a deal remaining elusive. Labour again accused the prime minister of a lack of willingness to compromise. A Tory former minister warned that British MEPs would be a disruptive influence in the European parliament if Brexit was extended. Tim Loughton said the UK will \u201celect an army of Nigel Farage Mini-Mes who will frankly wreak havoc\u201d if the country participates in EU elections. Senior EU figures have demanded assurances the UK would not disrupt the bloc\u2019s functioning if it stayed as a condition of a delay to Brexit. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events. And, if you\u2019d like to read yet more on the Tory infighting, my colleague Rowena Mason has the full story: It emerged yesterday that the Conservatives were planning to contest the European parliamentary elections and had invited potential MEPs to put themselves forward. One person who will not be doing so, however, is David Bannerman \u2013 the Tory MEP for the East of England. After quite some consideration, I have decided today not to stand again as a Conservative MEP for the East of England if elections are called for 23 May 2019. I think it would be dishonourable for me personally to stand again as a Conservative MEP in these circumstances, particularly with my strong views on honouring the Brexit result. I am unable to defend the decision to call these elections and the arguments for yet further delay when the British people just want Brexit done. I strongly believe it is entirely wrong and counterproductive for these elections to be held at all. With nearly three years since the Referendum (of 23 June 2016) the British people are angrily demanding that the result be honoured and Brexit be delivered. Bannerman has said he would support the prime minister\u2019s deal \u201conly on the basis of getting the UK legally out of the EU\u201d. Following talks between Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron in Paris, a Downing Street spokesman has said: The prime minister met with President Macron in Paris this afternoon, ahead of the EU Council meeting tomorrow. Following the prime minister\u2019s letter to Donald Tusk last week, the leaders discussed the UK\u2019s request for an extension of article 50 to 30 June, with the option to bring this forward if a deal is ratified earlier. The prime minister updated President Macron on the ongoing talks with the [Labour party] to agree a way forward that respects the result of the 2016 referendum. They also discussed upcoming European parliamentary elections with the PM saying that the government was working very hard to avoid the need for the UK to take part. The leaders also discussed the ongoing situation in Libya. The PM expressed her deep concern about the recent escalation and said it was important for the international community to work together to bring an end to the violence. Back in Westminster, the noises emanating from the Labour party in respect of the cross-party Brexit talks remain somewhat downbeat. A spokesperson has said: We had further detailed and wide-ranging talks with cabinet ministers and officials today. We have yet to see the clear shift in the government\u2019s position that is needed to secure a compromise agreement. We have agreed to hold further talks on Thursday in an effort to break the Brexit deadlock, and find a compromise that can win support in Parliament and bring the country together. The party has repeatedly accused the prime minister of showing insufficient willingness to compromise during the negotiations; something Downing Street has denied. In reaction, the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, has said: The fact that talks seem to have broken down again is not a surprise, since neither side seemed interested in negotiating a compromise because they are more concerned with protecting party political interest. May and Corbyn must stop avoiding the elephant in the room; only a People\u2019s Vote can secure a cast iron majority. The prime minister must now chair a cross-party committee, including the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Plaid Cymru, and independent MPs, to agree to a confirmatory referendum on the deal with an option to remain in the EU. If MPs commit to working together we can pull the UK back from the brink and ensure that the people, not politicians, have the final say on Brexit. Allied to the previous post, Sky News\u2019 political editor, Faisal Islam, has seen a draft of the European Council\u2019s conclusions that suggests the EU leaders are drawing up plans along the lines defined by Tusk: The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has written to EU leaders urging them to offer the UK a flexible extension to the article 50 process of up to one year. That would allow the UK to leave at any point within that period that it decides to do so, he says. The leaders are due to meet to discuss Brexit on Wednesday and the release of Tusk\u2019s letter coincides with Parliament\u2019s acceptance of Theresa May\u2019s plan to ask for a delay to 30 June this year. But Tusk tells European leaders it is highly unlikely the UK can get a deal signed, sealed and delivered by that date. And Tusk insists the price of any such deal must be the UK\u2019s acceptance that the withdrawal agreement stays as it is, though he says he would be open to further negotiation on the political declaration \u2013 the framework for the future relationship between the bloc and the UK. Our experience so far, as well as the deep divisions within the House of Commons, give us little reason to believe that the ratification process can be completed by the end of June. In reality, granting such an extension would increase the risk of a rolling series of short extensions and emergency summits, creating new cliff-edge dates. This, in turn, would almost certainly overshadow the business of the EU27 in the months ahead. The continued uncertainty would also be bad for our businesses and citizens. Finally, if we failed to agree on any next extension, there would be a risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit. He recommends that the European Council discuss alternative arrangements, including a flexible extension that would last \u201conly as long as necessary and no longer than one year, as beyond that date we will need to decide unanimously on some key European projects\u201d. The flexibility would allow to terminate the extension automatically, as soon as both sides have ratified the withdrawal agreement. The UK would be free to leave whenever it is ready. And the EU27 would avoid repeated Brexit summits. Importantly, a long extension would provide more certainty and predictability by removing the threat of constantly shifting cliff-edge dates. Furthermore, in the event of a continued stalemate, such a longer extension would allow the UK to rethink its Brexit strategy. The UK would remain a full, if departing, EU member and Tusk acknowledged some concerns among EU27 leaders \u2013 notably expressed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron (see 4.29pm) \u2013 that that would \u201cpose risks for the functioning\u201d of the bloc. To address them, we would need to agree on a number of conditions: No re-opening of the withdrawal agreement; no start of the negotiations on the future, except for the political declaration; the UK would have to maintain its sincere cooperation also during this crucial period, in a manner that reflects its situation as a departing member state. We should remember, however, that the United Kingdom will remain a member state with full rights and obligations. And, in any event, the UK can revoke article 50 at any time, as stated by the European Court of Justice. Finally, Tusk said the EU27 must approach the UK with a fraternal attitude, saying the two \u201cwant to remain friends and close partners ... Neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated at any stage in this difficult process\u201d. May will address the leaders on Wednesday, before the EU27 hold a private meeting to agree their response to her request for a delay to 30 June 2019. This is how the parties divided in the vote on the motion approving the PM\u2019s decision to seek an article 50 extension until 30 June. For Labour: 223 Conservatives: 131 SNP: 33 Independents: 17 Lib Dems: 11 Plaid Cymru: 4 Greens: 1 Total: 420 Against Conservatives: 97 DUP: 9 Labour: 3 (Ronnie Campbell, Stephen Hepburn, Kate Hoey) Independents: 1 (Frank Field) Total: 110 And here are some key points that emerge from the figures. May won the vote with majority opposition support. Only 31% of her votes - less than a third - came from Conservative MPs. On Brexit you could argue this is the moment when she became a Ramsay MacDonald; heading a national government, but reliant on the votes of another party. The Tories split three ways, and fairly evenly, in this division. Some 42% of Tory MPs voted with the government, another 30% voted against, and the rest did not vote. In a further sign that government discipline is breaking down, 12 ministers did not vote with the government, including Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary. It is not clear yet how many of these were deliberate abstentions (ie, in defiance of the whip), and how many were approved absences, but it would be unusual to have this many ministers having permission not to vote in a division like this. Jeremy Corbyn has kept his party united on this issue. Only three Labour MPs defied the whip to vote with the government. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Theresa May has won the vote on requesting an article 50 extension until 30 June by 420 votes to 110 - a majority of 310. Theresa May has arrived at the Elysee Palace for talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. This is from the BBC\u2019s Brussel correspondent, Adam Fleming. In the Commons MPs are now voting on the motion to request an article 50 extension. Downing Street has said that the talks with Labour aimed at finding a Brexit compromise have been \u201cproductive\u201d and that a further session is planned for Thursday. It it an implicit admission that Theresa May will not have struck a deal with Jeremy Corbyn before she goes to Brussels for the emergency summit tomorrow afternoon. A Number 10 spokesman said: We have had further productive and wide-ranging talks this afternoon, and the parties have agreed to meet again on Thursday once European council has concluded. We remain completely committed to delivering on Brexit, with both sides working hard to agreeing a way forward, appreciating the urgency in order to avoid European elections. The two sides had a half-hour working lunch starting at 1pm, and then continued in talks until 5pm. UPDATE: It was not much of a lunch, according to the Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. Another Tory Brexiter has given a speech saying that it would be a mistake for the EU to offer the UK a long article 50 extension because the UK would end up being a disruptive influence. It was Tim Loughton, a former minister, speaking in the Brexit debate a few minutes ago. What is significant is that Loughton is much less of a hardliner than Mark Francois and Jacob Rees-Mogg, the other Brexiters who have been making this argument today. (See 1.45pm.) Loughton voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal in January, but voted for it in the subsequent two debates. Addressing EU leader in the Commons debate this afternoon, he said: Please, put us out of our misery now, as this house and this government appear incapable of doing. At tomorrow\u2019s EU Council, please vote against any further extensions to article 50 and oblige the UK to leave the EU on Friday on WTO terms, as you previously said you would only honour any application for an extension if there was a credible reason so to do. That credible reason does not not exist ... If the EU elections go ahead, it is highly likely that UK will elect an army of Nigel Farage Mini-Mes who will frankly wreak havoc with the European parliament and wreck your calculations about the balance of power within the EU. Loughton said there was no prospect of May agreeing a deal with Labour that would be acceptable to majority of Conservative MPs and he said within the next few months the EU could be dealing with a different prime minister. He went on: If an extension runs for another year, you will have to resign yourself to a further year of disagreement and obfuscation in this house, with the knock-on effects of chaos and undermining of regular EU processes, of budgets and other measures to be negotiated. My appeal to the EU is, if you value the future of the EU, you do not want us to remain an integral part of it in the current circumstances. Do yourself a favour. Do this house a favour, do this country a favour, and say that this country is out, and then, armed with that certainty, let us all sit down constructively and pragmatically to decide on what our future relationship will actually look like, and one which works to our mutual benefit, and sets a course where we can remain friends and allies and trading partners in years to come. While Theresa May was on a flight from Berlin to Paris to meet Emmanuel Macron, the Elysee briefed that the \u201cgood cop, bad cop\u201d narrative in which France was being portrayed as nasty was a red herring. \u201cThe proof is that we are looking hard for solutions,\u201d a source in Macron\u2019s office said. \u201cBut France is firm on the principles, yes, that\u2019s true,\u201d the source said. Paris said that this meant protecting the future workings of the EU. Any long extension beyond the European parliament elections would require \u201cvery strict guarantees\u201d that the UK \u201cas an exiting member state\u201d would not fully take part in or disrupt key European council or commission decisions on the future of the EU. The source said this would mean limits being placed on the UK\u2019s participation in European council and commission business, but not in the European parliament. The UK would need to agree to these guarantees and agree to regular checks on the UK\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d every three or four months. Asked about the length of a possible extension to the UK\u2019s exit date, the French source said: \u201cWe think one year would be too long.\u201d Macron is also concerned that Brexit must not continue to dominate EU business. A source at the Elysee palace said: We cannot keep holding repeat Brexit summits. The EU has other things to do. Only a few weeks before the European elections, the EU must show that it knows how to do other things than holding summits about Brexit. In the Brexit debate Owen Paterson, the Tory Brexiter, says that the government should listen to the extraordinary anger of people who voted leave, and that the UK should leave the EU at 11pm on Friday. He says there might be some disruption. But that would not be as damaging as having people feel that their vote has been ignored, he says. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has told the BBC that Theresa May has not shown proper leadership over Brexit. She said: [Theresa May] needed to show leadership and I\u2019m sorry to say that hasn\u2019t been evident in this past couple of months. Asked if the DUP would end its confidence and supply arrangement with May, Foster replied: Our confidence and supply arrangement is with the Conservative party, so it\u2019s not a matter for us to tell the Conservative party who they choose as their leader, or indeed their next leader, because of course the prime minister has already indicated she is leaving that post. It\u2019s a matter for the Conservative party. Pennycook says Labour would back any \u201creasonable\u201d article 50 extension beyond 30 June. But any such extension must be for a worthwhile purpose, he says. It should not be used by the government simply to create time to allow Theresa May to try yet again to get her current deal through parliament, he says. Labour would back any \u201creasonable\u201d article 50 extension beyond 30 June, the shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook says. In the Brexit debate Matthew Pennycook, the shadow Brexit minister, is speaking for Labour. He condemns the government\u2019s handling of the Brexit process, and particularly criticises Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, for this morning giving credence to the \u201cfantastical notion\u201d that the EU will be willing to reopen the withdrawal agreement. (See 9.35am.) It is long past time that government ministers stopped peddling myths to indulge the hardliners on their own back benches. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle intervenes, and asks Pennycook to condemn the hardline Brexiters in the European Research Group who are saying the UK will disrupt the EU if it is made to stay in. Pennycook agrees. He says the ERG MPs saying this are the same people who claimed the UK had no influence when it was a member. In the Commons MPs have just started debating the motion backing the prime minister\u2019s plan to request an article 50 extension. This is a debate that is taking place because of the Yvette Cooper bill passed yesterday. Here is the text of the government motion. That this house agrees for the purposes of section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2019 to the prime minister seeking an extension of the period specified in article 50(3) of the treaty on European Union to a period ending on 30 June 2019. Two amendments were tabled, one from the SNP saying the extension should last until 30 June 2019 at the earliest, and another from the Tory Brexiter Peter Bone saying the extension should last until 15 April (Monday). But John Bercow, the Speaker, says he has not selected either amendment. Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, is opening the debate. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant asks what will happen if the EU only offers a longer extension. Buckland says he does not want to discuss what might happen at the summit next week. Iain Duncan Smith, another Tory Brexiter, asks if it is true that the UK could elected MEPs only for them to not take up their seats. Buckland says, if the UK were to leave the EU in June, after the elections but before the new parliament meets, then the newly-elected MEPs would not take their seats. These are from my colleague Angelique Chrisafis in Paris. These are from my colleague Dan Sabbagh who was at the People\u2019s Vote rally. I previewed Huw Merriman\u2019s speech earlier. (See 12.10pm.) Britain\u2019s already struggling economy would be pushed into a two-year recession by a no-deal Brexit, the International Monetary Fund has warned. As my colleague Larry Elliott reports, ahead of Theresa May\u2019s plea to EU leaders for a further delay to Britain\u2019s departure, the IMF used a downbeat half-yearly assessment of the global economy to predict that the UK economy could be 3.5% smaller than expected by 2021 if trade barriers were swiftly erected. The World Economic Outlook \u2013 completed in March before the latest developments in Brexit \u2013 predicted UK growth of 1.2% in 2019 on the assumption that a Brexit deal is done. Judging by what the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler is saying, German officials are even less forthcoming about today\u2019s Merkel/May talks than Number (which is no small achievement - see 2.33pm.) Labour has said it expects significant new proposals from the government when senior figures meet cabinet ministers to resume talks, including on single market alignment, a customs union and protections against a future Tory leader unpicking any agreement. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who is joining the talks for the first time, said Labour was engaging seriously but said the party had to hear new proposals. Speaking after Treasury questions in the Commons, McDonnell said that the customs union was the first item on the agenda for the talks, followed by closer alignment with the single market, particularly focussed on arrangements for financial services, followed by workers rights, consumer and environmental protects and a lock to prevent the agreement from being unlocked \u2013 including potentially doing a binding deal with the EU. A second referendum was also on the agenda, McDonnell said, though he expressed scepticism if the talks would manage to include that in just four-and-a-half hours. \u201cWhether we reach it, we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. McDonnell said correspondence had been exchanged between the two sides since Friday but no new proposal had been outlined ahead of the talks resuming on Tuesday lunchtime. He said: What there hasn\u2019t been sufficient discussion of so far is alignment with the single market. So Philip Hammond\u2019s there today and we will be expecting him to outline in more detail the proposals that they have. He said Labour remained particularly concerned about protecting any deal being done from being unpicked by a new Brexiter prime minister. On the agenda we\u2019ve maintained the discussion about entrenchment - how do we secure any deal that comes forward in the long term? Boris Johnson\u2019s threat to any deal in the future and then Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s threat this morning [see 10am] basically arguing anything could be overturned in the future - some of that discussion that will take place will be about how any deal is secure for the long term and how best to secure that, through either domestic legislation or treaty. He suggested any deal would have to be written into an EU-level text We can have greater security as a result of international agreement. It\u2019s more than being in written legislation, it\u2019s about the agreement we have with the EU. Asked if that meant reopening the binding withdrawal agreement, which the EU has repeatedly declined to do, he said: It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be reopened but there has to be some element in which an agreement can be secured in that way. We are asking for a clearer proposal on how we can have that security for the longer term. McDonnell said that remarkably little progress had been made so far on Labour\u2019s central demand for any future deal to include a permanent customs union. They are not even giving us any changes in language. But we will see what comes out of today. We have been treated to a mini-run-through of several among the likely leadership contenders to replace Theresa May at the launch of a thinktank report focusing on that favourite of Conservative navel-gazing subjects: why the party is so bad at attracting young voters. The report, by Onward, makes for alarming reading for the Tories, revealing that the \u201ctipping point\u201d age at which more people support the Conservatives rather than Labour has advanced four years \u2013 from 47 to 51 \u2013 in the last two years, since the 2017 election. The study has been endorsed by a string of several leadership hopefuls, three of whom spoke at its formal launch in Westminster: international development minister Penny Mordaunt; health secertary Matt Hancock; and Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the foreign affairs committee. Michael Gove had been due, but pulled out. While we learned nothing substantially new about what they stand for, it did become fairly apparent all of them would probably like the top job, giving what you might call wide-ranging responses to the questions on offer. One of Mordaunt\u2019s most interesting messages was to reach beyond her usual pro-leave constituency to praise remain voters for their \u201cgreatest act of patriotism\u201d in accepting the Brexit referendum result. Tugendhat, answering a question about whether the Tories needed a generational change in leader, predicted May\u2019s replacement would be \u201csomeone under 50\u201d. Coincidentally or not, Boris Johnson is 54 \u2013 and Tugendhat is 45. Hancock perhaps had the best lines, saying voting Conservative \u201cused to be something people started to think about doing when they got their first paycheck \u2013 now it\u2019s when they get their first winter fuel allowance.\u201d In another response, he said: \u201cIf we become only a Brexit party then we truly are finished.\u201d The main lesson from the event was perhaps the most obvious one: while May is still officially in Downing Street, the debate in her party is already well on to what happens once she\u2019s gone. Brexiters have a new institution to criticise today. This is from Suzanne Evans, a former Ukip deputy chair, who is complaining that the Queen gave royal assent to the Yvette Cooper bill requiring the PM to seek an article 50 extension. A few weeks ago the Telegraph claimed ministers were considering asking the Queen not to give royal assent to any bill of this kind seen as obstructing Brexit. Downing Street dismissed the story, and by the time the Cooper bill started going through the Commons last week, the proposal was no longer even being talked about. In his new book, Beyond Brexit: Britain\u2019s Unprotected Constitution, the constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor explains why Number 10 would never dream of involving the Queen. He explains: While no doubt in law there is still one constitution, what is lawful is, as we have seen, not necessarily constitutional. The Queen could lawfully refuse assent to government legislation, but that would not be constitutional. If you are seriously interested in constitutional history, Beyond Brexit is well worth reading, although Brexit events are moving so fast that already an update feels necessary. When Bogdanor wrote that passage, he was making a hypothetical point. I guess he never imagined that a few months later ministers would be floating this as an option with the Telegraph, and Brexiters would be denouncing the Queen. Downing Street has sent out this statement about Theresa May\u2019s talks with Angela Merkel. As is the norm for readouts of this kind, it tells us very little. The prime minister met with German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin this afternoon for a working lunch. Ahead of EU council tomorrow, the leaders discussed the UK\u2019s request for an extension of article 50 to June 30 with the option to bring this forward if a deal is ratified earlier. The prime minister outlined the steps the government is taking to bring the Brexit process to a successful conclusion, and updated chancellor Merkel on the ongoing discussions with the opposition. The leaders agreed on the importance of ensuring Britain\u2019s orderly withdrawal from the European Union. The leaders also discussed the ongoing situations in Yemen and Libya. Theresa May has been holding talks with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, in Berlin, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s emergency EU summit on Brexit. Later she will be flying to Paris for talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. May will be asking the leaders of the two most powerful countries in the EU to back her request for another article 50 extension, ending on 30 June. If they are not amenable to that, she will be seeking an extension on the least-onerous terms available to the UK. Britain is likely to be offered a final long extension ending on 31 December after the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, failed to convince the the bloc\u2019s capitals that Theresa May has a plan to break the Brexit impasse. Barnier has sought to intensify pressure on May to agree to the UK staying in the customs union, saying a new approach of this kind would be the sort of plan needed to justify the UK getting a long article 50 extension. (See 11.17am.) The German government has rejected a claim from Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, that Merkel might be wiling to reopen the withdrawal agreement. (See 10.32am.) Barnier also rejected the assertion. (See 11.17am.) Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has said that staying in the customs union would be \u201cthe worst of both worlds\u201d for the UK. (See 11.49am.) Mark Francois, the vice chair of the European Research Group, which represents hardline Tory Brexiters, has said the EU will regret allowing the UK to stay if it grants an article 50 extension. In a speech to the Bruges Group at lunchtime, Francois said: My message to the European council tomorrow night would be as follows: \u201cThis is the 21st century and you cannot hold a nation captive against their will. There is no point granting a temporary extension to kick the can down the road in the hope that we will finally ratify the withdrawal agreement, as we never will. \u201cIf, however, you attempt to hold us in the European Union against the democratically expressed will of the British people then, in return, we will become a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d within the EU, which would utterly derail all your attempts to pursue a more federal project. \u201cA new Conservative government, led by someone like Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab, might vote down your budget, veto your attempts at greater military integration, and generally make it impossible for you to bring about the more federal project in which you so desperately believe\u201d ... So my earnest message to the European council is simple. Brexit has already gone on long enough. If you now try to hold on to us against our will, you will be facing Perfidious Albion on speed. It would therefore be much better for all our sakes if we were to pursue our separate destinies, in a spirit of mutual respect. As Boris Johnson recently quoted Moses\u2019 warning to Pharaoh \u2013 \u201cLet my people go!\u201d As the Sun\u2019s Matt Dathan points out, at the Bruges Group event Friday was presented as the Brexit deadline, even though most observers think an article 50 extension will be agreed. In another warning to the EU, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG chair, has said that May\u2019s successor might not be bound by the assurances she gives EU leaders in Brussels tomorrow. (See 10am.) Parliament\u2019s pension fund trustees are to reconsider the rules of their investments to take account of the risk of climate change, in a first for MPs\u2019 finances. A senior Spanish diplomatic source said that Monday\u2019s events in Westminster had been reassuring but warned it was too early to talk of the mooted, year-long extension. All that was on the table at the moment, they added, was an extension until 30 June. The source also welcomed the recent talks between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, adding that it would have been good to see them happen far earlier. They played down the significance of Wednesday\u2019s pre-meeting gathering of the leaders of France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland, saying that no decision would come out of it, and that it was more of an informal meeting that the mini-summit it had been portrayed as. At the end of the day, they added, the ball remained firmly in May\u2019s court. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is adamant that Brexit cannot be delayed beyond December 2019, and will ask the other 26 EU leaders to impose compliance checks on the UK every three months during any extension, Alberto Nardello reports in a story for BuzzFeed. Theresa May spoke to her Swedish counterpart, Stefan L\u00f6fven, by telephone earlier today, Downing Street said. The call was one of a number the PM has had with EU leaders in the run-up to tomorrow\u2019s summit. More than 100 Tories are set to win council seats in local elections in England on 2 May before a single ballot is cast, provisional figures gathered by the Press Association show. Following the close of nominations last week, about 110 Conservative candidates will be elected unopposed as no other candidates are contesting the seats where they are standing. Only a handful of Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates will be elected unopposed when voting takes place at 248 councils in the biggest set of polls in the four-year cycle, the Press Association reports. More than 25,400 candidates are contesting about 8,400 council seats, according to PA\u2019s latest figures. Britain is likely to be offered a final long extension ending on 31 December after the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, failed to convince the the bloc\u2019s capitals that Theresa May has a plan to break the Brexit impasse, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. Most of the MPs who have backed the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum are opponents of Brexit who would like to see the public vote to remain. But at a People\u2019s Vote rally at lunchtime one of the speaker will be Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP and parliamentary private secretary to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who will be speaking in favour of a second referendum as a supporter of the PM\u2019s Brexit deal. Merriman is expected to say: I have fiercely opposed a second referendum. But I find myself here on this platform at this critical time for our country, because along with many more MPs on all sides of the House of Commons, I have reluctantly come to accept that the solution to the deadlock in parliament is to let the people back into this decision. A wind of change of is blowing through this debate that can clear the way to a solution. A new vote is the way to deliver the clarity we need. A new vote \u2013 whichever way it goes \u2013 must be binding on our elected leaders. A new vote is the only way to ensure a lasting settlement for our politicians and for our country too. Merriman has been told he is likely to be sacked as a PPS if he speaks in favour of a second referendum at the rally, even though he voted for a second referendum amendment when Tory MPs were given a free vote during the indicative votes debate. In an interview on the Today programme this morning he said that not being able to defend his vote in public was \u201cthe politics of the madhouse\u201d. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and John McDonnell, his Labour opposite number, are joining the cross-party talks today intended to find a Brexit compromise acceptable to the government and Labour. Both sides are having lunch together later, Downing Street said. As well as Hammond, the government team will include Michael Gove, the environment secretary, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, Greg Clark, the business secretary, and Julian Smith, the chief whip. It is well known that Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is strongly opposed to the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU. As a cabinet minister his entire life revolves around negotiating trade deals, and if the UK were to remain in the customs union, he would be largely redundant. But he has set out his objections at some length in a letter to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee. Doubtless he will not be too upset that Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen obtained a copy. The letter makes if fairly clear that Fox would resign if the cabinet were to agree to staying in the customs union as part of a compromise agreement with Labour. Here is an excerpt from Fox\u2019s letter. We would be stuck in the worst of both worlds, not only unable to set our own international trade policy, but subject, without representation, to the policy of an entity over which MPs would have no democratic control. As I said at the [1922] meeting, in such a scenario the UK would have a new role in the global trading system \u2013 we ourselves would be traded. As the famous saying in Brussels goes, if you are not at the table, you are on the menu. Fox ended his letter by saying that being outside the customs union was an \u201cabsolute prerequisite to Britain being able to benefit from ambitious UK trade and development policies\u201d. Theresa May arrived at Angela Merkel\u2019s office in Berlin on a brisk but sunny Tuesday morning at 11:57 \u2013 three minutes ahead of schedule, and while the German leader was still making her way down the stairs to the entrance. The British prime minister had to be dragged back back out on to the red carpet for the official photograph. German officials have been keen to temper British expectations ahead of the two leaders\u2019 meeting, with a government spokesperson rushing to deny media reports that Merkel is inclined to reopening the withdrawal agreement and accept a time-limit to the backstop. (See 9.35am.) \u201cThese reports are without any basis in fact,\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian. \u201cThe withdrawal agreement remains in place.\u201d May herself has insisted that the withdrawal agreement is not open to renegotiations, and the EU27 has made an extension conditional on leaving the agreement untouched. Theresa May has arrived in Berlin for her talks with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. In recent days we have seen interventions from Brexiters in London clearly designed to influence decisions taken in Brussels (eg, from Mark Francois yesterday and from Jacob Rees-Mogg on Friday and again today). But the EU can play this game too, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, seemed to be using his press conference now to dial up the pressure on Theresa May to agree to keep the UK in a customs union. He stressed that the final decision would have to be taken by EU leaders, and he did not categorically say that the EU would only agree to grant a long article 50 extension if the UK agreed to stay in a customs union. But he clearly implied this, and he did not demur when a reporter put it to him that this was what he was suggesting. (See 10.25am.) Here are the key quotes. Barnier suggested that the EU might not agree to a long article 50 extension unless Theresa May is willing to embrace a customs union. In his opening remarks, Barnier said that the EU needed a \u201ctimeline\u201d or a \u201croadmap\u201d from the UK before deciding what would happen next. He said the start of cross-party talks in London had introduced a new element in the process and then he made a point he has often made before, saying the EU could quickly and easily upgrade the political declaration to include a customs union if the UK shifted. He said: There is one point that needs to be stated quite clearly; that these ambitions, with regard to future relations, which could for example consist of adding to a free trade agreement ... for example a customs union - we are willing to improve and amend the political declaration rapidly, within a few hours or days. But the request we await and expect from the UK as a result of this cross-party dialogue is one that needs to respect the principles underlying the approach of the European council and the European parliament, and respect what we are and what we will continue to be. This is something worth recalling; we are talking about the integrity of the internal market, the decision making autonomy of the 27 and the indivisibility of the four freedoms ... That\u2019s a point that needs to be understood very clearly. And if that is the case, then we are willing straight away ... to get down to amending and improving the providing more ambition to the political declaration which will set the framework for future relations. Then Barnier suggested that the decision of this kind by the UK, to accept a customs union, was exactly the sort of \u201croadmap\u201d the EU needed to hear to justify a long extension. He said: Now, why am I stressing this particular point, and these new elements in the process which we hope will allow for a new process to emerge in the House of Commons and will allow ultimately for a new majority to emerge with regard to this agreement and this new political declaration? Why am I stressing this so much? Clearly it\u2019s because this is what would provide meaning to the request that the UK prime minister has submitted for an extension. And this is all I wish to say on this for today. Forgive me for not dwelling on this further, but this is a matter for the leaders of the European Union tomorrow. This extension has to serve a purpose. It has got to serve a purpose to provide more time if necessary to ensure that the political process I\u2019ve described can be crowned with success, and that this majority can be attained. The issue of the length of the extension, which has been discussed at great length with its possible pros and cons - I\u2019m not going to make a statement on that. From my vantage point, it is not up to me to do so. But the duration of the extension has got to in line in any case with the purpose being striven for. That is what I would say right now. It has got to serve a purpose or an aim. It is worth remembering that May is not requesting a long article 50 extension. She is only asking for one until 30 June. But the EU has refused this request once before, and it does not want the UK to remain in the EU until 30 June if European elections get cancelled in the UK, just in case the UK decides to revoke article 50 in June, leaving the UK a member of the EU but with no MEPs, and the European institutions in legal chaos. That is why many observers think the EU is more likely to offer a long extension. Barnier dismissed Andrea Leadsom\u2019s suggestion (see 9.35am) that the withdrawal agreement might be reopened. That was not going to happen, he said. Barnier said, if there was a no-deal Brexit, it would be the UK\u2019s fault, not the EU\u2019s. (See 10.21am.) Barnier says the length of an article 50 extension would have to be linked to its purpose. George Ciamba, the Romanian foreign affairs minister, says the EU will take two things into account; the fact that the UK is holding European elections, and the talks with Labour. Barnier says the EU has prepared for all options. The EU does not want to see no-deal, he says. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: There have been reports in the UK saying Angela Merkel is considering a five-year time limit to the backstop. Are those reports true? Barnier says he has no information to that effect. Q: You seem to be suggesting that it won\u2019t be enough for May to say she is in talks with the opposition. You seem to be implying that she will have to say she is open to a customs union to get a long extension. Is that right? Barnier says he can express an opinion on the customs union. At an event the other day he said he could only give an opinion on this. It was for the UK to make a choice, he says. He says he knows a lot about France, but also about big exporting countries like Germany. Germany is in the EU. But it is still a big exporting country. He says France and Germany think it is in their interests to be in a common trading block. They speak with a single voice when speaking to President Trump, or to China. He says the French and Germans see that as in their national interests. He says Labour, and some in the Conservative party, support a customs union. The British business community supports it too, he says. He says these are facts he is noting. He says Labour wants a customs union. The EU is ready for that, subject to the facts he set out. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected the first paragraph in this post because the question was about a possible five-year time limit to the backstop, not a five-year extension, as I wrongly said initially. Barnier says an orderly withdrawal has been the EU\u2019s objective, not least because of the need for talks in the second stage. The UK will remain a friend, partner and ally, he says. He says, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s summit, they have examined the way forward. He says the EU needs a timeline or roadmap from the UK. A new element is the start of cross-party discussions in London. He says at today\u2019s meeting they all expressed their hopes in respect of these talks. They all want a positive result, he says, that might allow a positive majority to emerge for a deal. If the UK wants to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, the only way to do so is on the basis of the withdrawal agreement. He says the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. That continues to be the case. The political declaration (PD) can be improved, he says, if the UK wants. He says the UK and the EU could add to the free trade agreement already proposed in the PD a customs union. This could be added rapidly, \u201cwithin a few hours or days\u201d, he says. Barnier says the EU could rewrite the political declaration \u201cwithin hours or days\u201d if the UK chose a customs union. But the request they await from the UK will have to respect that the EU is. He says he is talking about the integrity of the single market, the autonomy of the EU27 and the indivisibility of the four freedoms. He says the EU is not willing to compromise on the ecosystem behind the single market. Why is is stressing that the PD could be rewritten? Because that would provide meaning to an extension, he says. He says he does not want to say more, because this is a matter for EU leaders at the summit tomorrow. He says the duration of an extension has to be in line with the purpose behind it. Barnier suggests the EU might not grant a long article 50 extension unless May backs a customs union. He says a no-deal Brexit would never be the responsibility of the EU. If the UK wants to stop no-deal, it can, by revoking article 50. Barnier says, if there is a no-deal, it will be the UK\u2019s fault, not the EU\u2019s. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, goes next. He says for two years he has enjoyed the trust of President Juncker, President Tusk and the European council. He has attempted to operate \u201cmethodically and calmly\u2019, he says. He says he has proceeded in an orderly fashion. The EU\u2019s guidelines reflect a desire to be united, he says. He is a worker, hopefully a qualified worker, on behalf of the EU27, nurturing unity. He says they have been defending the European Union, and its foundations. The UK is familiar with these, he says, because of the single market (which the UK helped to establish). The EU is holding a press conference after today\u2019s general affairs council. George Ciamba, the Romanian foreign affairs minister, goes first. He says the discussions focused on Theresa May\u2019s request for an extension. He says that most colleagues said prolonging article 50 was an instrument, not a plan. The UK would have to provide a clear plan to justify an extension, he says. He says his fellow ministers welcomed the UK\u2019s decision to hold European elections, he says. He says that no-deal remains a possibility. He says everybody in the room was united behind the idea that the withdrawal agreement is the best possible agreement and the only possible agreement. Talking of Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, who chairs the European Research Group, has been engaged in more Twitter diplomacy this morning, warning the EU that Theresa May\u2019s successor might not be bound by the assurances she gives EU leaders in Brussels tomorrow. EU ministers have been attending a meeting of the EU\u2019s general affairs council in Luxembourg this morning where Brexit has been on the agenda ahead of the summit tomorrow. Several of them stressed that any article 50 extension would come with conditions attached as they spoke to reporters on their way in. Michael Roth, the German Europe minister, said the situation was \u201cvery, very frustrating\u201d. He said the EU would consider Theresa May\u2019s request for an extension lasting just until 30 June, but also perhaps for a \u201clonger one, but this must also be subject to very strict criteria.\u201d Amelie de Montchalin, the French Europe minister, said: We want to understand what the UK needs this extension for, and what are the political surroundings around Theresa May to have this extension. And then comes the question of the conditions of what role we\u2019d want the UK to play during this extension time. And Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, said: No-deal in my view would be an an extraordinary failure of politics and we need to ensure that that doesn\u2019t happen. But of course there needs to be a real plan to go with a request for an extension - that\u2019s credible - in order for that extension to be agreed over the next three days, and I think that\u2019s likely to happen. Any conditions would be designed to ensure that the UK did not disrupt the EU if allowed to stay, as the Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg said it should in a tweet on Friday that received a lot of attention in Brussels. Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said this morning that Theresa May would have explain why delaying Brexit would lead to the withdrawal agreement being passed for EU leaders to agree to an article 50 extension. He told Franceinfo TV: There is need for clarity on why the delay and how it will in the end facilitate an agreement. Asked whether a no-deal was inevitable if May failed, Le Maire replied: I prefer an agreement. But Theresa May should give us the reasons why she wants the delay and these reasons must be credible. Andrea Leadsom, the Brexiter leader of the Commons, told reporters when she was doorstepped outside her home this morning that she hoped Angela Merkel would agree to support the idea of the withdrawal agreement being renegotiated. Leadsom said: The prime minister is off to see Angela Merkel today. And what I think would be fantastic is if Angela Merkel will try to support a proper UK Brexit by agreeing to reopen the withdrawal agreement. There have been rumours over the weekend that some senior members of the German government would be willing to do that in order to get Theresa May\u2019s deal across the line ...If we could get the prime minister\u2019s deal over the line because the EU have decided to support measures on the backstop, then that would be the best possible outcome. It was not clear what Leadsom was referring to, but she may have been inspired by this tweet from her fellow Tory Brexiter Greg Hands. Some Tory Brexiters still cling to the belief that, in response to a bit more pressure from the UK, the EU will agree to re-open the withdrawal agreement and amend it to give the UK a legally-binding right to leave it unilaterally. But EU leaders have repeatedly ruled this out, and Downing Street accepts this and has long since given up asking for changes of this kind. So why is Leadsom raising this as a possibility? It is either extreme wishful thinking or - what is much more likely - she wants to reassure Brexiters in the Tory party that she has not given up on the fight for backstop rewrite. (Leadsom was runner up in the leadership contest in 2016 and has not ruled out trying again.) Tomorrow night EU leaders will decide whether to grant the UK another article 50 extension, delaying Brexit. If they say no, the UK will have to leave at 11pm on Friday. Another extension is likely, but it may come with some unpalatable conditions. This afternoon MPs will debate Theresa May\u2019s proposal for an extension lasting until 30 June. But the UK won\u2019t even be in the room when the EU27 decide their offer, and today May will be visiting Berlin and Paris to speak to Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron to press her case. In a speech in 2016 during the EU referendum campaign Michael Gove, the co-leader of Vote Leave who is now environment secretary, declared: \u201cThe day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want.\u201d Today, as May visits Germany and France in the role of supplicant, she will demonstrate quite how monumentally wrong Gove\u2019s prediction turned out to be. Here is a preview story from my colleague Daniel Boffey. And here is a Guardian analysis of what Berlin and Paris are both looking for. Merkel and Macron, and other EU leaders, want the UK to agree a Brexit deal, and they will be asking May about the chances of her talks with Labour producing a compromise solution that could get through parliament. But this morning on the Today programme David Gauke, the justice secretary, did not raise hopes that a breakthrough was imminent. Asked if there would be an agreement with Labour in the next 24 hours, he replied: I\u2019m not going to make a prediction in terms of where we are going to get to. But, from what I hear, both sides - I certainly know our side - are keen to engage, but I\u2019m hearing that about the Labour side as well. So I hope we can make progress. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am (UK time): Theresa May meets Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, in Berlin. 11am: The EU holds a briefing on consumer and employment rights after Brexit. 11.30am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 12pm: Cabinet ministers Matt Hancock, Penny Mordaunt and Michael Gove, and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, speak at the launch of a report from the thinktank Onward on the age gap in politics. Given the line-up, it is being seen a effectively a hustings for the forthcoming Tory leadership contest. 12pm: Tory Brexiters Mark Francois, Andrew Bridgen and Anne Marie Morris speak at a Bruges Group event headed \u201cNo delay, no capitulation - no deal\u201d. (Note: this is not seen by lobby journalists as a parade of leadership contenders.) Afternoon: MPs will debate a government motion saying the PM should seek an article 50 extension lasting until 30 June. This debate is taking place because of the Yvette Cooper bill that received royal assent last night. 5pm (UK time): May meets Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in Paris. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

It then refers to some countries being more \u201cgenerous\u201d than others, citing Slovakia and France as differing examples.</p> <p>This ignores significant variation in systems and legislation at EU country level regarding freedom of movement and implies that some countries are more \u201cgenerous\u201d by choice. Such differences merely reflect those in national systems.</p> <p>Pre-Brexit, the UK did not require EU nationals to register or apply for residency to become self-employed. In Slovakia, they were awarded permanent residency when they applied for residency, enabling them to access the same rights as Slovak nationals under freedom of movement. In France, permanent residency was not required in such circumstances.</p> <p>EU27 countries were encouraged to ensure UK nationals could continue working and living in the EU after Brexit, and recent legislation in France and Slovakia does exactly that.</p> <p>UK nationals in Slovakia will keep the permanent residency they were entitled to as EU citizens.</p> <p>UK nationals in France were advised to apply for residency permits pending citizenship. Many are teachers and therefore civil servants, a status restricted under French law to French and EU citizens. Measures drafted by the French senate stated they would lose that status after Brexit, but the French national assembly voted otherwise, contradicting suggestions that France might be less \u201cgenerous\u201d than other EU27 countries.</p> <p>EU27 countries are dealing with Brexit fallout as best they can.

      "bodyText": "Your article (Leaked file shows contrasts for Britons in EU after no-deal Brexit, 4 April) quotes \u201ca leaked EU document\u201d that \u201cpresents a hotchpotch of attitudes among the EU27\u201d towards UK nationals. It then refers to some countries being more \u201cgenerous\u201d than others, citing Slovakia and France as differing examples. This ignores significant variation in systems and legislation at EU country level regarding freedom of movement and implies that some countries are more \u201cgenerous\u201d by choice. Such differences merely reflect those in national systems. Pre-Brexit, the UK did not require EU nationals to register or apply for residency to become self-employed. In Slovakia, they were awarded permanent residency when they applied for residency, enabling them to access the same rights as Slovak nationals under freedom of movement. In France, permanent residency was not required in such circumstances. EU27 countries were encouraged to ensure UK nationals could continue working and living in the EU after Brexit, and recent legislation in France and Slovakia does exactly that. UK nationals in Slovakia will keep the permanent residency they were entitled to as EU citizens. UK nationals in France were advised to apply for residency permits pending citizenship. Many are teachers and therefore civil servants, a status restricted under French law to French and EU citizens. Measures drafted by the French senate stated they would lose that status after Brexit, but the French national assembly voted otherwise, contradicting suggestions that France might be less \u201cgenerous\u201d than other EU27 countries. EU27 countries are dealing with Brexit fallout as best they can. Establishing poorly assessed hierarchies of \u201cgenerosity\u201d is ill-judged at this point.

In extraordinary circumstances, the bill devised by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Oliver Letwin passed its final stages in the House of Lords on Monday night and was approved by the Commons that evening. The swift passage of the bill, which took just three sitting days to complete, was made possible by the success of an unprecedented amendment which allowed MPs to seize control of parliamentary business on particular days, meaning the government could not block its progress. The EU Withdrawal (No 5) Act received royal assent just after 11pm on Monday night, forcing the prime minister to extend the article 50 process and to set out the length of the extension in the Commons on Tuesday. The Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, said the government would no longer block the progress of the bill after it was passed by the Lords on Monday evening, but she called it a \u201chuge dog\u2019s dinner\u201d and criticised how little time for debate the bill had been given. The Commons passed the final stage of the bill by 392 votes to 85 \u2013 a majority of 307. May has already pledged to seek an extension until 30 June but the government opposed the legislation, fearing the precedent it would set for backbenchers to be able to pass bills. Under the terms of the new act, the government must table a motion to agree the length of extension the prime minister will seek from the EU. On Monday night, in the wake of the bill\u2019s approval, the government tabled its motion setting out May\u2019s intention to seek an extension until 30 June. That is set to be debated \u2013 and potentially amended \u2013 in the Commons on Tuesday.

At the end of it, May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/02/theresa-may-calls-for-talks-with-jeremy-corbyn-in-bid-to-save-brexit\">announced a big shift</a>: she would enter into talks with Jeremy Corbyn to break the deadlock, and if the two of them failed to find a compromise she would let parliament decide a binding way forward.</p> <p>The move was not popular with some in her own party: the prospect of a softer Brexit \u2013 particularly with a customs union \u2013 and long delay, requiring Britain to hold European parliamentary elections, prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/02/i-fear-for-brexit-erg-dismayed-by-may-plan-to-talk-to-corbyn\">prompted outrage</a> among the hardline ERG group. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/theresa-may-warned-brexit-pact-with-corbyn-could-tear-tories-apart\">Two ministers quit</a> and there were predictions Brexit would tear the Conservative party apart.</p> <p>After two days of talks, May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/05/donald-tusk-will-tell-eu-to-back-brexit-flextension-for-uk\">asked Donald Tusk</a>, the president of the European council, for a delay until 30 June, promising to plan for the elections but hoping that a cross-party agreement before 22 May would mean she would not have to hold them. (The government has confirmed it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/apr/08/brexit-latest-news-live-theresa-may-union-most-likely-outcome-if-labour-and-government-can-compromise-says-minister-live-news?page=with:block-5cab81d38f08bc7376ae9414#block-5cab81d38f08bc7376ae9414\">is indeed preparing</a> for the elections.) Labour said May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/05/labour-says-may-unable-to-compromise-as-brexit-talks-stall\">might not be willing to compromise enough</a> ever to reach a deal.</p> <p>Tory Brexiters continued to bash the cross-party talks, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/07/andrea-leadsom-no-deal-brexit-next-week-would-not-be-so-grim\">Andrea Leadsom rejecting a long extension</a> and saying no deal would \u201cnot be so grim\u201d. The education minister Nadhim Zahawi said taking part in European elections, as required under a long extension, would pose an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/06/tory-mp-nadhim-zahawi-says-joining-in-eu-elections-would-be-conservative-party-suicide-note\">\u201cexistential threat\u201d</a> to the party.</p> <p>Facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/07/theresa-may-brexit-cabinet-in-the-dark-over-plans-critical-eu-summit\">intense cabinet pressure to avoid a long delay</a>, May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/08/theresa-may-unplugged-new-laid-back-pm-speaks-from-the-sofa\">released a homespun video</a> calling for a compromise solution, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/08/theresa-may-resume-talks-labour-find-brexit-compromise\">talks resumed again on Monday</a> in a last-ditch effort to find an agreement before Wednesday\u2019s emergency EU summit.</p> <p>In Brussels and the other EU27 capitals, meanwhile, there was some disagreement over how to proceed. Tusk pushed for a longer one-year delay, as did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/eu-leaders-urged-to-refuse-may-appeal-for-further-brexit-delay\">Jean-Claude Juncker</a>, the European commission president, who said that the end of this week \u2013 12 April \u2013 should be the \u201cultimate deadline\u201d for MPs to pass a deal.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, pleading the case for a longer extension, said the EU must be \u201cpatient and understanding\u201d with Britain. Germany would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/04/angela-merkel-back-action-avoid-hard-border-ireland\">do all it could</a> to prevent a no deal and avert a hard Irish border, she said.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s weekly Brexit briefing, trying to make sense of the nonsensical since June 2016. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And catch our monthly Brexit Means podcast here. Top stories So, this really is crunch time \u2013 at least until the next one. We last left you heading for that seven-hour cabinet lock-in, at which Theresa May and her ministers fought to find a way out of the Brexit impasse. At the end of it, May announced a big shift: she would enter into talks with Jeremy Corbyn to break the deadlock, and if the two of them failed to find a compromise she would let parliament decide a binding way forward. The move was not popular with some in her own party: the prospect of a softer Brexit \u2013 particularly with a customs union \u2013 and long delay, requiring Britain to hold European parliamentary elections, prompted prompted outrage among the hardline ERG group. Two ministers quit and there were predictions Brexit would tear the Conservative party apart. After two days of talks, May asked Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, for a delay until 30 June, promising to plan for the elections but hoping that a cross-party agreement before 22 May would mean she would not have to hold them. (The government has confirmed it is indeed preparing for the elections.) Labour said May might not be willing to compromise enough ever to reach a deal. Tory Brexiters continued to bash the cross-party talks, with Andrea Leadsom rejecting a long extension and saying no deal would \u201cnot be so grim\u201d. The education minister Nadhim Zahawi said taking part in European elections, as required under a long extension, would pose an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the party. Facing intense cabinet pressure to avoid a long delay, May released a homespun video calling for a compromise solution, and talks resumed again on Monday in a last-ditch effort to find an agreement before Wednesday\u2019s emergency EU summit. In Brussels and the other EU27 capitals, meanwhile, there was some disagreement over how to proceed. Tusk pushed for a longer one-year delay, as did Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, who said that the end of this week \u2013 12 April \u2013 should be the \u201cultimate deadline\u201d for MPs to pass a deal. Angela Merkel, pleading the case for a longer extension, said the EU must be \u201cpatient and understanding\u201d with Britain. Germany would do all it could to prevent a no deal and avert a hard Irish border, she said. But France played it tougher, saying no delay should be granted without a concrete plan that had clear parliamentary support. As the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the EU27 were unlikely to veto a delay to the process and that any member state that did so \u201cwouldn\u2019t be forgiven\u201d, it emerged that May would visit Berlin and Paris on Tuesday \u2013 the day before the summit \u2013 to persuade Merkel and Emmanuel Macron of the need for a short extension. Meanwhile, Tory backbenchers pursued a fresh attempt to oust May by indicative votes. Oh, and MPs passed by just one vote a draft law tabled by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative MP Oliver Letwin instructing May to seek an article 50 extension and avoid a no-deal Brexit. Despite some impressive filibustering, the bill was eventually given an unopposed third reading in the Lords and now goes back to the Commons, where the government will schedule time for debate once it gets royal assent this evening. What next May faces a familiar problem: by Wednesday she must present the EU27 with a credible reason for wanting a second short Brexit delay, but every reason she could give risks splitting her party. Without a new date, the UK is due to leave without a deal on Friday. But there seems little immediate prospect of the prime minister reaching a Brexit agreement with Labour, which sees little electoral advantage in such a pact. Tusk has floated the idea of a \u201cflextension\u201d, a longer delay with an option to leave as soon as the withdrawal agreement is ratified by the Commons. But this, or any long postponement, could run into problems with some member states and is hugely unpopular with leave-minded (and even many moderate) Conservatives. In the end, May could be forced to turn to parliament. If Cooper\u2019s bill gains royal assent this week, parliament will get time to decide what length of extension May should request, taking the decision out of the prime minister\u2019s hands.

The overall result in the 2016 EU referendum was tight (51.89% voted leave versus 48.11% remain), but on the coast the leave vote had been particularly strong \u2013 leave won a majority in more than 100 of about 120 parliamentary constituencies with a coastline. I wanted to know more about the people who delivered that result.</p> <p>The trip was a revelation. First, people were often surprised to be asked their views, saying they felt they weren\u2019t important enough for anyone in London to ask. People plied me with tea, biscuits and sandwiches, took me on tractor rides and to the bingo and made a few jokey marriage proposals.

      "bodyText": "The thing about an old rusty tractor, said Tony McClure, a cockle picker, was that even in the sea air it would start. His was parked out on the tidal flats of Flookburgh sands in Morecambe Bay, braving the salty shallows during an unusually warm February dawn. A model of a trawler is displayed in the window of a house in Sunderland Point, Morecambe Bay He was comparing old tractors to modern ones, and I was well aware of what he was talking about. The tide here comes in fast: if you\u2019re not careful it can swamp a vehicle. So you want be certain to get off that seabed. Tony McClure picking cockles, Flookburgh sands, Morecambe Bay McClure, 39, was one of the first people I met on a February-March assignment around England\u2019s coastline, where I was photographing and talking to people who had voted to leave the European Union. Like most of the 50 or so people I met and spoke to while travelling from Morecambe in Lancashire to St Agnes in Cornwall, McClure wanted Britain to get out of the EU. Most spoke as if they felt tricked by Brussels and trapped in a world that was turning against them. \u201cThey\u2019ve wound us in their little web, with their laws and suchlike as that, and they rule us,\u201d said John Eldin, a 77-year-old on the east coast. Tony Brown, 59, having a pint in Barrow-in-Furness, said: \u201cThey block anything that we want.\u201d Former nurse Tom Morris in Brighton I\u2019d embarked on the journey because, looking at the UK from Ireland, I\u2019d noticed something about the coastal areas. The overall result in the 2016 EU referendum was tight (51.89% voted leave versus 48.11% remain), but on the coast the leave vote had been particularly strong \u2013 leave won a majority in more than 100 of about 120 parliamentary constituencies with a coastline. I wanted to know more about the people who delivered that result. The trip was a revelation. First, people were often surprised to be asked their views, saying they felt they weren\u2019t important enough for anyone in London to ask. People plied me with tea, biscuits and sandwiches, took me on tractor rides and to the bingo and made a few jokey marriage proposals. Most said they still wanted to get out of Europe. A boat at low tide in the marshland at Sunderland Point Their reasons were more individual and varied than I expected. Some wanted to revive a nostalgic rosy past or keep immigrants out. Some thought they were taking back control, some wanted an end to the EU bureaucracy that they saw as hurting their livelihoods, and some thought it was time London paid attention to smaller voices. A full English breakfast made of sweets for sale in Skegness; Dana Marie Ovington, who would have voted leave if she had been old enough, plays bingo at Coronation Hall in Skegness An amusement arcade in Skegness Others had more concrete goals: a grandmother in Skegness hoped that the decline of her town, designated the most deprived seaside area in Britain in a study by the Office for National Statistics in 2013, might be slowed down if taxpayers\u2019 funds stopped heading to Europe. And people like Margaret Owen, a fisherwoman, wanted better leaders. \u201cWe need to stand on our own two feet, we\u2019re a capable country,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people that we trusted in and that we voted for, and that we thought could carry our hopes and dreams through, have let the whole country down.\u201d Margaret Owen fishing at Sunderland Point It was the off season, and as I arrived on the east coast a storm was on the way. Seaside towns are notoriously seasonal, but people living in towns on England\u2019s coast are more likely than average to suffer from deprivation, a government study from 2015 found. From the rusting remains of Redcar\u2019s steelworks to the windswept skeleton of a fairground shut for the winter in Skegness, people I met said all they wanted was to find a way to make a living.
