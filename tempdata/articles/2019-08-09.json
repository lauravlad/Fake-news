At the time none of this was thought likely, but someone in the SNP seems to have a crystal ball, and the Scottish government therefore has a clear mandate for a second independence referendum.</p> <p>It is reasonable for the Labour party both north and south of the border to be in favour of keeping the union and to campaign for that.

      "bodyText": "At the time of the last elections for the Scottish parliament in 2016, the position of the SNP was that if a Conservative government was elected at the next UK general election, and if there was a referendum on EU membership, and if the UK voted to leave and Scotland did not, then that would constitute a change of circumstances sufficient to trigger a second referendum on Scottish independence. At the time none of this was thought likely, but someone in the SNP seems to have a crystal ball, and the Scottish government therefore has a clear mandate for a second independence referendum. It is reasonable for the Labour party both north and south of the border to be in favour of keeping the union and to campaign for that. If they are democrats it is not reasonable for them to deny a second vote. Incidentally, Ruth Davidson is on the record, after the Brexit vote, as saying it would be most unwise of the UK government to deny Scotland a second referendum, but that was before they did just that, and she has since built her career on a \u201cno second vote\u201d position. I live in Scotland and, like Simon Jenkins (Independence for Scotland is inevitable \u2013 we need a plan for it, 9 August), would vote for independence tomorrow, given the opportunity. Westminster is corrupt, undemocratic and not fit for purpose. In Scotland we have a modern parliament elected by proportional representation. If we were independent we would have a written constitution too. It is not perfect but it is streets better than Westminster. Voters in the rest of the UK should be demanding all these things.

Even worse, her assertion that she has no intention to \u201crestructure society\u201d, even though scholars argue a government-backed redistribution of wealth is necessary for racial equality, makes Harris sound more like Joe Biden than Shirley Chisholm, after whom she has fashioned herself. While she may be able to make distinctions between herself and Joe Biden on civil rights, her brand of economic moderation is in some ways more dangerous. Appealing to black women superficially, without the substance to back it, gives her enough legitimacy to win black women over while offering little in return. This leaves progressive black women in the awkward position of not critiquing her so that she gets the nomination, which becomes not critiquing her so she wins the general election, which turns into leaving her presidency unchallenged so she can govern. While protecting the career of a single black politician, black women as a whole are likely to face unabated, growing inequality. We can\u2019t afford the four years of piecemeal moderation that Kamala Harris offers, and we have the debt to prove it.
