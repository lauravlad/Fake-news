In the recent European election, Plaid Cymru \u2013 the party that would presumably deliver a grateful nation from its servitude \u2013 won 19.6% of the vote. The Brexit party won 32.5%. If there is a silent majority in Wales in favour of simultaneous secession from the union with the Saeson and perpetuation of the one with the European project, its silence is deafening. Measurable support for Welsh independence has never been more than anaemic. Dafydd Elis-Thomas, the veteran Plaid Cymru politician, once described the prospect as a mirage.

Have they forgotten that Japan has New Zealand on its doorstep? Quite apart from any tariffs, whenever a trade deal could be negotiated, the price of Welsh lamb would be increased by the long-distance costs of refrigerated transit. Not to mention the effects on global warming.</p> <p>It would be no consolation to farmers \u2013 or anyone else likely to lose their jobs \u2013 that \u201cthey voted leave in 2016 so it would be undemocratic for them to be allowed to change their minds.\u201d Besides which, the government refuses to acknowledge that a no-deal outcome does not, and never did, have a mandate. The propaganda at the time meant most people expected not only a deal but a favourable deal.

On average, the Japanese consume 0.1kg of lamb a year compared with 15.4kg of pork. A survey by the trade body Meat and Livestock Australia showed that 35% of Japanese consumers don\u2019t know how to cook lamb and 47% are unfamiliar with it. For good or bad, lamb is very unpopular in Japan being widely described as \u201cstinky\u201d. Moreover, 40% of what little lamb is eaten in Japan is already imported from the nearer suppliers Australia and New Zealand.</p> <p>Post-Brexit policy is being made on the hoof and is based on a fantasy.

In the recent European election, Plaid Cymru \u2013 the party that would presumably deliver a grateful nation from its servitude \u2013 won 19.6% of the vote. The Brexit party won 32.5%. If there is a silent majority in Wales in favour of simultaneous secession from the union with the Saeson and perpetuation of the one with the European project, its silence is deafening. Measurable support for Welsh independence has never been more than anaemic. Dafydd Elis-Thomas, the veteran Plaid Cymru politician, once described the prospect as a mirage. It has always been so, and is highly likely to remain so. Deri Hughes London \u2022 I hope Welsh farmers were reassured by the government\u2019s assertions that they will be able to offset a \u201cno deal\u201d loss of trade with new markets like Japan (Sheep farmers left in dark over how they can avoid no-deal catastrophe, 13 July). Have they forgotten that Japan has New Zealand on its doorstep? Quite apart from any tariffs, whenever a trade deal could be negotiated, the price of Welsh lamb would be increased by the long-distance costs of refrigerated transit. Not to mention the effects on global warming. It would be no consolation to farmers \u2013 or anyone else likely to lose their jobs \u2013 that \u201cthey voted leave in 2016 so it would be undemocratic for them to be allowed to change their minds.\u201d Besides which, the government refuses to acknowledge that a no-deal outcome does not, and never did, have a mandate. The propaganda at the time meant most people expected not only a deal but a favourable deal. Boris Johnson should live up to his promises or give us another vote on \u201cno deal\u201d. Gloria Brown Llaneglwys, Powys \u2022 Alun Cairns, the secretary of state for Wales, claimed UK farmers could export their sheep and lamb to Japan instead of Europe in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This scarcely believable statement epitomises the lack of understanding of a no-deal solution. The extra cost of shipping to Japan will be huge and totally illogical when our prime markets are a short distance from Dover, and many major EU cities are within only a few hours\u2019 distribution, covering 100 million-plus customers. It puzzles me that we can so readily ignore our EU customers and the impact it has on UK economy, the jobs in the supply and distribution chain and on the livelihood of many in the farming industry. John Kelly Liverpool \u2022 The suggestion by Alun Cairns that sheep farmers can compensate for the loss of their major EU markets by exporting lamb to Japan is unfounded and economically illiterate, 13 July). Lamb is not a traditional part of the Japanese diet, which is dominated by fish and plant-based foods. On average, the Japanese consume 0.1kg of lamb a year compared with 15.4kg of pork. A survey by the trade body Meat and Livestock Australia showed that 35% of Japanese consumers don\u2019t know how to cook lamb and 47% are unfamiliar with it. For good or bad, lamb is very unpopular in Japan being widely described as \u201cstinky\u201d. Moreover, 40% of what little lamb is eaten in Japan is already imported from the nearer suppliers Australia and New Zealand. Post-Brexit policy is being made on the hoof and is based on a fantasy. Time to give it the chop.

But sadly this seems far less plausible than a political downward spiral, with acrimony over money and the Irish border meaning negotiations go backwards before they can go forwards.

In an optimistic scenario, the shock of no deal will bring both sides back to the table with strong incentives from domestic constituencies to find a way through. But sadly this seems far less plausible than a political downward spiral, with acrimony over money and the Irish border meaning negotiations go backwards before they can go forwards. And even when serious talking begins, the UK will be a third country. No article 50 and no withdrawal agreement means a lengthier and messier process. So there\u2019s no point shooting the messenger. When Carney \u2013 or other economists \u2013 say no deal will damage the UK economy but that it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to say just how much, he\u2019s not a \u201cgloomster\u201d but simply stating the obvious. And when he says that while the Bank (and the Treasury) can help cushion the immediate impacts but sorting out the mess afterwards will be up to the politicians, he\u2019s not passing the buck but making clear that if politicians take us down that road, they will bear a heavy responsibility. \u2022 Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe.

But I think this has wider national significance. Not only does it cut Boris Johnson\u2019s majority to just one and show that there isn\u2019t a mandate for his no deal Brexit.

She said such an outcome would have a devastating impact on the rural economy as tariffs on lamb exports would put many sheep farmers out of business. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is not surprising that people here have sent a very clear message to Boris Johnson that he needs to change his plan,\u201d she said.</p> \n  <p>Swinson admitted that LibDems played the system by persuading the Greens and Plaid Cymru to pull out of the byelection to allow her party a clear run at the seat.</p> \n  <p>She said: \u201cI do genuinely say thank you to Plaid and the Greens.

And this comes off the back of our best of our local election results and storming victories in the European elections where we beat both the Conservatives and the Labour parties to our best ever European election results too.

It clearly made a difference, giving Tories something positive to vote for and, more importantly in a 52:48 per cent Brexit split constituency, he had a renewed focus on taking the UK out of the EU on October 31. The Conservatives returned in this by-election to the party of leave and therefore Brexit, in a successful strategy to squeeze the Brexit Party vote. Boris becoming Prime Minister even for just over a week but with a new Brexit delivery agenda, injected an element of uncertainty into proceedings right up to the announcement of the result. In just over a week Boris moved his party from a position of no hope to coming close to victory.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d43cf138f08c7e177d43263\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-02T05:50:44.028Z\">6.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A reminder from the Guardian\u2019s <strong>Hannah Jane Parkinson </strong>about the circumstances that led to yesterday\u2019s byelection.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ladyhaja/status/1157154043594018817\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">it will never not be funny that Chris Davies, after being found guilty of expenses fraud and voted out by circa 20% of his constituents on petition, chose to stand again. <a href=\"https://t.co/2TdeRW5qfK\">https://t.co/2TdeRW5qfK</a></p>\u2014 Hannah Jane Parkinson (@ladyhaja) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladyhaja/status/1157154043594018817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d43ccd18f084f687f34f25b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-02T05:43:07.442Z\">6.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In case you missed it yesterday,<strong> Sonia Sodha</strong><strong>\u2019s </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/01/no-deal-preparations-britain-boris-johnson-eu\">comment piece</a> on the government\u2019s announcement of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/31/labour-attacks-appalling-waste-as-johnson-adds-2bn-no-deal-brexit-fund\">\u00a32.1bn for no-deal planning</a> is well worth a read.

The Lib Dems won 13,826 votes with the Tories taking 12,401, a margin of 1,425 that overturned the Tories\u2019 previous majority of more than 8,000. Veteran MP Frank Field has announced that he will be standing as an independent in the next election. Field resigned the Labour whip after 39 years as the party\u2019s MP in Birkenhead last August, following a vote of no confidence from constituency members. He will run as a \u201cBirkenhead Social Justice\u201d candidate. Here is a quick roundup of his career to date. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has been accused of \u201cmisleading the public\u201d over no-deal Brexit and bringing the post of Foreign Secretary \u201cinto disrepute\u201d. Labour former Foreign Office minister Ben Bradshaw has written to Raab calling on him to apologise for claiming that the prospect of a no-deal exit from the European Union was \u201cwidely discussed and considered a realistic prospect during the 2016 EU referendum\u201d. Earlier this week the Guardian looked at what exactly had been said during the referendum campaign \u2013 Sean Kemp, a former Lib Dem head of media and Downing Street special adviser, has written for the Guardian cautioning against taking the result in Brecon and Radnorshire for grated. I don\u2019t know what god Lib Dem HQ was praying to in order to get a contest against a Conservative candidate who had just lost a recall petition after admitting fiddling his expenses, but I\u2019d suggest they build it a bigger shrine. Throw in other remain parties not standing and we shouldn\u2019t pretend that anything other than a Lib Dem victory here would have been a shock. But if there\u2019s a danger in over-interpreting one result, there\u2019s also a risk that the current relative good fortune being enjoyed by the Lib Dems is taken for granted. Received wisdom now appears to be that with a strong remain message and the Labour and Conservative parties apparently vacating the centre ground, everything is now theirs for the taking \u2013 and that it was always thus. Yet it\u2019s worth remembering that six months ago the very same received wisdom was that the party was possibly doomed. Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, has compiled this roundup of opinions on our new prime minister from politicians on the continent. \u201cLike many people, I was easily charmed by his demeanour, his self-confidence, his intelligence,\u201d said Han ten Broeke, a former Dutch MP specialising in EU affairs. \u201cHe\u2019s a pleasure to listen to. I have a soft spot for Britain, and Boris was one reason why.\u201d Ten Broeke has since revised his opinion. \u201cThe charm, the intellect, the confidence \u2013 it all now looks a lot like over-confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cA promise of simple solutions to complex problems. And it could have disastrous consequences.\u201d Field has published 10 immediate priorities for Birkenhead, which include eliminating child poverty and youth unemployment. He said he was working on a manifesto, shaped by the views of constituents, in preparation for a snap general election. Frank Field has announced that he will stand at next general election as a \u201cBirkenhead Social Justice\u201d candidate. He was a Labour MP for 39 years before resigning the party whip last August. Field said in a statement: It is a privilege to serve as Birkenhead\u2019s MP \u2013 as it has been every day for the past 40 years. It is ultimately a sovereign decision for the people of the town to decide who they wish to represent them in the House of Commons. I will be standing again as a candidate at the next election with the aim of doing what I have done for 40 years: always putting the interests of our town and our country first while championing the views and interests of the underdogs in our society. While we\u2019re waiting for the Frank Field announcement (see here), here\u2019s a bit of a recap \u2013 77-year-old Field has been MP for Birkenhead since 1979. While he was briefly minister for welfare reform in Tony Blair\u2019s government (May 1997 til July 1998 ), he resigned following disagreements with the then social security secretary Harriet Harman and returned to the back benches where he continued to be critical of the government. He is considered to be on the right of the party and in 2010 David Cameron made him his poverty tsar. Field was elected chair of the work and pensions select committee in 2015, where he has been a fierce critic of universal credit. In August 2018 he resigned the Labour party whip, citing anti-semitism in the party, after losing a vote of no confidence by members in his constituency. He subsequently described himself as an \u201cindependent Labour MP\u201d. Field is a eurosceptic and sided with Theresa May\u2019s government in numerous Brexit votes. Jane Dodds echoed the warning of the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, that these were dangerous times for the union. She said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats are a party that want to stay as part of the United Kingdom. We want to stay in Europe. We see that as healthy for our communities. We have to stay in Europe and we have to stay in this bigger team.\u201d Turning to the farming, a key issue during the by-election campaign, she said: \u201cOctober, November and December are peak times to sell Welsh lamb. There are two issues for farmers \u2013 firstly, how are they going to cope with 40% tariffs on their lamb exports. The second is mental health. Farming is the profession with the highest suicide rate. These are real concerns.\u201d She called for Boris Johnson to return to Wales and have proper discussions with farmers. \u201cI want him to come and have really robust discussion with our farmers here.\u201d Asked if there will be constituencies where the Lib Dems will not stand at the next general election to clear the way for Plaid Cymru or the Greens, she said: \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly be having those discussions. It\u2019s too early to say at the moment. We want to reach out across political divides to find ways of working together. I will be looking for opportunities for that to happen.\u201d She rejected the idea that it was awkward representing a constituency that voted to leave the EU. \u201cI\u2019m here for everybody whether they voted for remain or Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were always up front about being the party of remain.\u201d Frank Field, the pro-Brexit former Labour minister who now sits as an independent MP is due to make an announcement \u201con his political future\u201d in the next hour. He will make a statement at Birkenhead Town Hall at noon followed by a question and answer session. Jo Swinson has said the byelection result could pave the way for more cross-party cooperation between pro-remain parties. She said: \u201cWe achieved a 12% swing overturning a majority of 8,000 in a seat that voted to leave the European Union. This is a stunning victory. Of course I am appreciative of Plaid and the Greens taking the step they did.\u201d Asked if this \u201cremain alliance\u201d would continue, she said: \u201cAbsolutely. In most constituencies across the country it will be the Liberal Democrats that are the strongest party of remain but we recognise the value in co-operating with others for that wider national goal to protect our country\u2019s future. I think this may well be a feature of future elections. We need to be grown up about that. Grown up co-operation across parties with the national interest will continue.\u201d Swinson also rejected the idea that Dodds had deliberately not talked much about Brexit during the campaign. She said: \u201cI absolutely heard her talking about stopping a no-deal Brexit. Farmers in this area talked to her about their concerns when we\u2019re looking at 40% tariffs on lamb exports.\u201d The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has been accused of \u201cmisleading the public\u201d over no-deal Brexit and bringing the post of Foreign Secretary \u201cinto disrepute\u201d. Labour former Foreign Office minister Ben Bradshaw has written to Raab calling on him to apologise for remarks on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this week. He said the foreign secretary had claimed the prospect of a no-deal exit from the European Union was \u201cwidely discussed and considered a realistic prospect during the 2016 EU referendum\u201d. Bradshaw said the claim there is a mandate for a no-deal Brexit is \u201cdeeply dishonest and demeans the office of foreign secretary\u201d. In the letter, Bradshaw told Raab: \u201cYour pronouncements since taking the job just a few days ago risk bringing this great office of state into disrepute. I was astonished to hear you claim on the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Monday 29 July that the prospect of a no-deal exit from the European Union was widely discussed and considered a realistic prospect during the 2016 EU referendum. You must know this is simply not true. \u201cThere appears to be no evidence at all of you ever suggesting that leaving the EU without a deal was a likely or possible outcome. Indeed, whenever the question was put to you, you suggested the opposite - you claimed that a new, better deal would be negotiated with the EU if people voted to leave. \u201cYou said the UK would of course retain a strong trading relationship with Europe and would likely get a bespoke deal, and stated, \u2018the idea that Britain would be apocalyptically off the cliff edge if we left the EU is silly\u2019. \u201cThis is not a subject for debate, it is a matter of public record. \u201cFor you to now try and claim a democratic mandate for no deal, despite failing to discuss the possibility of such an outcome during the referendum, is deeply dishonest and demeans the office of foreign secretary.\u201d Bradshaw called on Raab to \u201capologise for misleading the public\u201d and to \u201cagree there is no mandate for no deal\u201d. The BBC\u2019s Reality Check team found no mention of leaving the EU without a deal in the six months before the referendum from Raab, Vote Leave or Michael Gove. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for the Welsh seat of Rhondda, claimed Labour\u2019s vague stance on Brexit had damaged the party in the byelection. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme he said: Some of us have been saying for quite some time that one of the problems about trying to be all things to men and women is that nobody ends up liking what you\u2019re offering. I think our constructive ambiguity hasn\u2019t really helped us over the last two years. We have tried to say to Brexit voters \u2018we are in favour of Brexit\u2019 but to remain voters \u2018we are in favour of remain\u2019 and in the end you\u2019re not. I am fundamentally a remainer and I believe it it is in the interest of Wales, and our country, that we should at the very least try and achieve as softer Brexit as possible so that we can continue trading with Europe. Bryant put a brave face on the result. \u201cIn the end biggest problem for the Labour party is that we nearly lost our deposit. I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t lose our deposit, lots of people were talking about that going to happen.\u201d He also claimed Labour was likely to call a vote on no-confidence in September. He said: \u201cI would be amazed if we were not to table a motion of no confidence, and I will be wholeheartedly supporting it.\u201d Jane Dodds continues to portray her victory as a rejection of a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News she said: Here in Brecon and Radnorshire what people were talking with us about, particularly those working in agriculture, is that a no-deal Brexit here would decimate the farming industry. That\u2019s the first thing that I want to make sure Boris Johnson understands. He now has to listen that a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for our farming and agricultural communities here. I\u2019m determined to find Mr. Johnson, wherever he\u2019s hiding. And so you\u2019ve got to listen, you really got to listen to what this has said. This has said that the people are breaking the Radnorshire do not want a new deal Brexit. We\u2019ve burst his bubble and the first week of his Premiership, and he has to listen to that. Asked if the LibDems would support a soft Brexit, Dodds said: \u201cWe\u2019ve said very clearly that any deal that goes before Parliament must be attached to people\u2019s vote.\u201d On electoral pacts she said: \u201cWe were delighted that the Green Party and Plaid Cymru decided to stand down here. They knew we could beat the Conservatives by doing that, but secondly, it was symbolic of adult grown up politics.\u201d Asked if the LibDems would step aside in other seats in return, she said: \u201cwe\u2019re open to that.\u201d Still no official reaction from Labour on the byelection. Jeremy Corbyn is instead focussing on flooding and the damaged dam at Whaley Bridge. Here\u2019s Swinson\u2019s congratulatory message to Dodds: Liberal Democrats are winning again. And this byelection victory shows that the people of Brecon and Radnorshire not only have a first class MP in Jane Dodds, but they have shown the people of Britain that we can do better than the choice on offer between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. Liberal Democrats have a vision for a cleaner, safer, richer country in the European Union. And as leader of the Liberal Democrats, I will fight to keep our country in the European Union. And we now have in Parliament, one more MP who will fight to make that happen. Jane Dodds will be a first class representative for Brecon and Radnorshire, and potentially a key vote in cutting Boris Johnson\u2019s majority to just one. Congratulations, Jane. Dodds: \u2018we\u2019ve burst Boris Johnson\u2019s bubble\u2019 Jane Dodds says her victory in the byelection has burst Boris Johnson\u2019s bubble. Speaking after being congratulated in person by Jo Swinson, Dodds said: Here we stand bursting Boris Johnson\u2019s bubble in the first week of his premiership. And here we are saying to him very loud and clear that farmers and agricultural workers here will not tolerate a no-deal Brexit. That families who work hard will not put up with the indignity of going to food banks and that everybody including, especially our young people, want to see a much clearer and faster action on the climate emergency. We are very clear that this opportunity. I want to that voice in parliament that demands from Boris Johnson that he acts on these issue. I look forward to being the rural voice of Wales and Liberalism in Parliament. Labour is staying very quiet about the result after its candidate, Tom Davies, almost lost his deposit. Heidi Allen, the former Tory MP, then leader of Change UK, and now a member of the Independent group, described the results as \u201cutterly brilliant\u201d. David Cameron\u2019s former director of communications reckons the Conservatives won\u2019t be that disheartened by the result. LibDem leader Jo Swinson is about to congratulate her new parliamentary colleague, Jane Dodds, at a garden party in the Brecon Beacons. Steven Morris is there: The Green party says the result of the byelection was vindication of its decision to stand aside in favour of the LibDems. Anthony Slaughter, leader of the Wales Green Party, said: \u201cThe local Green Parties in the constituency made a decision, in the light of the critical circumstances of this moment, with the finely balanced parliament in Westminster, to withdraw in order to maximise the chances of a Remain MP. \u201cThat decision is absolutely vindicated by this result. The people of Brecon and Radnorshire have taken the opportunity to cut Boris Johnson\u2019s majority in Westminster to a highly unstable one, reducing further the risk of a disastrous crash-out Brexit. \u201cAnd the Green party\u2019s decision was key to that: the Liberal Democrat majority was 1,400 votes. We got 1,300 votes in the seat in 2015, while Plaid Cymru, who also withdrew from the by-election, also got that many votes. \u201cOf course what we need is a change to the undemocratic voting system, to ensure that everywhere in every nation votes can express their political preferences, vote for what they believe in and get it. But until we elect a parliament in Westminster that will reform our system and bring our politics into the 21st century, we have to work within the system we have.\u201d ITV\u2019s political editor has this: Liz Saville Roberts, leader of Plaid Cymru in Westminster, said Labour had been punished in the byelection for putting tribalism before the national interest. Here\u2019s a graphic of Brecon and Radnoshire result: The Shetland byelection, triggered by the resignation of long-serving Scottish Lib Dem MSP Tavish Scott, may not be attracting quite so much UK media attention, but here\u2019s a thing: it will now be the first time that prisoners are able to vote in a Scottish election. The Scottish government has announced that prisoners serving sentences of 12 months or less and who normally live in the island constituency, will have the right to vote: the ruling is expected to apply to fewer than five people. This brings Scotland into line with the European Court of Human Rights, which said in 2005 that the UK government\u2019s blanket ban was a breach of prisoners\u2019 human rights. In 2017, the UK government announced a compromise, but only after franchise powers had been devolved to Holyrood. A bill has been lodged at the Scottish parliament to do likewise, but the constitutional relations secretary, Michael Russell, has now passed this remedial order to ensure that the Shetland byelection aligns with the ECHR ruling. The Scottish Tories are unimpressed, describing it as an \u201cill-judged move\u201d which opens to door to prisoner voting and has been done without proper debate or consultation. Alistair Campbell hailed the byelection as a victory for the \u201cremain alliance\u201d. Campbell, who was Tony Blair\u2019s director of communication, was expelled from Labour after voting LibDem in the European election. Last week he said he had no wish to be readmitted to Labour in part because of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s failure to unequivocally back a second referendum. Swinson also predicted further electoral pacts between pro-EU parties following the byelection. Speaking to Today she said: \u201cI do think that working across party lines is important when there is so much at stake for the future of our country and I will continue to do that. \u201cI\u2019ve exchanged messages this morning with the Green and Plaid leaderships and I think there will be more co-operation in future elections.\u201d The new LibDem leader, Jo Swinson, said the byelection demonstrated there is no public consent for pursuing a no deal Brexit. Speaking to BBC Breakfast she said: \u201cIt\u2019s really good for the Liberal Democrats. But I think this has wider national significance. Not only does it cut Boris Johnson\u2019s majority to just one and show that there isn\u2019t a mandate for his no deal Brexit. This also shows hope to people in this country that they don\u2019t have to settle for that choice between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, there is a more positive alternative available \u2013 the Liberal Democrats.\u201d She said the many people in the leave-voting constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire were worried about the impact of a no deal Brexit. She said such an outcome would have a devastating impact on the rural economy as tariffs on lamb exports would put many sheep farmers out of business. \u201cIt is not surprising that people here have sent a very clear message to Boris Johnson that he needs to change his plan,\u201d she said. Swinson admitted that LibDems played the system by persuading the Greens and Plaid Cymru to pull out of the byelection to allow her party a clear run at the seat. She said: \u201cI do genuinely say thank you to Plaid and the Greens. And I\u2019ve been in touch with their leaders this morning to express that personally, because they put the national interest first and stood aside. \u201cWe are working the system that we have, we have won a victory with a 12% swing overturning an 8,000 majority. And this comes off the back of our best of our local election results and storming victories in the European elections where we beat both the Conservatives and the Labour parties to our best ever European election results too. So this is a sustained pattern of Liberal Democrats winning again, on the up.\u201d Tory party chairman, James Cleverly, conceded that the byelection was \u201cdisappointing\u201d for the Tories but pointed out that the Labour party had moved backwards in support. He told Today: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to lose a parliamentary colleague, obviously. But what we saw here was a very close result in a byelection which the Lib Dems were expecting to romp home comfortably.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat we also saw was the Labour Party, the official opposition, the party that claims to be ready to step in, almost losing their deposit well in Wales. They moved backwards.\u201d The elections experts, John Curtice, says the result of the byelection should make Boris Johnson cautious about going for a snap election. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said the vote showed the Tories were enjoying a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d but only at the expense of the Brexit party. He said: \u201cIn an early general election at the moment at least, the Conservatives would be at risk of losing.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen thinking about the prospects for an early general election. If the Liberal Democrats could pick up 40 or 50 seats, winning a large overall majority, which seems to be the point of a snap election, would become rather more difficult for the Conservatives would otherwise be the case.\u201d He said the result confirmed recent opinion polls putting the Conservatives above their performance in the European and local elections but 10% below their total in the last general election. He said: \u201cThe Boris bounce is good news for the conservatives. It\u2019s encouraging, as is the result of this by election despite the loss, but it\u2019s not necessarily substantial enough for anybody to want to precipitate an early general election with any great degree of confidence that you would end up with an arithmetic in the House of Commons that was significantly better than the one that the Prime Minister is currently going to have to deal with.\u201d \u201cTough night,\u201d Ukip has posted on Twitter. Ukip placed last in yesterday\u2019s vote, behind the Monster Raving Loony Party. An interesting take on the Tory loss in the Telegraph today, which seems to argue that the real winners on the day were... the Conservatives. \ud83e\udd14 It\u2019s paywalled, so for those who haven\u2019t subscribed, here\u2019s a brief sample. This was an election that the Lib Dems threw the kitchen sink at and should have been a shoo-in for them. The fact that it wasn\u2019t and that the Conservatives finished a close second, suggests Boris Johnson has got the Conservatives back into play electorally in what is a high risk winner takes all general election strategy. All the same, nothing in this result suggests anything other than ongoing voter unpredictability. With all the indicators pointing to a 1990s style Lib Dem gain against a Government in difficulties, enter right the Tories Lord Flashheart, one Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, injecting confidence, charisma and optimism as a dynamic new Prime Minister and taking Government by the scuff [sic] of its neck. It clearly made a difference, giving Tories something positive to vote for and, more importantly in a 52:48 per cent Brexit split constituency, he had a renewed focus on taking the UK out of the EU on October 31. The Conservatives returned in this by-election to the party of leave and therefore Brexit, in a successful strategy to squeeze the Brexit Party vote. Boris becoming Prime Minister even for just over a week but with a new Brexit delivery agenda, injected an element of uncertainty into proceedings right up to the announcement of the result. In just over a week Boris moved his party from a position of no hope to coming close to victory. A reminder from the Guardian\u2019s Hannah Jane Parkinson about the circumstances that led to yesterday\u2019s byelection. In case you missed it yesterday, Sonia Sodha\u2019s comment piece on the government\u2019s announcement of a \u00a32.1bn for no-deal planning is well worth a read. Here\u2019s a taste: It beggars belief that the government is spending billions \u2013 \u00a36.3bn so far this year \u2013 on contingency planning in case it decides to take us into a self-imposed economic disaster that is entirely avoidable. On the other hand, if Boris Johnson is deluded enough to proceed with crashing Britain out of the EU without a deal \u2013 and many of his actions as prime minister suggest that he is \u2013 the couple of billion announced this morning will feel like small change compared with what the government and businesses will have to spend to mitigate the long-term economic pain of no deal... Unless parliament can find a way to stop it, the chances of no deal are increasing by the day. Johnson could have eradicated the need for no-deal contingency spending by being clear he\u2019d never commit to such a grossly negligent act of economic self-harm. But he boxed himself in with his \u201cdo or die\u201d rhetoric during the Tory leadership contest. And so money that could have been spent elsewhere \u2013 \u00a36.3bn would boost the annual social care budget by almost a third \u2013 continues to be spent getting ready for something business leaders have warned Britain can never be ready for. That\u2019s not even taking into account the billions that the CBI says businesses have spent on their own contingency planning. One thing is certain: if we do crash out with no deal, that \u00a36.3bn will seem like peanuts. If borne out, those OBR forecasts will translate into hundreds of thousands more people losing their jobs; small businesses going bankrupt; people who already struggle to pay the mortgage finding themselves trapped in negative equity. And it\u2019s going to be those areas of the country hardest hit by decades of deindustrialisation and the financial crisis that will feel the economic pain of no deal most sharply. The Treasury won\u2019t know what\u2019s hit it. The full article is here. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has a busy morning ahead in light of the byelection victory, as well as visiting the constituency at 9am, she will be doing a lot of radio. Good morning and welcome to the politics liveblog. I\u2019ll be holding the fort for the early shift, before the unparalleled Andrew Sparrow takes over later on. The big news overnight was that the Liberal Democrats\u2019 candidate, Jane Dodds, won the seat of Brecon and Radnorshire in the byelection, cutting Johnson\u2019s Commons majority to one. The Liberal Democrats won 13,826 votes, with the Conservatives taking 12,401, a narrow majority of 1,425 that overturned the Tories\u2019 previous majority of more than 8,000. It was a sobering night for the Labour party (1,680 votes), which was beaten into fourth place by the Brexit party (3,331), and only just held on to its deposit. Ukip came last behind the Monster Raving Loony Party. The defeat will be a major blow to the Tories and will be seized on as a sign voters are concerned by Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the EU without a deal if necessary. In her acceptance speech, Dodds said that the vote \u201csent a powerful message to Westminster: we demand better\u201d and said her first act as MP would be \u201cto find Boris Johnson, wherever he\u2019s hiding, and tell him loud and clear: stop playing with the futures of our communities and rule out a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Ed Davey, the Lib Dem MP for Kingston and Surbiton, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge result. Not only is it the Liberal Democrats back in Wales and continues the momentum we had in the locals and Europeans but it\u2019s massive for the party arithmetic over Brexit The Brecon and Radnorshire by-election was the front-line of the stop Brexit campaign. This is going to make Boris Johnson\u2019s job that much more difficult and for those of us who are desperate to stop Brexit it\u2019s a crucial moment.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, will visit Brecon and Radnorshire this morning at 9am, and we will be watching for comment and reaction from MPs as the day unfolds.
