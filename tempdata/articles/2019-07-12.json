And, as you would expect, the real winner was Andrew Neil. It is a joy to watch an exceptionally well-briefed interviewer and the most memorable things that were said tonight were probably those said by him. Interviewers are often accused of not having the facts available to contest dodgy claims made by politicians, and it was worth watching the programmes alone just to hear Neil take on Jeremy Hunt\u2019s claims about the merits of cutting corporation tax, or deflate the \u2018I cut crime by 20%\u2019 boasts we\u2019ve been hearing about the Boris Johnson mayoralty ad nauseam. And then there was the farcical exchange about paragraph 5C of Gatt article 24. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/12/andrew-neil-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-boris-johnson-uses-andrew-neil-interview-to-deny-failing-to-support-ambassador-live-news?page=with:block-5d28d73b8f0845f89e30c26a#block-5d28d73b8f0845f89e30c26a\">7.56pm).</a> Johnson tried briefly to bluff his way through, but even he know when he was beaten, and he was wise enough to end up answering the question honestly; no, he did not know what was in paragraph 5C.</p> \n  <p>Faced with this sort of ordeal, the best that candidates can do is play for a draw and both Hunt and Johnson got through their interviews humbled, but without major disaster. Hunt\u2019s worst moment probably came when he refused to rule out delaying Brexit beyond Christmas. Johnson\u2019s came when he was asked about refusing to back Sir Kim Darroch in the ITV debate on Tuesday. To anyone who watched the debate, it was obvious that Johnson was cutting Darroch loose; he refused a very direct invitation to match Hunt\u2019s promise to keep Darroch in post until the end of the year, when he was due to retire, and he refused to offer even the slightest criticism of President Trump. Tonight Johnson claimed that his words had been misrepresented to Darroch, who he said had not watched the debate live, and he insisted that in fact he had been backing the ambassador. Not for the first time, his self-justification sounded dishonest. Is that any longer a surprise? Perhaps what is more telling is the way this suggests Johnson has been rattled by the strong criticism he has received in recent days for his willingness to let such a senior diplomat go at the behest of Trump.</p> \n  <p>The Johnson camp were probably also relieved that Neil chose not to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2013/mar/24/boris-johnson-accused-nasty-video\"> do an Eddie Mair </a>and focus heavily on character. Johnson came out of the interview looking shallow and evasive, but not especially more than usual. And it\u2019s a Friday night, and most of the votes are probably already in. It is very hard to imagine that he won\u2019t be prime minister in a fortnight. If so, remembering the old saying about how countries get the leaders they deserve, what on earth will this say about Britain?</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-13T06:58:20.625Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d28d9a88f08d0b6ca52f9fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-12T19:06:50.076Z\">8.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Neil ends with another character question.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Someone who\u2019s worked for you, who knows you well, says you\u2019re all flaws and no character.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has finally conceded that he should have been more supportive towards Sir Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to Washington, in an ITV Tory leadership debate on Tuesday. In the debate Johnson refused to say as PM he would keep Darroch in post despite President Trump refusing to deal with him and this lack of support contributed to Darroch\u2019s decision to resign the following day. At a Tory hustings tonight Johnson for the first time admitted he should have answered the question about this on Tuesday differently. (See 9.25pm.) Earlier, in an interview with Andrew Neil, he defended his role in the affair, claiming his remarks in a televised debate had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d to the former ambassador to Washington. Jeremy Hunt, Johnson\u2019s rival in the Tory leadership contest, has refused to rule out delaying Brexit beyond Christmas. (See 6.42pm.) Police have opened an investigation into the alleged leaking of diplomatic cables involving the outgoing UK ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, and demanded that those responsible hand themselves in. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Andrew Neil is, of course, a brilliant interviewer, but he seems to have been outdone by an (as yet unnamed) heckler at the Conservative party hustings in Cheltenham tonight. The hustings started at the same time as the interviews. Most of us were watching the BBC, but at the hustings Boris Johnson was heckled when he tried to dodge a question about whether he should have been more supportive towards Sir Kim Darroch in the ITV debate on Tuesday, and that forced him to admit for the first time that he should have been. The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has the full story. And here is the key quote from Johnson: Well, I don\u2019t think that anything I said was actually decisive in Kim\u2019s decision to resign. Had I my time again, to answer your question directly, yes - I probably should have been more emphatic that Kim personally had my full support. But I was surprised that his tenure as ambassador in Washington should be raised by the foreign secretary as a fitting subject for debate in a Conservative party leadership campaign. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the Andrew Neil interview. Or, rather, what they are saying about how Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt performed. The main theme on Twitter seems to be how good Andrew Neil was. From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush And here is an extract from Bush\u2019s article. Jeremy Hunt did very well explaining away his many inconsistencies and his helter-skelter Brexit positioning but ultimately his performance here felt like watching a team come from four nil down to grab a point: it\u2019s impressive, yes, but you have to ask yourself what he had done wrong to end up in that position in the first place. As for Boris Johnson, he did very badly. He had no grip of the detail, struggled to tackle any of the questions about the mistakes he had made or to defend any of his controversial positions. From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From Sky\u2019s Rob Powell From the Economist\u2019s Adrian Wooldridge From MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse From the Specatator\u2019s Katy Balls From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston The BBC\u2019s Reality Check team have been fact-checking some of the claims made in the debate. And this is from the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard. My colleague Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, also thinks Boris Johnson was not being honest in his interview tonight in what he said about the Kim Darroch affair. The Independent\u2019s John Rentoul has got transcripts of both interviews here. Andrew Neil interviews - Snap verdict: Great for TV viewers, but rather less good for news editors. And, as you would expect, the real winner was Andrew Neil. It is a joy to watch an exceptionally well-briefed interviewer and the most memorable things that were said tonight were probably those said by him. Interviewers are often accused of not having the facts available to contest dodgy claims made by politicians, and it was worth watching the programmes alone just to hear Neil take on Jeremy Hunt\u2019s claims about the merits of cutting corporation tax, or deflate the \u2018I cut crime by 20%\u2019 boasts we\u2019ve been hearing about the Boris Johnson mayoralty ad nauseam. And then there was the farcical exchange about paragraph 5C of Gatt article 24. (See 7.56pm). Johnson tried briefly to bluff his way through, but even he know when he was beaten, and he was wise enough to end up answering the question honestly; no, he did not know what was in paragraph 5C. Faced with this sort of ordeal, the best that candidates can do is play for a draw and both Hunt and Johnson got through their interviews humbled, but without major disaster. Hunt\u2019s worst moment probably came when he refused to rule out delaying Brexit beyond Christmas. Johnson\u2019s came when he was asked about refusing to back Sir Kim Darroch in the ITV debate on Tuesday. To anyone who watched the debate, it was obvious that Johnson was cutting Darroch loose; he refused a very direct invitation to match Hunt\u2019s promise to keep Darroch in post until the end of the year, when he was due to retire, and he refused to offer even the slightest criticism of President Trump. Tonight Johnson claimed that his words had been misrepresented to Darroch, who he said had not watched the debate live, and he insisted that in fact he had been backing the ambassador. Not for the first time, his self-justification sounded dishonest. Is that any longer a surprise? Perhaps what is more telling is the way this suggests Johnson has been rattled by the strong criticism he has received in recent days for his willingness to let such a senior diplomat go at the behest of Trump. The Johnson camp were probably also relieved that Neil chose not to do an Eddie Mair and focus heavily on character. Johnson came out of the interview looking shallow and evasive, but not especially more than usual. And it\u2019s a Friday night, and most of the votes are probably already in. It is very hard to imagine that he won\u2019t be prime minister in a fortnight. If so, remembering the old saying about how countries get the leaders they deserve, what on earth will this say about Britain? Neil ends with another character question. Someone who\u2019s worked for you, who knows you well, says you\u2019re all flaws and no character. The British people will face huge and unprecedented risk with Boris Johnson as prime minister, won\u2019t they? Johnson rejects the claim, and ends with a rant about Jeremy Corbyn. No. I think that the British people face one serious risk and that is that we failed to get Brexit done, we failed to unite our country and we thereby are so remiss as to allow the government of this country to pass into the hands of an avowed Marxist or semi-Marxist who would put up taxes, who would put up taxes on inheritance, on pensions, on incomes, on corporation tax and he would be an economic disaster. And that\u2019s it. I will post reaction and a summary soon. Q: Would you continue with the government\u2019s current fiscal rules? Johnson says he would continue to reduce debt. Asked what the national debt currently is, he says it is about 80% of GDP. Neil tells him it\u2019s 83% Q: Would you accept limits on borrowing? Johnson says there is scope for more borrowing. Neil asks him if he would stick to the government\u2019s second fiscal rule. Johnson says he will be setting out his plans in due course. Neil tells him what the second rule is; not borrowing more than 2% of GDP. He says Johnson seems to be offering a more \u201claxical\u201d fiscal policy. Johnson says \u201claxical\u201d is not a proper word. Q: Who will come first with your tax cuts? The rich or the poor. Johnson replies: The poorest come first. The poorest come first. Johnson says the poorest will take priority when he cuts taxes. There is then what passes for a moment of comedy in these things. BJ: Paragraph 5B. Article 24. Get the detail right. Get the detail right, Andrew. It\u2019s article 24 paragraph 5B. AN: And how would you handle paragraph 5C? BJ: I would confide entirely in paragraph 5B, because that is AN: How would you get round what\u2019s in 5C? BJ: I would confide entirely in paragraph 5B which is enough forour purposes. AN: Do you know what\u2019s in 5C? BJ: No. AN: I thought you were a man of detail. BJ: Well,you didn\u2019t even know whether it was an article or a paragraph, but \u2013 AN: But that\u2019s not the details you told those Tory hustings ... BJ: There\u2019s enough in paragraph 5B to get us the agreement that we want. AN: No. 5C says you don\u2019t just need the EU\u2019s approval; you need to agree with the EU the shape of a future trade agreement ... Neil is now asking about Gatt article 24. Johnson does not challenge Neil when Neil says Johnson wrongly claimed that the UK could use it unilaterally. But Johnson claims it would still be a route to tariff-free trade in the event of no deal. It might be possible and I accept that this has to be done by mutual agreement but it might be possible, for instance, as we come out to agree under Gatt 24 paragraph 5B that both sides agree to a standstill, a protraction of their existing zero tariff-zero quota arrangements until such time as we do a free trade deal. And that will be one way forward. And that would be very attractive and of course it will be up to our friends and partners to decide whether they want to go along with that. Johnson again refuses to rule out proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. Neil puts it to Johnson that the EU will not agree a change the backstop. What has changed now, what has changed now is that there is a different approach to the negotiations, a new optimism about what we can do, a new spirit of determination to come properly out of the EU and to get a fantastic deal. And we do that by remitting the solutions to frictionless trade across the Irish border, the Northern Irish border and indeed all other borders to the work that needs to be done to do a free-trade agreement. That is the way to do it. And that\u2019s the way forward. Johnson claims \u201ca new spirit of determination\u201d in the EU means a Brexit deal is now possible. Johnson reasserts his determination to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. I think it would be absolutely insane now to say that yet again we have a a phoney deadline, it all can be kicked off until - kick the can down the road \u2018till the Greek calends. Johnson defends what he said about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. If you look at what I said, I said - the limit of what she was doing was teaching journalism. What I meant to say was that that was the most they could possibly accuse her of. As it happened \u2013 even that was not true ... I reject entirely the assertion that anything I said made things worse. Neil is summing up this part of the interview. This has been the theme of your campaign. I want to comeback to when our ambassador was on the frontline, in the crosshairs, you did not stand up for him. That\u2019s what worries people. Johnson replies: Because I thought it was totally wrong to drag into the public domain the career prospects of a senior official and to turn that into a political football. Johnson claims he was standing up for Darroch in the Tuesday debate. Neil challenges this. The president called him wacky, pompous, a fool, stupid. You didn\u2019t have a word of criticism of the president. Johnson does not challenge this, but says he has said critical things about Trump in the past. Johnson denies failing to support Sir Kim Darroch, the ambassador to the US, in the TV debate on Tuesday. (See 6.36pm.) Neil gets Johnson to confirm that crime went down by 20% in London when he was mayor. He asks if Johnson knew how much it went down in the country as a whole at the same time. Johnson does not seem to know. \u201cBy 26%,\u201d says Neil. Neil goes on: \u201cSo you didn\u2019t outpace the country. You were part of a national trend.\u201d Johnson repeats figures about his record in London, but he does not challenge Neil\u2019s argument. Another hardball intro from Andrew Neil. He starts: Boris Johnson, we\u2019re going to talk a lot about policy, but I first want to talk about you, because for many people \u2013 including many Tories \u2013 your character, your reputation, trust in you is as big an issue as the policies you stand for. Do you accept that that\u2019s a problem for you? Boris Johnson replies: No, I don\u2019t at all. I think what people want to see is what my plans are to come out of the EU on October 31st, to get that deal done, take us beyond Brexit and unite the country. And I\u2019ve got a lot of things that I think will be fantastic Conservative policies. I think they want to hear about that, they want to hear about what we can do to fight crime, and I think they\u2019ll be interested to know what \u2013 the last time I was asked to fight crime here in this city, what we did in getting it down by, I think, about 20% overall. The murder rate down by about 50%. If people are interested in my character and my political credo or whatever, look at what I deliver. Johnson dismisses suggestions that his character should be an issue in the campaign. Hunt ends on health, saying he secured extra funding for the NHS. Neil says the rate of increase is still lower than the postwar average. And that\u2019s it. Neil asks Hunt to name any big business that has asked for this corporation tax cut. \u201cBusinesses welcome business tax cuts,\u201d Hunt replies. But, when challenged, he cannot name any specific business asking for the corporation tax cut he is proposing. Hunt cannot name any major business calling for the tax cut he proposes. Neil challenges Hunt\u2019s analysis. Mr Trump\u2019s corporation tax cuts were only a small part of an overall fiscal package which has increased the deficit by $2tn in America and has given them a deficit of 5% of GDP. The corporation tax cuts were small in that huge stimulus. Is that your plan in Britain? To get a bigger and bigger deficit, as in America? Hunt replies: Well, our context, of course, is different, but it\u2019s different in two ways. First of all, my corporation tax cuts are much more radical than anything President Trump did. To bring those corporation tax rates down to 12\u00bd%, one of the very lowest in the world, as low as the levels in Ireland. And incidentally, when Ireland did those cuts, they had a GDP per head that was lower than ours. Now it\u2019s nearly 50% higher. Neil says there has been an even bigger cut in corporation tax over the last decade, but, he says: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t turbocharged the economy; we\u2019ve had the slowest recovery in history.\u201d Q: You have made a lot of spending and tax cut pledges. Do those promises stand in the event of a no-deal Brexit? Hunt says the corporation tax cuts would stay. Q: So you would use half the Treasury\u2019s fiscal headroom for tax cuts for businesses? Yes, says Hunt. He explains why. And let me tell you why. First of all, because in a no-deal situation you will have a shock to the economy with the imposition of tariffs and this is a good way to give businesses more headroom to deal with those changes. But secondly, this is I think the nub of the argument that I\u2019m making. I want to fire up businesses, to get young people starting their own businesses justas I started my own business and I accept that a cut incorporation tax isn\u2019t the most popular tax cut, but what it does, if you look at what President Trump did in America, he cut business taxes and it increased the American growth rate. It\u2019s now growing at about twice our rate, about 3% compared to our 1\u00bd%. If we did that in this country we would have an extra 20 billion pounds to spend on precious public services and further tax cuts and that is the heart of our success as a country will be to fire up the economy. Hunt says he would expect Brexit to happen before Christmas, but does not give a firm commitment to deliver it by then. (See 6.42pm.) Hunt says he can get a deal by the end of September. And it could then get through parliament within a month, he claims. I think in that situation parliament will be willing to sit at weekends, will be willing to sit late, to do this, but I think it may take a few extra days and I would be willing to allow those days, yes. Hunt says he would ask MPs to sit at weekends to get Brexit legislation passed before end of October if necessary. Neil challenges Hunt about a claim he has made about Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. You claim that Chancellor Merkel has told you she\u2019s prepared to look at changes to the withdrawal agreement. We\u2019ve spoken to the German chancellery and they have told us the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation. Hunt replies: What I said was that Chancellor Merkel had said to me that if a new British prime minister came forward with a different plan for the Northern Irish border, of course they would look at the package and that is because they want to find a solution to this. Neil turns to the Brexit deal Hunt wants. Q: What is the biggest change you want? The backstop, says Hunt. Q: And would that make it deliverable? I think it would broadly make it deliverable within parliament. I think that certainly earlier this year that would be the case, but I will be, as I say, putting together a negotiating team ... Pressed on what other changes he might want, Hunt just says it is \u201cthe main one\u201d. Hunt repeats the point about the UK leaving. What I say, and what I say as prospective Prime Minister of this country, is that as a democracy, we are leaving the European Union. And if the only way that the Europeans will allow that to happen is without a deal, then so be it, we will do it. But it isn\u2019t my first choice. Hunt says he does not want a no-deal Brexit, but he says he is prepared to go for one if necessary. Neil says only a year ago Hunt said the only person rejoicing in no-deal would be Vladimir Putin. Hunt admits this. What I was saying in that interview is that we have to be very careful. I was saying to the Europeans actually in that interview, because I was in Holland when I gave that interview, be very careful. If you think that no deal is going to be a smooth process \u2013 it risks fracturing the friendship. Hunt explains how his Brexit strategy would be different from Theresa May\u2019s. The main thing that I would do differently to Theresa May is I would not be proposing anything to Brussels that we can\u2019t get through parliament. And so my negotiating team would have the DUP, the ERG, the Brexit purists in our party, Scottish and Welsh Conservatives, because we must think about the union as well. Hunt says Sir Kim Darroch has said that not being backed by Boris Johnson in the TV debate on Tuesday was one of the factors explaining his resignation. Neil taunts Hunt about his business experience. When you were an entrepreneur you didn\u2019t do negotiations anything like what will be required in Brussels, anything like the scale. And you go on about being an entrepreneur, you weren\u2019t exactly Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, were you? Hunt claims that as an entrepreneur he did learn relative skills. Well, I think you do learn the basics of negotiation. The learn the basics of being prepared to walk away ... This could be the smallest contract for someone trying to get a business off the ground as I did, but those basics remain the same. And I will tell you that in government those same skills I use to negotiate very complex things like the Licence Fee deal with the BBC, the NHS pay awards. But Neil is not impressed. Let\u2019s be honest. You may have been doing it all your life but you have no track record of successful negotiation in the big league. Maybe in the minor league, but this is the big league Mr Hunt. Hunt urges him not to \u201cbelittle people up and down the country who have built up businesses\u201d. Q: When you said the next PM has to be someone Brussels will talk to, were you saying the EU would not talk to Johnson? Hunt replies: Well, people can make their own conclusions. When pushed on this, he refuses to criticise Johnson. I have avoided in this leadership campaign making personal comments about Boris, because we\u2019ve got to come together as a party at the end of this. Hunt says he cannot stand up for democracy abroad unless he is will to defend it at home - by implementing the result of the 2016 referendum. How can I be a foreign secretary who stands up for democratic principles in somewhere like Hong Kong, if I\u2019m not prepared to stand up for democratic principles at home in this, one of the oldest, most robust democracies in the world? Q: Why did you vote for May\u2019s deal three times? Hunt replies: The reason I voted for it was because at every stage I voted for us to leave the European Union as quickly as possible. And I didn\u2019t think it was perfect, but I would have preferred right today to be outside the European Union, to have left the EU, to have resolved that issue and then to tackle the imperfections in that deal, the main one of which was the backstop. And as I say, other leading Eurosceptics, people like Jacob Rees-Mogg, for exactly the same reasons, they also voted for that deal because they also wanted us to leave as quickly as possible. Andrew Neil starts with a zinger. Jeremy Hunt - like Theresa May you voted to Remain. LikeTheresaMay you\u2019re a Tory technocrat. Like Theresa May you voted for her Brexit deal, three times. Why would the Tories want more of the same when it\u2019s hardly been a golden age for them? Jeremy Hunt says he is a \u201ctotally different person\u201d with a \u201ctotally different plan. Andrew Neil is opening the programme now. He says the Jeremy Hunt interview will be shown first. And we have a surfeit of interviews this evening. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has had the challenging task of trying to get Theresa May to say something newsworthy. Some of these comments are almost identical to what Theresa May said in an interview with the Daily Mail this morning. But the highlight of of that interview was this comment, widely seen as a jibe at Boris Johnson. May said: Too many people in politics think being prime minister is a position of power. Actually, it is a position of service to the country where you are always asking yourself \u201cWhat more can I do for the public?\u201d. And here is the Jeremy Hunt clip cited earlier. Here is the Boris Johnson clip cited earlier. And this is what the Press Association has filed about the Jeremy Hunt interview. Tory leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt has refused to commit to taking Britain out of the European Union before Christmas, saying prime ministers should \u201conly make promises they know they can deliver\u201d. The foreign secretary insisted it was possible to get a revised deal with Brussels by the end of September, and said if it took \u201ca few extra days\u201d to get it through parliament he would delay Brexit beyond the October 31 deadline. But, when pressed during an interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil, he refused to say whether the UK would have left by Christmas, though claimed \u201cit\u2019s not going to be months\u201d. Hunt has said that he believes he would be able to get a new deal with Brussels, but if that proved impossible, he would prepare for no deal on October 31, making a judgment on the best course to follow at the end of September. He expressed his confidence in getting a deal by the end of September, telling the BBC: \u201cI believe we can and I, as I say, I think that people like Angela Merkel want to solve this problem. \u201cIf we have a deal, if it\u2019s clear to us and to the Europeans there\u2019s a deal to be done, then of course I would go for that and if it took a little bit - you know, a few extra days - to get it through parliament.\u201d He said parliament would be \u201cwilling to sit at weekends, will be willing to sit late, to do this\u201d but that it \u201cmay take a few extra days and I would be willing to allow those days\u201d. Asked whether he would be prepared to delay by days, weeks or months, Mr Hunt replied: \u201cWell it\u2019s not going to be months.\u201d But pressed on whether the UK would be out by Christmas, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you those commitments ... \u201cIt\u2019s because prime ministers should only make promises they know they can deliver. And there\u2019s another reason why we have to be careful about this 31st of October date. \u201cIt is because parliament may try and take a no deal Brexit off the table altogether and so I think - my commitment is that I think I\u2019m the best person to get a deal and if we get a deal it will be on or around the 31st of October but I can\u2019t control what parliament does and that\u2019s why I\u2019m being honest with people about the difficulties.\u201d Hunt went on to say he expected Brexit to happen before Christmas and, when asked if there was any chance the UK could still go in to 2020 as a member of the EU, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t believe so, no.\u201d In a swipe at his rival Boris Johnson, Hunt said he would deliver Brexit \u201cmore quickly than the alternative\u201d. \u201cIf you want to leave the EU quickly, if you want to avoid a general election, which is the risk if you go about this in the wrong way, I\u2019m the person who has the biggest chance of negotiating that deal and getting us out by October 31.\u201d Andrew Neil is widely regarded as the best prosecutorial interviewer on television. There are other styles of interviewing that can be equally effective and revelatory (sometimes more so), but since cockfighting and bear-baiting have been banned, the British have relied on alternative forms of entertainment and seeing their political leaders getting duffed up on TV by a brilliant forensic performer has been a good substitute. Tonight Neil gets to have a go at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. The two half-hour interviews, which have been pre-recorded and go out at 7pm, almost certainly come too late to influence the result. According to one assessment, Johnson already has enough votes in the post to have won, whatever happens before the election closes at the end of next week. But Johnson, who is almost certain to be prime minister within a fortnight, has given relatively few interviews during the campaign, especially to journalists who might be deemed difficult. This is an important moment of scrutiny for him. The Press Association has filed an early story based on what he said in the interview. Here it is. Boris Johnson has admitted a report of his comments about Sir Kim Darroch was a \u201cfactor\u201d in his resignation as Britain\u2019s ambassador to the United States. However, the Tory leadership frontrunner denied failing to give Sir Kim his backing and said his words during a televised leadership debate had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d. Johnson\u2019s lack of explicit support for Darroch during the ITV debate on Tuesday was widely seen to have been the final straw for the envoy following the leak of his diplomatic cables criticising Donald Trump\u2019s White House. Furious Tory MPs accused the former foreign secretary, who is favourite to succeed Theresa May, of throwing Darroch \u201cunder a bus\u201d, leaving him no option but to resign. But in an interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil, Johnson said when he spoke to Darroch by telephone the ambassador told him he had not seen the debate himself although somebody had told him about Mr Johnson\u2019s comments. \u201cHe said that what somebody had relayed to him had been a factor in his resignation,\u201d Johnson said. He added: \u201cI think that unfortunately what I said on that TV debate was misrepresented to Kim.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Police have opened an investigation into the alleged leaking of diplomatic cables involving the outgoing UK ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, and asked that those responsible hand themselves in. Scotland Yard said its counter-terrorism command, which takes national responsibility for investigating allegations of criminal breaches of the Official Secrets Act, was leading the investigation. Darroch resigned as the envoy to the US on Wednesday after the Tory leadership candidate, Boris Johnson, publicly refused to explicitly support him over the revelation that the ambassador had been heavily critical of Donald Trump in secret communications with London. The US president reacted with fury to the emergence of the cables \u2013 in which Darroch reportedly described him as \u201cinept\u201d, \u201cinsecure\u201d and \u201cincompetent\u201d \u2013 and said he would no longer deal with him. On Friday, Neil Basu, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said: \u201cGiven the widely reported consequences of that leak, I am satisfied that there has been damage caused to UK international relations, and there would be clear public interest in bringing the person or people responsible to justice.\u201d The Cabinet Office launched an investigation in the immediate aftermath of the story\u2019s publication by the Mail on Sunday.

He added: \u201cI stood up completely for the principle that civil servants should be allowed to say what they want for their political masters without fear or favour.\u201d Johnson also denied being \u201ccraven\u201d towards the US president and claimed that, in the debate, he had simply been rejecting the idea that Darroch\u2019s career should be made into a \u201cpolitical football\u201d. During Tuesday\u2019s debate, when asked to confirm whether he would keep Darroch in post if he became prime minister, Johnson declined to do so, saying it would be \u201cpresumptuous\u201d. Later on Friday evening, he was heckled during a hustings in Cheltenham. \u201cAnswer the bloody question,\u201d an audience member shouted at Johnson as he was asked about Darroch\u2019s resignation. Responding, Johnson admitted he should have handled the issue differently, but said it should never have been raised as an issue in a political campaign. In his own BBC interview, Jeremy Hunt \u2013 the foreign secretary and Johnson\u2019s rival for the Tory leadership \u2013 told Neil that Darroch had \u201cbeen clear that that [Johnson\u2019s response] was one of the factors [in his resignation], and I think it\u2019s a great shame\u201d. On Thursday, amid concern among diplomats that a similar fate could befall them as they fulfilled their duties, Hunt wrote to all Foreign Office staff imploring them to continue \u201cspeaking truth to power and standing up for British interests\u201d.",

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>I had always naively imagined that parenting would get easier the older the children got. And in many mundane ways it has. I no longer have to worry so much about keeping them alive, about making sure they have done their homework or whether they are happy at university. They are now their own people, making their own decisions and sometimes even telling us what they are. Parenting has moved from practical problems to existential ones. Our daughter, who was over from Minneapolis for the first time in six months to direct a play at the <a href=\"https://www.thelatchmere.co.uk/theatre503/\">Latchmere theatre</a> in London, has gone back home. Her home. I find that hard to imagine because part of me still thinks of our home as her home. But it isn\u2019t. She has moved on, even if I haven\u2019t. My wife and I are no longer such key figures in her life. Not that she doesn\u2019t love us, but we are no longer as important as we once were. Which is as it should be. If she was still living with us at 27, we\u2019d all be driving one another mad. And for the most part, I have got used to the 4,000-mile distance between us, but having had her back for three weeks I feel bereft once more \u2013 despite the towels no longer being left on the floor. This is my new reality of getting older. A series of ever more frequent losses, each one diminishing me a little more. Until the rest is silence.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>The spin rooms for televised political debates are usually dripping with sweat and adrenaline, as MPs and supporters of the rival participants do their best to push themselves centre stage of lobby reporters to persuade everyone that their candidate has landed all the killer lines. Tonight\u2019s debate at the ITV studios in Salford was rather different. A large number of Tory MPs had been expected, but at the last minute they were forced to remain in Westminster as the Conservative whips did not trust Labour to honour their pairing commitments in the crucial amendment put forward to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/30-plus-tory-rebels-willing-to-defy-whip-and-block-no-deal-brexit\">Northern Ireland bill by Dominic Grieve</a> that would make it difficult for Boris Johnson to prorogue parliament. Not that it did them much good as the government still contrived to lose by one vote as one MP got caught short in the toilet. So up in Salford, the spinner-in-chief for Team Boris was Jason McCartney, a former Tory MP who lost his seat at the 2017 election. Understandably, McCartney had little idea of why Boris was so marvellous because no one had bothered to tell him. Team Hunt was led by another former Tory MP, Rob Wilson. Not even Wilson seemed to know who Wilson was. This meant that most of the spinning was journalists asking other journalists who they thought had done well, which led to a much more agreeable and better informed level of analysis. The general consensus was that my dog would make a better prime minister than Boris or Jeremy.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/apollo-11-review-moon-landing-documentary-nasa-neil-armstrong-buzz-aldrin\">Apollo 11 review \u2013 stunning return to an incredible journey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Normally the TV schedules are rather thin at this time of the year as the broadcasters save up their best shows for the winter months.

The weird thing is I can remember so little of my early life \u2013 most years are rolled into a blur of boredom, anxiety and a sense of not quite fitting in \u2013 but that summer of 1969 stands out as beacon of clarity. Even now when I look at the moon, I can almost smell the days of that summer. It was as if, for the first time, I felt a sense of wonderment. The feeling that a better life was possible.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>Maybe it was my old inner hippie, but I was rather endeared to the Australian cricket coach, Justin Langer, for getting his players to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/08/australia-england-world-cup-semi-final\">wander round Edgbaston barefoot</a> prior to their World Cup semi-final against England in order to channel the positive vibes of the turf.

Maybe Langer\u2019s pre-match ritual only works on a solstice because England played the almost perfect game to win at a canter. My plan not to watch England matches \u2013 yet again the cricket was only on in the background with the sound turned down \u2013 is paying dividends. All I need to do to ensure our first World Cup victory is to make sure I miss large chunks of Sunday\u2019s final. It will be a sacrifice, but my sense of public service demands no less. It will also be an act of atonement. I was at the last World Cup final in which England took part 27 years ago in Melbourne and was unashamedly cheering on Pakistan; I had been following the team throughout the tournament as I was writing a book about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/the-nightwatchman/2015/mar/09/cricket-world-cup-final-1992-sweater-wasim-akram-pakistan-england\">Wasim Akram</a> and Waqar Younis and had become close to many of the players.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson belatedly admitted to failures in his handling of the leaked cables issue that led to the resignation of a British diplomat as he came under intense political pressure on Friday. In a tense interview on the BBC, the would-be prime minister acknowledged that his refusal to explicitly back Sir Kim Darroch, the UK\u2019s outgoing ambassador to Washington, amid a diplomatic row had been a factor in the envoy\u2019s decision to step down. But he insisted that his remarks had been misrepresented to Darroch. In a Tory leadership hustings that took place at about the same time as the prerecorded interview was being broadcast, Johnson admitted he should have handled the situation differently, as he was heckled by an audience member who demanded that he \u201canswer the bloody question\u201d. Johnson had declined repeated opportunities during a televised debate on Tuesday to explicitly back Darroch, an act he told the BBC had been a \u201cfactor\u201d in the envoy\u2019s decision to resign. He later told the hustings audience, however: \u201cI don\u2019t think that anything I said was actually decisive in Kim\u2019s decision to resign. Had I my time again, to answer your question directly, yes \u2013 I probably should have been more emphatic that Kim personally had my full support.\u201d Even as he acknowledged his impact, Johnson robustly defended his role. He told the BBC his remarks in the hustings had only been \u201crelayed\u201d to the ambassador and that they had been \u201cmisrepresented\u201d. Darroch, he claimed, had not seen the debate himself and, after hearing the second-hand report of the remarks, decided to resign from one of the UK\u2019s most prestigious foreign postings without watching the broadcast. Darroch quit his post on Wednesday, after Donald Trump publicly expressed his fury about a series of highly critical reports that had been leaked to the Mail on Sunday. Johnson, challenged repeatedly about the issue in the interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil on Friday, denied that he failed to support Darroch in Tuesday\u2019s ill-tempered ITV leadership debate. \u201cI stood up completely for the principle that civil servants should be allowed to say what they want for their political masters without fear or favour,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe real culprits are the people who leaked that material.\u201d He said: \u201cI spoke to him [Darroch] the next day and said how sorry I was that he had resigned, and he said he had not watched it,\u201d Johnson said. But he added: \u201cWhat he said was that somebody had relayed to him what I had said. He said that what somebody had relayed to him had certainly been a factor in his resignation. I think, unfortunately, what I said during that TV debate was misrepresented to Kim.\u201d Johnson also denied being \u201ccraven\u201d towards the US president, and claimed that in the debate he had simply been rejecting the idea that Darroch\u2019s career should be made into a \u201cpolitical football\u201d. During Tuesday\u2019s debate, when asked to confirm that he would keep Darroch in post if he became prime minister, Johnson declined to do so, saying it would be \u201cpresumptuous\u201d. By contrast, his rival, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cWho chooses our ambassadors is a matter for the United Kingdom government and the United Kingdom prime minister, so I\u2019ve made clear that if I am our next prime minister, the ambassador in Washington stays.\u201d Friends of the former ambassador have cited the perceived lack of support from Johnson as one reason he took the dramatic step of resigning the next day. The Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan said Johnson had, \u201cthrown our top diplomat under a bus\u201d. Darroch\u2019s resignation was greeted with dismay at the Foreign Office, where Johnson\u2019s stance was viewed as a failure to stand up to the maverick US president, who had called the ambassador \u201cwacky\u201d and a \u201cpompous fool\u201d on Twitter. The department\u2019s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, told MPs he believed the incident was unprecedented. In his own interview with Neil, Hunt said he \u201cexpects\u201d Brexit to be completed by Christmas. Throughout the campaign, Hunt has carefully avoided echoing Johnson\u2019s pledge to take Britain out of the EU by the 31 October deadline \u201ccome what may\u201d \u2013 though he claims his background as an entrepreneur will help him to strike a new compromise with the EU27. He insisted on Friday: \u201cI\u2019m being honest with people.\u201d Hunt also hinted that he acknowledged the flamboyant Johnson was more attractive to many of the 160,000 grassroots Tory members who are selecting Britain\u2019s next prime minister in a postal ballot. He said his worry was that Conservative members would \u201cvote with their hearts instead of their heads\u201d. The result of the hard-fought contest, which began with a field of 13 candidates more than a month ago, will be announced on 23 July. Theresa May will take part in her final prime minister\u2019s questions the next day, before going to Buckingham Palace to tender her resignation to the Queen. May also gave an interview to the BBC on Friday, reflecting on her troubled three years in Downing Street.

We are already on board. Since Pope Francis\u2019s letter to the world, Laudato Si\u2019, Catholics have been reflecting on how we can work for climate justice. Thousands of our churches now run on renewable energy, while thousands of parishioners have taken to the streets to demand political action.</p> <p>Last month, for instance, nearly 1,500 Cafod supporters joined people from other faith communities as part of a climate and environment lobby of parliament. Some 12,000 people of all faiths and none travelled from across the country to speak to more than 350 MPs about the political and economic decisions needed if the UK is to reach net-zero emissions. And faith leaders undertook a Walk of Witness down Whitehall to show our commitment to protecting creation and our poorest sisters and brothers \u2013 those who will pay the greatest price if we fail to urgently cut emissions.</p> <p>So, people in faith communities are taking action. But not because it\u2019s a membership drive. It\u2019s because we hear the cry of the Earth and of the poor, who experience the injustice of climate change right now through lost lives and livelihoods. We care for our common home because it\u2019s our moral duty to act.<br><strong>Christine Allen</strong><br><em>Director, </em><em>Catholic Agency for Overseas Development </em></p> <p>\u2022 The government may be responding to the climate crisis like a \u201cDad\u2019s Army\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/10/uks-preparation-for-climate-crisis-like-dads-army\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 10 July) but more than 120 local authorities led by all of the main political parties have declared that this really is a climate emergency and that they will go into battle with or without government support.</p> <p>Between us we have multibillion-pound budgets, cross party determination, increasing public support and some legislative powers. We are already building up some impressive examples of what can be done and are pooling our experience and expertise. But we can\u2019t win the campaign our own: we need the government to send reinforcements, bringing legislation and resources to support renewable energy, zero-carbon building, public transport, carbon sequestration, action on biodiversity and much more.<br><strong>Cllr Kevin Frea</strong><br><em>Co-chair, UK Climate Emergency Network</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your coverage of the Committee on Climate Change\u2019s report, with its stinging criticism of government failure to tackle climate change, does not sufficiently identify how the aviation industry needs to be held to immediate account. Given that parliament and many city councils and local authorities have declared a climate emergency, aviation should no longer be protected from scrutiny.</p> <p>The suggested action by the CCC is for a plan to be published limiting the increase in air traffic to 60%. This target is too generous, and is unattainable if all airports are allowed to expand as currently planned. It certainly does not enable the government to achieve net carbon neutrality.</p> <p>We call for no airport expansion, and for a process to begin to roll back existing flights. This could begin with the introduction of a frequent-flyer levy, banning short-haul flights, and forcing airlines to fly planes full (ie to share passengers and cancel low-density flights). A citizens\u2019 assembly should sort the details of how to reduce air travel.<br><strong>Mark Smalley</strong> <em>XR Bristol, </em><strong>John Adams</strong> <em>Professor emeritus and chair of Stop Bristol Airport Expansion, </em><strong>Hilary Burn</strong> <em>Chair, Parish Councils Airport Association</em>, <strong>Stephen Clarke</strong> <em>Green councillor, Bristol city council, </em><strong>Tanguy Tomes</strong> <em>Environmental consultant</em>, <strong>Tarisha Clarke</strong> <em>Airport Action, </em><strong>Dr Steve Melia</strong> <em>Senior lecturer in transport policy, University of the West of England</em></p> <p>\u2022 That the government\u2019s climate advisers, the committee on climate change, reveal little preparation has taken place to deal with extreme weather isn\u2019t, in itself, a shock. What is shocking is that the government, distracted by the not-so-smooth process of grappling with Brexit, still doesn\u2019t appear to get it.</p> <p>By failing to see the problems with fracking despite all of the evidence, green-lighting climate-damaging infrastructure like more new roads, and blithely approving another runway at Heathrow, it\u2019s clear the government has been resisting the hard and immediate policy work needed to kickstart a massive programme of change.</p> <p>This change will be for the unalloyed good of all of us, as well as make for a healthier environment \u2013 even if it possibly dents some multinationals\u2019 balance sheets.<br><strong>Mike Childs</strong><br><em>Head of science, Friends of the Earth</em></p> <p>\u2022 In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/08/weatherwatch-heatwaves-nuclear-power\" title=\"\">Weatherwatch</a> (9 July), Paul Brown highlighted the risks to nuclear power stations with climate change. As he pointed out, nuclear reactors are not a reliable source of base load power. The increasing number of heatwaves threatens their supply of cooling water, particularly in France, which exports electricity.</p> <p>In the UK, reactors use sea water, but there are dangers ahead there, too, with the risk of flooding from rising sea levels.

Some 12,000 people of all faiths and none travelled from across the country to speak to more than 350 MPs about the political and economic decisions needed if the UK is to reach net-zero emissions. And faith leaders undertook a Walk of Witness down Whitehall to show our commitment to protecting creation and our poorest sisters and brothers \u2013 those who will pay the greatest price if we fail to urgently cut emissions. So, people in faith communities are taking action. But not because it\u2019s a membership drive. It\u2019s because we hear the cry of the Earth and of the poor, who experience the injustice of climate change right now through lost lives and livelihoods. We care for our common home because it\u2019s our moral duty to act. Christine Allen Director, Catholic Agency for Overseas Development \u2022 The government may be responding to the climate crisis like a \u201cDad\u2019s Army\u201d (Report, 10 July) but more than 120 local authorities led by all of the main political parties have declared that this really is a climate emergency and that they will go into battle with or without government support. Between us we have multibillion-pound budgets, cross party determination, increasing public support and some legislative powers. We are already building up some impressive examples of what can be done and are pooling our experience and expertise. But we can\u2019t win the campaign our own: we need the government to send reinforcements, bringing legislation and resources to support renewable energy, zero-carbon building, public transport, carbon sequestration, action on biodiversity and much more. Cllr Kevin Frea Co-chair, UK Climate Emergency Network \u2022 Your coverage of the Committee on Climate Change\u2019s report, with its stinging criticism of government failure to tackle climate change, does not sufficiently identify how the aviation industry needs to be held to immediate account. Given that parliament and many city councils and local authorities have declared a climate emergency, aviation should no longer be protected from scrutiny. The suggested action by the CCC is for a plan to be published limiting the increase in air traffic to 60%. This target is too generous, and is unattainable if all airports are allowed to expand as currently planned. It certainly does not enable the government to achieve net carbon neutrality. We call for no airport expansion, and for a process to begin to roll back existing flights. This could begin with the introduction of a frequent-flyer levy, banning short-haul flights, and forcing airlines to fly planes full (ie to share passengers and cancel low-density flights). A citizens\u2019 assembly should sort the details of how to reduce air travel. Mark Smalley XR Bristol, John Adams Professor emeritus and chair of Stop Bristol Airport Expansion, Hilary Burn Chair, Parish Councils Airport Association, Stephen Clarke Green councillor, Bristol city council, Tanguy Tomes Environmental consultant, Tarisha Clarke Airport Action, Dr Steve Melia Senior lecturer in transport policy, University of the West of England \u2022 That the government\u2019s climate advisers, the committee on climate change, reveal little preparation has taken place to deal with extreme weather isn\u2019t, in itself, a shock. What is shocking is that the government, distracted by the not-so-smooth process of grappling with Brexit, still doesn\u2019t appear to get it. By failing to see the problems with fracking despite all of the evidence, green-lighting climate-damaging infrastructure like more new roads, and blithely approving another runway at Heathrow, it\u2019s clear the government has been resisting the hard and immediate policy work needed to kickstart a massive programme of change. This change will be for the unalloyed good of all of us, as well as make for a healthier environment \u2013 even if it possibly dents some multinationals\u2019 balance sheets. Mike Childs Head of science, Friends of the Earth \u2022 In Weatherwatch (9 July), Paul Brown highlighted the risks to nuclear power stations with climate change. As he pointed out, nuclear reactors are not a reliable source of base load power. The increasing number of heatwaves threatens their supply of cooling water, particularly in France, which exports electricity. In the UK, reactors use sea water, but there are dangers ahead there, too, with the risk of flooding from rising sea levels. Add to that the whopping costs and the dangers of terrorist attacks, technical failures, human error and radioactive contamination, and it is difficult to understand why politicians are supporting \u201cnew build\u201d nuclear reactors. Why are they not choosing to put money and resource into sustainable energy sources? Rae Street Littleborough, Lancashire \u2022 The disavowal that leaves us heading for climate catastrophe was well captured on page 8 on 10 July, with your reports about \u201cDad\u2019s Army\u201d climate crisis preparations and David Attenborough\u2019s warning that pollution will soon be as reviled as slavery sharing the page with an advert for a car with a twin power turbo engine and the exhortation \u201cDon\u2019t have fun.

The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy, and the longer he is likely to maintain that position.\u201d Rather than passing, this political mood has intensified. It is impossible to watch how Farage or Johnson relate to Trump, or each other, or to their own underlings, without imagining the entire evolutionary regression voiced by David Attenborough. Great leaders show, rather than tell, their skills. Yet Johnson never lets up with telling people that he is not \u201cdefeatist\u201d, that he will \u201cput some lead in the collective pencil\u201d, that \u201cenergy\u201d is needed, that what the EU really fears is a big strong man like him. Mm. I hear they talk of little else in the 27 European capitals. \u201cO Fates, please spare us the dreaded \u2018positive energy\u2019 of a guy internationally ridiculed as the worst foreign secretary in memory; and the unplayable charm of a surprisingly indifferent orator who knows the Latin for \u2018can we just take out the backstop?\u2019\u201d And Johnson does know Latin, as he never misses a chance to remind us. No one could accuse him of wearing his learning lightly \u2013 or, indeed, wearing any of it lightly. Witness his excruciating promise to reach out to something he pointedly referred to as \u201cOppidan Britain\u201d. To which the increasingly despairing response has to be: YES YES! I KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU WENT TO! I KNOW WHAT HOUSE YOU WERE IN! I KNOW YOU GOT A SECOND CLASS CLASSICS DEGREE! I KNOW THIS SOMEHOW ENDS WITH YOU CONSIGNING OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY TO THE CATACOMBS THEN BEATING US TO DEATH WITH YOUR RELATIVELY MIDDLEBROW ACHIEVEMENTS! But mate: you are 55 \u2013 FIFTY-FIVE \u2013 years old. How, how can you possibly still be wanking on about any of this, in public, as though it was still the best thing you\u2019ve ever done? Can it really be because it was? [Spoiler: yes.] It feels doubly shameful that this gilded overpromotee should have failed to defend Darroch, a scholarship boy who grew up in a council house, but who appears to have drawn rather less self-admiring attention to his own background than Johnson insists upon doing every time his carers let him out. He may use longer words, but Johnson\u2019s sledgehammer self-admiration does not differ materially from the US president\u2019s diurnal reminders that he is a strong, good-looking and very stable genius. In many ways, there can be no greater therapist\u2019s case study than Trump. If \u2013 like many of us at times in our lives \u2013 you are one of those people who thinks they\u2019d feel better about themselves if they only got that promotion/ earned more money/ were more successful in whichever way, then will you just look at this guy. LOOK AT HIM. He\u2019s the actual president of the actual United States of America, and he still spends half his time tweeting on the bog, horrifyingly weakly, about people who should be so far below his sight line as to not even remotely register. What a reminder that it\u2019s really not about how you do externally. Unless you take care of your shit, it\u2019s still there inside, gnawing you to bits, and it never goes away. For all his unrivalled power and immense wealth, Donald Trump is by far and away the most insecure person most of us have ever seen. And it looks like we\u2019re getting our own, small-pond version of him inside of a fortnight. If only alleged strongman Boris Johnson had found some way of taking care of his shit. Instead, we\u2019ll be picking up the tab. Still, I\u2019m sure every Briton will be honoured by the chance to play their small part in the larger story of this one defective, arrogant man. Or, to put it in classical terms we can all understand, the guy who really puts the anus into Coriolanus. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",
