      "bodyText": "Santi Cazorla\u2019s first La Liga goals since 2012 stunned Real Madrid and stole struggling Villarreal a 2-2 draw at Estadio de la Cer\u00e1mica. The former Arsenal midfielder struck twice \u2013 including an 82nd-minute equaliser \u2013 as Real slumped to an eighth league game without victory in 17 games this season, leaving them seven points adrift of the leaders, Barcelona. Cazorla has relaunched his injury-hit career back in Spain this season, returning to his homeland after a six-year stint with the Gunners that was cut short by a terrible run of injuries. And the 34-year-old found the net in Spanish top-flight action for the first time since scoring for M\u00e1laga in a 1-1 draw at Osasuna on 23 April, 2012, when he put Villarreal ahead after four minutes on Thursday night. Cazorla bent a wonderful shot into the bottom corner to ignite a game rescheduled due to Real\u2019s participation in last month\u2019s Club World Cup. But the European champions struck back three minutes later with a headed goal from Karim Benzema after a sweeping attacking move. Rapha\u00ebl Varane gave the visitors the lead in the 20th minute with a header from a free-kick but Cazorla had the final say when he ghosted into the box undetected to nod home at the back post and give his side a deserved point in the new coach Luis Garc\u00eda Plaza\u2019s first home game in charge. Gareth Bale was withdrawn at half-time in another blow to Real, having appeared to struggle with a possible left calf complaint late in the first half. \u201cIt could be said the result was fair,\u201d Real\u2019s coach, Santiago Solari, said. \u201cWe chased the victory and had it in our hands. We wanted to kill the game off and they put us under a lot of pressure as they were at home and they badly needed the points. When Gareth came off we lost a bit of sharpness in attack, we still had the chance to score a couple but we needed to attack with more clarity.\u201d Villarreal, who have reached the last 32 of the Europa League despite a dire domestic season, clawed their way out of the relegation zone to 17th in the standings, level on points with 18th-placed Athletic Bilbao. \u201cThis result will give us strength,\u201d said Garc\u00eda, who has taken two points from two games since succeeding the sacked Javi Calleja. \u201cI imagine that every game from now on will be a battle, a war to survive, but hopefully we\u2019ll come through it and this point gives us a big emotional boost.\u201d",

When Liverpool watch the replays they will barely comprehend how Stones\u2019s final swing of the ball missed Salah, from point-blank range, when even the merest of touches would have resulted in a goal. City made the most of their fortune and, when Sergio Ag\u00fcero put them into the lead, five minutes before half-time, it was a reminder that the truly great strikers tend to save their best for the big occasions. Bernardo Silva did the build-up work on the left and for the first time Ag\u00fcero had manoeuvred a yard for himself inside the penalty area. He was still left with an acute angle, shooting left to right, with an outstanding goalkeeper to beat in the shape of Alisson. Ag\u00fcero had nicked the ball in front of Dejan Lovren but still had his opponent in close proximity. It was the kind of shooting opportunity, on the half-turn, that many strikers would have passed up, concluding that the chances of scoring were too remote. His finish was a beauty \u2013 swivelling on the spot and connecting with power and precision. The ball was still rising as it soared between Alisson and his near post and City had the breakthrough they craved. That goal continued Ag\u00fcero\u2019s record of having scored on all seven occasions he has faced Liverpool in league fixtures at this stadium. More importantly, it gave the home team an element of control when, until that point, Liverpool had seldom looked in trouble. Robertson had been coping with Sterling, Alexander-Arnold had the speed and agility to match San\u00e9 and, until that piece of brilliance from Ag\u00fcero, it was unusual to see City finding it so difficult to create chances. Equally, the same could be said of Liverpool for most of the game and, if City\u2019s supporters had any apprehension about seeing Danilo and Aymeric Laporte operating as their team\u2019s full-backs, it was gone by the end. Liverpool\u2019s 20-match unbeaten run was over and, for City, the title race had opened up with new possibilities.",

Very intense and we were unlucky in our finishing moments. A bit more unlucky than City. That was one of the main differences They had periods where they dominated but we came back and had big chances. We had Mo with a big save from Ederson and Gini from a set-piece. You have to score in those moments. If you think of the goal Aguero scored there is no angle. Nice goal. In a similar situation we didn\u2019t score. But everyone can see why we have the points we have. We made it really difficult. I\u2019ve said to the boys it\u2019s completely okay. We could have drawn, we could have won. We lost but it is not the biggest problem. I really like Vincent Kompany. But how on earth is that not a red card? He is the last man and if he hits Mo more he is out for the season. He knows Mo is that quick so he takes the risk. I don\u2019t know if the ref saw it. I saw it, after the game especially. We carry on. I think we can play better.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2e8b83e4b072dc52e680a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-03T22:24:56.621Z\">10.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>This is the first time in Pep Guardiola\u2019s time at Manchester City that they\u2019ve had less possession than their opponents in the Premier League. </b>Liverpool had 51% possession.

We have Zinchenko but I didn\u2019t want to put this young guy under pressure against Salah. It was not easy for Laporte. But they fought for everybody. Fernandinho, Sergio, Bernardo. We need Sergio in these games. He has special quality in these positions. He has done it all his career. His finish was incredible. They had the first clear chance. We were unlucky. But after we played real good. We scored two and created more. It is important we showed courage. I apologise for what happened with the fourth official. If we had lost today it was almost done. It would have been so difficult. But we cannot forget we are four points behind them and they are the leaders. But this gives us a lot of confidence. Fernandinho is back. We have played a lot without key players. It is not easy for us. Now rest. Then the FA Cup.

In fact Liverpool often looked comfortable in the first half, only to let Aguero in shortly before half-time, and there was nothing to suggest Sane\u2019s winner was on the way after Roberto Firmino\u2019s equaliser.

They\u2019ve had injuries to important players, particularly Fernandinho, but those were still avoidable defeats against Crystal Palace and Leicester. This is a big mental test now for Guardiola\u2019s side. Down the years Guardiola hasn\u2019t really had a comeback title win. The question many people are asking now is whether City are capable of chasing Liverpool. That remains to be seen given that they were under such little pressure at the top last season. You sense they could start to drift if they lose tonight - that it could become a little like the 16-17 season. That said, I make City title favourites if they hand Liverpool their first league defeat.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2e54d3e4b02fb91ff0db6d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-03T18:40:36.033Z\">6.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>I\u2019d like to talk more about the idea that Pep Guardiola\u2019s sides don\u2019t cope well under pressure.</strong> I definitely think there\u2019s something in it. When they\u2019re on top his teams can look utterly untouchable \u2013 think Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Bayern in the Bundesliga, City last season. The football is so perfect, the kill so beautiful, that resistance can seem futile. But how do they respond when things go wrong? In the 2011-12 season Barcelona didn\u2019t deal well with chasing Real Madrid and they made an enormous mess of their Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, a tie they shouldn\u2019t have lost for so many reasons. </p> <p>Then, at Bayern, domestic dominance seemed to hurt them at the business end in Europe. They never even made it to a final; they panicked against Madrid in 2014 (Guardiola still kicks himself over that second leg), fell apart against Barcelona and Leo Messi in 2015 and failed to combat Atletico Madrid\u2019s counterattacks in 2016. The tie against Barca feels particularly instructive. Messi scored the opener quite late on and a 1-0 away defeat in the first leg probably would have been a good result for Bayern. Instead they were out of it after conceding twice more.</p> <p>It seems to be a trend and a weakness that Guardiola\u2019s teams concede in bursts in difficult moments. It happened twice at Anfield last season, domestically and in the Champions League, and it\u2019s not easy to figure out the cause. Is it down to his managerial style? That they tend to be so dominant of the ball that they aren\u2019t really geared to defend and don\u2019t know how to react when things go wrong? Is it, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic alleged, that Guardiola likes obedient players who follow his instructions? If that\u2019s the case, are his teams capable of thinking on their foot on the pitch? You might say not given how they faltered against Lyon when Guardiola was serving a touchline ban earlier this season.</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into all this. We are, after all, not dealing with a huge sample size. But I\u2019m interested to know what you think.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2e54bae4b072dc52e67f15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-03T18:30:39.455Z\">6.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>While we wait for teams, here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s match preview.</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/02/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-challenge-winning-ugly\">Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City face new challenge of winning ugly | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2de535e4b0cebe7617f2c1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-03T15:29:25.060Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hello. </strong>Go back to the start of this decade and the manager who really gave Pep Guardiola the heebie-jeebies was Jose Mourinho. It was Mourinho\u2019s Internazionale side who denied Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona another Champions League title with a resolute counterattacking performance in 2010; it was Mourinho\u2019s Real Madrid who took the La Liga title off Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona in 2012. Fast forward to 2016 and some pundits reckoned that Mourinho\u2019s arrival in Manchester at the same time as the Catalan was going to be the Premier League\u2019s defining rivalry. Not quite, of course. Time moves on and a new nemesis has emerged to keep Guardiola up at night. His name, as you well know, is Jurgen Klopp.</p> <p>It\u2019s become obvious that nobody troubles Guardiola more than Liverpool\u2019s manager, who has a 7-5 winning record over his Manchester City counterpart after their spells in England and Germany. There\u2019s been less heavy metal football from Klopp this season, but that hasn\u2019t hurt Liverpool\u2019s assault on the Premier League title. They head to the Etihad Stadium with a seven-point lead over the champions and it could be another damp squib of a title race if they stretch their advantage further this evening. Liverpool, who remain unbeaten after 20 games, have a chance to make one hell of a statement. Few people envisaged such a scenario developing at the start of the season, but it\u2019s clear that Klopp isn\u2019t overawed by taking on Guardiola. They meet on a level playing field and instead of hanging on to City\u2019s coattails, it\u2019s Liverpool who are threatening to sprint into the distance.</p> <p>This one is fascinatingly poised. In November all the talk was of City going another season unbeaten or breaking the 100-point barrier. When Liverpool grabbed that bizarre last-minute winner in the Merseyside derby at the start of December, it almost felt like the race had been prolonged for another week or two. Yet the picture has changed in the past month. One theory is that City are so geared towards achieving footballing perfection that they don\u2019t know how to react when their supremacy is challenged. They\u2019ve stuttered since losing to Chelsea, giving Liverpool a leg-up after defeats to Crystal Palace and Leicester City over the festive period. They\u2019ve started making sloppy mistakes and have looked mentally uncertain during their moment of self-doubt. Perhaps it\u2019s a flaw in Guardiola\u2019s approach; his teams have always been liable to self-implode when challenged. It could be a personality glitch. <strike> Bald fraud. </strike></p> <p>Either way, the question now is whether City are capable of playing catch-up. That\u2019s hard to call. None of Guardiola\u2019s titles have been won from losing positions, whether with Barca, Bayern or City; they\u2019ve mostly tended to race out in front early on and cruise from there. Mind you, it does feel slightly weird to say that all the pressure\u2019s on City. Liverpool, after all, are looking to scratch the most irritating of itches and satisfy their yearning for a first league title since 1990. There\u2019s still so much football to play, but it must already feel tantalisingly close. It remains to be seen how they\u2019ll cope with the weight of history on their shoulders, especially if their lead is cut to four points tonight.</p> <p>For now, though, the vibe is different to the 2013-14 season. At the moment it\u2019s hard to see Liverpool slipping and giving the ball to a Demba Ba type. They feel mature and controlled. While they\u2019re a devastating attacking force with Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane up front, they\u2019ve also developed a knack for grinding out results. With Alisson Becker in goal and Virgil Van Dijk at the back, they\u2019ve only let in four goals. They\u2019ll fancy their chances against City. They can open up a nine-point lead over Spurs again.</p> <p>Then again they know the size of the task facing them here. According to Klopp, City are still the best team in the world. \u201cIt is one of the most difficult games you can play in the modern football world, away at City,\u201d he says. And you can see his point. When they are at their best, there\u2019s nothing quite like a Guardiola side in full flow. They\u2019re far too good to be written off yet. For Guardiola, though, the challenge is to get his players thinking clearly again. Immaculate focus is required against a team Liverpool\u2019s focus \u2013 on the pitch and on the touchline. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>8pm GMT.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e7828d9779b8afb10d04dd6c153592c300c22b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e7828d9779b8afb10d04dd6c153592c300c22b8/0_0_3500_2367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"To Manchester!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To Manchester!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-03T18:59:37.411Z\">at 6.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. It\u2019s been a thrilling night. Manchester City have gone four points behind Liverpool at the top of the league and the title race is fascinatingly poised. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye! Jurgen Klopp speaks! \u201cIt was big pressure on the game. Very intense and we were unlucky in our finishing moments. A bit more unlucky than City. That was one of the main differences They had periods where they dominated but we came back and had big chances. We had Mo with a big save from Ederson and Gini from a set-piece. You have to score in those moments. If you think of the goal Aguero scored there is no angle. Nice goal. In a similar situation we didn\u2019t score. But everyone can see why we have the points we have. We made it really difficult. I\u2019ve said to the boys it\u2019s completely okay. We could have drawn, we could have won. We lost but it is not the biggest problem. I really like Vincent Kompany. But how on earth is that not a red card? He is the last man and if he hits Mo more he is out for the season. He knows Mo is that quick so he takes the risk. I don\u2019t know if the ref saw it. I saw it, after the game especially. We carry on. I think we can play better.\u201d This is the first time in Pep Guardiola\u2019s time at Manchester City that they\u2019ve had less possession than their opponents in the Premier League. Liverpool had 51% possession. AWARD THEM THE POINTS NOW. Pep Guardiola speaks! \u201cThe boxes made the difference. We were outstanding from the first minute. I am happy to reduce our gap against Liverpool and come back to second position. Everything is open. We don\u2019t have a left-back. We have Zinchenko but I didn\u2019t want to put this young guy under pressure against Salah. It was not easy for Laporte. But they fought for everybody. Fernandinho, Sergio, Bernardo. We need Sergio in these games. He has special quality in these positions. He has done it all his career. His finish was incredible. They had the first clear chance. We were unlucky. But after we played real good. We scored two and created more. It is important we showed courage. I apologise for what happened with the fourth official. If we had lost today it was almost done. It would have been so difficult. But we cannot forget we are four points behind them and they are the leaders. But this gives us a lot of confidence. Fernandinho is back. We have played a lot without key players. It is not easy for us. Now rest. Then the FA Cup. Then go game by game.\u201d It\u2019s still in Liverpool\u2019s hands, so it\u2019s interesting to look at their fixtures. Potential stick games? They have West Ham, Manchester United and Everton away on 4 February, 24 February and 2 March. They also still have to host Tottenham and Chelsea. But they\u2019ll fancy themselves in most of their home games and have away games against five sides in the current bottom half. One of the most satisfying things for Manchester City tonight is how strong they were without the ball. It\u2019s an underrated part of their game. This was a real grind and they worked so hard out of possession. Liverpool were rarely allowed to develop any flow in attack. Their front three weren\u2019t allowed to click. John Stones is asked about his part in Ederson\u2019s near calamity in the first half. \u201cI tried to just take everything to be honest,\u201d the Manchester City defender says. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it was quite tight. I\u2019m just happy it didn\u2019t go over the line. It\u2019s one of those things where the keeper\u2019s shouting and the defender wants to clear it. I tried to take him and the ball and it\u2019s come back off him. I just reacted quickly.\u201d Vincent Kompany speaks! \u201cI\u2019m not even worried about the result. I\u2019m buzzing with a tremendous performance. We went toe to toe with a very aggressive and physical team and matched them. It\u2019s still in Liverpool\u2019s hands. But we are a better team when we play with emotions.\u201d The defender\u2019s asked about his foul on Mohamed Salah in the first half. \u201cI thought it was a great challenge. Was it not? Oh. I got the ball, a bit of the man. It wasn\u2019t naughty, I didn\u2019t try to injure him.\u201d Here\u2019s Daniel Taylor\u2019s report from the Etihad Stadium. Hopefully this is the start of a memorable race to the finishing line. Neutrals won\u2019t want to see Liverpool collapse after their first setback of the season. They shouldn\u2019t kick themselves too much. It was a game of fine margins and Manchester City, who looked very nervy at times, just edged it thanks to those snappy strikes from Sergio Aguero and Leroy Sane. I\u2019m not sure this was elite City this evening. They were very intense and their rigid back four worked well, but they didn\u2019t really spend 90 minutes slicing Liverpool open. In fact Liverpool often looked comfortable in the first half, only to let Aguero in shortly before half-time, and there was nothing to suggest Sane\u2019s winner was on the way after Roberto Firmino\u2019s equaliser. Jurgen Klopp will want to focus on the positives and stress that his team had chances to snatch an equaliser. City, however, will reckon they\u2019re over the hump now. Liverpool, of course, remain top but Manchester City have cut their lead to four points thanks to Leroy Sane\u2019s winner. Third-placed Tottenham are six points behind. Blue Moon blares out across the Etihad Stadium. A bewildered Jurgen Klopp walks on to the pitch to console his beaten players. Liverpool can\u2019t believe they\u2019ve lost this one. Manchester City\u2019s fans are savouring every moment. Klopp walks over to applaud the away end. He\u2019s wearing a grim expression. He knows his team were very close to killing off City\u2019s title hopes tonight. Momentum is back with the champions now, though. The title race is back on! Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten run is over! 90 min+6: We are past the allotted five minutes. There\u2019s barely any time left. 90 min+5: Ederson\u2019s booked for timewasting at a goal-kick. 90 min+4: Ederson charges from his line to punch a long ball clear. Moments later Aguero tries to catch Alisson off his line from inside his own half! He does not score. He does not get close. 90 min+3: Alexander-Arnold makes to the byline after poor defending from Sane but Danilo cuts out his cross. 90 min+2: Liverpool are camped in City\u2019s half now. Van Dijk has gone forward! 90 min: City waste two chances to seal it! Lovren fails to control Shaqiri\u2019s pass inside his own area and Bernardo Silva nips in. He runs through but Alisson stands tall and makes a fine save from the midfielder\u2019s thumping effort. The rebound comes back to Sterling, who lashes a shot through the bodies and wide of the right post! Five added minutes. 89 min: Bernardo Silva has been booked for a foul on Fabinho. 88 min: City make their final change. Nicolas Otamendi replaces Vincent Kompany. 86 min: Daniel Sturridge replaces Gini Wijnaldum. Kyle Walker is on for Aymeric Laporte. This is incredibly tense and dramatic now. City are fretting. 85 min: From the resulting corner, City are all at sea! Ederson flaps and Wijnaldum - I think - almost forces the ball over the line at the far post! Somehow it\u2019s cleared and whipped away from Van Dijk. City survive. Just. 84 min: With City screaming for a foul on Fernandinho by Firmino, Liverpool attack. The ball\u2019s played through for Salah, who has the better of Stones. The Egyptian shoots low from the left, aiming for the far corner, but Ederson pushes it wide! Guardiola goes mad on the touchline. He roars at the fourth official and chucks his scarf on the floor! Anthony Taylor runs over to have a word. 82 min: City counter, Sterling surging past a tiring Robertson and racing into Liverpool\u2019s half. Sterling slips a pass through to Aguero, who\u2019s in the clear, with only Alisson to beat. He tries to skip to the goalkeeper\u2019s right and looks to have done the hard part. But just when it seems Aguero\u2019s going to roll the ball home and kill Liverpool off, Alisson dives bravely at his feet and concedes a corner! 81 min: Head tennis in the City area! Alexander-Arnold turns the ball across goal and Kompany heads into the air. Liverpool try to force a chance, but City stand firm. 80 min: Sane breaks down the left, skips inside and finds Sterling, who can\u2019t make up his mind, allowing Robertson to tackle him. 79 min: City haven\u2019t really been tested since restoring their lead. We\u2019re still waiting for the second Liverpool wave. 77 min: Xherdan Shaqiri replaces Sadio Mane. 73 min: Before the goal I was about to suggest that City would be putting De Bruyne on soon. But now it\u2019s Liverpool who are thinking of an attacking change. Xherdan Shaqiri is getting ready. Raheem Sterling, seemingly played just onside by Lovren, turns on the right and starts a dangerous City attack. He dribbles inside and plays a pass to the left for Sane, who\u2019s been well contained by Alexander-Arnold tonight. Until now. The German doesn\u2019t waste time thinking what to do. Instead he gets the ball out of his feet and whacks a low, diagonal left-footed drive across Alisson, against the inside of the left post and into the back of the net to restore City\u2019s lead! I was just about to say that City weren\u2019t threatening. 67 min: City look slightly shocked. They need to shake that goal out of their system as soon as possible. 65 min: Ilkay Gundogan replaces David Silva, who hasn\u2019t done much tonight. Trent Alexander-Arnold, such a good crosser of the ball, sets this goal in motion and the final assist comes from Liverpool\u2019s other full-back. Alexander-Arnold cuts back on to his left foot on the right and lifts a deep cross to the far post. Danilo\u2019s in trouble and Andrew Robertson arrives to turn the ball back across goal, giving the unmarked Firmino the easy task of heading in from close range! Advantage Liverpool! They\u2019ve silenced the home fans. Liverpool are level! 63 min: A free-kick to Liverpool just inside City\u2019s half leads to a scramble in the area. Ederson comes to try and collect Alexander-Arnold\u2019s delivery, but Kompany heads it away. With Ederson stranded, Firmino picks up possession and hammers a shot goalwards. But Kompany\u2019s raced back to clear off the line and City survive! 61 min: Fernandinho is having a wonderful game. That is all. 59 min: Danilo dribbles inside from the right and pings a shot wide from 25 yards. Alisson wasn\u2019t worried. 57 min: Liverpool replace James Milner with Fabinho. 56 min: Robertson finds space on the left and swings a cross into the area. It\u2019s headed away but Alexander-Arnold charges on to the loose ball and lets fly with his right foot. The ball flashes a few yards wide of the left post. 55 min: Liverpool are struggling to do anything right in possession. Which is probably why Fabinho is getting ready to come on soon. 53 min: Fernandinho, who\u2019s having a storming game, whips a shot miles over from 20 yards. 52 min: Sterling charges at Robertson on the right, drives inside the area and tries to check back inside the Liverpool left-back. Robertson stands firm and Sterling goes down. The City fans scream for a penalty, but they\u2019re pushing it a bit. 51 min: Mane darts down the left after a raking pass from Firmino, but his cross is straight at Ederson. \u201cDo you think Klopp is too loyal to his Captain?\u201d Chris Healy says. \u201cHenderson started all three Champions League away games and Liverpool lost all three. Fabinho was good at Chelsea, great against United and Shaqiri is much more a front foot player. I just don\u2019t think Henderson\u2019s performances justify his inclusion in the big games and there are better options sitting on the bench.\u201d 50 min: Anthony Taylor does a passable imitation of Dejan Lovren by slipping inside Liverpool\u2019s area. I\u2019m here all week. 48 min: City are in control at the start of the second half. They\u2019re dominating possession. 46 min: Manchester City get the second half underway. There have been no substitutions. Another look at that Kompany tackle on Salah: the defender was off the ground and out of control. It could easily have been a red. Half-time emails \u201cAmazingly, I\u2019m feeling pretty serene about this,\u201d Matt Dony says. \u201cI mean, Liverpool almost certainly won\u2019t go through the whole season unbeaten, so I can\u2019t stress too much over being behind. And it seems hard to believe that Liverpool won\u2019t score at least one goal. This is an unfamiliar feeling. I\u2019m used to simple despair after bad results, and a fear that things will soon go wrong after good results, with very little in between. A semi-confident acceptance, with the sure knowledge that there will be good results in the rest of the season, is alien, uncertain territory. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d \u201cI feel like through the years I\u2019ve seen Ag\u00fcero score this type of goal many times,\u201d Kari Tulinius says. \u201cHe receives the ball in traffic, without an inch of space, yet somehow manages to get off a powerful shot into the top corner. Is there a striker playing today who\u2019s better at scoring from tight angles than Ag\u00fcero?\u201d It\u2019s been frenetic and absorbing and City have a crucial lead thanks to a poacher\u2019s goal from the magnificent Sergio Aguero. Liverpool will feel aggrieved to be behind, though. They\u2019ll argue that Vincent Kompany should be off and they\u2019ll also reflect on that ridiculous early scramble in City\u2019s area. It\u2019s all to play for in the second half. See you in 15 minutes. I\u2019m off to get some cherries. 45 min+1: Laporte picks up a booking for clumping Milner. Two of City\u2019s back four are on yellows now. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. 44 min: The home fans are taunting Liverpool\u2019s away support with that Allez! Allez! Allez! song. 43 min: There\u2019s been no response from Liverpool yet. City fancy a second before half-time. Liverpool suddenly look vulnerable down the left. Sane bursts behind Alexander-Arnold and although the angle\u2019s tight, his cross-shot forces Alisson to claw the ball clear. Sterling fastens on to the rebound but runs out of room. City keep pressing, though. Another cross comes into the box and Aguero goes down under a challenge from Van Dijk. Nothing doing. Still City press. Bernardo Silva picks up possession and runs down the left. He reaches the byline and digs a ball into the six-yard box. Aguero nips in front of the dozing Lovren and smashes an unstoppable shot past a stunned Alisson with his left foot to give City the lead with their first worthwhile attempt! City\u2019s main man does it again! 40 min: There\u2019s plenty of chatter that Kompany deserved a red for that tackle on Salah. I remember him being sent off for a similar one against Manchester United in 2012. maybe the fact we\u2019re talking about it so much is because nothing\u2019s happening. But... 38 min: Wijnaldum pulls back Sane and receives a booking. 37 min: Looking at that earlier goalline clearance from Stones, he somehow managed to nutmeg the advancing Salah. It\u2019s absurd Liverpool aren\u2019t ahead. 33 min: Sane scoots behind Lovren on the right and pulls the ball back into the area. Van Dijk boots it behind for a corner, from which nothing occurs. 31 min: Under no pressure just inside City\u2019s half Stones overhits a simple pass to Kompany. Salah nips in to try to win the ball, forcing Kompany to go to ground to stop the Egyptian racing clear. However the City defender\u2019s tackle lacks control and he sends Salah flying. Kompany looks astonished to receive a yellow card, but he can\u2019t really have any complaints after jumping into the challenge. 28 min: A long ball down the right from Fernandinho sends Sterling tearing away down the right. He has the legs on Robertson and he\u2019s able to cut back and pull the ball back to David Silva. This is the clearest opening so far for City. But Silva fails to sort his feet out properly and it\u2019s easy for the immovable Van Dijk to block his weak prod. 24 min: Aguero swivels a pass through to David Silva on the left, but Van Dijk sticks out a leg to clear the Spaniard\u2019s cutback in the six-yard box. Liverpool are defending very well. City haven\u2019t had a shot yet. 21 min: The goalline technology system shows the ball was 0.00000000000000001mm from going over the line before Stones cleared it. No goal, then, but City have had their warning and Liverpool know they can get at them now. 20 min: Having enjoyed that escape, City look to respond in kind. Aguero spins Lovren, who brings him down heavily. It\u2019s a booking for the Liverpool centre-back. 18 min: Liverpool mount an attack that starts from the edge of their own area. It\u2019s a splendid move and it picks up dangerous moment when Salah turns in the middle of City\u2019s half, combines with with Fimrino and makes towards the area. This is so slick and City are in real trouble when Salah slips a clever pass through to Mane. He\u2019s through on goal and the stadium goes silent! He\u2019s there before Ederson and slips a low shot towards the right corner. Is it going in? No! The ball hits the base of the post and rebounds out. Stones tries to hack it clear from near his own goal but strikes his clearance straight against the prone Ederson! The ball bounces back towards goal and with Salah closing in, Stones scoops clear before the ball crosses the line! What an incredible sequence! 15 min: Liverpool are keeping City away from Alisson at the moment. In fact, we haven\u2019t seen much from City\u2019s creative players yet. The two Silvas are yet to affect the game and Liverpool are starting to fancy themselves going forward, though their latest attack ends when Fernandinho pinches Salah\u2019s pocket in the area. 12 min: Sterling tries to beat Robertson on the right. The Liverpool fans enjoy seeing their left-back win this duel. It\u2019s a big night for Sterling, who never seems to play well against his old side. 11 min: The game has started to simmer down a little. \u201cI think Pep\u2019s team can\u2019t, in Zidane\u2019s words, \u201csuffer\u201d and win,\u201d Joseph Lam says. \u201cZidane\u2019s side always seem to be able to crank out wins having been on the ropes for much of the game -- it\u2019s a quality that Pep\u2019s Barca, Bayern and City all seem to lack. And to address Paul Fitzgerald, Pep\u2019s side have had their fair share of bad luck, but there was nothing unlucky about that 2014 Madrid tie. They were absolutely eviscerated in Munich.\u201d 9 min: Now Liverpool attack, with Robertson\u2019s ball from the left finding Mane in City\u2019s half. This is better from the leaders. Mane spreads it out to Alexander-Arnold on the right and the youngster\u2019s cross hits a City defender and bounces through to Ederson. 7 min: City have started with furious intensity. They\u2019re flying into the midfield challenges. This is going to be a huge test of Liverpool\u2019s nerve. 5 min: Fernandinho barrels forward, takes a heavy touch, gets clipped by Henderson and charges straight into Robertson, who stays down. City continue to attack until Anthony Taylor stops play to let Robertson get some treatment. 4 min: Every Liverpool touch is being booed. Every Liverpool mistake is being jeered. The City fans are up for this and Liverpool are causing a few problems for themselves. 3 min: With his back to goal on the left, Aguero turns and brilliantly wriggles clear of a couple of Liverpool defenders. However his cross towards Sterling drifts out of play. Soon City are heading down the left, Sane occupying two defenders. The German makes space and drives towards the byline before firing a low ball into the middle, but it\u2019s too close to Alisson. 2 min: There was some speculation that City would be playing with a back three, but Laporte is at left-back. How conventional from Guardiola. Liverpool, meanwhile, look a little nervous early on. Alisson, normally so cool with the ball at his feet, shanks a clearance straight out for a throw, much to the amusement of the City fans. Liverpool need to be careful here. Peep! Liverpool, all in red, get the game underway. The home fans, looking to create an intimidating atmosphere, are whistling and jeering their every touch. Liverpool, licking from right to left in the first half, immediately give the ball away. Start as you mean to go on, lads. Here come the teams! We\u2019ll have football soon! When was the last Premier League game as significant as this one? \u201cI suspect that \u2018perfect or nothing at all\u2019 is part of Barcelona\u2019s, and hence Guardiola\u2019s, DNA,\u201d Philip Podolsky says. \u201cThey only ever won the Champions League in the seasons they\u2019ve swept La Liga as well: Madrid\u2019s record is almost the polar opposite.\u201d Jurgen Klopp speaks! \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can come here and expect three points. You need to be ready to suffer. All the effort you put in doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll win. What makes is dangerous for them is you have to play football. Put them under pressure. It will be a tough game. Play as good as you can, run as much you can, close the gaps, play football in the best way. Create organised chaos in their defence. It is difficult. If you play 95 minutes against City you are not 80 minutes in front of their goal. You have to calm down a little bit and let them run. The boys know what to do. They have to do it in the right moment and we will be fine.\u201d Pep Guardiola speaks! \u201cWe will try to attack and defend well. It is not just enough to attack or just to defend. We know each other well. I think the plan is good. In the box it makes the difference. The boxes make the difference. When you are precise the rest is easy.\u201d Pre-match emails \u201cI think there\u2019s something in that idea of perfection suddenly having to stretch itself,\u201d Paul Fitzgerald says. \u201cBut I also think luck played a part. I remember the 2nd Leg of the Inter game and they were quite unlucky ( people forget that Bojan scored and was wrongly adjudged to be offside). And his Bayern still dominated against madrid even though the system wasn\u2019t quite right. But tonight is big.\u201d \u201cInteresting starting lineups,\u201d Peter Oh says. \u201cGuardiola may regret ignoring the cautionary proverb people who walk through glass tunnels shouldn\u2019t throw on Stones.\u201d \u201cIs the reason that Pep\u2019s teams seem to struggle when under pressure simply that they\u2019re a bit like a jet engine - they either work perfectly or not at all? \u201c David Hopkins says. Manchester City make two changes after beating Southampton. John Stones replaces Oleksandr Zinchenko, meaning that Aymeric Laporte moves to left-back, and Leroy Sane is in for Riyad Mahrez. Kevin de Bruyne starts on the bench. Mohamed Salah might fancy his chances against Laporte. Liverpool make two changes after thrashing Arsenal. Jordan Henderson replaces Fabinho and Jurgen Klopp stiffens his midfield by starting James Milner instead of Xherdan Shaqiri. Manchester City: Ederson, Danilo, Stones, Kompany, Laporte; Fernandinho; Sterling, Silva, Bernardo, Sane; Aguero. Subs: Muric, Walker, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Mahrez, Otamendi, Jesus. Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Milner, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Mignolet, Moreno, Fabinho, Keita, Shaqiri, Lallana, Sturridge. Referee: Anthony Taylor. \u201cWhile this is a mouth-wateringly \u2018big\u2019 game and the timing of it, following City\u2019s recent falterings, is perfect, I see it as far from decisive,\u201d Dean Kinsella says. \u201cLiverpool are fab to watch and have good midfield options, but I cannot see their cavalier approach lasting the whole season. Stumbling a little only seems a Van Dijk or Alison injury away.\u201d I don\u2019t think Liverpool have been cavalier. Obviously an injury to Van Dijk or Alisson would hurt them badly, but they\u2019ve only conceded eight goals. For all the doubts over Manchester City, Jurgen Klopp still thinks they\u2019re the best around. Let the mind games begin! Further to that, of course, is the way that Manchester City have struggled in recent weeks. They\u2019ve had injuries to important players, particularly Fernandinho, but those were still avoidable defeats against Crystal Palace and Leicester. This is a big mental test now for Guardiola\u2019s side. Down the years Guardiola hasn\u2019t really had a comeback title win. The question many people are asking now is whether City are capable of chasing Liverpool. That remains to be seen given that they were under such little pressure at the top last season. You sense they could start to drift if they lose tonight - that it could become a little like the 16-17 season. That said, I make City title favourites if they hand Liverpool their first league defeat. I\u2019d like to talk more about the idea that Pep Guardiola\u2019s sides don\u2019t cope well under pressure. I definitely think there\u2019s something in it. When they\u2019re on top his teams can look utterly untouchable \u2013 think Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Bayern in the Bundesliga, City last season. The football is so perfect, the kill so beautiful, that resistance can seem futile. But how do they respond when things go wrong? In the 2011-12 season Barcelona didn\u2019t deal well with chasing Real Madrid and they made an enormous mess of their Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, a tie they shouldn\u2019t have lost for so many reasons. Then, at Bayern, domestic dominance seemed to hurt them at the business end in Europe. They never even made it to a final; they panicked against Madrid in 2014 (Guardiola still kicks himself over that second leg), fell apart against Barcelona and Leo Messi in 2015 and failed to combat Atletico Madrid\u2019s counterattacks in 2016. The tie against Barca feels particularly instructive. Messi scored the opener quite late on and a 1-0 away defeat in the first leg probably would have been a good result for Bayern. Instead they were out of it after conceding twice more. It seems to be a trend and a weakness that Guardiola\u2019s teams concede in bursts in difficult moments. It happened twice at Anfield last season, domestically and in the Champions League, and it\u2019s not easy to figure out the cause. Is it down to his managerial style? That they tend to be so dominant of the ball that they aren\u2019t really geared to defend and don\u2019t know how to react when things go wrong? Is it, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic alleged, that Guardiola likes obedient players who follow his instructions? If that\u2019s the case, are his teams capable of thinking on their foot on the pitch? You might say not given how they faltered against Lyon when Guardiola was serving a touchline ban earlier this season. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into all this. We are, after all, not dealing with a huge sample size. But I\u2019m interested to know what you think. While we wait for teams, here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s match preview. Hello. Go back to the start of this decade and the manager who really gave Pep Guardiola the heebie-jeebies was Jose Mourinho. It was Mourinho\u2019s Internazionale side who denied Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona another Champions League title with a resolute counterattacking performance in 2010; it was Mourinho\u2019s Real Madrid who took the La Liga title off Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona in 2012. Fast forward to 2016 and some pundits reckoned that Mourinho\u2019s arrival in Manchester at the same time as the Catalan was going to be the Premier League\u2019s defining rivalry. Not quite, of course. Time moves on and a new nemesis has emerged to keep Guardiola up at night. His name, as you well know, is Jurgen Klopp. It\u2019s become obvious that nobody troubles Guardiola more than Liverpool\u2019s manager, who has a 7-5 winning record over his Manchester City counterpart after their spells in England and Germany. There\u2019s been less heavy metal football from Klopp this season, but that hasn\u2019t hurt Liverpool\u2019s assault on the Premier League title. They head to the Etihad Stadium with a seven-point lead over the champions and it could be another damp squib of a title race if they stretch their advantage further this evening. Liverpool, who remain unbeaten after 20 games, have a chance to make one hell of a statement. Few people envisaged such a scenario developing at the start of the season, but it\u2019s clear that Klopp isn\u2019t overawed by taking on Guardiola. They meet on a level playing field and instead of hanging on to City\u2019s coattails, it\u2019s Liverpool who are threatening to sprint into the distance. This one is fascinatingly poised. In November all the talk was of City going another season unbeaten or breaking the 100-point barrier. When Liverpool grabbed that bizarre last-minute winner in the Merseyside derby at the start of December, it almost felt like the race had been prolonged for another week or two. Yet the picture has changed in the past month. One theory is that City are so geared towards achieving footballing perfection that they don\u2019t know how to react when their supremacy is challenged. They\u2019ve stuttered since losing to Chelsea, giving Liverpool a leg-up after defeats to Crystal Palace and Leicester City over the festive period. They\u2019ve started making sloppy mistakes and have looked mentally uncertain during their moment of self-doubt. Perhaps it\u2019s a flaw in Guardiola\u2019s approach; his teams have always been liable to self-implode when challenged. It could be a personality glitch. Bald fraud. Either way, the question now is whether City are capable of playing catch-up. That\u2019s hard to call. None of Guardiola\u2019s titles have been won from losing positions, whether with Barca, Bayern or City; they\u2019ve mostly tended to race out in front early on and cruise from there. Mind you, it does feel slightly weird to say that all the pressure\u2019s on City. Liverpool, after all, are looking to scratch the most irritating of itches and satisfy their yearning for a first league title since 1990. There\u2019s still so much football to play, but it must already feel tantalisingly close. It remains to be seen how they\u2019ll cope with the weight of history on their shoulders, especially if their lead is cut to four points tonight. For now, though, the vibe is different to the 2013-14 season. At the moment it\u2019s hard to see Liverpool slipping and giving the ball to a Demba Ba type. They feel mature and controlled. While they\u2019re a devastating attacking force with Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane up front, they\u2019ve also developed a knack for grinding out results. With Alisson Becker in goal and Virgil Van Dijk at the back, they\u2019ve only let in four goals. They\u2019ll fancy their chances against City. They can open up a nine-point lead over Spurs again. Then again they know the size of the task facing them here. According to Klopp, City are still the best team in the world. \u201cIt is one of the most difficult games you can play in the modern football world, away at City,\u201d he says. And you can see his point. When they are at their best, there\u2019s nothing quite like a Guardiola side in full flow. They\u2019re far too good to be written off yet. For Guardiola, though, the challenge is to get his players thinking clearly again. Immaculate focus is required against a team Liverpool\u2019s focus \u2013 on the pitch and on the touchline.

A number of Democrats had long called for new leadership. However, through a series of concessions including term limits for serving as Speaker, she won over key dissents like Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio.</p> <p>The opposition to Pelosi manifested itself in different ways.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping it up for today. Here are the day\u2019s key stories: Nancy Pelosi was elected speaker of the House as a new Democratic-controlled House of Representatives was sworn into office. Pelosi won the speakership with 220 votes, assuming the gavel for the second time in her career. \u201cTwo months ago, the American people spoke and demanded a new dawn,\u201d she said in a victory speech. The government remained shut down, over Donald Trump\u2019s demand that any government funding bill include money for his border wall. The House is expected Thursday night to pass a bill to reopen shuttered agencies and continue their funding at current levels until February. But Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate say they\u2019re not willing to accept this. Trump made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room \u2013 his first \u2013 where reporters had been summoned at the last minute for what was purported to be a question and answer session with press secretary Sarah Sanders. Instead, Trump, joined by members of a border patrol union, spoke briefly, talking up his border wall, and left without taking questions. Donald Trump gave brief remarks talking up his border wall and left the briefing room without taking questions. He explained that he was meeting with members of the border patrol union in the Oval Office and made an impromptu decision to come out and speak to the press. \u201cWithout a wall you cannot have border security,\u201d Trump said. He went on to claim that technology was not sufficient to secure the border, saying, \u201cnobody knows much more about technology, this type of technology certainly, as I do.\u201d Tech like drones and sensors, he said, are \u201cnot going to stop the problems.\u201d He ignored questions from reporters as he left. Donald Trump is making the case for his border wall. \u201cYou can call it a barrier. You can call it anything you want,\u201d he said. He is joined by a group of Border Patrol and ICE agents, and introduced Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council. \u201cWalls actually work,\u201d Judd said. \u201cIf you interview border patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work.\u201d Donald Trump himself will speak to the press at today\u2019s hastily-scheduled briefing. He\u2019s taking the podium at the White House press room now. The White House has scheduled a last minute press briefing, which is expected to begin any minute. Senator Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, said the Senate should vote to fund the government and end a government shutdown without money for Donald Trump\u2019s border wall. \u201cI think we should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,\u201d he said, according to the Hill. The Senate unanimously passed a bill to fund the government until February, before Donald Trump reversed course and said he would not accept such a bill without wall money. The House is expected to pass the same bill later Thursday. But because it is now a new Congress, the Senate would have to pass it again. And Majority Leader Mitch McConnell now says he won\u2019t allow a vote on any bill unless Trump agrees to it. The Justice Department is investigating whether former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke lied to his agency\u2019s inspector general investigators, the Washington Post reported. Zinke was the subject of two inspector general\u2019s probes, dealing with his real estate activities in his home state of Montana, and his involvement with the review of a Native American casino project in Connecticut. He resigned amid multiple scandals. Zinke spoke to the inspector general\u2019s investigators in two voluntary interviews, a spokesman told the Post. The spokesman said he \u201cto the best of his knowledge answered all questions truthfully,\u201d and has not been contacted by the Justice Department about the matter. Democratic state attorneys general are appealing the ruling from a Texas judge finding Obamacare unconstitutional. \u201cOur goal is simple: to stand up for the law of the land -- the Affordable Care Act -- in order to keep health care affordable and accessible for millions of Americans,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the group, said Thursday, according to CNN. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a debate.\u201d There are 17 states participating in the appeal. The healthcare law remains in effect as the case progresses. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor ruled last month the law was unconstitutional because Congress eliminated the penalty for people who don\u2019t have health insurance as required by the law\u2019s individual mandate. Previously, the Supreme Court upheld the original law. The state attorneys general are taking up the defense of Obamacare instead of the federal government because the Trump administration declined to defend it in court. Donald Trump is considering former Senator Jim Webb to become his next Secretary of Defense, the New York Times reports. James Mattis resigned from the post in protest after Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria, citing fundamental disagreements between them over the US role in the world. Webb is a former Democratic senator and presidential candidate, who served as Navy secretary under former president Ronald Reagan. The White House has invited Congressional leaders back for more talks on Friday about resolving the government shutdown. The proposed meeting would be at 11:30am on Friday, White House spokesman spokesman Hogan Gidley told the Hill. A previous meeting on Wednesday made little progress toward ending the impasse over Donald Trump\u2019s demand for money to build a wall on the southern border. The new Congress brings with it a new order of succession to the presidency. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who was sworn in today to represent Minnesota, arrived for the ceremony with her father, at the same airport where they arrived as refugees more than 20 years ago. Omar is Somali-American and lived as a child in a refugee camp in Kenya. \u201cAs my dad said, he had high hopes for us about the opportunities we would have when we came to this country. But I don\u2019t think he imagined that some day his baby would be going to Congress just 20 years after we arrived here,\u201d Omar said in video of their arrival. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d her father added. Earlier we reported on some stats showing the new Congress is a bit more diverse religiously than the old one. Those changes are reflected in the books new members used to take their oath of office. Nancy Pelosi has been sworn in as Speaker of the House. Rep. Don Young of Alaska, as the dean of the House, administered the oath. Pelosi invited her own grandkids to join her at the podium, and then invited any other children who wanted to join them. Kids and grandkids of members of Congress flocked to the rostrum and gathered around her as she took the oath. \u201cI now call the House to order on behalf of all of America\u2019s children,\u201d she said. Pelosi then administered the oath swearing in the new class of House members. The House has made renovations to make it possible for the first time for people with disabilities to preside over the chamber, Nancy Pelosi said in her speech after being elected speaker. To mark the change, Rep. Jim Langevin of New Jersey, who uses a wheelchair, will preside over the House this afternoon as the first president pro tempore in the new Congress. Nancy Pelosi took the gavel and assumed the Speaker\u2019s chair. She noted that her election as speaker for the second time, the first woman to hold the job, comes on the 100th anniversary of women getting the right to vote. By electing Democrats to control the House in November, she said the American people had chosen to exercise the \u201csystem of checks and balances that protects our democracy.\u201d Pelosi vowed Democrats would fight for policies that benefit the middle class, and tackle climate change - an issue whose urgency she said the American people recognize better than politicians. \u201cWe must also face the existential threat of our time, the climate crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people are ahead of the Congress. The Congress must join them.\u201d The new speaker said Democrats will later today bring up legislation to fund the government and end the possible government shutdown. The legislation, previously passed unanimously by the Senate, would fund the government at current levels without adding money to build a border wall. Pelosi laid out other legislative priorities including universal background checks for gun buyers, an ethics bill known as HR 1, and protections for immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. Newly elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and minority leader Kevin McCarthy, both Californians, took the podium to a serenade of \u201cCalifornia Here I Come.\u201d McCarthy is speaking first. \u201cWe are at our best when we focus not on retribution but on building a more perfect union,\u201d he said. But McCarthy said there is \u201cone core principle upon which we will not compromise: Republicans will always choose personal freedom over government control.\u201d The full tally of Speaker votes on the House floor: Nancy Pelosi has been officially elected House Speaker. The results of the vote on House floor: 220 votes for Pelosi. Republican leader Kevin McCarthy got 192 votes, 18 members voted for someone else, and three voted present. More context from the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs: Pelosi won election to be Speaker by a comfortable margin. Only 15 Democrats ended up defecting after a number of newly elected members ran for the House pledging to oppose Pelosi. Pelosi, who had previously served as Speaker from 2007-11, became the first former Speaker to win re-election to the job since Sam Rayburn in 1955. The California Democrat had faced dissent from within her caucus. A number of Democrats had long called for new leadership. However, through a series of concessions including term limits for serving as Speaker, she won over key dissents like Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio. The opposition to Pelosi manifested itself in different ways. Three Democrats voted present (including the newly elected Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey who first attempted to vote \u201cno\u201d which was not an option). Others backed a variety of candidates. There were three votes for incoming DCCC chair Cheri Bustos of Illinois, two for Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and other votes cast for figures as varied as former Vice President Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams, the losing Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia. Republican Kevin McCarthy faced less dissent in his own caucus as a number of members of the hard-right Freedom Caucus supported his candidacy and only handful of Republicans voted for Jim Jordan, the leader of that group. Jordan himself voted for McCarthy. One Democratic aide hailed Pelosi as a \u201cmastermind\u201d for her comfortable win and noted \u201call of us are amazed by how easy today\u2019s vote will be for her.\u201d The aide noted though that unlike Pelosi\u2019s first stint as speaker \u201cmanaging this caucus will be more difficult than back in 2007.\u201d A full list of the Democrats who voted against Nancy Pelosi, via a Talking Points Memo reporter: Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York, who promised during her campaign to oppose Nancy Pelosi, chose Stacey Abrams - the former Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia - for her speaker vote. Rep. Max Rose, another New York Democrat who campaigned on the promise to oppose Pelosi, voted for Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth. Rep. Seth Moulton, a leader of a faction of Democrats who had opposed Nancy Pelosi, cast his vote for her. He agreed to back her in a deal that will impose term limits on members of the Democratic leadership. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also voted for Pelosi. Her vote drew a smattering of groans and boos. Rep. Ron Kind, a Wisconsin Democrat, is another vote against Nancy Pelosi. He voted for Georgia Rep. and civil rights icon John Lewis for speaker. Rep. Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat from Pennsylvania, voted for Rep. Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts. Member of the House are now being called on by name to cast their votes for Speaker. Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a newly elected Democrat from upstate New York, was the first Democrat to vote against Nancy Pelosi. He instead voted for former Vice President Joe Biden as speaker. More context on the nominations of Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy to lead their parties in the House, from the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs: Both Pelosi and McCarthy received nomination speeches from rising stars in their respective caucuses. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who has been talked about as a potential future Speaker even before his election to be House Conference Chair last month, touted Pelosi\u2019s progressive credentials saying \u201cHouse Democrats are down with NDP,\u201d using the initials for Nancy D\u2019alesandro Pelosi. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who has just been elected House Republican Conference chair, nominated McCarthy. The second generation congresswoman touted the California Republicans\u2019 conservative credentials and his support for President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall. Despite only being elected in 2016, Cheney has already risen to the #3 position among House Republicans. Rep. Liz Cheney nominated Kevin McCarthy to be the Republican House minority leader. She drew cheers from Republicans when she said McCarthy would lead the fight to \u201cbuild the wall.\u201d Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York has nominated Nancy Pelosi for House Speaker. Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat recently elected to the number 5 Democratic leadership post, said Pelosi has a track record of legislative success \u201cunparalleled in modern American history.\u201d Jeffries said Pelosi\u2019s efforts \u201csaved the American automobile industry, provided affordable healthcare to more than 20 million Americans,\u201d among a host of other legislation he listed. \u201cBut Nancy Pelosi is just getting started,\u201d he said. All nine of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s grandchildren are on the floor with her as she prepares to ascend to the speakership, per our Lauren Gambino. Her five children are her guests in the House gallery - along with singer Tony Bennett, Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead, American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten, and Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser. A former employee at Donald Trump\u2019s New Jersey golf club says managers removed her from a list of workers to be vetted by the Secret Service because they knew she was in the country illegally. Emma Torres, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador, is the fifth worker at the Trump National Golf Club to tell the New York Times on the record that they were employed there despite lacking legal authorization, and that managers knew undocumented immigrants worked there. Torres said she and other members of the kitchen staff were asked in 2016, when Trump was running for president, to write their names, addresses and social security numbers on a list that would be sent to the Secret Service for clearance. She said she went to human resources and told a staffer that she was in the country illegally. The staffer said, \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. No problem\u201d and scratched her name off the list, she told the Times. The HR employer then asked Torres for names of other workers, which she provided. She believes they were also removed from the list. Torres said she was hired in 2015 with a fake social security number and green card - and told the manager interviewing her that they were fake. Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, one of the two first Muslim Congresswomen who will take office today, will take her oath of office on a copy of the Koran owned by Thomas Jefferson, per the Detroit Free Press. It\u2019s the founding father\u2019s copy of George Sale\u2019s 1734 translation of the Koran into English, a two-volume work that belongs to the Library of Congress. The new 116th Congress has now officially convened. Vice President Mike Pence is swearing in members of the Senate. House members are preparing to be sworn in. Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s response to a tweet by Donald Trump mocking her presidential bid, per NBC: \u201cYeah, again, how about the president spends his time getting the government back open?\u201d Donald Trump tweeted an image mocking Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign for president. It features the slogan \u201cWarren: 1/2020th,\u201d an apparent reference to the much-derided DNA test the Massachusetts Democrat took finding she had a small fraction of Native American heritage. Trump has frequently mocked Warren on the issue, branding her \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein says former Vice-President Joe Biden is her top pick for a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. \u201cI\u2019ve watched him as vice president, I\u2019ve seen him operate, I\u2019ve seen him perform,\u201d the California Democrat told Politico. \u201cHe brings a level of experience and seniority which I think is really important.\u201d Biden, like most of the rest of the potential 2020 field, has not said whether or not he will run. House Democrats plan to hold hearings on Medicare for All, the single payer healthcare proposal supported by many newly-elected left-leaning members. Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has agreed to hearings on legislation that would create the universal health care system, the Washington Post reported. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step forward to have the speaker\u2019s support,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who will be the House sponsor of the bill. \u201cWe have to push on the inside while continuing to build support for this on the outside.\u201d White House counselor Kellyanne Conway argued Thursday that if Democrats really cared about the plight of migrants at the southern border, they\u2019d support building a wall to keep them out. \u201cThey\u2019re now turning a blind eye to the humanitarian crisis, which includes children,\u201d Conway said. The government has been partially shut down since last month because Trump will not approve government funding unless it includes money to build his proposed wall on the US-Mexico border. Conway, in an appearance on Fox News, said the wall was necessary for migrants\u2019 own good to deter families with children from making the perilous journey from Central America to the border. She accused incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of ignoring presentations form cabinet officials at a White House meeting Wednesday about immigration numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to them, and if Nancy Pelosi really cared about those kids, she would have at least listened,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing because we need a secure border,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t call it anything but raw politics.\u201d Donald Trump is now blaming the government shutdown, which he once said he would take full responsibility for, on the 2020 presidential election. Some new data from the Pew Research Center explores the religious composition of the new Congress set to take office today. The new Congress is slightly more religiously diverse than the last one, according to Pew. In the 115th Congress, 91% of members were Christian, while in the 116th, 88% are Christian. There are four more Jewish members, one additional Muslim and one more Unitarian Universalist in the new Congress \u2013 as well as eight more members who decline to state their religious affiliation. The new Congress includes the first two Muslim women to serve in the House. But while the new Congress is a bit more diverse, its religious breakdown is still much different than the country\u2019s overall, according to Pew\u2019s analysis: \u201cBy far the largest difference between the U.S. public and Congress is in the share who are unaffiliated with a religious group. In the general public, 23% say they are atheist, agnostic or \u2018nothing in particular.\u2019 In Congress, just one person \u2013 Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who was recently elected to the Senate after three terms in the House \u2013 says she is religiously unaffiliated, making the share of \u2018nones\u2019 in Congress 0.2%.\u201d Another 3% of Congress, though - all Democrats - said they did not know or refused to state their religious affiliation in a CQ Roll Call questionnaire. Groups heavily represented in Congress include Methodists, Anglicans/Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Lutherans. Some 15% of members identify as Protestants unaffiliated with any particular denomination, compared to just 5% of the general public. Pentecostals are one underrepresented Protestant denomination: 5% of the general public, but only 0.4% of Congress. About 6% of Congress identifies as Jewish, compared to 2% of the general public. Congress has three Muslims, three Hindus, two Buddhists, and two Unitarian Universalists. Because of the government shutdown, the Trump administration has moved to delay a court hearing in a lawsuit by the NAACP challenging their preparations for the 2020 census. According to documents posted by an NPR reporter, the Justice Department says in court documents that without government funding, DOJ and Department of Commerce employees are prohibited from working on the case. North Carolina Republican Congressional candidate Mark Harris filed court papers Thursday asking that he be certified as the winner of a contested House race there. Vote counts show Harris ahead by a small margin, but no winner has been certified in the race after allegations of absentee ballot fraud by an operative working for the Republican. The seat remains empty as the new Congress is sworn in today. Harris\u2019s legal team filed the petition with Wake County Superior Court, WRAL reported. Harris is expected to meet Thursday with investigators probing the operation to illegally collect absentee ballots from citizens in parts of the district. \u201cThere is uncertainty of when a new State Board of Elections will be operational, when a new State Board of Elections may act, and whether a new State Board of Elections will continue to drag this out unnecessarily and outside of any statutory procedure, as the prior State Board had done,\u201d said Harris attorney David Freedman, according to WRAL. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley says he won\u2019t be running for president again in 2020, and pins his hopes on Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke making a run. O\u2019Malley, a long-shot candidate in the 2016 Democratic primary, wrote an op-ed in the Des Moines Register arguing O\u2019Rourke would be the best candidate next year for the party. O\u2019Rourke ran unsuccessfully last year against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. \u201cThe fearless vision and unifying message which brought people together in Texas also sparked imaginations all across our country. And, I believe, will again \u2014 if Beto O\u2019Rourke runs for president,\u201d O\u2019Malley wrote. A California Democrat plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Donald Trump on the first day of the new Congress. Rep. Brad Sherman will introduce the measure Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported. He first introduced articles of impeachment last year, but this time around the House will be under government control. \u201cThere is no reason it shouldn\u2019t be before the Congress,\u201d Sherman told the LA Times. \u201cEvery day, Donald Trump shows that leaving the White House would be good for our country.\u201d Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not rule out impeachment proceedings in an interview Thursday morning, but said Democrats would wait to see the conclusions of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. Rep. Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee, plans to re-introduce a bill protecting the job of special counsel Robert Mueller on Thursday, CNN reports. The legislation would say that the special counsel could only be fired for cause, and only by certain Justice Department officials. It would allow the special counsel to challenge his dismissal in court. Democrats in the House may pass the bill, but it has little chance of passing the Senate, where majority leader Mitch McConnell refused to bring it up for a vote in spite of Senator Jeff Flake blocking all judicial confirmations unless the special counsel bill was brought up. Flake has now retired. Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will give Donald Trump \u201cnothing for the wall,\u201d as a government shutdown over his demand for money to build a border wall grinds on. \u201cNo, no. Nothing for the wall. We\u2019re talking about border security,\u201d she said in an interview that aired this morning on NBC\u2019s Today Show. \u201cThere is no amount of persuasion he can do to say to us, \u2018We want you to do something that is not effective, that costs billions of dollars.\u2019 That sends the wrong message about who we are as a country.\u201d Democrats have offered $1.3bn for border security measures other than a wall. Trump wants $5bn for a wall. \u201cThis is the Trump shutdown, through and through. That\u2019s why he has proudly taken, in his view, proudly taken ownership of it. There\u2019s no escaping that for him,\u201d Pelosi said in the Today Show appearance. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we take any joy in the fact that there is a Trump shutdown. We want government to open.\u201d Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she won\u2019t rule out the possibility that Donald Trump could be indicted while in office, calling the question \u201can open discussion.\u201d In an interview with NBC\u2019s Today Show Thursday, Pelosi said the Justice Department\u2019s policy of shielding an incumbent president from criminal charges is not set in stone. \u201cI do not think that that is conclusive. No, I do not,\u201d Pelosi told the Today Show. \u201cI think that that is an open discussion. I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law.\u201d Pelosi is expected to ascend to the speakership Thursday when a new, majority-Democratic House is officially sworn in. She said she has no plans to pursue impeachment of the president, but wouldn\u2019t rule it out pending the results of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference. \u201cWe have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report. We shouldn\u2019t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn\u2019t avoid impeachment for a political reason. So we\u2019ll just have to see how it comes,\u201d she said. In another interview with USA Today, she said there would have to be bipartisan support for impeachment before she would pursue it. \u201cIf there\u2019s to be grounds for impeachment of President Trump \u2013 and I\u2019m not seeking those grounds \u2013 that would have to be so clearly bipartisan in terms of acceptance of it before I think we should go down any impeachment path,\u201d Pelosi said. Democrats officially take control of the House today, as members of the 116th Congress are formally sworn in. The ceremonial swearing in is set for noon. Nancy Pelosi is set to become the new House Speaker. Much of the federal government remains shut down, with little progress toward resolving the impasse over Donald Trump\u2019s demand for money to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. The House plans to vote on Thursday for bills that would fund the government without border wall money, ending the shutdown. But even though the Senate previously unanimously approved the same sort of temporary spending bill, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, now says he won\u2019t allow a vote on a bill unless Trump agrees to it, and said the shutdown could last for \u201cweeks\u201d. Meanwhile, the class taking the oath today includes a host of historic firsts: the first Native American women, the first Muslim women, the first black women elected from Massachusetts and Connecticut, the first Hispanic women elected from Texas, and the youngest woman to be elected to Congress. A record 102 women will be sworn into the House on Thursday, 35 of whom were elected for the first time in November.",

Their takeover was fuelled by 63 Democrats whose victories in the November midterm elections helped the party win by the largest margins since the Watergate scandal in 1974. Nancy Pelosi reclaimed her former title as speaker of the House. She made history in 2007 as the first woman to hold the position, before handing over the gavel when the GOP won the House in 2011. The Republicans will be led by Kevin McCarthy of California. \u201cI think of it is a responsibility,\u201d Pelosi told Today when asked how she felt about being the most powerful woman in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t think of it as an accomplishment \u2026 This isn\u2019t breaking a glass ceiling \u2013 this is breaking a marble ceiling in the Capitol of the United States.\u201d Pelosi became one of few elected officials to regain the gavel, and the first for more than 50 years. \u201cWhen our new members take the oath, our Congress will be refreshed and our democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative freshman class,\u201d Pelosi said on Thursday. \u201cWorking together, we will redeem the promise of the American dream for every family, advancing progress for every community.\u201d As in years past, proud relatives and curious members of the public filled the House and Senate galleries as the 116th Congress was sworn in and new leaders were elected. But this year the faces look different \u2013 more diverse and more female. Rashida Tlaib, an incoming Democratic congresswoman from Michigan, announced on Instagram that she would wear a traditional Palestinian thobe \u2013 a long-sleeved, ankle-length garment \u2013 when being sworn in. Ilhan Omar, an incoming Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, swore the oath of office on her grandfather\u2019s Qur\u2019an. In an Instagram post, her father recounted the family\u2019s journey from a refugee camp in Kenya to the US, where they first arrived at an \u201cairport in Washington DC\u201d. \u201cI could never have dreamed that 23 years later I would return to the same airport with my daughter Ilhan by my side, the day before she is to be sworn in as the first Somali-American elected to the United States Congress,\u201d he wrote. Congressman Jim Langevin, a Democrat from Rhode Island and the first quadriplegic person elected to Congress, presided over the chamber on the first day. After the speaker was elected, the newly empowered Democratic majority was due to vote on an internal rules package designed to bring more transparency to congressional governance, a measure that has already exposed ideological tensions within the party. Two prominent progressives, Ocasio-Cortez and Congressman Ro Khanna of California, said they would oppose the package, arguing that the rules would hinder liberals\u2019 ability to advance their ambitious social agenda. Democrats will then turn to their first major order of business: a spending package that would end the government shutdown. The party is unified on the legislation but Donald Trump has said he will refuse to sign the bill, which does not include funding for his border wall. The vote will be the first test of their power \u2013 and an indication of the battles to come in a newly divided government.",

The country\u2019s two busiest hubs \u2013 London\u2019s Heathrow and Gatwick \u2013 have brought in their own military-grade anti-drone apparatus. The owners of both airports invested millions of pounds in the equipment after about 140,000 passengers were affected by the unprecedented disruption to Gatwick. The military had to be called amid a series of reported drone sightings over the course of three days, and it is believed that the Israeli-developed Drone Dome system, which can detect and jam communications between a drone and its operator, was deployed. While it would not say exactly what equipment had been installed since then, a spokeswoman for Gatwick said the airport\u2019s owners had bought a system that provided a similar level of protection and had installed it about a week ago. Heathrow\u2019s spokeswoman also confirmed that the reports of investment in military-grade anti-drone equipment at that airport, which first appeared in the Times on Thursday, were accurate. On Wednesday, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that it had withdrawn its resources from Gatwick, though a spokesman said the armed forces \u201cstand ever ready to assist should a request for support be received\u201d. It is understood that the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, chaired a meeting on Thursday morning at which defence chiefs, the police and Home Office officials discussed future plans for dealing with the threat of drones to vital infrastructure. The parliamentary undersecretary of state for transport, Liz Sugg, is also due to meet the heads of the UK\u2019s major airports next week to discuss the states of their own defences, as well as what they plan to put in place in future, the Guardian understands.

      "bodyText": "A late surge in online sales helped save Christmas for the fashion chain Next, with its better than expected performance helping to lift shares across the battered retail sector. The high street bellwether is among only a few retail chains that resist pre-Christmas discounting and it was expected to have suffered as struggling rivals slashed prices to attract shoppers suffering Brexit jitters. In the end Next reported overall sales growth of 1.5% for the last two months of 2018. Its shares, which have been under pressure since November on the back of fears of a poor Christmas, closed up more than 4% at \u00a343.50, the biggest FTSE 100 riser. Its performance also boosted the share price of rival chains Marks &amp; Spencer, Associated British Foods \u2013 the parent company of Primark \u2013 and Debenhams. However, there was a stark divide between the fortunes of Next\u2019s stores and its web operations. The retailer\u2019s high street performance was weaker than expected, with sales down 9.2%, while its online sales jumped 15.2%. The extra cost of fulfilling web orders as well as higher sales of seasonal gifts, such as beauty products, which have lower profit margins, resulted in Next trimming its annual profit forecast by \u00a34m to \u00a3723m for the year to the end of January, a figure that is down slightly on 2018. It also predicted profits would slide again in 2020 to \u00a3715m. \u201cNovember was very disappointing,\u201d said Next\u2019s chief executive, Simon Wolfson. \u201cIt was unusually mild and the sales we lost were on the winter-weight products.\u201d However, the retailer made up the lost ground in December as sales of winter coats and knitwear took off in the three weeks before Christmas. \u201cTo some extent the money that was not spent in November we found was spent in December,\u201d said Lord Wolfson. Fears the crucial Christmas trading period would be a washout for the country\u2019s retailers were sparked by profit warnings from Asos, Bonmarch\u00e9 and Superdry. The Sports Direct chief executive, Mike Ashley, had also warned that trading in November was \u201cunbelievably bad\u201d. Industry data for November painted a gloomy picture as high streets suffered the largest drop in shopper numbers for a decade, while the warning from Asos caused a share price rout, suggesting the high street malaise had infected online players. However, Next\u2019s performance was in keeping with John Lewis, which on Wednesday reported a strong finish to a rollercoaster Christmas trading period, with a bumper December sales fortnight as consumers went on an eleventh-hour spending spree. Despite the gloom Wolfson said consumers were \u201cnot in a bad place\u201d as the economic forces that affect spending were \u201crelatively benign\u201d. Retailers are suffering as rising rents, business rates and wages drive up the cost of running physical stores, at a time when shoppers are increasingly spending online. Last week HMV emerged as the first major Christmas casualty as it collapsed into administration for the second time in six years, putting more than 2,200 jobs at risk. Peel Hunt analyst Jonathan Pritchard said Next\u2019s figures were reassuring in light of the \u201cArmageddon commentary\u201d that had weighed heavily on retailers\u2019 share prices. \u201cChristmas did arrive,\u201d said Pritchard. \u201cThe last three weeks of December were decidedly positive [for Next] after a stinker of a November, but more sales were online at the expense of in stores. We expect that this will be a trend that we see elsewhere in the sector.\u201d In September, Next published detailed analysis of the ramifications of a no-deal Brexit on the company. Three months on Wolfson, a Conservative peer and prominent Vote Leave supporter, said key questions, such as how the feared customs logjam at UK and EU ports would be managed, had not been answered by the government. \u201cI think the government is less prepared than I thought it was and businesses are less prepared than I thought they were,\u201d said Wolfson, who had arrived at the conclusions based on private conversations and the government\u2019s failure to set out the customs procedures and tariff rates it would adopt in a no-deal situation. \u201cThere may well be plans on these things but they have not been published and that makes it hard for businesses to plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are secret plans they need to get on and make clear what those plans are.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal government has tasked its new aged care watchdog to ramp up the number of unannounced audits and inspections at Australian nursing homes. But an academic and an industry insider warn that flaws in the auditing process could make it possible that substandard care continues to be overlooked. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission started operations on Wednesday and is set to triple the number of unannounced aged care homes reaccreditation audits in 2019 compared to last year. There will also be an increase in unannounced inspections to more than 3,000 this year. The Flinders University associate professor Sam Davis said there was room for improvement in the audit and inspection processes. \u201cFacilities often utilise the guidelines for accreditation as their be all and end all,\u201d Davis told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe often lose the interpretation of what those guidelines are meant to be. You end up with what we have, which is largely task-oriented approaches to care when in fact the very things they are supposed to be meeting in accreditation standards are person-centred living.\u201d She hadn\u2019t personally come across records being faked ahead of audits, but suspected it happened. \u201cWhat organisations do you know of [where] there isn\u2019t some kind of fudging of things?\u201d she said. A former aged care endorsed enrolled nurse, who worked at a nursing home in regional Victoria for more than 25 years, said auditors needed to wise up to the tricks some nursing home managements use to cheat the system. Nursing homes knew exactly what auditors were looking for so could manipulate the process, she told Guardian Australia, on the condition of anonymity. She said scheduled audits and inspections were ineffective and were basically a tick-the-box exercise. Nursing home managers sometimes ramped up activities such as massages or exercise programs on audit day, she said. \u201cOn the day of the audit they\u2019ll make sure they\u2019ve got enough staff on the floor when normally they may not,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say \u2018this is what happens all the time\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t happen all the time.\u201d She said auditors needed to be on the look out for corner-cutting behaviour such as whether a massage program that was supposed to be done by registered nurses was actually being done by less-qualified personal carers. She said the massages may only last five minutes instead of the required 20 minutes and might not be happening twice a week. Exercise charts were easily faked, along with records for toileting, oral hygiene and fluid consumption, she said. \u201cThose exercises will be ticked on the chart but will not have actually been done,\u201d she said. In order to conduct meaningful audits, inspectors needed to stop restricting visits to business hours and should arrive unannounced to monitor night and early morning shifts, she said. \u201cThey should see how many staff are on duty when it\u2019s bedtime, see how many staff are feeding them of a night or at breakfast.\u201d In recent years at her former workplace, the usual ratio of two staff to 30 residents at night had been cut down to one worker to 30 residents to save money. This meant that residents were being turned less frequently, toileted less often and this resulted in more falls because residents were trying to take themselves to the bathroom, she said, and was unlikely to be picked up in an audit. A series of investigations into Adelaide\u2019s failed and now closed Oakden nursing home highlighted problems to do with audit and inspection processes. Both the South Australian and federal governments have made changes since the scandal. The facility met all 44 standards during a check in February 2016 and was reaccredited until 2019. It also passed an unannounced inspection in October 2016. The death of an elderly man, who had been overmedicated, and a subsequent complaint from his family sparked a South Australian investigation into the home. A March 2017 audit found 15 of 44 standards had not been met \u2013 three sanctions were imposed and accreditation period reduced to October 2017. The SA chief psychiatrist\u2019s report into Oakden said \u201cfocus was on compliance and accreditation, not on improvement or on high quality and safe care\u201d. A report from SA\u2019s corruption watchdog referenced allegations there were \u201cdeliberate attempts by staff at the facility to conceal the true physical state of the facility and the care being provided\u201d from federal auditors. The federal aged care minister, Ken Wyatt, insists the new watchdog will better target sub-standard care. A royal commission into the aged care sector is under way.",

Guardian Australia reported on Wednesday that the Queensland-based budget airfare company Bestjet and its subsidiaries, Wynyard Travel Pty Ltd and Brooklyn Travel Pty Ltd, went into voluntary administration on 18 December. Its wind-up has left travellers who booked flights through the company thousands of dollars out of pocket and searching for answers. \u201cI really haven\u2019t heard anything, and I don\u2019t hold out much hope that I\u2019m going to see the money again,\u201d said Paul, who spent just under $6,200 on flights for his family to visit Greece in November. \u201cIt\u2019s my 50th birthday next year so we thought we\u2019d go on an extended family holiday, we booked the airfares through Bestjet in November and it ended up just shy $6,200 for the five of us, my wife, myself and the three kids. \u201cWe got a confirmation email from Bestjet with all details on it and didn\u2019t think anything more of it [until] my wife saw a post on Facebook about Bestjet going under. \u201cWe rang the airline, Emirates, and they told us the booking had been made but had been cancelled on the second of December.\u201d Bestjet was founded by Rachel James, the wife of former Air Australia owner Michael James, just weeks after the budget airline\u2019s high-profile collapse in 2012. Air Australia was almost $100m in debt when it went under, leaving thousands of travellers stranded overseas. Its collapse led to Michael James being disqualified from managing corporations for three years by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. In 2016 the Australian Federation of Travel Agents (AFTA), an industry body, stripped Bestjet of its accreditation because it believed Michael James had an influential role in the company. Bestjet fought the decision in the Brisbane supreme court, producing a resignation letter from Michael James from 2015. The company argued that between November 2013 and December 2015 he worked as a \u201cfares and pricing analyst\u201d, and \u201cdid not have \u201ca senior management position and did not have any role in the day-to-day management of Bestjet\u201d. But the AFTA\u2019s decision was upheld as part of an interlocutory judgment, in which the court found he \u201cmay\u201d have been in a position to influence or make decisions about Bestjet\u2019s business. A preliminary report prepared last month by Bestjet\u2019s administrators, Pilot Partners, said Michael James was involved in the management of Bestjet. \u201cOur investigations have revealed that Mr James (husband to the former director, Ms Rachel James) was involved in the day-to-day operations of the business,\u201d the report stated. And now new documents lodged with Asic appear to show he was involved in the finances of the business. A list of creditors shows Bestjet owes hundreds of thousands of dollars to various companies including travel fare aggregators Kayak and Skyscanner. More than a dozen of the entries include a note stating \u201cno details provided, refer to M James\u201d. The creditors\u2019 list also includes a company called OTAlab, owed $96,629 for \u201cPhillipines payroll, annual leave and termination notice\u201d. The creditor details state that OTAlab is a related party to Michael James. Guardian Australia was unable to reach Michael James for comment. The details around Bestjet\u2019s collapse are made murkier because of its recent sale. On 2 November it was sold to a company called McVicker International. The company was registered in October. In a statement to Asic made by its sole director, Robert Bruce McVicker, he says he had a \u201climited understanding\u201d of the businesses operation because of his short time in control of the company. \u201cHowever, it would be prudent to make enquiries to the previous director regarding the balance of the time that this business was in operation,\u201d he wrote.

      "body": "<p>For decades universities have been falling down on the job of teaching people to think for themselves and selling themselves as trainers for enhanced income generation. It is an abomination if, as George Monbiot reports (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/31/advertising-academia-controlling-thoughts-universities\" title=\"\">Who is really making your choices? It may not be you</a>, 31 December), they are supporting research into techniques for overcoming resistance to advertising. We should look to other institutions to provide reservoirs of resistance. They will not be specifically set up to combat the \u201chidden persuaders\u201d that Vance Packard wrote about in 1957, but by groups who build community on other common interests.</p> <p>Perhaps the most successful is the Campaign for Real Ale, which took on the global beer producers who told us what to drink. My own city has many fine pubs, traditional and modern, which are obvious centres of resistance and not just on the beer front. What some will find more surprising is that there are some church communities around that encourage people to develop a capacity for scepticism, while helping them to stand up to the powerful forces of 21st-century global capitalism.<br><strong>Geoff Reid</strong><br><em>Bradford</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot\u2019s warnings about the insidious power of advertising research being funded by publicly funded universities are well-made. We should remember that David Cameron was motivated by this growing body of research in establishing the Downing Street behavioural insight or \u201cnudge\u201d unit \u2013 allegedly aimed at exploiting the better side of human psychology with a view to improving citizens\u2019 behaviour (such as sending n tax returns on time). Manipulating the behaviour of unsuspecting individuals was a wholly accepted premise. Indeed, the main nudge theorist, an American economist, won a Nobel prize in 2017, so his work has already had a considerable impact on a global scale. At a time when higher education is being commercialised like never before, with the financial stakes rising year by year, we must give the highest priority to the ethical scrutiny and control of publicly funded research and the individuals engaged in it.<br><strong>Gillian Dalley</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is right to point up the aggressive efforts on the part of corporations to control consumer responses. But he is too sweeping in tarring \u201cuniversities\u201d as a whole as contributing to this process. It is mostly business schools that conduct such research. Having worked for some decades in such establishments, I can confirm that apart from some lip service to wider social concerns, usually in areas such as business ethics, international management or (some aspects of) corporate social responsibility, the main purpose of most business school activity \u2013 and of the vast majority of research funding in the field \u2013 is to improve the success of individual organisations, without regard to wider implications. We need more academic regard, and more funding, devoted to the broad philosophical, social and political impacts of business if we are to see a brake on the corroding influence of modern advertising techniques.<br><strong>Paul Griseri</strong><br><em>La Genetouze, France</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot highlights an often hidden and insidious aspect of modern capitalism. In the early days of capitalism, advertising was used to simply make the wider public aware of a product, but with modern technology and psychological sophistication this has morphed into a highly persuasive operation, plugging in to human \u2013 and particularly children and young people\u2019s \u2013 weaknesses.</p> <p>I remember when I first went to live in East Germany, long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, how the \u201cgrey\u201d reality, so tediously iterated in the west, represented for me a freedom from unnecessary and intrusive advertising. I found it wonderfully refreshing. I could think my own thoughts, daydream and just observe the world of architecture, people\u2019s activities and my whole environment untrammelled by gaudy, in-your-face hoardings and sexually exploitative imagery. Of course, there were the ubiquitous simplistic political slogans, but they were less obtrusive than commercial advertising and had little, if any, effect on a sceptical populace.</p> <p>Now it is not just hoardings, of course, but social media technologies that dominate our daily lives and corporate interests plug directly into our brains, creating addictions as pernicious as cocaine or opium. How quaint does the Big Brother concept in Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four seem in contrast.<br><strong>John Green</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is quite right to complain about academics doing research that helps advertisers manipulate minds. But universities suffer from an intellectual and humanitarian scandal far worse than Monbiot seems to realise. Most would agree that a proper basic aim of academia is to help promote human welfare by intellectual, educational and technological means. If this aim was taken seriously, and pursued rationally, academia would give intellectual priority to the tasks of articulating our problems of living, including our global problems, and proposing and critically assessing possible solutions \u2013 possible actions, policies, political programmes, ways of living.</p> <p>Intelligent public education about what our problems are, and what we need to do about them, would be an absolute priority.

      "bodyText": "For decades universities have been falling down on the job of teaching people to think for themselves and selling themselves as trainers for enhanced income generation. It is an abomination if, as George Monbiot reports (Who is really making your choices? It may not be you, 31 December), they are supporting research into techniques for overcoming resistance to advertising. We should look to other institutions to provide reservoirs of resistance. They will not be specifically set up to combat the \u201chidden persuaders\u201d that Vance Packard wrote about in 1957, but by groups who build community on other common interests. Perhaps the most successful is the Campaign for Real Ale, which took on the global beer producers who told us what to drink. My own city has many fine pubs, traditional and modern, which are obvious centres of resistance and not just on the beer front. What some will find more surprising is that there are some church communities around that encourage people to develop a capacity for scepticism, while helping them to stand up to the powerful forces of 21st-century global capitalism. Geoff Reid Bradford \u2022 George Monbiot\u2019s warnings about the insidious power of advertising research being funded by publicly funded universities are well-made. We should remember that David Cameron was motivated by this growing body of research in establishing the Downing Street behavioural insight or \u201cnudge\u201d unit \u2013 allegedly aimed at exploiting the better side of human psychology with a view to improving citizens\u2019 behaviour (such as sending n tax returns on time). Manipulating the behaviour of unsuspecting individuals was a wholly accepted premise. Indeed, the main nudge theorist, an American economist, won a Nobel prize in 2017, so his work has already had a considerable impact on a global scale. At a time when higher education is being commercialised like never before, with the financial stakes rising year by year, we must give the highest priority to the ethical scrutiny and control of publicly funded research and the individuals engaged in it. Gillian Dalley London \u2022 George Monbiot is right to point up the aggressive efforts on the part of corporations to control consumer responses. But he is too sweeping in tarring \u201cuniversities\u201d as a whole as contributing to this process. It is mostly business schools that conduct such research. Having worked for some decades in such establishments, I can confirm that apart from some lip service to wider social concerns, usually in areas such as business ethics, international management or (some aspects of) corporate social responsibility, the main purpose of most business school activity \u2013 and of the vast majority of research funding in the field \u2013 is to improve the success of individual organisations, without regard to wider implications. We need more academic regard, and more funding, devoted to the broad philosophical, social and political impacts of business if we are to see a brake on the corroding influence of modern advertising techniques. Paul Griseri La Genetouze, France \u2022 George Monbiot highlights an often hidden and insidious aspect of modern capitalism. In the early days of capitalism, advertising was used to simply make the wider public aware of a product, but with modern technology and psychological sophistication this has morphed into a highly persuasive operation, plugging in to human \u2013 and particularly children and young people\u2019s \u2013 weaknesses. I remember when I first went to live in East Germany, long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, how the \u201cgrey\u201d reality, so tediously iterated in the west, represented for me a freedom from unnecessary and intrusive advertising. I found it wonderfully refreshing. I could think my own thoughts, daydream and just observe the world of architecture, people\u2019s activities and my whole environment untrammelled by gaudy, in-your-face hoardings and sexually exploitative imagery. Of course, there were the ubiquitous simplistic political slogans, but they were less obtrusive than commercial advertising and had little, if any, effect on a sceptical populace. Now it is not just hoardings, of course, but social media technologies that dominate our daily lives and corporate interests plug directly into our brains, creating addictions as pernicious as cocaine or opium. How quaint does the Big Brother concept in Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four seem in contrast. John Green London \u2022 George Monbiot is quite right to complain about academics doing research that helps advertisers manipulate minds. But universities suffer from an intellectual and humanitarian scandal far worse than Monbiot seems to realise. Most would agree that a proper basic aim of academia is to help promote human welfare by intellectual, educational and technological means. If this aim was taken seriously, and pursued rationally, academia would give intellectual priority to the tasks of articulating our problems of living, including our global problems, and proposing and critically assessing possible solutions \u2013 possible actions, policies, political programmes, ways of living. Intelligent public education about what our problems are, and what we need to do about them, would be an absolute priority. The pursuit of knowledge and technological knowhow would be important, but secondary. No university in the world is organised along these lines. All take the first priority to be to acquire specialised knowledge. All around the world universities, in their whole structure, betray reason and, as a result, betray humanity. At present we do not have what we so urgently need: institutions of learning rationally devoted to helping us learn how to make progress towards a better, wiser, more civilised world.

      "bodyText": "The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said his country is preparing for a no-deal Brexit as seriously as it is for Theresa May\u2019s deal and warned that the EU\u2019s existing offer must not change. In remarks that echoed EU comments earlier on Thursday rebuffing British hopes of further talks, Varadkar said European leaders were united behind the existing deal and that he and Angela Merkel had held a 40-minute call at her request. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November,\u201d he said. The taoiseach said he had \u201cgiven up speculating\u201d on whether Britain would leave the EU without a deal but that Ireland\u2019s contingency planning for a no-deal outcome would continue. His warning that preparations for no deal have escalated will sharpen pressure on May before the crucial parliamentary vote in mid-January. The Irish agriculture minister, Michael Creed, said earlier on Thursday he would be asking for emergency EU aid for Irish farmers in the event of a no-deal Brexit. May has been ringing EU leaders ahead of the Commons vote but has so far seen little movement as a result of her Christmas telephone diplomacy. Varadkar said Irish and British government officials would be speaking by phone on Friday, Reuters reported. He said the calls would be followed up with \u201cdirect contact\u201d between the two prime ministers as needed. But a European commission spokeswoman said talks could not be reopened. \u201cThe deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible and the EU27 leaders confirmed on 13 December [at an EU summit] in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I understand for now, no further meetings are foreseen between the commission\u2019s negotiators and the UK\u2019s negotiators, as negotiations have indeed concluded.\u201d An EU source said nothing had happened regarding Brexit over the last 10 days, though May had spoken with the head of the European council, Donald Tusk, on Wednesday. The prime minister spoke to the German chancellor twice during the holiday period. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, does not appear to have been on the list for a Christmas phone call from May, but the commission spokeswoman said he was \u201calways available to listen to Prime Minister May\u2019s views with regards to the temporary nature of the backstop\u201d. The British government is pushing for further guarantees on the Irish backstop, the fallback plan to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. With only 85 days until Brexit, the last-ditch push for guarantees has intensified concern about the damaging effects of the UK crashing out without a deal. Creed said Ireland\u2019s demand for aid from Brussels in the event of no deal would be substantial. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at hundreds of millions,\u201d he told the Irish Independent. \u201cBetween the beef industry and the fishing industry we\u2019re talking mega-money.\u201d EU law allows emergency aid for farmers affected by sudden market shocks; the EU released more than \u20ac1bn to help farmers cope with Russia\u2019s 2014 ban on imports of EU produce. But officials said they would only respond to a formal request from the Irish government, if the UK left without a deal. On Wednesday, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the British government needed more certainty that the UK would not be trapped in the backstop indefinitely. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for anything new, but we are asking you to define what temporary means so we can have confidence we\u2019re not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever,\u201d Hunt said. The EU\u2019s reluctance to reopen talks is not just a holding line over the Christmas holidays but reflects the deeply held view among officials that the bloc has gone as far as it can in offering reassurance on the backstop. At an EU summit in December, EU leaders agreed that the backstop would \u201capply temporarily unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement\u201d to ensure that a hard border would be avoided. The text also stated that if the backstop were triggered, EU negotiators would use \u201cbest endeavours\u201d to negotiate a replacement agreement. EU officials say this document has significant legal weight because it is the formal conclusions of a European summit. None of them think that a different legal format \u2013 for example, depositing the text on the backstop at the United Nations \u2013 would make any difference to the chances of the Brexit withdrawal deal passing the House of Commons. \u201cThere is a general frustration with the whole process. We have worked very hard for the last 18 months,\u201d said one EU source. \u201cWe have compromised, we have done a lot to get this nailed down on time.\u201d EU leaders were said to be irritated by May\u2019s remarks at the December summit that British MPs did not trust the EU. Reflecting that mood, Juncker told the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag last week that British MPs deeply distrusted the EU and the prime minister. He said the EU had no intention of trying to keep the UK inside the EU, adding: \u201cAll we want is clarity about our future relations and we respect the result of the referendum.\u201d In the interview he also said the EU would be ready to open talks on the future relationship with the UK \u201cthe very next day\u201d after any positive vote by the UK parliament, not waiting until Brexit day on 29 March. Meanwhile, May\u2019s renewed attempts to woo the Democratic Unionist party have been rejected again after a lunch between the prime minister and Nigel Dodds, the party\u2019s deputy leader. A statement released by Dodds said May\u2019s draft EU withdrawal agreement flew in the face of government commitments on Northern Ireland. He emphasised the party\u2019s concerns over the proposed backstop, saying: \u201cNo one wants a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic \u2026 With this clarity emerging in London, Dublin and Brussels, there is evidently no need for this aspect of the withdrawal agreement.\u201d",

Did it turn out to be a really inhospitable place or something?</p> <p>I think we all have to ask as the huge caravan of men returning from #MeToo exile threatens to overwhelm us. Over the past week, it has been difficult to turn on the internet without seeing reports detailing this alleged crimewave\u2019s progress. \u201cMy life is over,\u201d declaimed comedian Louis CK to \u2026 hang on, where are my reading glasses? \u2026 a sold-out audience in Long Island. He owns a multi-million dollar estate on nearby Shelter Island, so I guess it feels as wastelandy a spot as any to unleash a set shitting all over school shooting survivors and people asking to be referred to by pronouns of their choice. But we\u2019ll come to the courage of this material shortly.</p> <p>For now, join the huddled masses, Mr CK! I\u2019m afraid the marketplace of men returning from the wilderness is now so crowded that you have to do something really quite special to get people\u2019s undivided attention.</p> <p>Leave it to acting\u2019s Kevin Spacey, then, who dropped a Christmas video that is a work of quite eye-popping WTF-ery. Even by Kevin\u2019s own standards of scenery-chewing, this one\u2019s a real masticator. Top line? He still seems to be in the dark as to how his plot has resolved. What can one say? Other than: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the movie, mate, but it turns out it was you all along.</p> <p>As it goes, that isn\u2019t the particular role in his canon on which Kevin overtly draws for this video. Instead, he gets himself up as House of Cards villain Frank Underwood, albeit a Frank Underwood standing behind a kitchen counter in a Father Christmas apron.</p> <p>Other details? You can see why Kevin opted to stand next to a massive turkey \u2013 a massive ham would have been too self-parodic \u2013 but it does all fade into the background once he starts speaking. \u201cI know what you want,\u201d he begins boldly. \u201cOh sure, they may have tried to separate us, but what we have is too strong, too powerful \u2026 I shocked you with my honesty \u2026 but mostly I challenged you and made you think \u2026 So we\u2019re not done, no matter what anyone says. I know what you want. You want me back \u2026\u201d On and on he rambles. \u201cSoon enough, you will know the whole truth \u2026 Now that I think of it, you never actually saw me die, did you?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZveA-NAIDI\" title=\"\">I\u2019m watching it right now</a>, Kevin.</p> <p>As for as the secondary import of Spacey\u2019s message, I would say it is the most perfect representation I have ever seen of the space beyond CAA representation. Ditched by the agency last year, Kevin is now operating in a place so far from talent management that the Chinese are decades off being able to land a probe on it.</p> <p>Yet he is still given to reticence when it suits. Spacey is due to appear in court in Massachusetts next week, charged with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man in a bar in 2016. But a few days after the video dropped, his lawyer argued that Spacey appearing in person would only \u201camplify the negative publicity already generated in connection with this case\u201d. Though the judge didn\u2019t actually use the words \u201cI think your client\u2019s kitchen psycho video already did that\u201d, he did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/dec/31/kevin-spacey-court-hearing-sexual-assault-massachusetts\" title=\"\">throw the request out</a>, so perhaps the Santa apron will get a more formal outing next Tuesday.</p> <p>However he plays it, then, Spacey\u2019s performance is already a real credit to his most recent alma mater, the Meadows clinic in Arizona, where you may recall his fellow patients included Harvey Weinstein. The Meadows offers a $2,000-a-night wilderness-type experience, being in the actual wilderness, but without requiring the sacrifice of comforts such as a kale menu or steam room.</p> <p>Both Harvey and Kevin are now back home, so both are \u2026 cured, is it? \u2026 of the illness they were being treated for. Well done, the Meadows! I hope this clinical success has spurred the creation of a dedicated programme for guys wrongly accused of multiple sexual assaults. I know the very last thing you care about is money, but it doesn\u2019t hurt that this is easily the fastest-growing entertainer demographic. Furthermore, I hope all your other paying patients who had to sit in group-therapy sessions with these two realise how lucky they were to share a treatment journey with some of the earliest identified sufferers of this illness \u2013 so new it has yet to be given a name. Does it even have a working title, or are you still listing it as Untitled Sexual Abuse Addiction Project?</p> <p>And so to Louis CK, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/31/louis-ck-parkland-survivors-standup-routine\" title=\"\">bootlegged set</a> suggested he is so angry at what he did to his life that he can only express it as anger toward people who wish to be known by different pronouns. I expect the next stage of his journey will be sophisticatedly demanding why something is transgressive when he says it, but not when it is said by, say, one of the women he forced to watch him masturbate in a locked room.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure we hate to disappoint this self-styled groundbreaker, but this is all very old hat. Jim Davidson was crusading against comic injustice way back in the 1980s. \u201c\u2018Well, Billy Connolly swears,\u2019\u201d he recently recalled saying to his BBC bosses. \u201cThe producers at the BBC said: \u2018A Billy Connolly swear word is different to a Jim Davidson swear word,\u2019 so there you go. Maybe it\u2019s the Scottish accent.\u201d Yes. Well, I\u2019m sure if it was going to be the fault of anything, it would be that Billy came from a different country from Jim. Still, they gave him a very good living for a couple of decades. And Jim\u2019s failure to accept that his time had passed gave him the next two decades of material.</p> <p>Listening to Louis CK\u2019s set, I was struck how much he reminded me of post-BBC Davidson, a man whose act strayed into such unfunny shithousery that it frequently drew complaints even from audience members who\u2019d paid to see a Jim Davidson gig. And so with Louis CK. Not laughing is presented as an imaginative failure on the audience\u2019s part. It reminds us that there is a special, roped-off VIP area of Woke for guys who have been accused of sexual misconduct. They can see worlds you can\u2019t! They are here to reveal their mysteries to you! THEY ARE STILL YOUR SPIRIT ANIMAL, OK? Catch up.</p> <p>As far as much of the rest of the act goes \u2013 pronouns, black guys having big dicks \u2013 this stuff really is the equivalent of mother-in-law material. It is one of the more embarrassing ironies of the age that everyone who utters the phrase \u201cBut you can\u2019t say that any more\u201d has, quite literally, just said the thing you can\u2019t say.</p> <p>One of my biggest and most doomed wishes for 2019 is for comedians to stop acting like it\u2019s crusadingly dangerous to say things that are basically indistinguishable from Jim Davidson\u2019s 1977 Seaside Special act \u2013 and then not just wondering why they don\u2019t get campus bookings, but claiming that comedy is being \u201ckilled\u201d.</p> <p>Comedy is not being killed. You can still say the things you can\u2019t say. It is 31 years since Allan Bloom wrote his pearl-clutching book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Closing_of_the_American_Mind\" title=\"\">The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today\u2019s Students</a>. It is 27 years since New York magazine ran its landmark article suggesting that the thought police were recreating 1930s Germany.</p> <p>Since then, what has really changed? Students are still being mild idiots on campus, but it was ever thus. We\u2019ve known students are idiots since way back. Shakespeare even wrote one of his top four tragedies about it. But you know, unless they homicidally avenge their fathers, sparking a chain of events that basically wipes out a generation of Denmark\u2019s ruling family, they usually get over it.</p> <p>I wish rich comedians would. Apart from students, who surely can\u2019t believe the attention they\u2019re paid, the only other people wetting their pants about all this bollocks are rightwingers who profit financially or electorally from making it a bogeyman. Look at the results. People who can see it works have been banging this drum for almost four decades now, and \u2013 SPOILERS \u2013 they keep winning. Four decades of seeing snowflakes everywhere has not closed the American mind. TURN ON THE TELLY. The American mind remains so yawningly, chasmically open that it has literally elected Donald Trump as its president. I don\u2019t want to close the American mind after the horse has been made consul but CHRIST, can we try some new material, please?</p>",

I hope this clinical success has spurred the creation of a dedicated programme for guys wrongly accused of multiple sexual assaults. I know the very last thing you care about is money, but it doesn\u2019t hurt that this is easily the fastest-growing entertainer demographic. Furthermore, I hope all your other paying patients who had to sit in group-therapy sessions with these two realise how lucky they were to share a treatment journey with some of the earliest identified sufferers of this illness \u2013 so new it has yet to be given a name. Does it even have a working title, or are you still listing it as Untitled Sexual Abuse Addiction Project? And so to Louis CK, whose bootlegged set suggested he is so angry at what he did to his life that he can only express it as anger toward people who wish to be known by different pronouns. I expect the next stage of his journey will be sophisticatedly demanding why something is transgressive when he says it, but not when it is said by, say, one of the women he forced to watch him masturbate in a locked room. I\u2019m sure we hate to disappoint this self-styled groundbreaker, but this is all very old hat. Jim Davidson was crusading against comic injustice way back in the 1980s. \u201c\u2018Well, Billy Connolly swears,\u2019\u201d he recently recalled saying to his BBC bosses. \u201cThe producers at the BBC said: \u2018A Billy Connolly swear word is different to a Jim Davidson swear word,\u2019 so there you go. Maybe it\u2019s the Scottish accent.\u201d Yes. Well, I\u2019m sure if it was going to be the fault of anything, it would be that Billy came from a different country from Jim. Still, they gave him a very good living for a couple of decades. And Jim\u2019s failure to accept that his time had passed gave him the next two decades of material. Listening to Louis CK\u2019s set, I was struck how much he reminded me of post-BBC Davidson, a man whose act strayed into such unfunny shithousery that it frequently drew complaints even from audience members who\u2019d paid to see a Jim Davidson gig. And so with Louis CK. Not laughing is presented as an imaginative failure on the audience\u2019s part. It reminds us that there is a special, roped-off VIP area of Woke for guys who have been accused of sexual misconduct. They can see worlds you can\u2019t! They are here to reveal their mysteries to you! THEY ARE STILL YOUR SPIRIT ANIMAL, OK? Catch up. As far as much of the rest of the act goes \u2013 pronouns, black guys having big dicks \u2013 this stuff really is the equivalent of mother-in-law material. It is one of the more embarrassing ironies of the age that everyone who utters the phrase \u201cBut you can\u2019t say that any more\u201d has, quite literally, just said the thing you can\u2019t say. One of my biggest and most doomed wishes for 2019 is for comedians to stop acting like it\u2019s crusadingly dangerous to say things that are basically indistinguishable from Jim Davidson\u2019s 1977 Seaside Special act \u2013 and then not just wondering why they don\u2019t get campus bookings, but claiming that comedy is being \u201ckilled\u201d. Comedy is not being killed. You can still say the things you can\u2019t say. It is 31 years since Allan Bloom wrote his pearl-clutching book The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today\u2019s Students. It is 27 years since New York magazine ran its landmark article suggesting that the thought police were recreating 1930s Germany. Since then, what has really changed? Students are still being mild idiots on campus, but it was ever thus. We\u2019ve known students are idiots since way back. Shakespeare even wrote one of his top four tragedies about it. But you know, unless they homicidally avenge their fathers, sparking a chain of events that basically wipes out a generation of Denmark\u2019s ruling family, they usually get over it. I wish rich comedians would. Apart from students, who surely can\u2019t believe the attention they\u2019re paid, the only other people wetting their pants about all this bollocks are rightwingers who profit financially or electorally from making it a bogeyman. Look at the results. People who can see it works have been banging this drum for almost four decades now, and \u2013 SPOILERS \u2013 they keep winning. Four decades of seeing snowflakes everywhere has not closed the American mind. TURN ON THE TELLY. The American mind remains so yawningly, chasmically open that it has literally elected Donald Trump as its president. I don\u2019t want to close the American mind after the horse has been made consul but CHRIST, can we try some new material, please?",

      "body": "<p>Five years ago, <a href=\"http://www.gabrielle-brady.com/\" title=\"\">Gabrielle Brady</a>, an Australian film-maker, decided to visit an old friend who had moved to remote Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. The tiny tropical Australian territory was only settled a century ago, when phosphate, deposited as guano by seabirds, was mined by Chinese and Malay labourers. Its latest industry, however, was the controversial \u201coffshore processing\u201d of refugees. For the past 17 years, asylum seekers reaching Australia\u2019s shores by boat have been dispatched to island detention centres and detained there indefinitely.</p> <p>Brady\u2019s arrival on holiday gave her friend, Poh Lin Lee, a break from her difficult job on Christmas Island, providing therapy for traumatised detainees. \u201cWe spent two weeks enjoying this beautiful environment \u2013 diving with dolphins, looking for whale sharks, going to really remote beaches,\u201d remembers Brady, who now lives in Berlin. \u201cAt the end, Poh said: \u2018I need to show you something.\u2019\u201d They slashed their way through dense jungle with machetes (\u201ceverywhere you go on Christmas Island, you need a machete\u201d) to reach a lookout. Below spread the grey buildings of the huge camp for refugees. \u201cIt was just truly shocking,\u201d says Brady. \u201cI\u2019d seen that image so many times in the Australian media, but I\u2019d forgotten it existed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8877208ad533aaf3e1a9588a32f1b28527c8053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8877208ad533aaf3e1a9588a32f1b28527c8053/434_0_1430_858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poh Lin Lee and one of her children in a still from Island of the Hungry Ghosts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poh Lin Lee and one of her children in a still from Island of the Hungry Ghosts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This revelatory mix of horror and beauty \u2013 and Lee\u2019s growing reservations about her job \u2013 drove Brady to return to the island five times over the next four years, making her powerful, discombobulating debut feature, <a href=\"http://www.christmasislandfilm.com/\" title=\"\">Island of the Hungry Ghosts</a>. Instead of a familiar focus on the life stories of traumatised refugees, Brady\u2019s film is a lyrical, dream-like journey into darkness. It offers no contextual information via voiceover or even captions; instead, the camera lingers on brooding rainforest, the spooky dinosaur-like rattle of tropical birds, and the extraordinary migrating land crabs (whose respectful treatment by the island authorities contrasts with that of the human arrivals).</p> <p>The film\u2019s core is Lee\u2019s life and therapeutic work as one of four counsellors employed by Australia\u2019s department of health at the island hospital. The film started small, she says, when she and Brady decided they wanted to secretly document detainees\u2019 stories.

      "bodyText": "Five years ago, Gabrielle Brady, an Australian film-maker, decided to visit an old friend who had moved to remote Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. The tiny tropical Australian territory was only settled a century ago, when phosphate, deposited as guano by seabirds, was mined by Chinese and Malay labourers. Its latest industry, however, was the controversial \u201coffshore processing\u201d of refugees. For the past 17 years, asylum seekers reaching Australia\u2019s shores by boat have been dispatched to island detention centres and detained there indefinitely. Brady\u2019s arrival on holiday gave her friend, Poh Lin Lee, a break from her difficult job on Christmas Island, providing therapy for traumatised detainees. \u201cWe spent two weeks enjoying this beautiful environment \u2013 diving with dolphins, looking for whale sharks, going to really remote beaches,\u201d remembers Brady, who now lives in Berlin. \u201cAt the end, Poh said: \u2018I need to show you something.\u2019\u201d They slashed their way through dense jungle with machetes (\u201ceverywhere you go on Christmas Island, you need a machete\u201d) to reach a lookout. Below spread the grey buildings of the huge camp for refugees. \u201cIt was just truly shocking,\u201d says Brady. \u201cI\u2019d seen that image so many times in the Australian media, but I\u2019d forgotten it existed.\u201d This revelatory mix of horror and beauty \u2013 and Lee\u2019s growing reservations about her job \u2013 drove Brady to return to the island five times over the next four years, making her powerful, discombobulating debut feature, Island of the Hungry Ghosts. Instead of a familiar focus on the life stories of traumatised refugees, Brady\u2019s film is a lyrical, dream-like journey into darkness. It offers no contextual information via voiceover or even captions; instead, the camera lingers on brooding rainforest, the spooky dinosaur-like rattle of tropical birds, and the extraordinary migrating land crabs (whose respectful treatment by the island authorities contrasts with that of the human arrivals). The film\u2019s core is Lee\u2019s life and therapeutic work as one of four counsellors employed by Australia\u2019s department of health at the island hospital. The film started small, she says, when she and Brady decided they wanted to secretly document detainees\u2019 stories. Brady met them inside Lee\u2019s consulting room, unbeknown to the guards posted outside the door, and gauged their willingness to be filmed. Although by agreeing they risked punishment or being transferred to other island camps, \u201cthere was huge interest,\u201d says Brady. \u201cI was meeting people who had been there for four or five years. There was a huge sense of desperation.\u201d It was dangerous for Lee as well, with the Australian government having introduced a draconian law threatening whistleblowers with two years\u2019 imprisonment. Lee took the chance. \u201cIt was far more important to document the stories at that stage,\u201d she says, by phone from Nice, where she now lives with her French husband and two children. \u201cThe risk I faced was nowhere near what the asylum seekers risked.\u201d In therapy with Lee, refugees from Afghanistan, Somalia and elsewhere discuss their treatment in detention, rather than the conflicts they have fled \u2013 a deliberate decision to avoid re-traumatising them. She worries about the impact on them of being constantly asked to retell their \u201ctrauma story\u201d. \u201cWhen I discussed these concerns with Gabrielle we realised it wasn\u2019t the kind of storytelling we wanted to invite. We offered therapeutic work and if something came out that would contribute to the film, that was secondary.\u201d In fact, Brady ended up filming more extensively only once some asylum seekers had been transferred to the Australian mainland. She and Lee felt their subjects could offer fully informed consent once they had access to legal advice, unmonitored emails and more personal freedom. These scenes, Brady insists, are not re-enactments but a continuation of Lee\u2019s therapeutic work. \u201cAt times we were filming in retrospect but the moment itself, particularly the therapy sessions, are very genuine.

The US ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman, visited Whelan in prison on Wednesday, a move described as \u201ca rookie mistake\u201d by one Russian foreign policy analyst. \u201cHe should have sent a career consular officer,\u201d said Vladimir Frolov. \u201cAn ambassadorial visit by a political appointee escalates the situation and raises the stakes, makes it harder to resolve the situation.\u201d Huntsman has been US ambassador to Russia since October 2017. A state department spokesperson said: \u201cAmbassador Huntsman expressed his support for Mr Whelan and offered the embassy\u2019s assistance. Ambassador Huntsman subsequently spoke by telephone with Mr Whelan\u2019s family. Due to privacy considerations for Mr Whelan and his family, we have nothing further at this time.\u201d",

The viking chieftain and his girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera) are forced to hunt out the titular dragon homeland after coming up against a powerful new enemy, while his trusty steed Toothless finally gets his own love interest.</p> <h2>Far-out sci-fi</h2> <p>Robert Rodriguez\u2019s cyberpunk Alita: Battle Angel (February) is the movie James Cameron was so desperate to make, for so many years, that he eventually dumped it on somebody else. Rosa Salazar\u2019s big-eyed Alita just looks downright weird in the trailers, and it remains to be seen whether an effect that works perfectly well in anime settles down over the course of the movie or just gives everyone watching a headache.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7pYhpJaJW8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w7pYhpJaJW8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Another Cameron cast-off of sorts is the so-far-untitled Terminator reboot that\u2019s due to arrive naked and glistening around November time. Deadpool\u2019s Tim Miller directs, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/20/sarah-connor-returns-linda-hamilton-to-star-in-terminator-6-arnold-schwarzenegger\">Linda Hamilton returning as Sarah Connor</a> for the first time in close to three decades. This alone should be worth the price of admission, providing the powers that be can avoid any madcap Terminator Genisys-style last-minute plot twists. If Hamilton\u2019s voice suddenly seems to take on a slight Austrian accent, or her eyes begin glowing all red and shiny, we\u2019ll know we\u2019re in trouble.</p> <p>Do audiences really want to see a Men in Black movie without Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones? We\u2019ll find out in June when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/29/thor-ragnarok-review-humour-lightens-marvel-chris-hemsworth\">Thor: Ragnarok</a> pals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chris-hemsworth\">Chris Hemsworth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/16/tessa-thompson-interview-decided-not-to-work-until-i-burned-for-something\">Tessa Thompson</a> pull on the sharp suits and make with the forget-everything gizmos in the latest instalment of the zany alien saga. Meanwhile, Smith has jumped ship to October\u2019s Gemini Man, which has the inimitable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/30/ang-lee-billy-lynns-long-halftime-walk-film-brokeback-mountain\">Ang Lee</a> in charge \u2013 though don\u2019t forget that the Taiwanese \u2026 ahem \u2026 <em>director of The Hulk</em> boasts somewhat average form when it comes to genre fare.

And will there really be an appetite for three Disney live action remakes in a single year? These are some of the posers that 2019 stands ready to answer, so let\u2019s dig right in to Week in geek\u2019s annual all-action preview of the big-screen hotties and notties for the 12 months ahead. Sizzling superhero epics and spiky spin-offs For all those complaining that they cannot peep their head inside a multiplex without being accosted by musclebound hunks with magical abilities, things are unlikely to get much better in 2019. The Marvel big guns will roll out in April\u2019s Avengers: Endgame, March\u2019s Captain Marvel and July\u2019s Spider-Man: Far from Home. The first will reveal how the world puts itself back together after Thanos\u2019s climactic finger snap in last year\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War, and the latter two take place before and after the big purple meanie destroyed half the galaxy\u2019s intelligent life forms. Meanwhile, the main movie from Warner Bros-owned DC this year will be the ostensibly kid-friendly Shazam!, about a skinny teenager who is given the power to identify obscure pop music tracks transform into a hulking costumed crime fighter simply by uttering the name of the hokey golden age hero. However, the year ahead does offer up the tantalising prospect of film-makers reworking the superhero genre into new and more intriguing forms. Might the comic book movie be entering its \u201cacid western\u201d period? Take October\u2019s Joker, which will exist outside the main DC Extended Universe. With more than a nod to Martin Scorsese\u2019s classic mean-minded 1982 satire The King of Comedy (as well as Alan Moore\u2019s graphic novel The Killing Joke), Todd Phillips\u2019s origin story stars Joaquin Phoenix as the crown prince of Gotham, recasting the DC staple as a failed standup comedian who embarks on a life of crime. With a budget of just $55m and no prospect of this new Joker being shoehorned into encounters with other DC stalwarts, the project has the welcome air of a production unhampered by commercial concerns. Of course, if it breaks all box office records, expect the DCEU to be immediately repositioned around this version of Batman\u2019s arch-nemesis, with the unfortunate Jared Leto unceremoniously jettisoned to a parallel comic book universe. Over at Twentieth Century Fox, still clinging on to its X-Men-tinted corner of the Marvel universe (at least until the studio completes its merger with Disney) the year\u2019s main focus will no doubt be June\u2019s Dark Phoenix. And yet August\u2019s The New Mutants, from The Fault in Our Stars director Josh Boone, looks a whole lot more interesting. Centring on four young people with nascent powers who have been trapped in a mysterious facility by unknown forces, it stars bright young things Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch) and Maisie Williams (Game of Thrones), and might mark a welcome shift for the superhero genre into full-on horror territory. Tipped to step even further over the line into gnarly eccentricity are M Night Shyamalan\u2019s Glass (out later this month), the third instalment of a trilogy that began with 2000\u2019s Unbreakable and continued with 2016\u2019s Split, and Brightburn, which looks like a twisted blend of Superman and The Omen. The former will see Samuel L Jackson\u2019s Mr Glass encountering the many kidney-curdling personalities of James McAvoy\u2019s Kevin Wendell Crumb, while Bruce Willis\u2019s David Dunn wrings his supposedly invincible fingers in angst. The latter sees Elizabeth Banks as a Martha Kent figure who rescues an all-powerful space baby from a fallen interstellar craft, only to discover her new ward is not the (Kryptonian) messiah, but a very naughty boy indeed.

Perhaps most intriguing here will be the prospect of noting whether the latter\u2019s director, Guy Ritchie, can finally move on from his past, or whether the new Aladdin will emerge as a lovable cockney urchin with super slo-mo fight skills. Perhaps Will Smith, who plays the genie, will grant the film-maker\u2019s wish for a hit after the disappointing double whammy of 2015\u2019s The Man From UNCLE and 2017\u2019s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.

Before that, in February, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part will return us to the world of super-sarcastic playthings as Chris Pratt\u2019s Emmet Brickowski is forced once again from his comfortably awesome existence to rescue Elizabeth Banks\u2019s Wyldstyle from the clutches of a nutty intergalactic invader named General Sweet Mayhem. Finally, next month\u2019s How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World will bring the adventures of Jay Baruchel\u2019s high-flying Hiccup to a rip-roaring close. The viking chieftain and his girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera) are forced to hunt out the titular dragon homeland after coming up against a powerful new enemy, while his trusty steed Toothless finally gets his own love interest. Far-out sci-fi Robert Rodriguez\u2019s cyberpunk Alita: Battle Angel (February) is the movie James Cameron was so desperate to make, for so many years, that he eventually dumped it on somebody else. Rosa Salazar\u2019s big-eyed Alita just looks downright weird in the trailers, and it remains to be seen whether an effect that works perfectly well in anime settles down over the course of the movie or just gives everyone watching a headache. Another Cameron cast-off of sorts is the so-far-untitled Terminator reboot that\u2019s due to arrive naked and glistening around November time. Deadpool\u2019s Tim Miller directs, with Linda Hamilton returning as Sarah Connor for the first time in close to three decades. This alone should be worth the price of admission, providing the powers that be can avoid any madcap Terminator Genisys-style last-minute plot twists. If Hamilton\u2019s voice suddenly seems to take on a slight Austrian accent, or her eyes begin glowing all red and shiny, we\u2019ll know we\u2019re in trouble. Do audiences really want to see a Men in Black movie without Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones? We\u2019ll find out in June when Thor: Ragnarok pals Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson pull on the sharp suits and make with the forget-everything gizmos in the latest instalment of the zany alien saga. Meanwhile, Smith has jumped ship to October\u2019s Gemini Man, which has the inimitable Ang Lee in charge \u2013 though don\u2019t forget that the Taiwanese \u2026 ahem \u2026 director of The Hulk boasts somewhat average form when it comes to genre fare. Given this one is about an ageing assassin who comes up against a younger version of himself, the one-time Hollywood top dog\u2019s aides will presumably be hoping against hope that nobody remembers Looper. Finally, December sees the final instalment in the new Star Wars trilogy hit cinemas. Mark Hamill\u2019s Luke Skywalker returns (again) after copping it last time (presumably as some kind of Force ghost), while we\u2019ll get to see if Adam Driver\u2019s Kylo Ren can recover from his ignominious failure to spot Skywalker\u2019s cheap conjuring trick at the Battle of Crait. Does anyone care who Rey\u2019s parents are any more?",

      "body": "<p>It seems a strange thing to say about the disgraced Labour MP for Peterborough, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/19/labour-mp-fiona-onasanya-guilty-of-lying-over-speeding-charge\" title=\"\">Fiona Onasanya</a> is a lucky woman. Onasanya was found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice last month. She faces a prison sentence. She is contemplating the ruin of a career that included her public aspiration to become Britain\u2019s first black female prime minister. I\u2019m not sticking my neck out very far to say that this last is not now going to happen.</p> <p>Onasanya\u2019s offence: she repeatedly denied to police that she was behind the wheel when her car was caught speeding in Cambridgeshire in 2017. She refused to say who was driving. In fact it was Onasanya, who is a qualified solicitor as well as an MP. After a first trial failed to agree a verdict, Onasanya was found guilty at the retrial. She will be sentenced soon.</p> <p>Amazingly, Onasanya remains an MP, at least until then. This is the first reason she is lucky. Many of us would have already been fired by now. MPs, however, enjoy some privileges, often rightly (think for a moment about the potential for partisan mischief of a general zero-tolerance statute). So a conviction does not debar someone from being an MP unless they are sentenced to 12 months or more (the result of a law brought in after the IRA hunger-striker Bobby Sands was elected in 1981 while serving 14 years). So Onasanya is entitled to remain until she is sentenced.</p> <p>Yet her determination is unusual. In recent cases in which MPs have faced criminal trials, they have often resigned before trial or sentencing. The Liberal Democrat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/mar/11/chris-huhne-vicky-pryce\" title=\"\">Chris Huhne</a>, who also lied to police about a speeding offence, resigned as an MP after pleading guilty in 2013. During the expenses crisis, Labour\u2019s David Chaytor, Jim Devine, Margaret Moran, Elliot Morley and Denis MacShane all quit before trial, and Eric Illsley did so before sentence. Conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/10/how-case-against-nigel-evans-fell-apart\" title=\"\">Nigel Evans</a> stayed in the Commons while on trial for sexual offences in 2014, of which he was acquitted. Onasanya, convicted, remains.</p> <p>What is more, she is up for a fight. In an unabashed <a href=\"https://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/opinion/peterborough-mp-fiona-onasanya-i-will-continue-to-fight-against-injustices-1-8752541\" title=\"\">article for the Peterborough Telegraph</a> last week, Onasanya wrote that \u201canyone who has been following the news\u201d would know that politics has recently been busy and fractious over Brexit and welfare reform, and that she was fighting for Peterborough. There was zero acknowledgment that anyone who had been following the news would also know she had been convicted of a serious crime \u2013 and no suggestion she had let her electors down. Far from it. Onasanya has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/20/labour-mp-fiona-onasanya-likens-her-conviction-to-that-of-biblical-figures\" title=\"\">compared herself to Jesus</a>, whose conviction \u201cby the courts of his day\u201d was the start of \u201cthe next chapter in his story\u201d.</p> <p>Her messianic defiance hasn\u2019t gone unrebuked. As soon as she was convicted, the Labour party suspended her. Jeremy Corbyn said she was \u201cobviously\u201d not going to stay an MP. Onasanya\u2019s article prompted the paper\u2019s editor to say that, while he felt duty bound to publish her column because she was the local MP, she ought to resign. \u201cShe is no longer fit to represent the people of Peterborough,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/opinion/peterborough-telegraph-editor-s-comment-unfortunately-no-longer-fit-to-be-an-mp-1-8754245\" title=\"\">Mark Edwards wrote</a>. But represent Peterborough she still does. It will be fascinating to see how far she pushes her luck in the Commons when it returns on Monday.</p> <p>Because here\u2019s the second reason Onasanya is lucky. Convicted MPs are actually very rare. No sitting MP has been imprisoned since 1991. That\u2019s not because, as the expenses scandal showed, there have been no miscreants. It\u2019s because, in the past 25 years, a story like hers would have had only one ending. Onasanya would have been driven out of Westminster, probably by the media alone, and also by political and parliamentary ostracism. But not, perhaps, any longer.</p> <p>That\u2019s because Onasanya is a beneficiary of something new \u2013 the Brexit obliteration effect. With politics so preoccupied, stories like hers have slipped down the agenda to become merely a sideshow. Neither her peers nor the media have the energy or space to chase her down in the old way. The blanket of Brexit has settled across almost everything in politics, like a deposit of volcanic ash, making traditional politics all but impossible. That same blanket is heaven sent for someone such as Onasanya.</p> <p>Moreover, and let\u2019s face facts here, she is a vote. In a knife-edge hung parliament, every vote matters. Last month, when Theresa May\u2019s leadership was on the line, the Conservative high command quietly took Burton MP Andrew Griffiths and Dover\u2019s Charlie Elphicke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/12/tory-mps-suspended-over-sex-allegations-reinstated-for-confidence-vote\" title=\"\">back into the fold</a>. They did so because their votes for May mattered more to Tory whips than the claims of inappropriate sexual behaviour, which the MPs deny, that led to their suspensions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/28/convicted-mp-fiona-onasanya-intends-to-stay-in-parliament\">Convicted MP Fiona Onasanya intends to stay in parliament</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour has decisively cut its ties with Onasanya. But she still has a vote, and she is a vote for Corbyn\u2019s pro-Brexit stance. That vote would be lost if there was an early byelection in leave-voting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/09/local-elections-peterborough-brexit-labour-conservatives\" title=\"\">marginal Peterborough</a>, which Onasanya won from the Tories in 2017 by a mere 607 votes. You can see why Labour might be willing to wait. Not even the Tories want a Peterborough byelection right now, especially if Nigel Farage reverses his pledge not to run, turning the contest into a toxic verdict on May\u2019s Brexit. In the end, it may take a recall petition to oust Onasanya.</p> <p>Britain can \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/31/in-2019-the-uk-will-start-a-new-chapter-says-theresa-may\" title=\"\">turn a corner</a>\u201d and start a new chapter if parliament backs her Brexit deal, said May in her new year\u2019s message.

      "bodyText": "It seems a strange thing to say about the disgraced Labour MP for Peterborough, but Fiona Onasanya is a lucky woman. Onasanya was found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice last month. She faces a prison sentence. She is contemplating the ruin of a career that included her public aspiration to become Britain\u2019s first black female prime minister. I\u2019m not sticking my neck out very far to say that this last is not now going to happen. Onasanya\u2019s offence: she repeatedly denied to police that she was behind the wheel when her car was caught speeding in Cambridgeshire in 2017. She refused to say who was driving. In fact it was Onasanya, who is a qualified solicitor as well as an MP. After a first trial failed to agree a verdict, Onasanya was found guilty at the retrial. She will be sentenced soon. Amazingly, Onasanya remains an MP, at least until then. This is the first reason she is lucky. Many of us would have already been fired by now. MPs, however, enjoy some privileges, often rightly (think for a moment about the potential for partisan mischief of a general zero-tolerance statute). So a conviction does not debar someone from being an MP unless they are sentenced to 12 months or more (the result of a law brought in after the IRA hunger-striker Bobby Sands was elected in 1981 while serving 14 years). So Onasanya is entitled to remain until she is sentenced. Yet her determination is unusual. In recent cases in which MPs have faced criminal trials, they have often resigned before trial or sentencing. The Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne, who also lied to police about a speeding offence, resigned as an MP after pleading guilty in 2013. During the expenses crisis, Labour\u2019s David Chaytor, Jim Devine, Margaret Moran, Elliot Morley and Denis MacShane all quit before trial, and Eric Illsley did so before sentence. Conservative Nigel Evans stayed in the Commons while on trial for sexual offences in 2014, of which he was acquitted. Onasanya, convicted, remains. What is more, she is up for a fight. In an unabashed article for the Peterborough Telegraph last week, Onasanya wrote that \u201canyone who has been following the news\u201d would know that politics has recently been busy and fractious over Brexit and welfare reform, and that she was fighting for Peterborough. There was zero acknowledgment that anyone who had been following the news would also know she had been convicted of a serious crime \u2013 and no suggestion she had let her electors down. Far from it. Onasanya has now compared herself to Jesus, whose conviction \u201cby the courts of his day\u201d was the start of \u201cthe next chapter in his story\u201d. Her messianic defiance hasn\u2019t gone unrebuked. As soon as she was convicted, the Labour party suspended her. Jeremy Corbyn said she was \u201cobviously\u201d not going to stay an MP. Onasanya\u2019s article prompted the paper\u2019s editor to say that, while he felt duty bound to publish her column because she was the local MP, she ought to resign. \u201cShe is no longer fit to represent the people of Peterborough,\u201d Mark Edwards wrote. But represent Peterborough she still does. It will be fascinating to see how far she pushes her luck in the Commons when it returns on Monday. Because here\u2019s the second reason Onasanya is lucky. Convicted MPs are actually very rare. No sitting MP has been imprisoned since 1991. That\u2019s not because, as the expenses scandal showed, there have been no miscreants. It\u2019s because, in the past 25 years, a story like hers would have had only one ending. Onasanya would have been driven out of Westminster, probably by the media alone, and also by political and parliamentary ostracism. But not, perhaps, any longer. That\u2019s because Onasanya is a beneficiary of something new \u2013 the Brexit obliteration effect. With politics so preoccupied, stories like hers have slipped down the agenda to become merely a sideshow. Neither her peers nor the media have the energy or space to chase her down in the old way. The blanket of Brexit has settled across almost everything in politics, like a deposit of volcanic ash, making traditional politics all but impossible. That same blanket is heaven sent for someone such as Onasanya. Moreover, and let\u2019s face facts here, she is a vote. In a knife-edge hung parliament, every vote matters. Last month, when Theresa May\u2019s leadership was on the line, the Conservative high command quietly took Burton MP Andrew Griffiths and Dover\u2019s Charlie Elphicke back into the fold. They did so because their votes for May mattered more to Tory whips than the claims of inappropriate sexual behaviour, which the MPs deny, that led to their suspensions. Labour has decisively cut its ties with Onasanya. But she still has a vote, and she is a vote for Corbyn\u2019s pro-Brexit stance. That vote would be lost if there was an early byelection in leave-voting, marginal Peterborough, which Onasanya won from the Tories in 2017 by a mere 607 votes. You can see why Labour might be willing to wait. Not even the Tories want a Peterborough byelection right now, especially if Nigel Farage reverses his pledge not to run, turning the contest into a toxic verdict on May\u2019s Brexit. In the end, it may take a recall petition to oust Onasanya. Britain can \u201cturn a corner\u201d and start a new chapter if parliament backs her Brexit deal, said May in her new year\u2019s message. She makes that all sound so simple. Get Brexit sorted and move on. In essence it\u2019s what Corbyn wants too, to get back to \u201creal\u201d politics after this long distraction. But as the Onasanya saga shows, such politics is asphyxiated by Brexit. Post-Brexit politics will be much more like Brexit politics than May and Corbyn think. There will be no quick turning of corners and no tidy new chapters, whatever MPs decide in two weeks\u2019 time. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<h2><strong>GETTING THE HOUSE IN ORDER</strong></h2> <p>Human beings have now reached such an advanced stage of evolution that we are prepared to pay cash money to a subscription channel to watch a reality television programme called Tidying Up. You can find that one on Netflix, tune in kids. It stars organising consultant Marie Kondo, whose MO is to rock up at someone\u2019s tat-packed house and order them to throw away some stuff and fold up their clothes neatly. That\u2019s about it, give or take. While cynics may raise an eyebrow at the brazen simplicity of the advice proffered, and ponder the savage irony of how the ten million copies of her NYT No 1 bestseller will be cluttering up charity shops for years to come, the folk she advises seem pretty happy at the end of each episode. So fair\u2019s fair. \u201cSparking joy\u201d is Kondo\u2019s mantra, nicked from The Fiver. OK, she didn\u2019t nick it from The Fiver.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/02/newcastle-united-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Romelu Lukaku scores with first touch as Manchester United beat Newcastle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anyway, this uncomplicated carry-on isn\u2019t a million miles away from what fellow lifestyle guru Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has been up to recently, ever since arriving at Old Trafford and exclaiming Jesus wept, will you look at all this effing mess, it\u2019s like somebody put a toddler in charge of housekeeping. Whenever Kondo arrives to advise on a cleaning purge, her first act is to kneel and offer respect to the house. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s first act upon becoming interim boss at Manchester United was notably similar, as he bowed down to sing hosannas to an institution he holds in the highest regard, an act of polite deference far beyond the toddler who was recently in charge of housekeeping.</p> <p>Then it was time, in line with the Kondo credo, to spark some joy. Solskj\u00e6r did this with a directive as simple as suggesting someone pair up their socks and store all their cutlery in a kitchen drawer: pile forward! And the joy was sparked. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave in May,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/02/newcastle-united-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">his fourth win out of four</a> at Newcastle, a record which emulates a certain Matt Busby\u2019s start at United. If he keeps going at this rate \u2026 well, just imagine Ed Woodward\u2019s dilemma this summer, as the galactico-obsessed suit celebrates Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s delivery of a top-four place, the FA Cup and Big Cup, yet despite all the evidence right in front of his face, still really, really, <em>really</em> wants to give the job to the Big World Star who\u2019s shown an interest.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re only three days into 2019, but it is already clear that the travails of the Chinese economy are set to be one of the major stories of the year. On Wednesday weak Chinese purchasing managers index data set the mostly negative tone for investors around the world, before Apple\u2019s revenue forecast downgrade dominated Thursday\u2019s trading. Alphabet has now overtaken Apple as the world\u2019s third-largest listed company after the precipitous fall in the latter\u2019s shares. The 9% fall at the latest reading equates to $67bn wiped off its market value. After breaking the trillion-dollar mark in 2018, it value lies at around $680bn now. Weak US factory data from the Institute for Supply Management have added to the bearish sentiment, as new order growth slumped to its lowest since 2014. US stocks have fallen across the major indices, with the S&amp;P 500 down by 2.1%, the Nasdaq 100 down by 2.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average down by 2.6% as this blog closes. And the contagion has been felt across the world, with Apple suppliers and China-exposed companies feeling the pain. In Europe shares remain down as markets prepare to close, with the FTSE 100 losing 0.5%. Thanks for reading the business live blog and farewell until tomorrow. JJ US stocks are continuing their downward spiral. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down by 2.4%, or 550 points. The S&amp;P 500 is down by 2% and the Nasdaq down 2.1%. Apple is, unsurprisingly, a big weight in all of them. The US\u2019s closely followed ISM manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) has also offered disappointing data, with the weakest new orders since January 2014. The index fell to a reading of 54.1 in December, much lower than the 57.9 consensus. The new order reading slumped from a reading of 62.1 in November to only 51.1. The survey pointed to continued expansion, but at a much less robust pace, according to Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s survey committee. He said: Comments from the panel reflect continued expanding business strength, but at much lower levels. Demand softened, with the New Orders Index retreating to recent low levels. Trump pipes up. President Donald Trump has blamed the three-week-old US government shutdown on the Democrats, again, in a morning tweet. And, as a chaser, he adds that the administration is \u201cdoing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on\u201d, mentioning China but not giving any detail. On a five-year view Apple has still made its investors a lot of money, but it has been an astonishing slump in just a quarter of a year from one of America\u2019s corporate behemoths. Read it and weep. That vertical line on the right hand side is the performance of Apple at the Wall Street open. Apple shares peaked at $233.47 in October, but they have since lost almost 40% of their value. They opened down 8.5% at around $144 and have kept going to more than 9%. If Apple shares remain on the same track today it would equate to the biggest one-day share price drop for five years, according to the Financial Times. The S&amp;P 500 is down by about 1% as well, while the Nasdaq is down by about 1.4 in early trading. While painful for investors, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that futures were pointing to worse losses on US indices earlier in the European trading day. The Dow Jones industrial average falls by 1% in early trading as ripples from the Apple revenue downgrade spread across the market. A reminder before the Wall Street open: Apple\u2019s market value was briefly above $1 trillion last year. Not any more. The market cap was $749.39bn at the end of trading on Wednesday. A 9% fall, as predicted by pre-market trading, would see that fall to almost $680bn \u2013 or $67bn off. We shall see shortly. More on that limp end to the year for the construction sector revealed by purchasing managers index data. The UK construction sector ended 2018 on a weaker footing, hitting a three-month low in December amid fading demand for commercial projects and the growing risk of a no-deal Brexit, writes Richard Partington. Construction companies hit a weaker patch during the last month of 2018 as new orders increased at a relatively subdued pace, while there were some reports that wet weather disrupted work. Read more here: Concerns over Chinese growth \u2013 spurred by weak manufacturing survey readings as well as Apple \u2013 have rightly dominated the business agenda so far this year, but here is a little reminder of what is ahead for the UK economy as Brexit approaches. The \u201cstartup\u201d company hired by the government to operate extra ferries as part of no-deal Brexit planning had no ships, and now it turns out its website terms and conditions on its website were intended for a food delivery firm, writes Ben Quinn. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the customer to thoroughly check the supplied goods before agreeing to pay for any meal/order,\u201d read part of the text on Seaborne Freight\u2019s website \u2013 after it won a \u00a313.8m contract. Read more here: More on the consensus-busting ADP number from Capital Economics. Andrew Hunter, Capital Economics\u2019 senior US economist, said the data provide \u201cfurther evidence that, for all the recent volatility in financial markets, the US economy remains in a healthy shape going into 2019.\u201d The markets apparently now believe that the Fed won\u2019t be raising rates at all this year. However, while we have long expected that an economic slowdown would eventually persuade officials to move to the side-lines later this year, we doubt that the Fed will be ready to abandon its rate hike plans when employment growth is still so strong and economic growth is still well above trend. Here is something (maybe) for the US investor bulls: Payrolls company ADP has reported that the US private sector added 271,000 jobs in December \u2013 far above the 178,000 expected, according to the economists\u2019 consensus. The figures suggest that tomorrow\u2019s market-moving non-farm payrolls data could beat current expectations of 177,000. The implications for stocks could be tricky: it could mean the economy is actually performing better than expected, helping company profits; on the other hand, it could persuade the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster, eventually slowing growth. Either way, the number is \u201ca welcome jolt to the market\u2019s favored narrative that the economy is slowing sharply\u201d, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He added: To describe this as startling would be something of an understatement. The biggest increase in the ADP measure of private employment since February last year came out of the blue. US futures have recovered slightly as the New York markets prepare to open, but they still point to a tough day ahead for America\u2019s biggest companies as investors try to judge how serious Apple\u2019s surprise revenue downgrade really was. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index appears in line to bear the brunt of investor fears, with futures down by 1.7%. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 are down by 0.9% while futures for the Dow Jones industrial average are down by 1%. Apple shares are set to fall by about 8% when the Nasdaq opens, after chief executive Tim Cook said the company had been blindsided by weaker demand for its products in China. It follows a trading day in Europe dominated by reaction to Apple\u2019s announcement, which shocked Wall Street and sent down the share prices of Apple suppliers and companies with major exposures to the Chinese economy \u2013 the makers of luxury goods such as Gucci owner Kering and Burberry prominent among them. In the UK, a quieter day for the City sees the FTSE 100 \u2013 now flirting with positive territory \u2013 led by Next. Despite a small profit downgrade, the retailer reported a better than expected Christmas period. UK construction figures earlier in the day also confirmed that the sector is in wait-and-see mode ahead of Brexit. Shares in AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline have been buoyed by the $74bn Bristol-Myers Squibb deal with Celgene. Both were in negative territory earlier in the day, but AstraZeneca is now up by 1.6% and GSK has gained 0.9%. Look at the jump in AstraZeneca\u2019s share price after the deal was announced at around midday GMT: Even with volatile stock markets and fears over global growth, it looks like Bristol-Myers Squibb has persuaded some investors that big pharma mergers and acquisitions are still possible. The first mega deal of the year has just landed in the US: pharma company Bristol-Myers Squibb plans to buy biotech firm Celgene for a cool $74bn. The $102.43 per Celgene cash and stock share offer will give Bristol-Myers 69% of the new business. It is expected to close in the third quarter of the year, generating cost synergies of $2.5bn by 2022. Shares in Celgene, which specialises in treatments for cancer and other severe, immune, inflammatory conditions, have surged by about 30% in pre-market trading. Bristol-Myers shares fell by 13%. Giovanni Caforio, chairman and chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb (who cannot have had much of a holiday), said he was \u201cimpressed by what Celgene has accomplished for patients\u201d. Just after midday, the European stock sell-off has accelerated in Germany and France. The Dax is down by 1.5% and the Cac 40 has lost 1.4%. The FTSE 100 has lost 0.3%, and the mid-cap FTSE 250 has edged down by 0.15%. Next is the biggest riser of the blue chips, up by 4.6%, followed by Tesco, up by 2.8%. Fashion house Burberry has lost 5.5% and miner Evraz is down by 4.8%. It\u2019s a big anniversary today for the cryptocurrency world: bitcoin turns 10. The original distributed ledger currency has offered much \u2013 although what it (or the underlying technology) has actually delivered so far is a different question. For many of the speculators who drove its price up above $19,000 in December 2017, the subsequent fall back to around $3,800 has hit them where it hurts. \u201cThe most impressive feature of bitcoin is that it is still there\u201d, writes Tibor Fischer today to mark the birthday. It has survived crash after crash and state hostility. It has truly been battle-tested in the harshest of conditions. Yet it has also failed in one of its key aims, Tibor says. The identity-hiding creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, wanted it to be a currency. That looks unlikely. In the near future, you won\u2019t be buying a pint of milk with it at the corner shop. Read more here: Amid the risk-off sentiment, gold is gaining, hitting six-month highs. Gold spot prices reach a high earlier of $1,292.32, although they have now retreated to around $1,287.45, a gain of around 0.3% for the day. Dean Popplewell, a vice president at spreadbetter Oanda, said: Gold prices scaled to a new six-month high earlier this morning as investor worries about a global economic slowdown, couple with equity markets volatility is supporting investor safe-haven buying, while a weaker dollar also offered some support. The price rise boosted London-listed gold miner Fresnillo, which was one of the best performers on the FTSE 100 approaching midday as shares rose by 2.1%. It looks like the Apple waves are going to rock US markets as well. After a brutal start to the first trading session of the year the major American indices actually finished Wednesday up. But that was before Apple cut its revenue guidance on the back of weakness in the Chinese market. US companies will do well to escape pain later. S&amp;P 500 futures are down by 1.7% with just over three hours to go until the opening bell on Wall Street, but futures for the Nasdaq, on which Apple is listed, are down by 2.8%. Dow Jones industrial average futures are down by 1.6%. In pre-market trading Apple\u2019s shares are down by 8.5%, after its first revenue downgrade in almost 12 years. Mostly red across main European stock markets at late morning. The FTSE 100 has weakened again, and is now down by 0.36%. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40 are both down by 1.2%, dragging down the Stoxx 600 by 0.9%. An \u201cuninspiring end to 2018\u201d for the British construction sector. The UK construction PMI has not exactly made waves this morning, with barely a murmur on sterling markets \u2013 the pound\u2019s 0.3% fall today was mainly a result of the market confusion around the flash crash last night. Construction industry activity is \u201clacklustre\u201d, with limp new business numbers not pointing to any likely pick-up, said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. He added: It is evident that there are significant headwinds currently hampering the construction sectors\u2019 upside. Some clients\u2019 willingness to commit to major new projects (particularly in the commercial sector) is currently being limited by Brexit uncertainties and a subdued domestic economy. However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, is more positive. He said: \u201cThe construction sector has had little to cheer recently, but 2019 should be a better year.\u201d Optimism among builders about the outlook for activity over the next 12 months rose to its highest level since April. While many were concerned by Brexit, others anticipated winning work related to some big-ticket transport and energy infrastructure projects in 2019. More detail on the Apple ructions, with European suppliers particularly in the spotlight, writes Mark Sweney. European suppliers to Apple have been hit hard, with the London-listed, Cardiff-based chip manufacturer IQE down 4%. The Newcastle-based software firm Sage fell 1.6%. Across Europe, Dialog Semiconductor, STMicroelectronics and BE Semiconductor fell down 8%, 7% and 3% respectively. The Austrian chipmaker AMS had more than a fifth wiped off its stock value. Chancellor Philip Hammond has appointed Dame Colette Bowe and Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia as external members of one of the Bank of England\u2019s top committees. They will join the financial policy committee (FPC), led by governor Mark Carney, which is responsible for monitoring financial stability. They will replace two men in the second half of the year. The Bank has faced persistent concerns about the gender balance in its top echelons. Of the 42 applicants to the jobs, 20 were women. Five women from 8 were invited to final-stage interviews. Bowe and Gadhia will start their new jobs shortly after the UK\u2019s departure from the EU in March 2019. The Bank has braced itself for financial market turmoil if the UK leaves without a deal. Bowe is the current chairman of the Banking Standards Board and has served as a board member of the UK Statistics Authority and the Department for Transport. Gadhia was the chief executive of Virgin Money from 2007 until last year\u2019s takeover by CYBG, and is one of the City\u2019s most prominent business figures. They will replace Richard Sharp and Martin Taylor, who are stepping down at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2019 respectively. British builders are suffering from \u201can intense headwind\u201d from \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Brexit uncertainty, according to Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit. It was the weakest upturn in commercial activity for seven months. UK construction firms signalled a slowdown in housing and commercial activity growth during December, which more than offset a strong performance for civil engineering at the end of 2018. Despite the weaker housing market, housebuilding came in as the fastest growing sub-sector for builders during the course of 2018. Yet \u201cresidential growth remains much softer than the two-and-a-half year peak achieved last summer\u201d, adds Moore. The growth of the British construction industry slowed in December because of subdued demand, according to the latest purchasing managers index (PMI) for the sector. IHS Markit\u2019s closely followed barometer fell to a reading of 52.8 in December, down from 53.4 in November. The index remained above the 50 no-change mark, indicating the sector is still growing, but it came in slightly below economists\u2019 expectations of 52.9. Next reactions are still coming in, and it\u2019s mostly positive for the retailer. \u201cNot such a bleak midwinter\u201d, according to analysts at UBS, the investment bank. They said that Next\u2019s performance \u201cshowed the benefit of holding full price for as long as possible\u201d. The company could also benefit from \u201cindustry capacity reduction\u201d, UBS said \u2013 banker code for other companies failing amid a struggling industry. Greg Lawless, consumer equity analyst at Shore Capital, said: Like the company, we believe that we need to get through calendar Q1 and understand the political and economic backdrop of any potential Brexit deal. Given the macroeconomic environment and difficult clothing market through the autumn, management should be applauded for such a credible trading update. And, of course, there\u2019s also the story we know well across the retail sector, with investment in online technology key as shopping moves online. Some more interesting detail on the currency flash crash last night which, as ever with these strange incidents, has left traders scratching their heads. The Japanese yen gained by as much as 7% against the Australian dollar, while it also fell steeply against the US dollar. Liquidity was constrained because Japan is still on holiday, meaning a few traders could have an outsized effect. The dramatic slump (and quick rebound) are evident in the chart below. Fritz Louw, currency analyst at Japanese bank MUFG, said: The sharp strengthening of the yen and weakening of the Australian dollar was clearly exaggerated by the flash crash but it does also reflect building fears over slowing global growth particularly in China and Australia. The flash crash also likely caused problems for holders of short positions against the Japanese yen. The below graph from Louw shows that short positions (the grey columns) have increased recently, meaning there will be a lot of losers from the big and brief rise in the yen\u2019s value. Some more good news for Next: stockbroker Liberum has upgraded its recommendation from \u201chold\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d in light of the stronger sales growth. Liberum analysts Tom Musson, Wayne Brown and Adam Tomlinson write: We think is an excellent performance considering how bad November was for the sector and the scale of the downgrades we have seen elsewhere in fashion and clothing. Their target price is now \u00a361 for the shares \u2013 so still a lot of upside in their view from the current mark of around \u00a343. A spike in sales in the last three weeks of December helped save Christmas for the fashion chain Next but a surge in costly web orders will hit annual profits, writes Zoe Wood. The high street bellwether is among only a few retail chains that resist pre-Christmas discounting and it was expected to have suffered as struggling rivals slashed prices to attract shoppers as Brexit jitters weighed on consumer confidence. In the end the retailer reported overall sales growth of 1.5% for the last two months of 2018. Read more here: Early trading confirms that Apple-inspired slowdown fears are leaving their mark on European stocks. Shares are down across major European markets \u2013 although the FTSE 100 has now recovered most of its early losses. London\u2019s blue-chip index is down by 0.1% Losses are steeper in Germany and France, where the Dax and Cac 40 are both down by 0.9%. The Apple contagion is spreading across Europe. Companies with large Chinese sales volumes are in the spotlight. Watchmaker Swatch and Kering, the luxury goods brand owner, have both taken a tumble, while Burberry is down by 3%. London-listed chipmaker IQE is down by 1%. Mining stocks are down across the board (with the exception of miners of safe-haven gold) as the Apple update feeds into fears that the slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, will drag on demand for minerals. Evraz and Antofagasta are among the largest fallers in the FTSE 100, both down by 2%. Next shares jump by 6%. The market appears to be pleased with Next\u2019s update, with shares hopping over Marks &amp; Spencer to lead the FTSE 100. Associated British Foods, which owns the Primark retailer, gained by 2%. Kingfisher, the owner of DIY chain B&amp;Q, gained by about 1%. Next chief executive Simon Wolfson said, \u201cThe UK consumer is not in a bad place.\u201d FTSE falls by 0.5% at the open. Marks &amp; Spencer is the early leader, up by more than 4% in the opening minutes, boosted by the readacross from Next\u2019s results. Burberry, which is highly exposed to the Chinese market, is among the biggest fallers early on, down by 2.8%. Let\u2019s get some more detail on that Apple forecast downgrade overnight. Trading in Apple shares was temporarily halted after the California-based company cut revenue forecasts, writes Dominic Rushe. \u201cWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,\u201d said Apple chief executive Tim Cook. He cited falling sales of iPhones, Mac computers and iPads. Apple\u2019s statement was its first profit warning since 2002 and its first of the smartphone age. Welcome to the business live blog, with our rolling coverage of markets, global economics and corporate news. After John Lewis yesterday reported a bump in sales in late December following a rocky pre-Christmas period, fellow retailer Next has also issued a relatively positive update, with trading in line with its previous forecasts. Sales at the FTSE 100 retailer rose by 1.5% from 28 October to 29 December, although it slightly downgraded its pre-tax profit forecast for the full year by \u00a34m, to \u00a3723m. The retail industry has been under serious pressure, but some analysts have argued that Next, which resisted the temptation to chase volumes with widespread discounting, may be able to weather the storm. On global markets, a shock revenue forecast downgrade from Apple overnight added to jitters that have carried over from the end of 2018. Apple\u2019s update after the close on US markets \u2013 which recovered from earlier falls to edge up on Wednesday \u2013 shocked Wall Street. Apple shares fell by as much as 7.5% in after-hours trading, as the company issued a warning that sales in the key Chinese market were dragged back by slowing growth. US stock futures point to another tricky session coming up later. The news prompted nerves on currency markets, where what appears to be a flash crash saw the Japanese yen soar against the US dollar as investors surged towards safe havens. Japanese markets remain on holiday, but Nikkei 225 futures fell by 2.2%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi 200 index fell by 0.95%. However, Thursday\u2019s trading was less painful in Hong Kong and Shenzhen after heavy falls on Wednesday: shares on the Shanghai SE composite index fell by only 0.2%, while the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index lost 0.3%. Australian shares bucked the trend as the Australian dollar fell to near decade lows, boosting mining companies.

      "bodyText": "Bayern Munich have returned with a new offer worth \u00a330m plus add-ons as they step up their attempt to sign Callum Hudson-Odoi from Chelsea. The German champions have identified the 18-year-old England youth international as one of their primary targets in the January transfer window. Hudson-Odoi has less than 18 months remaining on his current contract and has refused to negotiate a new deal with Chelsea as he weighs up his options, with Bayern already having bids of \u00a315m and \u00a320m rejected. After Chelsea announced the \u00a358m purchase of Christian Pulisic from Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, Bayern have returned with a third offer that could make Hudson-Odoi the most expensive English teenager in history, eclipsing the \u00a330m Manchester United spent on Luke Shaw in 2014. The bid remains under consideration, with Chelsea seriously considering selling a player who first joined the club as a seven-year-old despite the manager, Maurizio Sarri, stating this week he has the potential to become one of the best players in Europe. While Chelsea hope they can still persuade him to commit to a new five-year contract offered last summer, it is understood that Hudson-Odoi is keen to establish himself as a first-team player at a time when his former England Under-17 teammates Jadon Sancho and Reiss Nelson have benefited from their moves to Germany.

      "body": "<p>Jenny Runacre had an uncanny experience when she saw herself in a 43-year-old film recently. The woman on screen was her, but the voice was not hers.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe the film had been dubbed into Italian and then dubbed back into English with another actor. Or maybe they didn\u2019t like my voice and changed it to someone else\u2019s,\u201d she says in a voice of a more seductive, deeper timbre than the one I had heard on film.</p> <p>If Runacre\u2019s voice has been erased, that would be fitting. Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s The Passenger, which is now being revived in a digitally improved version, is about changing identities. It could have been called The Man Who Mistook Himself for a Corpse. Its protagonist, played by Jack Nicholson, is a TV journalist called David Locke who is covering a civil war in a nameless African republic. He is sick of himself, professionally burned out, and his marriage is on the rocks. Then he sees a way out. He swaps identities with a lookalike man whose body he finds in a hotel room. Little does he know that the man he has become is a rebel gun-runner whom government hitmen want to rub out. He becomes, unwittingly at first, a politically committed freedom fighter rather than the detached observer of a struggle that he was in his previous life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"124b591dbfae29de9184ac7ef04340c550676b2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/124b591dbfae29de9184ac7ef04340c550676b2e/0_0_3905_2541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny Runacre, pictured in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenny Runacre, pictured in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Runacre plays Rachel, Locke\u2019s estranged wife and a fellow journalist, whom we see in London with her lover, played by Steven Berkoff.

In flashback, we see Rachel observing her husband as he interviews the republic\u2019s dictator.

You\u2019d work not knowing what you were doing. I thought, if he\u2019s unhappy with what I\u2019m doing he will tell me. On set, though, he wouldn\u2019t really talk to you directly, but would often send over another person who would say: \u2018The maestro would like you to do this or that.\u2019 How lovely to be called maestro!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abfc18677c5792160dac7cf72e91129ca37ded6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abfc18677c5792160dac7cf72e91129ca37ded6e/0_0_2228_1659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Nicholson in The Passenger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Nicholson in The Passenger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And what of Nicholson and Maria Schneider, credited only as the Girl, with whom Locke gallivants around Europe and Africa, all the while pursued by hitmen until the film\u2019s tragic denouement?</p> <p>\u201cIt was an unusually quiet performance that Antonioni got out of Jack \u2013 very different from those excitable performances he gave in Chinatown, One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest and The Shining.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholson was accompanied during the 10-week shoot through Algeria, Spain and London by his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston.</p> <p>\u201cHe was notoriously promiscuous and, despite Anjelica being there, flirted with the girls on the set and they with him.\u201d Including her? \u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t interested. Instead, I formed a bond with Maria and her girlfriend Joey, an American photographer she was devoted to, and who was treated for psychosis soon after filming finished on The Passenger. Maria hated Hollywood and had had terrible experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Schneider was just 19 when she appeared in Bertolucci\u2019s notorious Last Tango in Paris (1972). \u201cShe told me she didn\u2019t know in advance there were going to be nude scenes.\u201d In the film, Marlon Brando\u2019s character, Paul, rapes Schneider\u2019s character, Jeanne, using a stick of butter as lubricant. In a 2007 interview, Schneider said the scene wasn\u2019t in the original script, and that Brando and Bertolucci had told her about it just before they began filming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"641b6bd81ce5d912b7db93d9160ddec760107c56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/641b6bd81ce5d912b7db93d9160ddec760107c56/0_509_5124_3075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Passenger with (from left) Maria Schneider Runacre, Charles Mulvehill and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Caffarel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Passenger with (from left) Maria Schneider Runacre, Charles Mulvehill and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Caffarel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/26/bernardo-bertolucci-obituary\" title=\"\">The director, who died earlier this year</a>, later acknowledged that he had sprung the scene on Schneider at the last minute, because he wanted her onscreen humiliation and rage to be real. \u201cI wanted Maria to feel, not to act,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Runacre says: \u201cShe told me that she wasn\u2019t actually buggered but that she was utterly humiliated by the way Bertolucci treated her.\u201d</p> <p>After The Passenger was screened at Cannes in 1975, cast and director rose for the expected applause, only to be booed. \u201cThey were booing Maria for her scandalous performance in Last Tango.

He should have, though.\u201d </p> <p>Runacre got the role in The Passenger because Antonioni had admired her debut performance in John Cassavetes\u2019 1970 film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKJcKI5v_SE\" title=\"\">Husbands</a>. She was a drama student when she auditioned to play a young English woman with whom Cassavetes\u2019 character has a dalliance while on a trip to London with his pals, played by Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara, when the three of them are going through a collective midlife crisis after the death of a friend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c752488bdc223db9a47908f434deef77b506ac7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c752488bdc223db9a47908f434deef77b506ac7e/0_0_3000_2013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Husbands (1970) with (from left) Noelle Kao, Peter Falk, Jenny Runacre, Ben Gazzara, Jenny Lee Wright and John Cassavetes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Husbands (1970) with (from left) Noelle Kao, Peter Falk, Jenny Runacre, Ben Gazzara, Jenny Lee Wright and John Cassavetes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI got the part, then forgot about it, graduated and went to Scarborough and played in rep \u2013 stuff like Agatha Christie and Pinocchio. While I was there, we were all drinking Guinness, so I put on a bit of weight. Then I got the call from Cassavetes saying I\u2019d got the role. I went back to London and Ben Gazzara said to me: \u2018You\u2019ve put on weight \u2013 better lose it.\u2019 People wouldn\u2019t speak that way now. But I slimmed down very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>She loved working on the film, particularly an early scene of mostly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKJcKI5v_SE\" title=\"\">improvised flirtation</a> with Cassavetes. \u201cIt was a great introduction to film for me because I had been learning the Stanislavski method and here I was learning something very different from Cassavetes.\u201d</p> <p>Husbands proved such a critical success that Cassavetes advised her to hurry to Hollywood. Why didn\u2019t you go? \u201cI didn\u2019t want Hollywood upending my life \u2013 or the humiliations that Maria was exposed to.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, while raising a family in London, Runacre worked with some of cinema\u2019s leading directors. She appeared in Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s The Canterbury Tales, Tony Richardson\u2019s Joseph Andrews, Ridley Scott\u2019s The Duellists, Nicolas Roeg\u2019s The Witches, John Huston\u2019s The MacKintosh Man and Derek Jarman\u2019s Jubilee.

He once shouted at me that I was driving too fast when we drove to Cannes to show Jubilee in 1978. He was right \u2013 I did drive too fast, so the car broke down. When we arrived, everything was stolen from our hotel room. And the people at the festival hated our punk gear \u2013 they thought we were ugly.\u201d She continues: \u201cI loved working with Derek, because it was all DIY, making our costumes and sets. You\u2019d never get that in Hollywood.\u201d</p> <p>Although she has acted throughout her career, on stage, film and TV (she was, for instance, Brenda Champion in Charles Sturridge\u2019s 80s adaptation of Brideshead Revisited), Runacre reinvented herself as a visual artist in the 90s and later taught performance art in west London. Her installation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4WfBNpBj3M\" title=\"\">At Least I\u2019ve Got My Visual Stimulus</a> is a Beckett-like piece featuring Runacre as a woman on stage talking unstoppably (the stimulant is telly), and her performance piece <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn6AdLHWRyA\" title=\"\">Bring Your Own Barbie</a> involves the artist deconstructing a mannequin that looks a little like her. It is almost as if Runacre is erasing her body double \u2013 Antonioni would have appreciated its critique of identity. \u201cYou know what I learned from the film? We\u2019re all passengers really.\u201d</p> <p>Runacre, now 72 and elegantly clad in skinny jeans and a boucle jacket, tells me her next role will be in Alexandre Dumas\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tickx.co.uk/event/1602244/the-lady-of-the-camellias/\" title=\"\">The Lady of the Camellias</a> at Waterloo East theatre in London in March.</p> <p>Does she wish she had become a Hollywood star? \u201cWell, I certainly didn\u2019t, did I? None of my films has gone on general release. Every one of them went straight to art houses. Not that I mind. I was in fringe theatre and then I had kids and then I got into making art. I\u2019ve loved that life, and I still do.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Passenger is re-released on 4 January.</em></p>",

You\u2019d work not knowing what you were doing. I thought, if he\u2019s unhappy with what I\u2019m doing he will tell me. On set, though, he wouldn\u2019t really talk to you directly, but would often send over another person who would say: \u2018The maestro would like you to do this or that.\u2019 How lovely to be called maestro!\u201d And what of Nicholson and Maria Schneider, credited only as the Girl, with whom Locke gallivants around Europe and Africa, all the while pursued by hitmen until the film\u2019s tragic denouement? \u201cIt was an unusually quiet performance that Antonioni got out of Jack \u2013 very different from those excitable performances he gave in Chinatown, One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest and The Shining.\u201d Nicholson was accompanied during the 10-week shoot through Algeria, Spain and London by his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston. \u201cHe was notoriously promiscuous and, despite Anjelica being there, flirted with the girls on the set and they with him.\u201d Including her? \u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t interested. Instead, I formed a bond with Maria and her girlfriend Joey, an American photographer she was devoted to, and who was treated for psychosis soon after filming finished on The Passenger. Maria hated Hollywood and had had terrible experiences.\u201d Schneider was just 19 when she appeared in Bertolucci\u2019s notorious Last Tango in Paris (1972). \u201cShe told me she didn\u2019t know in advance there were going to be nude scenes.\u201d In the film, Marlon Brando\u2019s character, Paul, rapes Schneider\u2019s character, Jeanne, using a stick of butter as lubricant. In a 2007 interview, Schneider said the scene wasn\u2019t in the original script, and that Brando and Bertolucci had told her about it just before they began filming. The director, who died earlier this year, later acknowledged that he had sprung the scene on Schneider at the last minute, because he wanted her onscreen humiliation and rage to be real. \u201cI wanted Maria to feel, not to act,\u201d he said. Runacre says: \u201cShe told me that she wasn\u2019t actually buggered but that she was utterly humiliated by the way Bertolucci treated her.\u201d After The Passenger was screened at Cannes in 1975, cast and director rose for the expected applause, only to be booed. \u201cThey were booing Maria for her scandalous performance in Last Tango. She got the blame, not Bertolucci.\u201d It was in a sense a second violation. The Passenger didn\u2019t win that year\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or and has gone into relative obscurity since. \u201cOne reason for that is that Jack bought the rights to the film and it was little shown.\u201d Why? \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t like his performance. He should have, though.\u201d Runacre got the role in The Passenger because Antonioni had admired her debut performance in John Cassavetes\u2019 1970 film Husbands. She was a drama student when she auditioned to play a young English woman with whom Cassavetes\u2019 character has a dalliance while on a trip to London with his pals, played by Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara, when the three of them are going through a collective midlife crisis after the death of a friend. \u201cI got the part, then forgot about it, graduated and went to Scarborough and played in rep \u2013 stuff like Agatha Christie and Pinocchio. While I was there, we were all drinking Guinness, so I put on a bit of weight. Then I got the call from Cassavetes saying I\u2019d got the role. I went back to London and Ben Gazzara said to me: \u2018You\u2019ve put on weight \u2013 better lose it.\u2019 People wouldn\u2019t speak that way now. But I slimmed down very quickly.\u201d She loved working on the film, particularly an early scene of mostly improvised flirtation with Cassavetes. \u201cIt was a great introduction to film for me because I had been learning the Stanislavski method and here I was learning something very different from Cassavetes.\u201d Husbands proved such a critical success that Cassavetes advised her to hurry to Hollywood. Why didn\u2019t you go? \u201cI didn\u2019t want Hollywood upending my life \u2013 or the humiliations that Maria was exposed to.\u201d Yet, while raising a family in London, Runacre worked with some of cinema\u2019s leading directors. She appeared in Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s The Canterbury Tales, Tony Richardson\u2019s Joseph Andrews, Ridley Scott\u2019s The Duellists, Nicolas Roeg\u2019s The Witches, John Huston\u2019s The MacKintosh Man and Derek Jarman\u2019s Jubilee. In the last of these she played both Elizabeth I and Bod, a member of a roaming, murderous gang of anarchists that also included Toyah Willcox and punk icon Jordan. Of those film-makers, who was the biggest monster? \u201cI\u2019ve got no complaints with any of them, apart from Derek. He once shouted at me that I was driving too fast when we drove to Cannes to show Jubilee in 1978. He was right \u2013 I did drive too fast, so the car broke down. When we arrived, everything was stolen from our hotel room. And the people at the festival hated our punk gear \u2013 they thought we were ugly.\u201d She continues: \u201cI loved working with Derek, because it was all DIY, making our costumes and sets. You\u2019d never get that in Hollywood.\u201d Although she has acted throughout her career, on stage, film and TV (she was, for instance, Brenda Champion in Charles Sturridge\u2019s 80s adaptation of Brideshead Revisited), Runacre reinvented herself as a visual artist in the 90s and later taught performance art in west London. Her installation At Least I\u2019ve Got My Visual Stimulus is a Beckett-like piece featuring Runacre as a woman on stage talking unstoppably (the stimulant is telly), and her performance piece Bring Your Own Barbie involves the artist deconstructing a mannequin that looks a little like her. It is almost as if Runacre is erasing her body double \u2013 Antonioni would have appreciated its critique of identity. \u201cYou know what I learned from the film? We\u2019re all passengers really.\u201d Runacre, now 72 and elegantly clad in skinny jeans and a boucle jacket, tells me her next role will be in Alexandre Dumas\u2019s The Lady of the Camellias at Waterloo East theatre in London in March. Does she wish she had become a Hollywood star? \u201cWell, I certainly didn\u2019t, did I? None of my films has gone on general release. Every one of them went straight to art houses. Not that I mind. I was in fringe theatre and then I had kids and then I got into making art. I\u2019ve loved that life, and I still do.\u201d \u2022 The Passenger is re-released on 4 January.",

The collective sigh at the start of If You Were Here Tonight is proof that, for his female fans, the man has very much still got it. He\u2019s an imposing 65-year-old who, having moved to Manchester in 2017, sporadically breaks into a mid-Atlantic accent; the singing voice is still resolutely American, and he hits the notes, initially rustily, dabbing his forehead as he goes. Apart from that, there\u2019s no deviation into the unknown, just faithful recreations of songs that made him a major player in Jam and Lewis\u2019s future-R&amp;B landscape. Well, maybe not completely faithful. Backed by seven musicians, including a singer who punishingly out-belts him on Saturday Love, he turns up the dial on Criticize, creating a massive, party-style ensemble number that makes the original prissy by contrast. O\u2019Neal could leave it to the band to do the heavy lifting, but he pulls his weight \u2013 in touch once more with the roistering spirit of 1987, perhaps. \u2022 At Jazz Caf\u00e9, London, 14 and 18 January.

It undergoes the same phases of illumination by the Sun as the side facing Earth.

The far side is pockmarked by more craters and appears almost devoid of the seas of solidified lava, known as maria, that form the shadowy shape of a face that we see from Earth.</p> \n<p>Scientists believe that as asteroids pummelled the lunar surface during the solar system\u2019s early history, giant lava flows on the moon\u2019s near side filled impact craters, obscuring them from view.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/moon-zip/giv-39026eP7VxjnTYyO/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/moon-zip/giv-39026eP7VxjnTYyO/\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>On the far side, fewer lava flows occurred, leaving intact a pristine record of ancient impacts.

Astronomers operating Earth-bound radio telescopes have to constantly grapple with electromagnetic interference from human activity: shortwave broadcasting, maritime communication, telephone and television signals. The far side of the moon is shielded from such signals, making it far easier to pick up faint fingerprints left by the Big Bang. These traces left across the cosmos could help tell us how the universe inflated at unimaginable speed in the first trillionth of a second after the Big Bang.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc838230-2b32-47d1-966c-490bdb9aa146\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2jtOYQ-Wm8M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Chang\u2019e 4 could also help pave the way for China\u2019s human spaceflight ambitions.

      "bodyText": "When we look up at the full moon, we only ever see one face: the \u201cman in the moon\u201d is always gazing back at us. Scientists believe that the far side, eternally hidden from view, may hold the key to fundamental mysteries about the moon\u2019s formation and its earliest history. China\u2019s Chang\u2019e 4 mission could reveal new clues to the cataclysmic collision that created the moon and uncover the origins of the water that is unexpectedly abundant in lunar soil. The moon\u2019s far side is sometimes known as the dark side, although it is not darker than the near side in any literal sense. It undergoes the same phases of illumination by the Sun as the side facing Earth. But because the moon spins on its axis at exactly the same rate as it orbits Earth, one side remains permanently out of view. It was only in 1959, when the first images of the far side were beamed back by the Soviet Union\u2019s Luna 3, that intriguing differences were revealed. The far side is pockmarked by more craters and appears almost devoid of the seas of solidified lava, known as maria, that form the shadowy shape of a face that we see from Earth. Scientists believe that as asteroids pummelled the lunar surface during the solar system\u2019s early history, giant lava flows on the moon\u2019s near side filled impact craters, obscuring them from view. On the far side, fewer lava flows occurred, leaving intact a pristine record of ancient impacts. The oldest, largest and deepest of these is the Aitken Basin, where Chang\u2019e 4 is now poised for exploration. Testing the composition of the soil could help narrow down theories about how the moon formed and the beginnings of the solar system. The mission will also conduct the first astronomy observations from the moon\u2019s far side, which is seen as a uniquely attractive site for monitoring radio waves coming from deep space. Astronomers operating Earth-bound radio telescopes have to constantly grapple with electromagnetic interference from human activity: shortwave broadcasting, maritime communication, telephone and television signals. The far side of the moon is shielded from such signals, making it far easier to pick up faint fingerprints left by the Big Bang. These traces left across the cosmos could help tell us how the universe inflated at unimaginable speed in the first trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. Chang\u2019e 4 could also help pave the way for China\u2019s human spaceflight ambitions. One theory for the abundance of water in lunar soil is that it is produced by reactions between the solar wind (a flow of charged particles including hydrogen) and minerals in the soil (containing oxygen). \u201cPeople are trying to reproduce this process in the lab, but it\u2019s really difficult to do correctly,\u201d said Martin Wieser, a researcher at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and the principal investigator on an instrument onboard Chang\u2019e designed to measure how the solar wind interacts with the lunar surface. \u201cThe only way, really, is to go to the lunar surface and look at it there.

      "bodyText": "First, it emerged that the \u201cstartup\u201d company hired to operate extra ferries as part of no-deal Brexit planning had no ships. Now, new questions are being asked about the readiness of Seaborne Freight to handle the \u00a313.8m contract after it turned out that terms and conditions on its website appeared to be intended for a food delivery firm. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the customer to thoroughly check the supplied goods before agreeing to pay for any meal/order,\u201d read part of the text on the company\u2019s website. Questions were also being raised about other parts of the terms and conditions, including a passage which stated: \u201cDelivery charges are calculated per order and based on [delivery details here].\u201d Another section, which appeared to be constructed with a view more to mitigating the impact of prank pizza orders than transporting goods across some of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, warned: \u201cUsers are prohibited from making false orders through our website.\u201d It added: \u201cSeaborne Freight (UK) Limited reserves the right to seek compensation through legal action for any losses incurred as the result of hoax delivery requests and will prosecute to the full extent of the law.\u201d Chris Grayling\u2019s Department for Transport said a section of the terms and conditions on the company\u2019s website had been put up in error and was being immediately rectified. Ridicule was also heaped on Seaborne\u2019s \u201cprivacy terms\u201d, which stated: \u201cMembers hold freedom to express themselves in their feedback. Although your intellectual freedom is respected, [Business name] reserves the right to remove from our website any material deemed threatening, immoral, racist, inaccurate, malicious, defamatory, in bad taste or illegal.\u201d Among those criticising the company after the curious language on the terms and conditions was first pointed out by Twitter users was Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who said: \u201cSeaborne Freight. No ships, no trading history and website T&amp;Cs copied and pasted from a takeaway delivery site.\u201d Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cAwarding a contract to a ferry company with no ships is yet another disgraceful misuse of public money by the transport secretary. \u201cThe idea that Chris Grayling is backing a new business and has looked at this \u2018very carefully\u2019 is utterly risible. It\u2019s yet another example of his incompetence and mismanagement of the UK\u2019s transport system.\u201d Another Labour MP, Tonia Antoniazzi, said: \u201cThis is beyond a joke. It\u2019s not just that the government have panic-hired a firm with no ships to conduct ferry services. That firm has literally nothing prepared to suggest the \u00a313.8m handed over to them is a sound investment. They\u2019ve seemingly copied and pasted their terms off a takeaway fast food website, and their login portal sends you back to Google.\u201d Other signs that the website may have been cobbled together included a \u201cportal login\u201d section that was an image of username and password boxes rather than an actual means of logging in. A language settings option also appeared to be an image of a union flag rather than an interactive option. Grayling, the transport secretary, was forced to defend the contract on Wednesday when he said he would \u201cmake no apologies for supporting a new British business\u201d after widespread criticism. The contract is one of three agreements worth a total of \u00a3107.7m signed by the government to help ease congestion at Dover by securing extra lorry capacity in the event of a no-deal Brexit. There was also pressure on the government to guarantee that the new ferry services aimed at easing pressure on Dover would be crewed by British seafarers. Mick Cash, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union, wrote to Grayling to seek assurances that any ships would be fully crewed by UK workers and to stress that collective bargaining agreements should be in place. Sandra Welch, the deputy chief executive of the Sailors\u2019 Society charity, expressed concerns about safety. \u201cSafety is paramount,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to avoid tragedy it is crucial that the right people with the necessary skills are involved.\u201d Seaborne hopes to operate freight ferries from Ramsgate from late March, beginning with two ships and increasing to four by the end of the summer. A spokesperson at Grayling\u2019s department said on Thursday: \u201cBefore any contract was signed, due diligence on Seaborne Freight was carried out both by senior officials at the Department for Transport, and highly reputable independent third-party organisations with significant experience and expertise into Seaborne\u2019s financial, technical and legal underpinning.\u201d",

In 1976, 10-year-old soon-to-be vocalist Douglas McCarthy met drummer David Gooday while looking for a Chelmsford hill down which to ride his new skateboard. \u201cHe put me in a headlock, gave me the knuckles and tortured me for hours,\u201d McCarthy recalls, creasing up with laughter. \u201cHe was fond of french fancies, so he\u2019d torture me, wave one in front of me and then eat the whole thing.\u201d</p> <p>Gooday had already anointed his friendship with synth player Bon Harris by whacking him on the head with a spirit level during a game of hide-and-seek. After becoming firm friends, the trio would get drunk and head to Chelmsford\u2019s Parrot Records, where they met Simon Granger, who wound up designing their record sleeves and has joined the band for their current reunion. \u201cThese three would stagger past and shout abuse at me, and I\u2019d shout back,\u201d Granger says. \u201cIt\u2019s all done deliberately, affectionately, but people outside would have seen it as aggressive.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a statement that says a lot about Nitzer Ebb. Founded in 1982, they were the tough cousins to label-mates and touring partners Depeche Mode, all pulsing rhythms, rubbery synths and McCarthy\u2019s performance style, which he succinctly describes as \u201cshouting and pointing\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibHbhH-Csyc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ibHbhH-Csyc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Nitzer Ebb, Frankfurt, 1989.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Gathered in the living room of Gooday\u2019s synth-packed Chelmsford flat, Nitzer Ebb knock back beer and red wine as they reflect on their past and present. Gooday and Granger have stayed in their home town, and, though Harris and McCarthy now live in Los Angeles, it is clear that their relationship has barely changed \u2013 their chat is fast-paced, expletive-laden, rude and tender.

      "bodyText": "Nitzer Ebb were born in violence. In 1976, 10-year-old soon-to-be vocalist Douglas McCarthy met drummer David Gooday while looking for a Chelmsford hill down which to ride his new skateboard. \u201cHe put me in a headlock, gave me the knuckles and tortured me for hours,\u201d McCarthy recalls, creasing up with laughter. \u201cHe was fond of french fancies, so he\u2019d torture me, wave one in front of me and then eat the whole thing.\u201d Gooday had already anointed his friendship with synth player Bon Harris by whacking him on the head with a spirit level during a game of hide-and-seek. After becoming firm friends, the trio would get drunk and head to Chelmsford\u2019s Parrot Records, where they met Simon Granger, who wound up designing their record sleeves and has joined the band for their current reunion. \u201cThese three would stagger past and shout abuse at me, and I\u2019d shout back,\u201d Granger says. \u201cIt\u2019s all done deliberately, affectionately, but people outside would have seen it as aggressive.\u201d It\u2019s a statement that says a lot about Nitzer Ebb. Founded in 1982, they were the tough cousins to label-mates and touring partners Depeche Mode, all pulsing rhythms, rubbery synths and McCarthy\u2019s performance style, which he succinctly describes as \u201cshouting and pointing\u201d. Gathered in the living room of Gooday\u2019s synth-packed Chelmsford flat, Nitzer Ebb knock back beer and red wine as they reflect on their past and present. Gooday and Granger have stayed in their home town, and, though Harris and McCarthy now live in Los Angeles, it is clear that their relationship has barely changed \u2013 their chat is fast-paced, expletive-laden, rude and tender. They represent a tradition that extends back into the Victorian music hall of tough, working-class art and entertainment that self-deprecates while taking itself very seriously indeed. It is a mixture of camp and machismo that should never be approached at face value, and is quite unlike anything else around today. \u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of herberts,\u201d says Gooday the torturer. \u201cIt\u2019s a real Essex word, herbert.\u201d The four herberts of Nitzer Ebb have reunited on the back of a resurgence in influence.

      "body": "<p>My break from work came to an end this morning, as I was reminded of a fact: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/02/average-10-year-old-18-years-worth-of-sugar-public-health-england\" title=\"\">children are eating too much sugar</a>. The new and welcoming part of the story was that the government is launching a campaign in England to help parents choose lower-sugar options for their children.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/21/chief-medic-calls-for-food-taxes-to-cut-salt-and-sugar-intake\">Chief medic calls for food taxes to cut salt and sugar intake</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wearing my nutritionist\u2019s hat, blaming sugar alone is not the answer to childhood obesity. Still, every action in the fight against obesity does help. Keeping the sugar debate alive opens opportunities for much-needed action in areas that have received little attention. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/22/mexico-sugar-tax-lower-consumption-second-year-running\" title=\"\">levy on sugar in Mexico</a> and recently in the UK <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/108/3/435/5095508\" title=\"\">revealed the results that are possible</a> when there is engagement from governments and the food industry. In the UK, we are just at the beginning of a wider programme that will succeed only if important players such as the infant food industry become actively engaged.</p> <p>My interest in this began in 2009 when I became a mother and had the responsibility of choosing what to feed my twins. Being a nutritionist gave me a lot of advantages in navigating the baby feeding journey but also made me wonder what choices other parents have. What does the market offer when parents decide not to, or cannot, prepare baby food from scratch? I was so concerned that I decided to refocus my academic research on infant feeding.</p> <p>It became apparent that there was little information on the ingredients used in the formulation of commercial baby foods in the British market. My studies led me to report that the baby-food market was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/30/baby-foods-found-too-sweet-to-encourage-variety-of-tastes-in-children\" title=\"\">promoting the development of sweet preferences</a> with the widespread use of sweeter vegetables and fruit, such as carrots and apples, rather than more bitter-tasting green vegetables. I also found that many baby-food companies were adding concentrated fruit juice or pureed fruit to make foods taste sweeter and that on average, dry sweet snacks had 26g of sugar per 100g. The food industry argues that it is using fruit and vegetables, which is true, but the problem is that the moment these fruits and vegetables are mashed and highly processed, the carbohydrates in the cell walls become free sugars.</p> <p>So I was seriously concerned to hear Tim Rycroft, of the Food and Drink Federation, defend adding sugar to infant food for reasons of \u201cpalatability\u201d on the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday. Making foods sweeter is a good way to ensure that children will choose them over other foods that are less immediately palatable. This, unfortunately, is what happens if babies are not offered less sweet foods. If the baby-food market offers highly processed fruits and other foods of a sweet nature, babies will have less opportunities to become familiar with a wider selection of foods in the future.</p> <p>But should we just blame the food industry for this? Is voluntary action enough or should we have stricter regulations to ensure that the baby-food market follows suit with the rest of the industry on sugar reduction goals? Reducing the sugar content in processed baby foods can help achieve the current advice of reducing the contribution from free sugars in total daily energy intake <a href=\"https://www.who.int/elena/titles/guidance_summaries/sugars_intake/en/\" title=\"\">to 5%</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, commercial baby foods are bought <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/725530/SACN_report_on_Feeding_in_the_First_Year_of_Life.pdf\" title=\"\">by at least one-third of parents</a>. Alison Tedstone said on Today in the same interview that Public Health England, where she is chief nutritionist, that she was seeking to engage more players in the sugar reduction programme and that other measurements will follow in 2020. I will be eagerly following this progress, in particular the engagement of the food industry.</p> <p>Most importantly, we need changes to legislation to make it mandatory for the industry to align to a reformulation programme rather than relying on it to volunteer for one. Additionally, the government should listen to expert groups that recommend increasing the age at which solid food is introduced from four months to six months. Limiting children\u2019s exposure to processed foods from an early age is something we all owe to children.

      "bodyText": "My break from work came to an end this morning, as I was reminded of a fact: children are eating too much sugar. The new and welcoming part of the story was that the government is launching a campaign in England to help parents choose lower-sugar options for their children. Wearing my nutritionist\u2019s hat, blaming sugar alone is not the answer to childhood obesity. Still, every action in the fight against obesity does help. Keeping the sugar debate alive opens opportunities for much-needed action in areas that have received little attention. The levy on sugar in Mexico and recently in the UK revealed the results that are possible when there is engagement from governments and the food industry. In the UK, we are just at the beginning of a wider programme that will succeed only if important players such as the infant food industry become actively engaged. My interest in this began in 2009 when I became a mother and had the responsibility of choosing what to feed my twins. Being a nutritionist gave me a lot of advantages in navigating the baby feeding journey but also made me wonder what choices other parents have. What does the market offer when parents decide not to, or cannot, prepare baby food from scratch? I was so concerned that I decided to refocus my academic research on infant feeding. It became apparent that there was little information on the ingredients used in the formulation of commercial baby foods in the British market. My studies led me to report that the baby-food market was promoting the development of sweet preferences with the widespread use of sweeter vegetables and fruit, such as carrots and apples, rather than more bitter-tasting green vegetables. I also found that many baby-food companies were adding concentrated fruit juice or pureed fruit to make foods taste sweeter and that on average, dry sweet snacks had 26g of sugar per 100g. The food industry argues that it is using fruit and vegetables, which is true, but the problem is that the moment these fruits and vegetables are mashed and highly processed, the carbohydrates in the cell walls become free sugars. So I was seriously concerned to hear Tim Rycroft, of the Food and Drink Federation, defend adding sugar to infant food for reasons of \u201cpalatability\u201d on the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday. Making foods sweeter is a good way to ensure that children will choose them over other foods that are less immediately palatable. This, unfortunately, is what happens if babies are not offered less sweet foods. If the baby-food market offers highly processed fruits and other foods of a sweet nature, babies will have less opportunities to become familiar with a wider selection of foods in the future. But should we just blame the food industry for this? Is voluntary action enough or should we have stricter regulations to ensure that the baby-food market follows suit with the rest of the industry on sugar reduction goals? Reducing the sugar content in processed baby foods can help achieve the current advice of reducing the contribution from free sugars in total daily energy intake to 5%. In the UK, commercial baby foods are bought by at least one-third of parents. Alison Tedstone said on Today in the same interview that Public Health England, where she is chief nutritionist, that she was seeking to engage more players in the sugar reduction programme and that other measurements will follow in 2020. I will be eagerly following this progress, in particular the engagement of the food industry. Most importantly, we need changes to legislation to make it mandatory for the industry to align to a reformulation programme rather than relying on it to volunteer for one. Additionally, the government should listen to expert groups that recommend increasing the age at which solid food is introduced from four months to six months. Limiting children\u2019s exposure to processed foods from an early age is something we all owe to children. Parents need a more supportive environment to give children a good start in life: less sugar, broader palates and healthier diets. \u2022 The headline on this article was changed on 4 January 2018. A previous headline had implied that babies did not naturally like sweet food which is not the case \u2022 Dr Ada Garcia is a public health nutritionist at the University of Glasgow",

I thought I just sucked at languages at school, but I now see that the classroom wasn\u2019t a suitable arena for me to learn languages. If you can afford a face-to-face tutor, great, but Skype classes work just as well and are a lot cheaper. You can learn at your own pace and ask as many questions as you like. Phoebe Atija, 22 The more exposure you have to the language by listening to it being spoken, the more it will embed itself in your brain. You can do this at any time, just by having the language around you. The listening source doesn\u2019t always have to be at your level: you can listen to authentic material such as songs or watch films in your chosen language, but turn off subtitles in English. Carole Trosch, 61 Find a way not to be ashamed of your mistakes. Try, try, try and try again. Do not be shy, do not avoid opportunities to speak in the language you are learning. People will laugh at you (not always unkindly), they may correct you, they may not understand you. None of this is important. What is important is that you face your shame and shake it off. Anonymous, 46 Cooking and eating Don\u2019t remove snacks from your diet when trying to eat more healthily: going cold turkey seems to lead to bingeing later on. Graze on healthy alternatives throughout the day; I roast chickpeas, which are delicious. Sophie, 28 Next time you use an Oxo cube DO NOT TEAR THE FOIL OFF! Instead, carefully fold back the four corner flaps and then gently crush the stock cube within.

But if you have more children, one can look after the animals, another can look after the machines, and another can tend to the plants.\u201d The Egyptian government\u2019s best efforts may also fail to reach more conservative doctors in rural areas, who are more likely to convey the message to patients that every child is a blessing, or to limit information about contraception. \u201cThe fact is that in every country, the government can\u2019t cover the entire spectrum,\u201d says Dr Natalia Kanem, head of the UN Population Fund, which has partnered with Egyptian ministries for the \u201ctwo is enough\u201d campaign. \u201cPrivate providers can misinform, or even perform so-called medical female genital mutilation. Our job is to flood real information here to counter the myths.\u201d A mushrooming and overwhelmingly young population disadvantages young women according to Kanem, who cites the fact that 62% of the Egyptian population is aged 29 or younger. \u201cIf you have a young population, those young people tend to have children young as their mothers were young, so you see an acceleration,\u201d she says. \u201cUnless women are able to make a conscious decision to have a child later, to marry later. \u201cWhen girls are left behind, half the population is left behind.\u201d",

She and her three-year-old daughter, Gabriella, were about to return to the UK from Iran after a family visit when she was arrested. Since then, she has spent most of her time in Evin prison in Tehran, separated from her daughter.</p>\n    <p>In January 2019 she went on hunger strike for three days in protest against being denied medical care in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison. In March, the UK Foreign Office granted her diplomatic protection, a step that raised her case from a consular matter to the level of a dispute between the two states.</p>\n    <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe worked for BBC Media Action between February 2009 and October 2010 before moving to Thomson Reuters Foundation, the news agency\u2019s charitable arm, as a project manager.

      "bodyText": "As Apple\u2019s shares tumble after its cut in forecasts, the company is laying the blame squarely on the economic slowdown in China. But that is only part of the problem. Never before has Apple faced such fierce competition from a multitude of rivals from around the globe, all vying for a slice of the lucrative premium smartphone market. Matching or exceeding Apple\u2019s iPhone on hardware quality, these phones are arguably more capable, often cheaper and, perhaps crucially for China, made by local firms, not only those from the US and South Korea. The iPhone X broke the mould in 2017 but 2018\u2019s iPhone XS and XS Max, while very good phones, were only iterative improvements even though Apple pushed the top asking prices to an extraordinary \u00a31,449 in the UK, $1,449 (\u00a31,152) in the US and 12,799 yuan (\u00a31,480) in China. The firm also launched a lower cost iPhone XR, which had the same processor and overall design of the iPhone XS, but dropped the quality of the screen, the materials used in its body and the dual camera system on the back for \u00a3749 in the UK, $749 in the US and 6,499 yuan in China. The iPhone\u2019s biggest \u2013 and sometimes better \u2013 rivals are: Huawei Mate 20 Pro The top of the pile for 2018 comes not from Samsung or Apple but China\u2019s Huawei, which overtook the iPhone maker to become the second largest smartphone manufacturer by volume in the world. The Mate 20 Pro is something rather special, combining more cutting-edge technology than any other into a well-rounded, long-lasting, beautiful device. It has a huge curved 6.39in OLED display, IR-based face recognition matching that available on the iPhone, a fingerprint scanner embedded under the display, and a fantastic triple-camera system on the back and battery life near double the competition. It can even wirelessly charge another device, a trick never before seen on any smartphone. While certainly not cheap, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro also undercut both Apple\u2019s top models \u2013 costing \u00a3900 in the UK and 6,799 yuan in China. The Mate 20 Pro is not available in the US. Huawei Mate 20 Pro review: cutting-edge brilliance 5/5 Samsung Galaxy Note 9 The perennial thorn in Apple\u2019s side in its battle for domination of the market since 2010, Samsung\u2019s latest is a different beast. The Galaxy Note 9 has the pre-requisite massive 6.4in OLED display, top of the line processor, wireless charging and a dual camera on the back. But it also has a powerful stylus that slots into the bottom of the phone and sets it apart from anything else, making it a real productivity powerhouse. You can draw, annotate, sign and handwrite on the large screen, and even use the stylus\u2019s button as a remote control for things such as the camera, for the perfect hands-free selfie. The Note 9 is the do-anything phone and it costs \u00a3899 or less in the UK, $999 in the US and 6,999 yuan in China. Samsung Galaxy Note 9 review: the do-everything phone 4/5 Google Pixel 3 The third iteration of the Android maker\u2019s own-brand smartphone, the Pixel 3 and 3 XL offer Google\u2019s vision of what the software on a phone should be. In the same way Apple makes both the hardware and software, the Pixel 3 benefits from Google\u2019s synergy to create an Android experience that is second to none. It may not have all the whizz-bang features of rivals, and may have a fairly dated screen design, but its AI smarts and gamechanging camera software offer something different. The smaller Pixel 3 costs \u00a3739 in the UK, $799 in the US and is available in China from around 7,400 yuan. Google Pixel 3 review: raising the bar for the Android experience 5/5 OnePlus 6T High-cost rivals to Apple\u2019s iPhone are one thing but there are also phones such as the brilliant OnePlus 6T that offer cutting-edge technology and great software at literally half the cost. The OnePlus 6T is a very fast, high-performing phone with top-of-the-line processor, a massive, beautiful 6.41in OLED display and excellent battery life. But it also has a tiny teardrop-shaped notch that makes the giant bar-shaped notch of the iPhone XS and Mate 20 Pro look stupid and an impressive in-display fingerprint scanner. The dual camera on the back is not quite as good and there is no wireless charging but the OnePlus 6T costs only \u00a3500 in the UK, $549 in the US and 3,499 yuan in China. OnePlus 6T review: you\u2019d have to spend double to get better than this 5/5 Chinese rivals Of course, in China the competition from local rivals is even more fierce. Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, Lenovo, Huawei\u2019s Honor sub-brand and Meizu are just a few of the top manufacturers. And many of the most ground-breaking smartphones are only launched in China, such as Honor\u2019s Magic 2, which is all screen on the front with a back half that slides up to reveal a camera. Xiaomi\u2019s Mi Mix 3 does a similar thing with the back sliding up to reveal front-facing cameras, while the top of Oppo\u2019s Find X pops up to reveal both front and rear cameras on command. Where hardware innovation was dominated by the US and South Korea, China\u2019s many smartphone firms are looking to lead the pack.",

Orphaned during the brutal partition of India by the departing British, he had been working since the age of 12 for an American company in the port city of Chittagong. He made tea, unloaded containers, repaired cars and swept floors. And he eventually concluded that the only way to ensure a better life for himself was to scrape together the fare for a one-way ride to the Tilbury Docks. As a citizen of the Commonwealth, he enjoyed this right to move to the United Kingdom, as did all those now fondly referred to as the \u201cWindrush generation\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/07/give-to-our-charity-appeal-and-help-stop-injustices-like-windrush\">Give to our charity appeal and help stop injustices like Windrush</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Now 84, Tasfin lives in Tooting, south London, with the eldest of his three sons, surrounded by grandchildren, the youngest of whom will be sitting her GCSEs in a few months\u2019 time.

In this case it was a visit to an outpatient NHS service in late 2017, where he was asked to prove his immigration status. Having never had the means to travel, Tasfin had never possessed a passport. \u201cMy wife was better with paperwork but she had already quit and gone upstairs.\u201d So this elderly man was swallowed whole by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/theresa-mays-hostile-environment-policy-at-heart-of-windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">hostile environment</a>.</p> \n<p>With no access to healthcare, Tasfin had no way of knowing that the pain in his legs was because of easily treatable blood clots, and he slowly stopped trying to walk at all.

But \u201cI didn\u2019t come from the Caribbean so I didn\u2019t think it was the same thing\u201d, says Tasfin. It was months before a lawyer attending his mosque heard about Tasfin\u2019s problems and helped him call the Windrush Taskforce. \u201c<em>Alhamdulillah</em> [praise be to God] he said something or I might not be here.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"03b27942-db26-4144-ac13-cf620819655e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gmG58Cwfvas?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In just a few words, Tasfin sums up the arbitrary cruelty of the government\u2019s hostile environment policy and the dangers of thinking its impacts have been confined to the Windrush generation or to the Caribbean community. We all now live under a system of Orwellian immigration laws that find people of colour guilty until they can prove their innocence. It denies them healthcare, housing and the right to work unless they can produce the right documentation; and if they cannot, it ties them up in bureaucracy and threatens them with removal. It forces police officers to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44074572\" title=\"\">report victims of sexual violence</a> to the Home Office if they cannot demonstrate their right to remain.</p> \n<p>In the absence of adequate legal aid, the fate of people like Tasfin is left entirely to chance \u2013 their very survival depending on the goodwill of a lawyer who happened to overhear a worrying story, or on the capacity of a local charity to run a legal advice surgery in the right place at the right time. And after another year in which advice organisations have been stretched by growing need and shrinking resources, it is hard not to be worried about the number of people out there who are still struggling on their own. People who may be sitting next to us on the bus or living next door. Neighbours and friends quietly struggling with the daily humiliation of having to beg for their most basic rights.</p> \n<p>After Brexit, these rules will apply equally to European nationals here in the UK. The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-immigration-white-paper-still-a-hostile-environment\" title=\"\">immigration white paper</a> confirms that there will be no significant effort to make the system fairer, more transparent or less dangerous. And analysis of the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/concerns-raised-over-59-page-handbook-on-brexit-settled-status-scheme\" title=\"\">\u201csettled status\u201d scheme</a> suggests that hundreds of thousands will be <a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/reports/unsettled-status-which-eu-citizens-are-at-risk-of-failing-to-secure-their-rights-after-brexit/\" title=\"\">left without documentation</a>, just as the Windrush generation were when the right to free movement from the Commonwealth came to an end. The pressure on community and legal advice organisations will likely be unprecedented; and unless we can dismantle the hostile environment, we will see a crisis that will likely dwarf even Windrush in its scale.</p> \n<p>Before Tasfin steps off the bus, he shows me the letter from the Home Office confirming his status in the UK. \u201cThis. Everything, all this suffering, just for this.\u201d Half a century in this country and it\u2019s a few words on official letterhead that determine whether a grandfather can live or die with dignity. I am filled with respect and love for this man I barely know, but it\u2019s overshadowed by a sense of guilt and urgency. This year our organisation helped thousands of people just like Tasfin, but in the space of a short bus ride, I\u2019m reminded of the thousands more out there who we couldn\u2019t reach.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Satbir Singh is chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, a beneficiary of the <a href=\"https://guardian.ctdonate.org/?utm_source=ogscl&amp;utm_medium=sfbk&amp;utm_campaign=ca18_fb1&amp;CMP_TU=mawns&amp;CMP_BUNIT=edtrl\" title=\"\">2018 Guardian and Observer appeal</a></p>",

In the absence of adequate legal aid, the fate of people like Tasfin is left entirely to chance \u2013 their very survival depending on the goodwill of a lawyer who happened to overhear a worrying story, or on the capacity of a local charity to run a legal advice surgery in the right place at the right time. And after another year in which advice organisations have been stretched by growing need and shrinking resources, it is hard not to be worried about the number of people out there who are still struggling on their own. People who may be sitting next to us on the bus or living next door. Neighbours and friends quietly struggling with the daily humiliation of having to beg for their most basic rights. After Brexit, these rules will apply equally to European nationals here in the UK. The recent immigration white paper confirms that there will be no significant effort to make the system fairer, more transparent or less dangerous. And analysis of the government\u2019s \u201csettled status\u201d scheme suggests that hundreds of thousands will be left without documentation, just as the Windrush generation were when the right to free movement from the Commonwealth came to an end. The pressure on community and legal advice organisations will likely be unprecedented; and unless we can dismantle the hostile environment, we will see a crisis that will likely dwarf even Windrush in its scale. Before Tasfin steps off the bus, he shows me the letter from the Home Office confirming his status in the UK. \u201cThis. Everything, all this suffering, just for this.\u201d Half a century in this country and it\u2019s a few words on official letterhead that determine whether a grandfather can live or die with dignity. I am filled with respect and love for this man I barely know, but it\u2019s overshadowed by a sense of guilt and urgency. This year our organisation helped thousands of people just like Tasfin, but in the space of a short bus ride, I\u2019m reminded of the thousands more out there who we couldn\u2019t reach. \u2022 Satbir Singh is chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, a beneficiary of the 2018 Guardian and Observer appeal",

Regulating housing should be 50 times more important that regulating banks.\u201d The public inquiry into the disaster will rarely sit this year, causing concern that momentum for reform could wane. Lawyers for the building companies and the council landlords involved in the refurbishment of the tower are being given time to trawl through more than 200,000 documents being disclosed before the second stage of the inquiry, which will scrutinise the management of the tower, communications with residents, its refurbishment and fire safety. The inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said in December that the hearings were unlikely to start before the end of 2019. The campaign for new regulation is a further sign that the bereaved, survivors and residents are opening a new chapter in their activism nearly 19 months after the fire in June 2017, which claimed 72 lives. \u201cWhat\u2019s key isn\u2019t that Grenfell is remembered for what happened before the fire, but for the change we achieved after the fire,\u201d said Daffarn. \u201cWe are looking to change the culture around social housing and the institutional indifference it entails. Grenfell United has come to believe that can be achieved through a two-pronged attack \u2013 tenants\u2019 voice and regulation.\u201d He said: \u201cGrenfell wouldn\u2019t have happened if we had been heard and respected \u2026 People are still not being listened to.\u201d Brokenshire said he was \u201cstruck by the need for clear and effective redress in the area of social housing and ensuring tenants are able to hold their landlords to account\u201d. \u201cThat message of tenant voices is very, very relevant in ensuring proper standards are maintained and that where things are going wrong they are picked up and addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a theme I am very conscious of when we look to the future of regulation around social housing.\u201d The government is expected to publish a white paper on social housing this year, which is expected to contain proposals for a new system of regulation.",

The suit also cites the use of Nirvana references in Marc Jacobs marketing materials, including a meme posted to the brand\u2019s Tumblr account featuring a clip of the group\u2019s 1991 hit, Smells Like Teen Spirit, and an image of Jacobs wearing a T-shirt above the words Come As You Are, the title of a 1992 hit by the trio. The suit describes Marc Jacobs\u2019 actions as \u201coppressive, fraudulent and malicious\u201d and claims that they \u201chave caused Nirvana to suffer irreparable injuries\u201d and \u201cthreaten to dilute the value of Nirvana\u2019s licenses with its licensees for clothing products\u201d. The department stores Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are also included in the suit for selling the items that allegedly infringe the band\u2019s copyright. The group is seeking monetary damages, the removal of sale of any such items and the removal of Nirvana references from promotional materials. Nirvana\u2019s iconography is subject to regular bootlegging: the hoodies found on market stalls worldwide are seldom licensed items. The group would be unlikely to pursue these vendors because of the low possibility of recovering significant damages, says Alexander Ross, a partner at music lawyers Wiggin LLP. \u201cSuing a major brand for alleged infringement, however, makes more sense from a financial perspective, and for PR and scale purposes, assuming of course that the action is successful,\u201d says Ross. \u201cIt also sends a message to other players in the fashion industry that the IP in question is jealously guarded against infringement.\u201d In 1992, at the height of Nirvana\u2019s fame, Marc Jacobs was fired from designer Perry Ellis after showing his infamous grunge collection, which mixed plaid, silk and skull caps. \u201cGrunge is anathema to fashion,\u201d said American fashion critic Cathy Horyn. Jacobs started his own line a year later, launching his debut collection in 1994. The Nirvana suit is the latest controversy to hit the designer. \u201cThe label is turning out clothes and accessories that lack a compelling point of view, failing to generate the excitement created by younger peers Alexander Wang and Joseph Altuzarra,\u201d New York Times reporter Steven Kurutz wrote in June. Kurutz cited luxury goods research by Exane BNP Paribas that estimated the brand had been losing more than \u00a345m annually over the past few years. By contrast, the value of band merchandise continues to grow, becoming increasingly important to artists\u2019 revenue streams following the decline of physical media and the impact of streaming on the market. Partnerships between bands and fashion houses have proven lucrative, such as Canadian rapper Drake\u2019s collaboration with winter wear brand Canada Goose. Official artist merchandise can attain the status of high fashion, a charge led by the designs produced for Kanye West\u2019s tour in support of his 2013 album Yeezus. The market for vintage band T-shirts is also booming. In 2011, an anonymous Australian buyer spent $10,000 on a Led Zeppelin T-shirt from the group\u2019s 1979 gig at Knebworth.",

      "bodyText": "A Saudi prosecutor has asked for the death penalty for five of 11 suspects held over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi at the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul on 2 October, the state news agency SPA reported on Thursday. The call came during the first court hearing in the Khashoggi case, which has shredded the kingdom\u2019s international reputation and strained its relations with Turkey, the US and many other western governments. In a trial that is likely to have major international diplomatic consequences, the 11 defendants appeared in court on Thursday in a session closed to the public. In late October the Saudis said they had detained 18 suspects in relation to the murder, but the names have not been shared with Turkish authorities. The Saudi general prosecution said the interrogation of a number of the accused would continue, adding that two requests asking for further evidence had been sent to Turkey but had not received any response. The Saudi prosecution said that following the hearing in the case the defendants asked for a copy from the prosecutors and sought time to make their defence. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has asked for the accused to be extradited to Turkey to stand trial, a request that has been rejected. Erdo\u011fan has effectively accused the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, of ordering the killing of Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, and has run a persistent campaign revealing details of the Turkish police investigation into the murder that has kept Saudi Arabia on the diplomatic back foot. The CIA has also told US Congress that it believes the crown prince ordered the killing. The episode has already led to a Saudi cabinet reshuffle, involving the partial demotion of the foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, and a reordering of the Saudi intelligence service seen to be at the heart of Khashoggi murder. Jubeir was replaced by Ibrahim al-Assaf, an experienced figure who had previously served as finance minister. In response to Khashoggi\u2019s murder, Britain has asked that the Saudis reassure the world that such an event cannot be repeated, seen as a code that the crown prince will not be able to use the intelligence service as a personal tool to suppress dissent abroad. The trial will be notable for the degree to which the defendants are able to set out in open court whether they were instructed by the state to carry out the murder, or instead had been instructed to repatriate Khashoggi, but on meeting resistance from the journalist chose to kill him. Trials in Saudi Arabia are normally held behind closed doors so it is likely no claim that the hit team were acting on orders of the royal court will ever be aired. The human rights group Reprieve estimates there have been nearly 700 executions in Saudi Arabia since 2014. Saudi Arabia has provided sharply contrasting accounts of how Khashoggi came to die. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Turkish police released new footage purporting to show bags containing Khashoggi\u2019s body parts being carried into the home of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul. Turkish authorities have carried out numerous body searches in Turkey since the murder, but without success. The Turkish network A Haber broadcast video showing the entrance to the gated residence of Saudi Arabia\u2019s consul general in Istanbul, not far from the Saudi consulate. The footage shows men, their faces obscured by shadow, carrying several large suitcases or bags into the building. The Saudis have not allowed the garden\u2019s well to be fully searched, or dried. The footage purportedly hows Maj Gen Mahir Abdul Aziz Muhammad Mutrib, an associate of the crown prince, helping with the movement of the bags. The consul, Mohammed al-Otaibi, has returned to Riyadh, and has not been seen.

      "body": "<p>The five nominees for this year\u2019s rising star Bafta have been revealed, with Black Panther star Letitia Wright current favourite to attract the most public votes to crown her the winner at the ceremony on 10 February.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5ff1b97d-de48-4f14-8a84-9c89735f737d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>When are the Baftas? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This year's Baftas take place on 10 February 2019. The ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall will be hosted by Joanna Lumley and broadcast \u2013 about 90 minutes after it actually happens \u2013 on BBC ONE.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who votes for the Baftas?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Baftas are voted for by around 6,500 members of the British Film and Television Academy. These are industry workers who have to apply for membership \u2013 and pay an annual subscription of \u00a3450. Each category in the shortlists is decided by a chapter of around 100 specialists in that area. Once the shortlists are announced, all voters can have their say. If they haven't seen a particular film, they are supposed to abstain from voting in that category \u2013 but this is unenforced.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why do they matter? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Baftas matter on their own terms, third only to the Golden Globes and the Oscars as prestige gongs. A Bafta win adds critical kudos \u2013 and, hopefully, box office \u2013 to a film, as well as credibility to an individual's career. They also matter because of their proximity to the Oscars. Until 2001, the Baftas took place in April or May, but since the move to about a fortnight before the Academy Awards, their importance increased. This is because voting for the Oscars closes a few days after the Baftas, meaning it's the final chance for candidates to impress with their speeches - or for Oscar voters to seek to redress apparent miscarriages of justice. The Bafta and Oscar voting bases overlap considerably, too: around 500 people are thought to vote for both.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So do the big winners generally mirror each other?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not necessarily. A recent survey found the Baftas were only the fourth best Oscars bellwether \u2013 after the DGA, PGA and SAG awards. Since 2001, they've predicted the best picture winner eight times out of a possible 17, diverging the past four years running, opting for Three Billboards over The Shape of Water, La La Land over Moonlight, The Revenant&nbsp;over Spotlight and&nbsp;Boyhood&nbsp;over Birdman. Their form is stronger when it comes to the acting categories, though they do consistently favour homegrown talent.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do winners actually get? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A big bronze mask on a marble base, which Bafta reserves the right to buy back for \u00a31 should the recipient give it to anyone other than their children. Plus a certificate, with which the winner can do what they like.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Wright, 25, is a Guyanese-born British actor who cut her teeth on TV shows such as Top Boy and Banana.

The threat came because 61% of his spell was full. His last innings with a similar percentage was the opening day of the most recent Ashes in Brisbane, where the air was humid, the sky overcast, and the pitch so slow that short balls were sent home chipped and neutered.</p> \n<p>But in Sydney, after Agarwal looked uncomfortable against a couple of short balls, Starc and his captain Tim Paine decided to make a day of it. He sent down nine overs in the session, unbroken but for a change to the Randwick End. With a newish ball in the first session of a Test, this second spell was 81% short balls. Hazlewood joined in. Agarwal had some dicey moments but rode it out. At the other end, negotiating it serenely, was Pujara. When it was over India remained one wicket down.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure about that, I wasn\u2019t too happy with that to be honest,\u201d said an unusually frank Nathan Lyon of his bowling colleagues after play. \u201cWe missed out on using the moisture in the wicket. I thought we could have stuck there longer. But the captain and the bowlers came up with a decent plan and unfortunately it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> \n<p>It didn\u2019t work. That sums up Australia\u2019s series. Blasting opponents out worked in the Ashes a year ago. Not any more. The series plan would have been to keep Kohli quiet and let that take care of the rest: India\u2019s captain has made one hundred compared to four last time he toured, but the plan hasn\u2019t worked. About the only thing that has worked has been the bowlers: hard.</p> \n<p>The fifth bowler didn\u2019t help in that regard. Another plan that hasn\u2019t worked. Marnus Labuschagne came into this Test with a first-class bowling average of nearly 50 in his career and 60 this domestic season, but was billed by his coach and captain as a leg-spinning all-rounder. His first over was pulled for three boundaries. Paine immediately dragged him from the attack.</p> \n<p>The player pulling those half-trackers was Pujara, who cruised past his half-century and into the 60s. Only twice in his career has he scored more than a dozen runs from an over. Then he marched off for tea.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"660a8c7850c65d63eafda311864b1f56c9af5fea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/660a8c7850c65d63eafda311864b1f56c9af5fea/0_73_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pujara weaves away from a Josh Hazlewood delivery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pujara weaves away from a Josh Hazlewood delivery.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Rycroft/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By that stage Agarwal had holed out against Lyon for 77. Virat Kohli gloved Hazlewood down the leg side just after the break. But Pujara just kept doing what Pujara does. Indian fans call him The Wall in reference to Rahul Dravid.

It\u2019s just that getting set for him is a matter of two sessions. In the third he often came down the wicket to Lyon, tucking ones or whipping fours. His best from Starc was a cut shot from close to the body, on one foot at the point of contact, hands in tight and scything.</p> \n<p>The cut is the closest Pujara has to a flourish.

In terms of deliveries this series he\u2019s faced 246, 204, 103, 11, 319, 2, and now 250 and counting. He\u2019s entirely capable of batting through another day for an Indian declaration or as last man standing. What he looks like while doing it doesn\u2019t matter. Every shred of respect he receives this series has been earned.</p>",

It has taken more than half a century for US-Russia space cooperation to reach this point of relative equanimity, but the arrival of China as a serious player \u2013 graphically illustrated by its latest success \u2013 has the potential to disturb this. Will Russia, for instance, see China, with its recent successes and innovations, as a future partner in space or a deadly rival? The US \u2013 through its long-Sinophobic Congress \u2013 seems already to have made up its mind. Not only is it increasingly treating China as an economic and military competitor, but President Donald Trump recently ordered the creation of a new Space Command for the US armed services, suggesting the direction of his thinking here, too. So far, China\u2019s precise ambitions for its space programme remain unclear. Establishing itself as a space power is surely one \u2013 but is it as a space power, or the space power? The equipment it has now sent to the moon suggests that communications and new natural resources are priorities. How far will the US, in particular, be prepared to watch and wait while Beijing potentially races ahead in these sensitive areas? Stand by for the US and Russia to take a new interest in the moon. \u2022 Mary Dejevsky is a former foreign correspondent",

Could it be that, from the viewer\u2019s perspective, progress is being made across the board? That is, apart from the loss of replays of past Irish racing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jan/02/talking-horses-racing-in-need-of-leadership-as-irish-replays-disappear\">which I was ranting about on Wednesday</a>.</p> \n<p>The thing I like most, so far, is the fact that Sky Sports Racing have installed cameras that look directly across the finishing line at all the tracks they cover, having taken over from At The Races. They now show <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AtTheRaces/status/1080100258208776193\">slow-motion replays</a> of all the runners crossing the line just seconds after it has happened.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/02/balnaslow-could-be-stripped-2018-foxhunters-chase-victory-aintree\">Balnaslow may be stripped of 2018 Foxhunters\u2019 Chase victory</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Really, we ought to have got to this years ago but we didn\u2019t, so this counts as a big step forward.

It gave me a crick in the neck.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Racing TV had a predictably hectic time on New Year\u2019s Day, trying to cope with live racing from six tracks in one afternoon. It led to a lot of split-screen action and they weren\u2019t helped by delays at two of the tracks as the afternoon progressed.

Other big names across the weekend are R&amp;B singers Solange, Khalid, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, H.E.R and Ella Mai; rappers Juice WRLD, Bad Bunny, Kid Cudi and Anderson .Paak; EDM stars Zedd, Diplo, Dillon Francis and DJ Snake; and British talent including the 1975, Aphex Twin and Blood Orange.",

I understand the federation can\u2019t do much for women\u2019s department since they are scared for their lives but they can give us a little support until we can stand on our feet because we are willing to take the risk and we are ready to fight for what we want.\u201d</p> <p>A Fifa source told the Guardian that it had been made aware of the issues and would be making efforts to meet Mohamed to discuss the situation.</p> <p>\u201cA small amount of the SFFs Forward funds have been used in the 2016-18 cycle for women\u2019s football and women\u2019s refereeing in the region,\u201d Fifa said. \u201cBut we expect a greater commitment to be made in the new year with a dedicated Forward project for women\u2019s football. We also understand that the SFF will appoint a new team to advance women\u2019s football in Somalia. To that end the FIFA Regional Development Office in Addis Ababa will meet with the SFF soon to discuss the SFF\u2019s plans.\u201d</p> <p>It said its commitment globally to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 football was demonstrated by a 20% increase in its Forward development fund for 2019-2022 to $6m, which includes \u201ca total investment of at least $150,000 per year per member association dedicated exclusively to women\u2019s football development\u201d, in addition to funding available through infrastructure and travel budgets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb4a1985cfeb6aabeecf729f1965e199953ef333\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb4a1985cfeb6aabeecf729f1965e199953ef333/0_0_5000_3122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Club academy players. \u2018We use football to fight early marriage and to fight for women\u2019s rights in society,\u2019 said Shaima Mohamed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Golden Club academy players. \u2018We use football to fight early marriage and to fight for women\u2019s rights in society,\u2019 said Shaima Mohamed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohamed Abdiwahab/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mohamed\u2019s frustrations were encapsulated after Golden Club were invited to send a team to the Human Rights Cup in South Africa last month to represent Somalia. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t make it because we lacked financial support from both the federation, where the women\u2019s department is not active, and the government. We trained for months to prepare for the cup. We were so disappointed. Discrimination holds us back.\u201d</p> <p>Mohamed, who grew up in Kenya, has been battling to establish women\u2019s football in Somalia since she moved back in 2015, aged 19. \u201cThere were no women playing football so I decided to form a group I could play with,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became an organisation. I had to open up an academy so that more girls could be inspired and empowered.\u201d</p> <p>Initial approaches to the Somali FA for support had been promising. \u201cAt first the president of the federation welcomed me. He took me to the African football symposium on women\u2019s football in Morocco earlier in 2018. It was the first time a woman from Somalia had attended such a conference.\u201d</p> <p>On her return she says things changed: \u201cI was given the official title of head of the women\u2019s department. I asked for an office, equipment, a place to work, but the president told me to focus on the academy until people get used to what I am doing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/01/2019-world-cup-fever-england-scotland-womens\">2019, World Cup fever No 2: England and Scotland go for glory in France | Louise Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI approached him again and asked for a field to train the girls because there is a lack of fields or stadiums available to women. I asked him to give us time for training and he said the country is not safe enough and said we should rent another field and they will pay for it, except that didn\u2019t last. It felt like they didn\u2019t want to give us help.\u201d</p> <p>Golden Club continues to thrive despite the difficulties. \u201cThere are a lot of young girls that are so talented but it can be hard for them since they don\u2019t have the self-confidence to come out and play football because they feel scared of society. After I created the first women\u2019s football club in Somalia I learned that football can play an important role to help women and girls build their self-confidence.\u201d</p> <p>The civil war and the presence of groups such as al-Shabaab harmed men\u2019s football too. \u201cThe extremists didn\u2019t allow men to play football. Sometimes they used to play in a tribalism way \u2013 one tribe would play another. Now youth are engaged, there are leagues and they have even started to participate in international tournaments.\u201d</p> <p>What keeps Mohamed going is her passion for the game and determination to do something positive for girls who contact her. \u201cBut I can\u2019t even offer the financial support in my city, let alone go to another region. The change that needs to be made is we need fields that will be secure for the girls and we need awareness.</p> <p>\u201cWomen\u2019s football is more than just sport. We use football to fight early marriage and to fight for women\u2019s rights in society. This is important for so many girls and women in Somalia.

We need formal recognition for Somalia women\u2019s football.\u201d She called on Fifa to step in. \u201cThey should do more to ensure we are receiving our funding,\u201d she said. \u201cFifa needs to do more accountability with every federation in Africa to see if the women\u2019s funding is being spent on women\u2019s football or something else. \u201cFifa could also do more by improving direct communications with the women\u2019s football department. I understand the federation can\u2019t do much for women\u2019s department since they are scared for their lives but they can give us a little support until we can stand on our feet because we are willing to take the risk and we are ready to fight for what we want.\u201d A Fifa source told the Guardian that it had been made aware of the issues and would be making efforts to meet Mohamed to discuss the situation. \u201cA small amount of the SFFs Forward funds have been used in the 2016-18 cycle for women\u2019s football and women\u2019s refereeing in the region,\u201d Fifa said. \u201cBut we expect a greater commitment to be made in the new year with a dedicated Forward project for women\u2019s football. We also understand that the SFF will appoint a new team to advance women\u2019s football in Somalia. To that end the FIFA Regional Development Office in Addis Ababa will meet with the SFF soon to discuss the SFF\u2019s plans.\u201d It said its commitment globally to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 football was demonstrated by a 20% increase in its Forward development fund for 2019-2022 to $6m, which includes \u201ca total investment of at least $150,000 per year per member association dedicated exclusively to women\u2019s football development\u201d, in addition to funding available through infrastructure and travel budgets. Mohamed\u2019s frustrations were encapsulated after Golden Club were invited to send a team to the Human Rights Cup in South Africa last month to represent Somalia. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t make it because we lacked financial support from both the federation, where the women\u2019s department is not active, and the government. We trained for months to prepare for the cup. We were so disappointed. Discrimination holds us back.\u201d Mohamed, who grew up in Kenya, has been battling to establish women\u2019s football in Somalia since she moved back in 2015, aged 19. \u201cThere were no women playing football so I decided to form a group I could play with,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became an organisation. I had to open up an academy so that more girls could be inspired and empowered.\u201d Initial approaches to the Somali FA for support had been promising. \u201cAt first the president of the federation welcomed me. He took me to the African football symposium on women\u2019s football in Morocco earlier in 2018. It was the first time a woman from Somalia had attended such a conference.\u201d On her return she says things changed: \u201cI was given the official title of head of the women\u2019s department. I asked for an office, equipment, a place to work, but the president told me to focus on the academy until people get used to what I am doing. \u201cI approached him again and asked for a field to train the girls because there is a lack of fields or stadiums available to women. I asked him to give us time for training and he said the country is not safe enough and said we should rent another field and they will pay for it, except that didn\u2019t last. It felt like they didn\u2019t want to give us help.\u201d Golden Club continues to thrive despite the difficulties. \u201cThere are a lot of young girls that are so talented but it can be hard for them since they don\u2019t have the self-confidence to come out and play football because they feel scared of society. After I created the first women\u2019s football club in Somalia I learned that football can play an important role to help women and girls build their self-confidence.\u201d The civil war and the presence of groups such as al-Shabaab harmed men\u2019s football too. \u201cThe extremists didn\u2019t allow men to play football. Sometimes they used to play in a tribalism way \u2013 one tribe would play another. Now youth are engaged, there are leagues and they have even started to participate in international tournaments.\u201d What keeps Mohamed going is her passion for the game and determination to do something positive for girls who contact her. \u201cBut I can\u2019t even offer the financial support in my city, let alone go to another region. The change that needs to be made is we need fields that will be secure for the girls and we need awareness. \u201cWomen\u2019s football is more than just sport. We use football to fight early marriage and to fight for women\u2019s rights in society. This is important for so many girls and women in Somalia. I am fighting for their future and I will never give up.\u201d Talking points \u2022 Arsenal have signed Danish winger Katrina Veje from Montpellier. \u2022 Goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger has left Birmingham. Last year she battled back from thyroid cancer and was named in the WSL PFA team of the year. \u2022 Celtic have announced plans to establish their women\u2019s team as the first full-time professional set up in next season\u2019s Women\u2019s Scottish Premier League.",

      "body": "<p>After the Dutch parliamentary elections of March 2017, the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/19/dutch-election-rutte-wilders-good-populism-bad-\">Mark Rutte</a>, triumphantly declared that \u201cgood populism\u201d had defeated \u201cbad populism\u201d, a claim eagerly and uncritically repeated in media around the world. It confirmed received wisdom that the best way to defeat the populist radical right, is to co-opt a moderate version of their agenda, while excluding the party itself.</p> <p>Few cared that Rutte\u2019s claim rested on dubious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Dutch_general_election\">empirical grounds</a>: compared with the 2012 election, Rutte actually lost big (-5.2%), whereas Geert Wilder\u2019s Party for Freedom (PVV) made gains (+3.0%) and was joined by a new far-right party, Forum for Democracy (FvD), with 1.8%, making their combined scored of 14.9%. That\u2019s less than one percentage point lower than the PVV\u2019s high score of 15.45% in 2010.</p> <p>Three 2018 elections will provide more ammunition for the debate on how best to respond to the radical right. In <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2018/09/10/swedens-election-results-the-view-from-across-europe/\">Sweden</a>, the rise of the Sweden Democrats was not halted in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/despite-making-gains-swedens-far-right-party-remains-out-of-power\">parliamentary election</a> in September, despite a significant turn to the right by the center-right Moderates and even the center-left Social Democrats. Both the Moderates (which lost 3.5% of their vote share) and the Social Democrats (which lost 2.8%) lost, while the Sweden Democrats were the biggest winners, coming in third with 17.5%, an increase of 4.7%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4162\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_opinion\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The results were fairly similar in the much-anticipated state elections in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/14/bavaria-poll-humiliation-for-angela-merkel-conservative-allies\">Bavaria</a>, where the hegemonic Christian Social Union (CSU) had practically copied the agenda of the populist radical right Alternative for Germany (AfD), just as they had done with the Republicans in the early 1990s. In fact, the CSU\u2019s regional struggle with the AfD had crippled the already troubled Grand Coalition in Berlin, with leading CSU politicians regularly defying \u201ctheir\u201d chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin and Brussels.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Bavarian_state_election\">polls</a> had been indicating for months, it stopped neither the ascendance of the AfD, nor the downfall of the CSU. After decades of ruling the state as a party fiefdom, the CSU lost its parliamentary majority and 10.5% of its vote share \u2013 a loss of 22% of its 2013 electorate. The AfD entered the Bavarian parliament in its first election, with 10.2% of the vote, not only less than polls had been predicting for months, but also some 2% less than the party had received in Bavaria in the 2017 federal elections.</p> <p>Finally, in the much less covered local elections in <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/traditional-parties-hammered-in-belgian-local-election/\">Belgium</a>, the \u201cdemocratic nationalist\u201d New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) lost big, despite having veered staunchly right, and making opposition to immigration, and its tough (and popular) secretary of state for asylum, migration and administrative simplification, Theo Francken, the focus of its campaign.</p> <p>At the same time, the populist radical right <a href=\"https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2018/10/15/so-who-won-the-election/\">Flemish Interest</a> (VB) returned from the dead, after focusing its campaign on opposition to the \u201csoft\u201d Francken, gaining its best score in decades. While extrapolations of local elections to national elections should always be treated with extreme care, the local elections indicate a possible big loss for N-VA and win for VB in next year\u2019s mass election year \u2013 Belgium will hold regional, national and European elections on 26 May 2019. And the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/09/belgium-government-loses-majority-over-un-migration-pact\">withdrawal</a> from the federal government of the N-VA, over the contentious but non-binding Marrakesh agreement will do little to mitigate that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Does this mean that voters prefer the original over the copy, as Jean-Marie Le Pen already declared in the 1990s?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So what, if anything, can we learn from these three important elections in 2018? First, the populist radical right is still on the rise in western Europe. Second, mainstream parties that co-opt the populist radical right agenda, even if they exclude the party, still lose elections. Third, the focus on socio-cultural issues \u2013 such as immigration and, to a lesser extent, European integration \u2013 helps not just the populist radical right, but also the Greens, who were the second biggest winners in both Bavaria and Flanders.</p> <p>Does this mean that voters prefer the original over the copy, as Jean-Marie Le Pen already declared in the 1990s? Not necessarily so. Both AfD and SD fell well below the numbers they polled several months ago, let alone in late 2016, when the EU-Turkey deal had taken the so-called \u201crefugee crisis\u201d off the top of the political agenda. Some defenders of the co-option strategy therefore claim that they would have done much better if the mainstream right (and sometimes left) had not moved staunchly right.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this is hard to disprove. The \u201cimmigration realistic\u201d Turkey deal has clearly lowered the salience of the immigration issue, which generally leads to lower support for populist radical right parties, whose main issue is immigration. Following the same logic, focusing election campaigns of the issues of the populist radical right, and using their frames (immigration as threat), will heighten their importance and therefore strength.

      "bodyText": "After the Dutch parliamentary elections of March 2017, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, triumphantly declared that \u201cgood populism\u201d had defeated \u201cbad populism\u201d, a claim eagerly and uncritically repeated in media around the world. It confirmed received wisdom that the best way to defeat the populist radical right, is to co-opt a moderate version of their agenda, while excluding the party itself. Few cared that Rutte\u2019s claim rested on dubious empirical grounds: compared with the 2012 election, Rutte actually lost big (-5.2%), whereas Geert Wilder\u2019s Party for Freedom (PVV) made gains (+3.0%) and was joined by a new far-right party, Forum for Democracy (FvD), with 1.8%, making their combined scored of 14.9%. That\u2019s less than one percentage point lower than the PVV\u2019s high score of 15.45% in 2010. Three 2018 elections will provide more ammunition for the debate on how best to respond to the radical right. In Sweden, the rise of the Sweden Democrats was not halted in the parliamentary election in September, despite a significant turn to the right by the center-right Moderates and even the center-left Social Democrats. Both the Moderates (which lost 3.5% of their vote share) and the Social Democrats (which lost 2.8%) lost, while the Sweden Democrats were the biggest winners, coming in third with 17.5%, an increase of 4.7%. The results were fairly similar in the much-anticipated state elections in Bavaria, where the hegemonic Christian Social Union (CSU) had practically copied the agenda of the populist radical right Alternative for Germany (AfD), just as they had done with the Republicans in the early 1990s. In fact, the CSU\u2019s regional struggle with the AfD had crippled the already troubled Grand Coalition in Berlin, with leading CSU politicians regularly defying \u201ctheir\u201d chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin and Brussels. As polls had been indicating for months, it stopped neither the ascendance of the AfD, nor the downfall of the CSU. After decades of ruling the state as a party fiefdom, the CSU lost its parliamentary majority and 10.5% of its vote share \u2013 a loss of 22% of its 2013 electorate. The AfD entered the Bavarian parliament in its first election, with 10.2% of the vote, not only less than polls had been predicting for months, but also some 2% less than the party had received in Bavaria in the 2017 federal elections. Finally, in the much less covered local elections in Belgium, the \u201cdemocratic nationalist\u201d New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) lost big, despite having veered staunchly right, and making opposition to immigration, and its tough (and popular) secretary of state for asylum, migration and administrative simplification, Theo Francken, the focus of its campaign. At the same time, the populist radical right Flemish Interest (VB) returned from the dead, after focusing its campaign on opposition to the \u201csoft\u201d Francken, gaining its best score in decades. While extrapolations of local elections to national elections should always be treated with extreme care, the local elections indicate a possible big loss for N-VA and win for VB in next year\u2019s mass election year \u2013 Belgium will hold regional, national and European elections on 26 May 2019. And the recent withdrawal from the federal government of the N-VA, over the contentious but non-binding Marrakesh agreement will do little to mitigate that. So what, if anything, can we learn from these three important elections in 2018? First, the populist radical right is still on the rise in western Europe. Second, mainstream parties that co-opt the populist radical right agenda, even if they exclude the party, still lose elections. Third, the focus on socio-cultural issues \u2013 such as immigration and, to a lesser extent, European integration \u2013 helps not just the populist radical right, but also the Greens, who were the second biggest winners in both Bavaria and Flanders. Does this mean that voters prefer the original over the copy, as Jean-Marie Le Pen already declared in the 1990s? Not necessarily so. Both AfD and SD fell well below the numbers they polled several months ago, let alone in late 2016, when the EU-Turkey deal had taken the so-called \u201crefugee crisis\u201d off the top of the political agenda. Some defenders of the co-option strategy therefore claim that they would have done much better if the mainstream right (and sometimes left) had not moved staunchly right. Unfortunately, this is hard to disprove. The \u201cimmigration realistic\u201d Turkey deal has clearly lowered the salience of the immigration issue, which generally leads to lower support for populist radical right parties, whose main issue is immigration. Following the same logic, focusing election campaigns of the issues of the populist radical right, and using their frames (immigration as threat), will heighten their importance and therefore strength. Even if a more anti-immigrant position will keep some voters from abandoning the center-right for the radical right, many voters are not just nativist but also populist, distrusting the mainstream parties, and therefore not open to leaving the radical right for the mainstream right. In the end, of course, the question is, or should be, a moral one. Copying the issues and frames of the populist radical right leads to populist radical right discourses and policies, whether adopted by populist radical right parties or mainstream parties. This is also the lesson of the Netherlands, where the exclusion of the PVV has not prevented the mainstream right from even further toughening immigration and integration policies. Assuming that we (still) consider both the messenger and the message as a threat to liberal democracy, \u201cgood populism\u201d is both empirically and normatively the wrong strategy to fight \u201cbad populism\u201d.

Though unintended, the closure of the national parks became a rallying cry for the public to force Congress to finally pass appropriation legislation and reopen the federal government. This time, surely to avoid the public outcry, the Trump administration decided to keep the national parks open while still furloughing the majority of the NPS staff. As the shutdown extends and the parks are left open, we will begin to see the ugly consequences. Trash is already accumulating in parks such as Yosemite, and will attract wildlife. This could result in tragic human/bear encounters, or habituate bears to human food, meaning the animals will have to be relocated or euthanized in the future. Civil war battlefield parks are seeing increases in artefact theft by people with metal detectors. Human waste has overwhelmed toilets in Joshua Tree and Point Reyes and has proliferated along trails, rivers and streams, potentially impacting water quality and certainly the visitor experience. Roads normally open in Mt Rainier and Crater Lake national parks are accumulating so much snow that they will have to be bulldozed to reopen, at a much higher expense and with prolonged delays. Visitor centers are closed across the parks, depriving visitors of information on hazardous conditions, trail closures and wildlife activity. Wildlife, normally fully protected, will be subject to poaching or threats, such as the recent break-in at the endangered Devil\u2019s Hole pupfish enclosure in Nevada. Visitors to parks are reporting dogs off leash, drone activity, off-highway vehicles and the public walking on or near fragile resources, such as the hot pools and thermal features of Yellowstone. There are other consequences of a shutdown that are less visible but very consequential. The control of the spread of invasive species into national parks stops, allowing some to gain a foothold that will be much harder to control. Long-term monitoring sites that measure snow depth, rainfall, air quality, water quality or pollution will go unmaintained. Research scientists working on complex issues that only occur during this period, such as pronghorn migration, may miss their window. These disruptions of data collection make the results less reliable for understanding ecosystem dynamics or climate change. Author Wallace Stegner said that \u201cNational parks are the best idea we ever had. Absolutely American, absolutely democratic, they reflect us at our best rather than our worst.\u201d Now left unattended and gathering trash and human waste, the Trump administration has let them reflect us at our worst. Jonathan B Jarvis was the 18th director of the National Park Service. He is now the executive director for the Institute for Parks, People and Biodiversity at the University of California, Berkeley.",

He arrived in Paris to a fanfare, introduced on a prime time television show not as the world\u2019s highest paid union player, as he had become with a contract in excess of \u00a31m a year, but as one of the greatest of any generation.</p> <p>The expectation was that Carter would dazzle in the Top 14 as he had for the Crusaders and the All Blacks but the environments were markedly different. The signing was condemned by the Toulon owner, Mourad Boudjellal, as a triumph of commercialism over rugby: he should know, given the number of southern hemisphere pensions he has boosted since resurrecting the club, but the Carter effect went beyond boosting Racing\u2019s turnover.</p> <p>They made two European Champions Cup finals in his three years there and won the Top 14 but Carter\u2019s influence at a club that included five other former All Blacks was, if not muted, understated. Boudjellal\u2019s point was not made out of mere jealousy: Carter had to adapt to Racing and French rugby, not the other way round.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/02/2019-rugby-world-cup-six-nations-new-year-must-not-trash-qualities-rugby-union\">This must not be the year when rugby union trashes its finest qualities | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne of the biggest surprises I had when joining Racing was that everyone did what the coach said,\u201d Carter said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/10/dan-carter-seeing-a-psychologist-allowed-me-to-confront-my-demons\" title=\"\">in an interview with the Observer last summer</a>. \u201cIn team meetings, players would not say a word \u2026 I had to bite my tongue.

Pau thought they had signed Julian Savea\u2019s brother, Ardie, after this year\u2019s World Cup, only for the flanker to agree a new contract with the New Zealand Rugby Union, prompted by the neck injury suffered four months ago by the first choice All Black in his position, Sam Cane.</p> <p>A number of New Zealanders will be off to Europe, including the experienced Ben Smith and Kieran Read. The latter, who has been lined up by Racing, makes commercial sense, like the Carter deal: All Blacks spend their careers having their playing loads closely monitored but in France they play even when not fully fit. It is Read\u2019s presence and all that he stands for that Racing, settled into their new stadium, will look to exploit.</p> <p>There have been a number of examples of New Zealand players who have successfully made the transition, notably Nick Evans at Harlequins. It is not so much how quickly they adjust but that they do. Carlos Spencer, another All Black 10, dazzled intermittently for Northampton and Gloucester but was never going to bring the controlling influence Premiership coaches demand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad411c2f7981a506754c81cdddf497e6fda4aa44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad411c2f7981a506754c81cdddf497e6fda4aa44/263_200_3613_2169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lima Sopoaga has taken time to adjust at Wasps\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lima Sopoaga has taken time to adjust at Wasps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The same applies to coaches. Northampton raised eyebrows last year when they announced Chris Boyd was arriving from the Hurricanes, home of the Barrett brothers. A club that for a decade had been arguably the most structured side in the Premiership had turned into risk-takers.</p> <p>Boyd said immediately on arriving in England that he would not look to turn the Saints into the Hurricanes, not least because the ingredients were different; evolution not revolution. New Zealand coaches who join clubs in the Premiership or Top 14 are confronted by something they have not experienced at home \u2013 relegation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/02/2019-world-cup-fever-rugby-union-japan-ireland-new-zealand\">2019, World Cup fever No 3: rugby union hits Japan amid uncertainty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Northampton had signed the Wales fly-half Dan Biggar before recruiting Boyd. He is a contrasting 10 to Beauden Barrett, all competitive hustle and bustle and suddenly Northampton was not the club he had joined. Wales left Biggar on the bench for their major internationals last autumn in favour of the more attacking Gareth Anscombe but Boyd is coaxing a different side out of the former Osprey.</p> <p>Biggar has profited from having Piers Francis outside him, but the England international will be out for up to six weeks after suffering a shoulder injury during last Friday\u2019s victory over Exeter. He may only miss one Premiership match with rounds of the Challenge Cup and the Premiership Cup taking up the rest of the month after this weekend, and the way the Saints are now using possession has helped them offset struggles up front.</p> <p>Change takes time. It was hard not to feel for Sopoaga at Twickenham last Saturday, a marquee signing struggling to make his mark. He prefers to stand deeper than most Premiership outside-halves but, unless operating off turnover ball, it makes the gainline harder to breach. He remains the player Wasps recruited but with the Premiership campaign now at the halfway point and his side tumbling down the table he needs to start emulating the good Evans.</p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\" title=\"\"><strong><em>To subscribe just visit this page and follow the instructions</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Daniel Carter joined Racing 92 after the 2015 World Cup he was treated like rugby royalty. He arrived in Paris to a fanfare, introduced on a prime time television show not as the world\u2019s highest paid union player, as he had become with a contract in excess of \u00a31m a year, but as one of the greatest of any generation. The expectation was that Carter would dazzle in the Top 14 as he had for the Crusaders and the All Blacks but the environments were markedly different. The signing was condemned by the Toulon owner, Mourad Boudjellal, as a triumph of commercialism over rugby: he should know, given the number of southern hemisphere pensions he has boosted since resurrecting the club, but the Carter effect went beyond boosting Racing\u2019s turnover. They made two European Champions Cup finals in his three years there and won the Top 14 but Carter\u2019s influence at a club that included five other former All Blacks was, if not muted, understated. Boudjellal\u2019s point was not made out of mere jealousy: Carter had to adapt to Racing and French rugby, not the other way round. \u201cOne of the biggest surprises I had when joining Racing was that everyone did what the coach said,\u201d Carter said in an interview with the Observer last summer. \u201cIn team meetings, players would not say a word \u2026 I had to bite my tongue. There was no awareness of playing what you see. My career has been about backing my instinct and being prepared to go against the gameplan.\u201d Boudjellal signed Carter\u2019s fellow World Cup winner Ma\u2019a Nonu at the end of 2015 but was soon complaining that he had expected more. The New Zealand wing Julian Savea has failed to make an impact at Toulon this season; all that is gold does not always glitter. Lima Sopoaga\u2019s arrival at Wasps this season was intended to mitigate the loss of Danny Cipriani but the New Zealand fly-half has taken time to adjust to the Premiership, not helped by injuries to the players inside and outside him, Dan Robson and Jimmy Gopperth. He is further proof that it is unwise to expect an instant return from pedigree players when they are exposed to a distinctly different climate. Such is the impact New Zealand have made at all levels of the game for so long that their players and coaches are always in demand. Pau thought they had signed Julian Savea\u2019s brother, Ardie, after this year\u2019s World Cup, only for the flanker to agree a new contract with the New Zealand Rugby Union, prompted by the neck injury suffered four months ago by the first choice All Black in his position, Sam Cane. A number of New Zealanders will be off to Europe, including the experienced Ben Smith and Kieran Read. The latter, who has been lined up by Racing, makes commercial sense, like the Carter deal: All Blacks spend their careers having their playing loads closely monitored but in France they play even when not fully fit. It is Read\u2019s presence and all that he stands for that Racing, settled into their new stadium, will look to exploit. There have been a number of examples of New Zealand players who have successfully made the transition, notably Nick Evans at Harlequins. It is not so much how quickly they adjust but that they do. Carlos Spencer, another All Black 10, dazzled intermittently for Northampton and Gloucester but was never going to bring the controlling influence Premiership coaches demand. The same applies to coaches. Northampton raised eyebrows last year when they announced Chris Boyd was arriving from the Hurricanes, home of the Barrett brothers. A club that for a decade had been arguably the most structured side in the Premiership had turned into risk-takers. Boyd said immediately on arriving in England that he would not look to turn the Saints into the Hurricanes, not least because the ingredients were different; evolution not revolution. New Zealand coaches who join clubs in the Premiership or Top 14 are confronted by something they have not experienced at home \u2013 relegation. Northampton had signed the Wales fly-half Dan Biggar before recruiting Boyd. He is a contrasting 10 to Beauden Barrett, all competitive hustle and bustle and suddenly Northampton was not the club he had joined. Wales left Biggar on the bench for their major internationals last autumn in favour of the more attacking Gareth Anscombe but Boyd is coaxing a different side out of the former Osprey. Biggar has profited from having Piers Francis outside him, but the England international will be out for up to six weeks after suffering a shoulder injury during last Friday\u2019s victory over Exeter. He may only miss one Premiership match with rounds of the Challenge Cup and the Premiership Cup taking up the rest of the month after this weekend, and the way the Saints are now using possession has helped them offset struggles up front. Change takes time. It was hard not to feel for Sopoaga at Twickenham last Saturday, a marquee signing struggling to make his mark. He prefers to stand deeper than most Premiership outside-halves but, unless operating off turnover ball, it makes the gainline harder to breach. He remains the player Wasps recruited but with the Premiership campaign now at the halfway point and his side tumbling down the table he needs to start emulating the good Evans. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

      "body": "<p>From Spam Appreciation Week in March to June\u2019s National Fudge Day and Sourdough September, every day of the year seems to have an (often baffling) link to a foodstuff. On the Guardian food desk, we take this with a pinch of salt \u2013 and not just on National Salt Awareness Week (from 29 February) \u2013 lest your year in recipes and food articles becomes subsumed by commercial partnerships.</p> <p>But Veganuary, the movement encouraging us to try cutting out animal protein and produce for the first month of the year (in the hope that we\u2019ll keep it up), feels a bit less silly. If adopted by enough people, veganism presents a viable way to offset environmental damage. It hit the mainstream in 2018, with conscious cooks and eaters embracing meat, fish, dairy and egg alternatives \u2013 from jackfruit to pulses \u2013 in their thousands. The Vegan Society says the UK\u2019s vegan contingent has grown fourfold in just four years, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/01/third-of-britons-have-stopped-or-reduced-meat-eating-vegan-vegetarian-report\" title=\"\">150,000 in 2014 to over 600,000</a> now, while last year Waitrose became the first supermarket to have a dedicated vegan section in 134 of its stores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/02/greggs-launches-vegan-sausage-roll\">Greggs launches vegan sausage roll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Going vegan does, however, demand a level of organisation and planning \u2013 and Veganuary is no exception. Where can you buy cashew cheese? What are the non-vegan ingredients everyone forgets about? Who writes the best (and easiest) vegan recipes? And, if you aren\u2019t cooking and need a speedy feed al desko, where can you find the best vegan lunch to go? To answer that last question, I ate a dozen lunches from outlets near the office, and here\u2019s what I found \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Pret a Manger hummus wrap (\u00a32.99) and vegan chilli side soup (</strong>\u00a32.35<strong>)</strong><br></h2> <p>It may be hard to balls up a hummus wrap, but I do think this one is pretty good for the price \u2013 it hits the spot, ranking low on imagination, but higher on palatability. The vegan chilli is very good \u2013 in spite of my objection to the side-soup format (taking more than half the price of the full-size option from customers for what seems like less than half the volume), and despite my hankering for an unvegan dollop of sour cream on top of it.<br><em><strong>4/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Wasabi vegan sushi box </strong>(\u00a36.60)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fed088318f22f2930ff99785ca6936388950986e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fed088318f22f2930ff99785ca6936388950986e/193_309_4697_2818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wasabi Vegan Sushi Box\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Sushi has an unfair advantage over other lunch options: douse with enough soy sauce, wasabi and ginger, and it always tastes good. This is as true of the vegan stuff as it is of fish, so I enjoyed this spread of rice, seaweed, vegetable and tofu concoctions, in spite of the whole premise of \u201ctakeaway sushi\u201d somehow seeming wrong (given it is traditionally defined by the care, attention and precision with which it is made).<br><em><strong>4/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Leon\u2019s Lebanese meze salad </strong>(\u00a34.95)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d8446b832435b6d7c715542e7b9528a8593040d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d8446b832435b6d7c715542e7b9528a8593040d/0_219_6570_3942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lebanese Mezze Salad from Leon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A paltry boxful of autumn and winter hues, this is tasty, but not one for the hungry. It has four components, of which the kale and lentil salad is the high point. The curried squash is nice, the hummus fine (you can\u2019t go wrong), but there are two dried-up falafel-brown orbs of vegetal dust. I\u2019m generally very keen on Leon\u2019s vegan offering, but this isn\u2019t their strongest option.<br><em><strong>3/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Benito\u2019s Hat five-a-day taco </strong>(\u00a36.30)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3a208f2590f697c7e9d69f3bb7261f442a518be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3a208f2590f697c7e9d69f3bb7261f442a518be/0_478_944_566/500.png\" alt=\"Benito - 5-a-day taco\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Soft tacos need to be heated to stop them falling apart. These had a split second on the grill before being loaded with a dead weight of loveless roasted veg and guacamole, and seasoned with bitter disappointment (but no salt). At \u00a36.30, this is at the dearer end of the spectrum, and that\u2019s not including the (vegan) cereal bar I had to buy afterwards to cheer myself up.<br><em><strong>1/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Eat\u2019s Mediterranean orzo </strong>(\u00a34.95)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d0dd13dedc3f3089a3c00b26246d71853fc2ff7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d0dd13dedc3f3089a3c00b26246d71853fc2ff7/0_331_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"EAT Orzo mediterranean salad\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A generous box of orzo in tomato sauce, peppered with tired roasted veg and some arbitrary spinach leaves. This comes with an abundance of very sweet dressing which imparts flavour to something that would otherwise be bland \u2013 but it\u2019s far too sugary. I sense the boxed pasta salad might have had its time; there\u2019s something outdated about this \u2013 which perhaps says all you need to know about Eat, really.<br><em><strong>1/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Leon\u2019s Brazilian black beans </strong>(\u00a33.95)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5169f4164acccc4426325a9c1138c1dfdda55c3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5169f4164acccc4426325a9c1138c1dfdda55c3f/414_414_4829_2897/1000.png\" alt=\"Brazilian Black Beans from Leon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So good. Leon manages to make its vegan boxes delicious and desirable in their own right \u2013 quite a feat. These beans, seasoned with hot smoked sweet paprika (the spice used in chorizo) have a \u201cmeatiness\u201d and are served over brown rice for a result that is wholesome, filling and satisfying. For the price, you won\u2019t find a better vegan feed.<br><em><strong>5/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Waitrose </strong><strong>Mexican spiced butternut squash &amp; beans wrap </strong>(\u00a33.40)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33c6b97eb8524f4a79f0451cad9c51e21fbcae12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33c6b97eb8524f4a79f0451cad9c51e21fbcae12/0_0_2365_2365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wrap from Waitrose - vegan Mexican spiced butternut squash and beans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A better Mexican than Benito\u2019s Hat, ticking the vital boxes that lunch should tick: tasty, sustaining and affordable. The wheat tortilla is made of pumpkin, which, though doughy, has a little more chutzpah on the taste front than wheat wraps usually do. Filled with black bean paste, cumin roasted butternut squash, chipotle salsa, spinach and coriander, it tastes freshly made and has plenty of flavour. Might be interesting to try the filling with a corn tortilla, though, for something gluten-free as well as vegan.<br><em><strong>4/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Waitrose sweet potato, bulgur &amp; couscous on red lentil hummus </strong>(\u00a33)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c0477ce9217f0c6b9dfe15748bb14cb249943bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c0477ce9217f0c6b9dfe15748bb14cb249943bd/0_0_2365_2365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"salad from Waitrose - sweet potato, bulgar and couscous\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Has the visual appeal of a molehill, but is better in the mouth. The red lentil hummus needs seasoning, but I like the fact that this is filling and has lots of different textures, colours and flavours to keep me interested. I\u2019m disappointed by the packaging, which I\u2019d expect to feel a little more sustainable.<br><em><strong>3/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Crussh jackfruit tinga fit bowl </strong>(\u00a36.95)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecd3510023d1a6666adf73ad1a811b223b04a616\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecd3510023d1a6666adf73ad1a811b223b04a616/0_0_3543_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crussh - Autumn pr images Fit bowl Jackfruit tingajpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I had to have some jackfruit at some point \u2013 it was the darling ingredient for vegans in 2018, and is said to be a plant-based answer to pulled pork. I thought this was delicious, but it needed the addition of zingy guacamole and crunchy coleslaw at the till \u2013 to accompany the sweetness of sweet potato mash and the spicy jackfruit curry. The ingredients are, however, largely cheap, so I would say this is \u00a31 too expensive.<br><em><strong>4/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer supergreen salad and Mexican-style rice and avocado </strong>(two for \u00a34)<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc06a30867bca6ddb520df8899913ecf099dc26c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc06a30867bca6ddb520df8899913ecf099dc26c/209_444_1486_1486/1000.png\" alt=\"Marks &amp; Spencer M&amp;S Supergreen salad - edamame, soybeans, apples and sufar snap peas in an apple, spy and ginger dressing Vegan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I like the M&amp;S two-for-\u00a34 deal \u2013 a bargain. I\u2019m less impressed by the packaging \u2013 which not only sounds my eco alarm bells, but makes the food look so much less appealing. The Thai flavours in the salad (ginger and soy) are quite simply delicious, while the \u201cmeh\u201d Mexican rice (I have decided all Mexican lunches need to come with extra lime for some zing) at least offers up the bulk I need. I was surprised not more of M&amp;S\u2019s options were vegan; they could do with a couple more.<br><em><strong>4/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Gail\u2019s pumpkin and wild rice (\u00a35)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"576633e317b95b277534ca02bbeb84c1e9aadfa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576633e317b95b277534ca02bbeb84c1e9aadfa8/176_0_667_667/500.jpg\" alt=\"gail\u2019s pumpkin-wild-rice\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m a big fan of Gail\u2019s and this feels fresh, hearty and good for me, with lashings of roasted cabbage and pecan pesto dressing. I think it\u2019s a bit underseasoned and could do with a more generous dollop of the pesto, on which it relies for its character. Were it not a vegan number, they would probably have thrown some crumbled feta over, but given the plant-based straitjacket, they need to make up for the flavour deficit.<br><em><strong>4/5</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>Tesco rainbow curry bowl (\u00a33.50)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"722b01cb59a4a896d62f9ac8634b944bf4614981\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/722b01cb59a4a896d62f9ac8634b944bf4614981/152_17_2588_2588/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesco Rainbow Curry Bowl Packaging\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We eat with our eyes as well as our palates, and I find it difficult to see past this bowlful\u2019s lack of visual appeal, with its limp assembly of veg and herbs \u2013 another example of plastic packaging really not helping the dish out. But it\u2019s worth doffing our caps to Tesco for having a relatively extensive line of affordable vegan lunch options, created for them by Wicked Kitchen. My rainbow curry bowl is full of flavour, with curried lentils and chickpeas, (slightly soggy) onion bhajis, mango cubes and minty dressing \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say the simply roasted sweet potato is \u201ctandoori style\u201d.<br><em><strong>2/5</strong></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "From Spam Appreciation Week in March to June\u2019s National Fudge Day and Sourdough September, every day of the year seems to have an (often baffling) link to a foodstuff. On the Guardian food desk, we take this with a pinch of salt \u2013 and not just on National Salt Awareness Week (from 29 February) \u2013 lest your year in recipes and food articles becomes subsumed by commercial partnerships. But Veganuary, the movement encouraging us to try cutting out animal protein and produce for the first month of the year (in the hope that we\u2019ll keep it up), feels a bit less silly. If adopted by enough people, veganism presents a viable way to offset environmental damage. It hit the mainstream in 2018, with conscious cooks and eaters embracing meat, fish, dairy and egg alternatives \u2013 from jackfruit to pulses \u2013 in their thousands. The Vegan Society says the UK\u2019s vegan contingent has grown fourfold in just four years, from 150,000 in 2014 to over 600,000 now, while last year Waitrose became the first supermarket to have a dedicated vegan section in 134 of its stores. Going vegan does, however, demand a level of organisation and planning \u2013 and Veganuary is no exception. Where can you buy cashew cheese? What are the non-vegan ingredients everyone forgets about? Who writes the best (and easiest) vegan recipes? And, if you aren\u2019t cooking and need a speedy feed al desko, where can you find the best vegan lunch to go? To answer that last question, I ate a dozen lunches from outlets near the office, and here\u2019s what I found \u2026 Pret a Manger hummus wrap (\u00a32.99) and vegan chilli side soup (\u00a32.35) It may be hard to balls up a hummus wrap, but I do think this one is pretty good for the price \u2013 it hits the spot, ranking low on imagination, but higher on palatability. The vegan chilli is very good \u2013 in spite of my objection to the side-soup format (taking more than half the price of the full-size option from customers for what seems like less than half the volume), and despite my hankering for an unvegan dollop of sour cream on top of it. 4/5 Wasabi vegan sushi box (\u00a36.60) Sushi has an unfair advantage over other lunch options: douse with enough soy sauce, wasabi and ginger, and it always tastes good. This is as true of the vegan stuff as it is of fish, so I enjoyed this spread of rice, seaweed, vegetable and tofu concoctions, in spite of the whole premise of \u201ctakeaway sushi\u201d somehow seeming wrong (given it is traditionally defined by the care, attention and precision with which it is made). 4/5 Leon\u2019s Lebanese meze salad (\u00a34.95) A paltry boxful of autumn and winter hues, this is tasty, but not one for the hungry. It has four components, of which the kale and lentil salad is the high point. The curried squash is nice, the hummus fine (you can\u2019t go wrong), but there are two dried-up falafel-brown orbs of vegetal dust. I\u2019m generally very keen on Leon\u2019s vegan offering, but this isn\u2019t their strongest option. 3/5 Benito\u2019s Hat five-a-day taco (\u00a36.30) Soft tacos need to be heated to stop them falling apart. These had a split second on the grill before being loaded with a dead weight of loveless roasted veg and guacamole, and seasoned with bitter disappointment (but no salt). At \u00a36.30, this is at the dearer end of the spectrum, and that\u2019s not including the (vegan) cereal bar I had to buy afterwards to cheer myself up. 1/5 Eat\u2019s Mediterranean orzo (\u00a34.95) A generous box of orzo in tomato sauce, peppered with tired roasted veg and some arbitrary spinach leaves. This comes with an abundance of very sweet dressing which imparts flavour to something that would otherwise be bland \u2013 but it\u2019s far too sugary. I sense the boxed pasta salad might have had its time; there\u2019s something outdated about this \u2013 which perhaps says all you need to know about Eat, really. 1/5 Leon\u2019s Brazilian black beans (\u00a33.95) So good. Leon manages to make its vegan boxes delicious and desirable in their own right \u2013 quite a feat. These beans, seasoned with hot smoked sweet paprika (the spice used in chorizo) have a \u201cmeatiness\u201d and are served over brown rice for a result that is wholesome, filling and satisfying. For the price, you won\u2019t find a better vegan feed. 5/5 Waitrose Mexican spiced butternut squash &amp; beans wrap (\u00a33.40) A better Mexican than Benito\u2019s Hat, ticking the vital boxes that lunch should tick: tasty, sustaining and affordable. The wheat tortilla is made of pumpkin, which, though doughy, has a little more chutzpah on the taste front than wheat wraps usually do. Filled with black bean paste, cumin roasted butternut squash, chipotle salsa, spinach and coriander, it tastes freshly made and has plenty of flavour. Might be interesting to try the filling with a corn tortilla, though, for something gluten-free as well as vegan. 4/5 Waitrose sweet potato, bulgur &amp; couscous on red lentil hummus (\u00a33) Has the visual appeal of a molehill, but is better in the mouth. The red lentil hummus needs seasoning, but I like the fact that this is filling and has lots of different textures, colours and flavours to keep me interested. I\u2019m disappointed by the packaging, which I\u2019d expect to feel a little more sustainable. 3/5 Crussh jackfruit tinga fit bowl (\u00a36.95) I had to have some jackfruit at some point \u2013 it was the darling ingredient for vegans in 2018, and is said to be a plant-based answer to pulled pork. I thought this was delicious, but it needed the addition of zingy guacamole and crunchy coleslaw at the till \u2013 to accompany the sweetness of sweet potato mash and the spicy jackfruit curry. The ingredients are, however, largely cheap, so I would say this is \u00a31 too expensive. 4/5 Marks &amp; Spencer supergreen salad and Mexican-style rice and avocado (two for \u00a34) I like the M&amp;S two-for-\u00a34 deal \u2013 a bargain. I\u2019m less impressed by the packaging \u2013 which not only sounds my eco alarm bells, but makes the food look so much less appealing. The Thai flavours in the salad (ginger and soy) are quite simply delicious, while the \u201cmeh\u201d Mexican rice (I have decided all Mexican lunches need to come with extra lime for some zing) at least offers up the bulk I need. I was surprised not more of M&amp;S\u2019s options were vegan; they could do with a couple more. 4/5 Gail\u2019s pumpkin and wild rice (\u00a35) I\u2019m a big fan of Gail\u2019s and this feels fresh, hearty and good for me, with lashings of roasted cabbage and pecan pesto dressing. I think it\u2019s a bit underseasoned and could do with a more generous dollop of the pesto, on which it relies for its character. Were it not a vegan number, they would probably have thrown some crumbled feta over, but given the plant-based straitjacket, they need to make up for the flavour deficit. 4/5 Tesco rainbow curry bowl (\u00a33.50) We eat with our eyes as well as our palates, and I find it difficult to see past this bowlful\u2019s lack of visual appeal, with its limp assembly of veg and herbs \u2013 another example of plastic packaging really not helping the dish out. But it\u2019s worth doffing our caps to Tesco for having a relatively extensive line of affordable vegan lunch options, created for them by Wicked Kitchen. My rainbow curry bowl is full of flavour, with curried lentils and chickpeas, (slightly soggy) onion bhajis, mango cubes and minty dressing \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say the simply roasted sweet potato is \u201ctandoori style\u201d. 2/5",

Though Murphy might squeak it, the divisive Sharp Objects is in with a shot, if it doesn\u2019t end up faring better in acting categories. A Very English Scandal, though, was a class act, and could be triumphant, particularly if the Hollywood Foreign Press Association decides to show some of the love for British shows that occasionally throws up a surprise.</p> <p><strong>Will win:</strong> The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story</p> <p><strong>Should win:</strong> A Very English Scandal</p> <h2><strong>Best actress in a limited series or TV movie</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"034c7952fcc8e260289c1b52191d937af4896b7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/034c7952fcc8e260289c1b52191d937af4896b7f/0_0_4050_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Adams in a scene from \u201cSharp Objects\u201d.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Adams in a scene from Sharp Objects.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Marie Fox/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike 2018, when Big Little Lies and Feud dominated this category to a near comical degree, there are five performances from five very different shows here. Regina King was strong in the otherwise turgid Seven Seconds, and won an Emmy to prove it, and it\u2019s hard to better a trio as strong as Patricia Arquette, Laura Dern and Connie Britton, but Sharp Objects marked a career-best performance for Amy Adams, who has had a very, very good career already.

Darren Criss has been much hyped for The Assassination of Gianni Versace, and after the Emmys, he looks like the frontrunner, but a more likely scenario is that it comes down to a battle of the Brits.

      "bodyText": "There are plenty of Hollywood A-listers duking it out for dominance this year, from Julia Roberts to Jim Carrey, with the TV categories starting to look like they took a wrong turn at the Academy Awards. But the Golden Globes are fun because they usually defy predictions. The Emmys may have established The Americans and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel as the ones to beat, but there is usually a strong British influence here, and this could be a night for A Very English Scandal or even Bodyguard to shine. Best limited series or TV movie There has been considerable admiration for Ryan Murphy\u2019s starry take on the murder of Gianni Versace, and after The People v OJ Simpson won this category two years ago, it would make a neat sequel. Though Murphy might squeak it, the divisive Sharp Objects is in with a shot, if it doesn\u2019t end up faring better in acting categories. A Very English Scandal, though, was a class act, and could be triumphant, particularly if the Hollywood Foreign Press Association decides to show some of the love for British shows that occasionally throws up a surprise. Will win: The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story Should win: A Very English Scandal Best actress in a limited series or TV movie Unlike 2018, when Big Little Lies and Feud dominated this category to a near comical degree, there are five performances from five very different shows here. Regina King was strong in the otherwise turgid Seven Seconds, and won an Emmy to prove it, and it\u2019s hard to better a trio as strong as Patricia Arquette, Laura Dern and Connie Britton, but Sharp Objects marked a career-best performance for Amy Adams, who has had a very, very good career already. So it seems inevitable that her complex, broken Camille Preaker will win her the prize. Will win: Amy Adams, Sharp Objects Should win: Amy Adams, Sharp Objects Best actor in a limited series or TV movie This is Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s third Golden Globes nomination, having lost out on Sherlock and The Imitation Game, and his Patrick Melrose ticks all award-worthy boxes: it\u2019s a literary adaptation, it\u2019s a period piece, and he has to act like he\u2019s taken an awful lot of drugs. Darren Criss has been much hyped for The Assassination of Gianni Versace, and after the Emmys, he looks like the frontrunner, but a more likely scenario is that it comes down to a battle of the Brits. And Hugh Grant continues a fruitful period with his brilliantly unvarnished portrayal of disgraced politician Jeremy Thorpe. Will win: Benedict Cumberbatch, Patrick Melrose Should win: Hugh Grant, A Very English Scandal Best supporting actress in a limited series or TV movie Surely one of the strongest and least predictable categories of the night, in which any nominee could feasibly be considered the best, particularly when comparing such different shows. Yvonne Strahovski might make up for the absence of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale this year after an unloved second season, despite it winning best drama in 2018. Penelope Cruz and Thandie Newton were both excellent, but this could be an Emmys do-over for Alex Borstein. However, the ever-brilliant Patricia Clarkson was stunning as the ethereal mommie dearest Adora, and would be a pleasant surprise win. Will win: Alex Borstein, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel Should win: Patricia Clarkson, Sharp Objects Best supporting actor in a limited series or TV movie Henry Winkler\u2019s hapless acting coach brought heart to Barry, which could otherwise be cold, and it has already won him an Emmy (also, Ted Danson was robbed). Kieran Culkin was fantastic as the youngest son in a Murdoch-esque media empire, and this is the only nomination for Succession, which deserves more accolades than that. But Ben Whishaw\u2019s flighty, fragile Norman Scott was a rich wonder, and it elevated the already great A Very English Scandal even further. Will win: Henry Winkler, Barry Should win: Ben Whishaw, A Very English Scandal Best TV series \u2013 musical or comedy Awards ceremony judges sure do love Mrs Maisel\u2019s moxie, and even though the second season was more cloying and whimsical than the first, it seems to have escaped the more harsh exclusion of, say, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. So it\u2019s a likely winner, though it is up against a strange and inconsistent bunch: Barry, The Kominsky Method and Kidding are all admirable, if hard to adore. The Good Place, so consistently inventive, might sneak a breakthrough win. Will win: The Marvelous Mrs Maisel Should win: The Good Place Best actress in a TV series \u2013 musical or comedy Rachel Brosnahan won it last year, so I\u2019m ruling her out for the double. Candice Bergen and Debra Messing are great, but retreading old roles. Kristen Bell deserves a shot for making The Good Place as charming as it is, for fork\u2019s sake, but I\u2019d have an outside punt on Alison Brie, nominated for the second time for Glow, if only for her services to leotards. Will win: Alison Brie, Glow Should win: Kristen Bell, The Good Place Best actor in a TV series \u2013 musical or comedy This has been a year of diverse performances and almost every one of these nominees has lifted an otherwise inconsistent show, whether it\u2019s Bill Hader\u2019s glassy-eyed assassin in Barry, or big screen transplants Jim Carrey (Kidding) and Michael Douglas (The Kominsky Method). Sacha Baron Cohen might have been too bleak in Who Is America?, but really, after his 2017 wins for best actor and best show, this has to be Donald Glover\u2019s year once again. Will win: Donald Glover, Atlanta Should win: Donald Glover, Atlanta Best TV series \u2013 drama Here we go: this is the toughest category to call, and the most likely to throw up a surprise, particularly given the pointed exclusion of last year\u2019s winner, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.

      "bodyText": "Bitcoin, the Big Daddy of cryptocurrencies, which celebrates its 10th birthday today, rarely inspires temperate or informed debate. For its detractors \u2013 mostly elderly bankers and economists \u2013 it is tulip-mania, moonshine, hi-tech smoke and mirrors. For its most fanatical adherents \u2013 techies and latter-day hippies \u2013 bitcoin is not merely a viable currency, but salvation: a universal panacea, not just to combat governmental ineptitude or malevolence, and poverty, but to end them. Hallelujah and kumbaya. The sneerers cite the rampant criminality in the ranks of the cryptosphere. It is true, in the 10 years since bitcoin was born on a couple of desktop computers \u2013 becoming an entity worth more than the M1 money supply of Argentina \u2013 its retinue has accommodated an incredible rogues\u2019 gallery. There have been old-fashioned cony-catchers, saltimbancos and bubblers who did a runner with other people\u2019s money in the time-honoured manner, but also drug-dealers, murderers and blaggers \u2013 not to mention the lethal dreamers and false prophets. But as the stalwarts of crypto will gleefully point out, the desperados and flimflammery encountered in these new forms are but a mirror of the better-tailored dishonesty found in the City of London or any of the world\u2019s financial centres. There is hardly a bank left that has not been caught money-laundering, market-rigging, misselling or involved in miscellaneous misdeeds. Cryptocurrencies are fiendishly complex \u2013 just a basic understanding requires a maths and IT background. And, like lawyers, even those developers who do know something rarely agree on anything. Even if you do know something about the tech, it does not help much, because this is all new and unprecedented. When tech leaves the white paper and hits the street, no one knows what the result will be. There is a long trail of individuals and companies who have been \u201crekt\u201d as the industry parlance has it because of events: for example, the Bitcoin Cash civil war last November. The most impressive feature of bitcoin is that it is still there. It has survived crash after crash and state hostility. It has truly been battle-tested in the harshest of conditions. The identity-hiding creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, wanted it to be a currency. That looks unlikely. In the near future, you won\u2019t be buying a pint of milk with it at the corner shop. Admittedly, if you are willing to trawl the internet, and in no rush to get things, you can buy all sorts of products \u2013 but for everyday life, compared with a contactless Visa card, bitcoin is almost useless. One of the selling points of bitcoin (and other cryptos such as Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Dash) is that you can \u201cbe your own bank\u201d. That has its attractions and advantages, but it also has a downside: it means having some understanding of the tech, and a willingness to take full responsibility when the bank robbers come. If something goes wrong, you are on your own. Again, compared with a credit card, bitcoin seems risky and hard work, unless you are really keen on buying drugs or tax evasion. On the other hand, bitcoin can be sent anonymously and fairly quickly to the other side of the world with low fees. 2017 was the year when you couldn\u2019t lose in crypto, but 2018 was the year when you couldn\u2019t win.

      "bodyText": "A total of 463 people have died due to traffic collisions in Thailand over the past week, as the country\u2019s notoriously lethal roads were once again swamped with drunk drivers during the new year period. The country\u2019s Road Safety Directing Centre said the death toll for what police call \u201cSeven Dangerous Days\u201d was up by 40 from last year\u2019s count of 423 and just shy of the record of 478 set in 2017. Drink-driving was listed as the cause of 40% of the 3,791 collisions reported between 27 December and 2 January. During that period 3,892 people were injured, down from 4,005 last year. Although this year\u2019s death toll was up, the collision count was down slightly, from 3,841. Speeding was the second most reported cause of collisions this year, accounting for 28%. Eighty per cent of vehicles involved in crashes were motorcycles. Last month the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that Thailand\u2019s road collision-related death rate was 32.7 people out of every 100,000, the highest in south-east Asia. The organisation has blamed Thai authorities for not implementing road safety rules effectively, leading to many drivers taking to the roads when drunk or without holding driving licences. After last year\u2019s record death toll was reported, Liviu Vedrasco of the WHO said that although the Seven Dangerous Days received much attention, poor road safety was a year-round problem in Thailand. \u201cRoads in Thailand are dangerous every day, not only seven,\u201d he said. According to the WHO, Libya is the only country with a higher road collision death rate. In 2015 the organisation reported a figure of 73.4 deaths out of every 100,000 people in the African country.",

Tarell Alvin McCraney\u2019s gentle, gospel-infused Choir Boy, which played off-Broadway in 2013 to mostly strong reviews, is finally transferring, a decision probably owing to the success of Moonlight, the best picture winner co-written by McCraney. A play even more likely to make headlines is James Graham\u2019s Ink, based on the early life of Rupert Murdoch. Rupert Goold, who premiered the play in 2017 at the Almeida, will again direct with Bertie Carvel as Murdoch (a male Trunchbull?) and Jonny Lee Miller as the editor Larry Lamb.</p> <p>They will be joined by Lucas Hnath\u2019s Hillary and Clinton (yes, that Hillary and that Clinton, mostly). Set in 2008 and starring John Lithgow and the ferocious Laurie Metcalf (she also starred in Hnath\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House Part 2), it finds the couple on the eve of the New Hampshire primaries. Hnath\u2019s play can be read as a prequel of our present political moment, while Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus, looks to be a follow-up to Shakespeare\u2019s Worst Roman Bake-off. It\u2019s by Taylor Mac (A 24-Decade History of Popular Music), one of the most joyful and subversive artists working today. Little is known about Gary, but it stars a trio of comedic geniuses \u2013 Nathan Lane, Andrea Martin and Kristine Nielsen \u2013 and will apparently center on a couple of lowly servants charged with mopping up the blood and offal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c90878d817b31dbda200515d7cda31d0b536434c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c90878d817b31dbda200515d7cda31d0b536434c/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Lithgow and Laurie Metcalf who will be playing the Clintons in Hillary and Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Lithgow and Laurie Metcalf who will be playing the Clintons in Hillary and Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For years Broadway has had a woman problem. While two-thirds of Broadway attendees are women, female writers, directors and composers are very much a minority. And this year, like last fall, women\u2019s stories are also somewhat rare, though there are plenty of couples narratives. In place of actual stories about women, producers have decided to gender-swap two very masculine plays, David Mamet\u2019s testosterone-driven Glengarry Glen Ross, will feature an all-female cast, under Amy Morton\u2019s direction. Following her triumph in Three Tall Women, Glenda Jackson will play another towering character, taking on the titular role in Shakespeare\u2019s bad dad tragedy King Lear. She first played the role in 2016 at the Old Vic, but this is a new production, led by Sam Gold, a director who has rarely met a classic he couldn\u2019t deconstruct.</p> <p>Other revivals include All My Sons, which recently swapped out directors after the Arthur Miller estate refused to approve its non-traditional casting, True West, starring Ethan Hawke and Paul Dano as rivalrous siblings and Burn This, with Keri Russell and Adam Driver as combustible lovers.</p> <p>As for musical revivals, there is an apparently traditional revival of Cole Porter\u2019s Kiss Me, Kate (It may brush up its Shakespeare, but will it brush up its spanking scene?) and a bracingly non-traditional Oklahoma!, directed by Daniel Fish, which refits the score for a lush bluegrass ensemble and re-examines the original\u2019s treatment of sex, violence and communal culpability.</p> <p>The 1982 Sydney Pollack film Tootsie has been converted to musical comedy, starring the wonderful Santino Fontana as an actor who mans up by wearing a dress and pantyhose. The songs are by David Yazbek of The Band\u2019s Visit. Another movie title on the lips of theater fans (just don\u2019t say it three times) is Beetlejuice. Directed by Alex Timbers, it\u2019s been adapted by Scott Brown and Anthony King, who wrote the very funny off-Broadway show Gutenberg! The Musical, with songs by Eddie Perfect, who contributed to the terrifying-in-all-the-wrong-ways King Kong. Timbers will also direct Moulin Rouge! The Musical, the ahistorical tale of a flaneur, a courtesan and quite a lot of marmalade. And receiving the jukebox treatment are the Temptations with Ain\u2019t Too Proud \u2013 The Life and Times of The Temptations. Directed by Jersey Boys\u2019 (and more regrettably Summer\u2019s) Des McAnuff, it has a book by Dominique Morisseau, who goes behind and alongside the musical.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10e93780af74e5013fd041e8857317c522cdce7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10e93780af74e5013fd041e8857317c522cdce7c/0_0_1000_666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Be More Chill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Be More Chill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Baranova</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That leaves two original musicals. Joe Iconis\u2019s Be More Chill is a rock and power-pop show about a high school zero who becomes a zeroes-and-ones hero after he swallows a supercomputer. The show had a tepid initial run a few years ago, but teenagers discovered the songs online and built a hugely dedicated and proudly unchill fan base. The other show, Ana\u00efs Mitchell\u2019s Hadestown, directed by Rachel Chavkin of Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812, has had an even longer road to Broadway. (Some of that road is literal: it started a dozen years ago as a song cycle that toured around Vermont by bus.) A folk opera riff on the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, it\u2019s about an artist who tries to change the world \u2013 or maybe just Broadway \u2013 with a song.</p>",

They will be joined by Lucas Hnath\u2019s Hillary and Clinton (yes, that Hillary and that Clinton, mostly). Set in 2008 and starring John Lithgow and the ferocious Laurie Metcalf (she also starred in Hnath\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House Part 2), it finds the couple on the eve of the New Hampshire primaries. Hnath\u2019s play can be read as a prequel of our present political moment, while Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus, looks to be a follow-up to Shakespeare\u2019s Worst Roman Bake-off. It\u2019s by Taylor Mac (A 24-Decade History of Popular Music), one of the most joyful and subversive artists working today. Little is known about Gary, but it stars a trio of comedic geniuses \u2013 Nathan Lane, Andrea Martin and Kristine Nielsen \u2013 and will apparently center on a couple of lowly servants charged with mopping up the blood and offal. For years Broadway has had a woman problem. While two-thirds of Broadway attendees are women, female writers, directors and composers are very much a minority. And this year, like last fall, women\u2019s stories are also somewhat rare, though there are plenty of couples narratives. In place of actual stories about women, producers have decided to gender-swap two very masculine plays, David Mamet\u2019s testosterone-driven Glengarry Glen Ross, will feature an all-female cast, under Amy Morton\u2019s direction. Following her triumph in Three Tall Women, Glenda Jackson will play another towering character, taking on the titular role in Shakespeare\u2019s bad dad tragedy King Lear. She first played the role in 2016 at the Old Vic, but this is a new production, led by Sam Gold, a director who has rarely met a classic he couldn\u2019t deconstruct. Other revivals include All My Sons, which recently swapped out directors after the Arthur Miller estate refused to approve its non-traditional casting, True West, starring Ethan Hawke and Paul Dano as rivalrous siblings and Burn This, with Keri Russell and Adam Driver as combustible lovers. As for musical revivals, there is an apparently traditional revival of Cole Porter\u2019s Kiss Me, Kate (It may brush up its Shakespeare, but will it brush up its spanking scene?) and a bracingly non-traditional Oklahoma!, directed by Daniel Fish, which refits the score for a lush bluegrass ensemble and re-examines the original\u2019s treatment of sex, violence and communal culpability. The 1982 Sydney Pollack film Tootsie has been converted to musical comedy, starring the wonderful Santino Fontana as an actor who mans up by wearing a dress and pantyhose. The songs are by David Yazbek of The Band\u2019s Visit. Another movie title on the lips of theater fans (just don\u2019t say it three times) is Beetlejuice. Directed by Alex Timbers, it\u2019s been adapted by Scott Brown and Anthony King, who wrote the very funny off-Broadway show Gutenberg! The Musical, with songs by Eddie Perfect, who contributed to the terrifying-in-all-the-wrong-ways King Kong. Timbers will also direct Moulin Rouge! The Musical, the ahistorical tale of a flaneur, a courtesan and quite a lot of marmalade. And receiving the jukebox treatment are the Temptations with Ain\u2019t Too Proud \u2013 The Life and Times of The Temptations. Directed by Jersey Boys\u2019 (and more regrettably Summer\u2019s) Des McAnuff, it has a book by Dominique Morisseau, who goes behind and alongside the musical. That leaves two original musicals. Joe Iconis\u2019s Be More Chill is a rock and power-pop show about a high school zero who becomes a zeroes-and-ones hero after he swallows a supercomputer. The show had a tepid initial run a few years ago, but teenagers discovered the songs online and built a hugely dedicated and proudly unchill fan base. The other show, Ana\u00efs Mitchell\u2019s Hadestown, directed by Rachel Chavkin of Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812, has had an even longer road to Broadway. (Some of that road is literal: it started a dozen years ago as a song cycle that toured around Vermont by bus.) A folk opera riff on the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, it\u2019s about an artist who tries to change the world \u2013 or maybe just Broadway \u2013 with a song.",

Safety Dave Duerson, another standout from the famed \u201885 Bears, committed suicide in 2011 and in death also was diagnosed with CTE. Before he died, Duerson noted that \u201cMike was not one who gave a damn about the players or their injuries when he was coaching.\u201d Ditka even tried to bust the union \u2013 he berated his own players for not crossing a picket line when the NFLPA went on strike in 1987 and called the scabs that played against Buddy Ryan\u2019s Eagles \u201cthe real Bears\u201d as the AFL-CIO in Philadelphia threatened a disturbance at the game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8efb5e1f89a25960feea099da43a7d5150485e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8efb5e1f89a25960feea099da43a7d5150485e79/0_0_2005_1330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Ditka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Ditka is carried off the field after the Bears\u2019 win in Super Bowl XX in January 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Sandlin/AP/PA Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his frank 1992 biography, Armen Keteyian described Ditka as a monster of a man who was a careless, absent father (\u201cI really can\u2019t picture back to one moment when we were really happy,\u2019\u2019 his son Matt is quoted as saying), a bad businessman with a trail of failed ventures, and a member of the one percent who identified as a \u201ccommon man\u201d when it suited him but when those same common men criticized his decisions, he dismissed them as \u201closers in life ... $100-a-week guys.\u201d</p> <p>The truth has always been out there. It\u2019s just that when Ditka ruled as a petty tyrant, fans and the media too often celebrated his behavior as hard-nosed toughness or excused it with a smirk and a shrug. C\u2019mon, it\u2019s just boys being boys \u2013 <em>Ditka being Ditka</em>. Fans and the media rarely soured on his antics when he was winning football games, but even when his teams failed (his record was a combined 20-44 over his last four seasons coaching the Bears and Saints), Iron Mike remained Teflon Mike when it came to maintaining his reputation as the ultimate \u201cold school\u201d coach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/30/nfl-scores-week-17\">NFL round-up: Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles sneak into playoffs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then there\u2019s his post-coaching career, which for the last two decades has mostly meant playing a caricatured version of himself for television. He\u2019s either hawking whatever product Madison Avenue throws at him \u2013 from Coors beer to Vienna Beef hot dogs to (God help us) Iron Mike \u201cmale virility supplements\u201d \u2013 or he\u2019s grunting about current players being wimps or clowns for NFL broadcasts on NBC, or espousing toxic or reactionary politics. In other words, he\u2019s a grizzled version of Trump.</p> <p>The Trump-Ditka comparison would have been even more perfect had the latter followed through with his plan to run against Barack Obama for US Senate in 2004 (he\u2019d \u201cget the Bubba vote,\u201d House majority leader Tom DeLay said at the time). Ditka eventually bowed out of the race but later claimed he could have beaten Obama and ended his political career then and there. Like many conservatives, Ditka\u2019s rhetoric has grown steadily worse. In 2016, Ditka pronounced Obama \u201cthe worst president we\u2019ve ever had\u201d and said he\u2019d vote for Trump.</p> <p>Ditka has also stumped for Illinois governor Bruce Rauner, a billionaire businessman who, like the coach-turned-pitchman and Trump, equates masculinity with a kind of peacocking performance; a pantomiming of working-class grittiness. Just as Trump cosplays like he\u2019s in the movie Top Gun while emceeing at military events or pretends to pal around with coal miners, Rauner dons flannel shirts or leather jackets and poses on Harley Davidson motorcycles \u2013 also to aim for Ditka\u2019s \u201cBubba vote\u201d. Granted, Ditka genuinely grew up modestly in Carnegie, Pennslyvania, but has spent most of his adulthood a multi-millionaire who developed a taste for expensive vintage cars and fine wines and owned an extravagant second home in Florida. He left behind his lunch pail decades ago.</p> <p>It was no surprise when Ditka echoed Trump in last year\u2019s controversy involving Colin Kaepernick and other players who took a knee during the anthem by saying he would have kicked the ex-Niners quarterback off his team. \u201cKaepernick would be an unknown \u2013 a complete unknown. He\u2019d be a complete nobody,\u201d Ditka barked. \u201cNobody would know who he was without the game of football, without the sport he\u2019s playing. Not to respect that, you have to be a pretty unintelligent person, I would think.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The real \u201cSuper Fans\u201d</strong></h2> <p>That\u2019s red meat for the Bears faithful, who are largely different than the goofy stereotype. George Wendt\u2019s Super Fan is woefully outdated. Chicago is no longer a working-class city (a greater share of adults now hold college degrees \u2013 38.5% \u2013 than in New York) and the Chi-caw-go accent is disappearing along with them. The typical hardcore Bears fan makes over $60,000 a year and can afford what consumer advice company <a href=\"https://www.valuepenguin.com/how-many-hours-you-need-work-afford-nfl-game\">ValuePenguin</a> rated as the least affordable ticket in the NFL last year. A Sunday gameday for three people, to pay for tickets, parking, and some food and drink, adds up to $483. An average Chicagoan would need to work 16\u00bd hours just to cover the cost.</p> <p>Those blue-collar guys with the thick white ethnic Chicago accent? They might be watching the game on TV, but these days Soldier Field is a haven for the NFL\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.marketresearchworld.net/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1113&amp;pop=1&amp;page=0&amp;Itemid=48\">prime demographic</a>: well-off aging suburban men who tend to vote Republican. In other words, Trump voters. Here in the overwhelmingly blue city of Chicago (83.7% of voters went with Hillary Clinton in 2016), Soldier Field feels like a bubble of deep red on game day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/31/the-eagles-are-playoff-bound-the-steelers-arent\">Eagles soar into playoffs as Steelers chances vanish in a single throw | Hunter Felt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I noticed plenty of fans this season who bedeck themselves with Ditka costumes or the team\u2019s wishbone \u201cC\u201d logo but they\u2019re increasingly worn on camouflage versions of Bears gear, like say, an olive-green military-themed Trubisky jersey (the Bears have an <a href=\"https://www.nflshop.com/chicago-bears/veterans-day/t-25488025+c-07458821+z-974-1713478163\">entire web page</a> devoted to veterans-themed team merch). Likewise, it\u2019s hard to miss all the SUVs or trucks parked at tailgates decked out with pro-Trump or conservative slogans. I\u2019ve met angry men at Soldier Field who hate leftists more than the Packers.</p> <p>\u201cNo one took a knee for our beautiful National Anthem today at the Chicago Bears game!\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RodStryker/status/1061731932361424897\">tweeted</a> someone purporting to be an Indiana man named Rod Stryker who posted a Ditka-like (or Trumpian) rant from the stands of the Bears\u2019 11 November home game against the Lions. \u201cIt would really take a commie loser scum bag like Krapernick to disrespect the Flag &amp; Military on Veterans Day at Soldier Field. Notice the stadium is packed with PATRIOTS who love America.\u201d</p> <p>There were plenty of reasons why Stryker, whose puckish avatar is a photoshopped image of Alexander Hamilton in a Maga hat, might feel right at home. That boycott of the NFL that conservatives loudly supported on social media last year after Trump encouraged them to do so in response to the anthem controversy? Instead of staying away from each other, If anything conservatives and the NFL appear to be engaged in a season-long recommitment ceremony to each other. If you\u2019re a right-wing Bears fan, you really can go home again \u2013 especially if you never really left.</p> <p>A kind of authoritarian conservatism has always hummed in the background of the NFL experience, but in 2018 we can see how it\u2019s curdled to the point where we get Trump as president and Ditka as his patron saint \u2013 all cheered on by today\u2019s real-life Super Fans, a demographic disproportionately made up of aggrieved right-wing culture warriors who want to make the NFL and America great again by yelling at black players who don\u2019t stand for the national anthem.</p> <p>The truth is: it\u2019s kind of hard to rewatch those Super Fan skits these days and listen to the worship for the \u201cDa Coach\u201d and \u201cDa Bearsss\u201d. It now sounds too much like an unquestioning, \u201cpost-truth\u201d devotion to a dictator-like leader\u2013no matter if they\u2019re the kind who favors sweater vests and steakhouses or expensive suits and skyscrapers.</p>",

Before he died, Duerson noted that \u201cMike was not one who gave a damn about the players or their injuries when he was coaching.\u201d Ditka even tried to bust the union \u2013 he berated his own players for not crossing a picket line when the NFLPA went on strike in 1987 and called the scabs that played against Buddy Ryan\u2019s Eagles \u201cthe real Bears\u201d as the AFL-CIO in Philadelphia threatened a disturbance at the game. In his frank 1992 biography, Armen Keteyian described Ditka as a monster of a man who was a careless, absent father (\u201cI really can\u2019t picture back to one moment when we were really happy,\u2019\u2019 his son Matt is quoted as saying), a bad businessman with a trail of failed ventures, and a member of the one percent who identified as a \u201ccommon man\u201d when it suited him but when those same common men criticized his decisions, he dismissed them as \u201closers in life ... $100-a-week guys.\u201d The truth has always been out there. It\u2019s just that when Ditka ruled as a petty tyrant, fans and the media too often celebrated his behavior as hard-nosed toughness or excused it with a smirk and a shrug. C\u2019mon, it\u2019s just boys being boys \u2013 Ditka being Ditka. Fans and the media rarely soured on his antics when he was winning football games, but even when his teams failed (his record was a combined 20-44 over his last four seasons coaching the Bears and Saints), Iron Mike remained Teflon Mike when it came to maintaining his reputation as the ultimate \u201cold school\u201d coach. And then there\u2019s his post-coaching career, which for the last two decades has mostly meant playing a caricatured version of himself for television. He\u2019s either hawking whatever product Madison Avenue throws at him \u2013 from Coors beer to Vienna Beef hot dogs to (God help us) Iron Mike \u201cmale virility supplements\u201d \u2013 or he\u2019s grunting about current players being wimps or clowns for NFL broadcasts on NBC, or espousing toxic or reactionary politics. In other words, he\u2019s a grizzled version of Trump. The Trump-Ditka comparison would have been even more perfect had the latter followed through with his plan to run against Barack Obama for US Senate in 2004 (he\u2019d \u201cget the Bubba vote,\u201d House majority leader Tom DeLay said at the time). Ditka eventually bowed out of the race but later claimed he could have beaten Obama and ended his political career then and there. Like many conservatives, Ditka\u2019s rhetoric has grown steadily worse. In 2016, Ditka pronounced Obama \u201cthe worst president we\u2019ve ever had\u201d and said he\u2019d vote for Trump. Ditka has also stumped for Illinois governor Bruce Rauner, a billionaire businessman who, like the coach-turned-pitchman and Trump, equates masculinity with a kind of peacocking performance; a pantomiming of working-class grittiness. Just as Trump cosplays like he\u2019s in the movie Top Gun while emceeing at military events or pretends to pal around with coal miners, Rauner dons flannel shirts or leather jackets and poses on Harley Davidson motorcycles \u2013 also to aim for Ditka\u2019s \u201cBubba vote\u201d. Granted, Ditka genuinely grew up modestly in Carnegie, Pennslyvania, but has spent most of his adulthood a multi-millionaire who developed a taste for expensive vintage cars and fine wines and owned an extravagant second home in Florida. He left behind his lunch pail decades ago. It was no surprise when Ditka echoed Trump in last year\u2019s controversy involving Colin Kaepernick and other players who took a knee during the anthem by saying he would have kicked the ex-Niners quarterback off his team. \u201cKaepernick would be an unknown \u2013 a complete unknown. He\u2019d be a complete nobody,\u201d Ditka barked. \u201cNobody would know who he was without the game of football, without the sport he\u2019s playing. Not to respect that, you have to be a pretty unintelligent person, I would think.\u201d The real \u201cSuper Fans\u201d That\u2019s red meat for the Bears faithful, who are largely different than the goofy stereotype. George Wendt\u2019s Super Fan is woefully outdated. Chicago is no longer a working-class city (a greater share of adults now hold college degrees \u2013 38.5% \u2013 than in New York) and the Chi-caw-go accent is disappearing along with them. The typical hardcore Bears fan makes over $60,000 a year and can afford what consumer advice company ValuePenguin rated as the least affordable ticket in the NFL last year. A Sunday gameday for three people, to pay for tickets, parking, and some food and drink, adds up to $483. An average Chicagoan would need to work 16\u00bd hours just to cover the cost. Those blue-collar guys with the thick white ethnic Chicago accent? They might be watching the game on TV, but these days Soldier Field is a haven for the NFL\u2019s prime demographic: well-off aging suburban men who tend to vote Republican. In other words, Trump voters. Here in the overwhelmingly blue city of Chicago (83.7% of voters went with Hillary Clinton in 2016), Soldier Field feels like a bubble of deep red on game day. I noticed plenty of fans this season who bedeck themselves with Ditka costumes or the team\u2019s wishbone \u201cC\u201d logo but they\u2019re increasingly worn on camouflage versions of Bears gear, like say, an olive-green military-themed Trubisky jersey (the Bears have an entire web page devoted to veterans-themed team merch). Likewise, it\u2019s hard to miss all the SUVs or trucks parked at tailgates decked out with pro-Trump or conservative slogans. I\u2019ve met angry men at Soldier Field who hate leftists more than the Packers. \u201cNo one took a knee for our beautiful National Anthem today at the Chicago Bears game!\u201d tweeted someone purporting to be an Indiana man named Rod Stryker who posted a Ditka-like (or Trumpian) rant from the stands of the Bears\u2019 11 November home game against the Lions. \u201cIt would really take a commie loser scum bag like Krapernick to disrespect the Flag &amp; Military on Veterans Day at Soldier Field. Notice the stadium is packed with PATRIOTS who love America.\u201d There were plenty of reasons why Stryker, whose puckish avatar is a photoshopped image of Alexander Hamilton in a Maga hat, might feel right at home. That boycott of the NFL that conservatives loudly supported on social media last year after Trump encouraged them to do so in response to the anthem controversy? Instead of staying away from each other, If anything conservatives and the NFL appear to be engaged in a season-long recommitment ceremony to each other. If you\u2019re a right-wing Bears fan, you really can go home again \u2013 especially if you never really left. A kind of authoritarian conservatism has always hummed in the background of the NFL experience, but in 2018 we can see how it\u2019s curdled to the point where we get Trump as president and Ditka as his patron saint \u2013 all cheered on by today\u2019s real-life Super Fans, a demographic disproportionately made up of aggrieved right-wing culture warriors who want to make the NFL and America great again by yelling at black players who don\u2019t stand for the national anthem. The truth is: it\u2019s kind of hard to rewatch those Super Fan skits these days and listen to the worship for the \u201cDa Coach\u201d and \u201cDa Bearsss\u201d. It now sounds too much like an unquestioning, \u201cpost-truth\u201d devotion to a dictator-like leader\u2013no matter if they\u2019re the kind who favors sweater vests and steakhouses or expensive suits and skyscrapers.",

The trial of the alleged Sinaloa cartel chief Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 which resumes on Thursday \u2013 has been no exception. The proceedings have offered extraordinary detail of the workings of a Mexican cartel, but have been hallmarked by what is unseen \u2013 and kept that way by Judge Brian Cogan. Day-to-day testimony has been like a Netflix thriller, yet it has obscured the nexus of top-level corruption the world\u2019s biggest criminal organisation operated north and south of the US border. The detail from cartel \u201csnitches\u201d testifying for the prosecution against their old boss or partner has been riveting. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s first employee, pilot Miguel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez, described a trip with Guzm\u00e1n to Japan, Thailand and Macau, and a visit they made to Los Angeles to spend $6m on planes before a gambling spree in Las Vegas. Guzm\u00e1n went to Switzerland, he said, for cellular anti-ageing treatment. Guzm\u00e1n ran a private zoo, and distributed bonus diamond-studded Rolexes and fancy cars to favourite underlings. Cocaine was smuggled to the US in what looked like cans of jalape\u00f1o peppers. Even Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 usually pensive \u2013 laughed when his lawyer William Purpura, picked up one of the cans entered in evidence, and told the court: \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to hold this one.\u201d The former chief of Colombia\u2019s Norte del Valle cartel, Juan Carlos Ram\u00edrez Abad\u00eda \u2013 alias La Chupeta, the Lollipop \u2013 gave enthralling evidence about one of the most important partnerships in narco-trafficking history, after Guzm\u00e1n impressed the Colombian with his insistence on only the best-quality product, speed of delivery \u2013 and his demand for an extra percentage. Ram\u00edrez, his face disfigured by plastic surgery, boasted about the 400,000 kilos of cocaine he had moved, and 150 executions he had ordered \u2013 including a family in New Jersey. His testimony also traced Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s takeover of Colombian distribution networks in the US while Ram\u00edrez did a short stretch in jail. Another Colombian narco, Jorge Cifuentes, testified to having furnished rightwing Colombian paramilitaries with 5,000 AK-47 assault rifles with which to fight leftwing Farc guerrillas, but then arranging a cocaine deal between Guzm\u00e1n and the Farc. The first we heard of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s voice was on a wiretap, expertly haggling with the comrades. The narco witnesses have offered detailed, sometimes darkly funny testimony; they are proud of what they did. Asked at one point about the killing of two female Colombian police agents, Chupeta gave a thumbs-up. His only apparent remorse was at the loss of two loads to US authorities. The star turn was the Sinaloa cartel accountant Jes\u00fas Zambada Garc\u00eda (brother of the drug lord who probably betrayed Guzm\u00e1n and now leads the cartel, Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada), who testified with cool aplomb about his \u201cinvestors\u201d, \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201creturns\u201d. In his coverage of the trial, David Brooks of the Mexican daily La Jornada wrote: \u201cChapo Guzm\u00e1n was one of the successful impresarios of a Mexican neoliberal model, heading a transnational commercial and financial operation dedicated to satisfying an insatiable demand in the US, generating hundreds of millions of dollars monthly for Mexico.\u201d But Guzm\u00e1n must go down as a big-catch criminal, and that is where the riptides beneath the surface matter. Italian mafia parlance calls it \u201cdietrologia\u201d \u2013 \u201cbehindology\u201d, the science of what lies behind appearances. And what lies behind the Chapo trial comprises the corruption of the Mexican state, what became of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s money, the role of the turncoat witnesses \u2013 and that of the US government in running and recruiting them. Zambada Garc\u00eda admitted bribing airport authorities, federal police and even Interpol, and said the cartel\u2019s man in government, Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna, was paid one instalment of $3m while head of the federal investigation agency, then another after being appointed minister for public security. Similar allegations against Garc\u00eda Luna had previously been made in Mexico, including in two books by the journalist Anabel Hern\u00e1ndez. In a statement to Mexican media, Garc\u00eda Luna denied the allegation, which he described as \u201ca lie, defamation and perjury\u201d. But Zambada Garc\u00eda also alleged that Garc\u00eda Luna was paid $56m by Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s affiliates the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva brothers, one of whom, H\u00e9ctor, was responsible for paying off politicians. H\u00e9ctor Beltr\u00e1n Leyva died in a Mexican jail the night before Zambada Garc\u00eda\u2019s testimony. According to discussion during a sidebar between counsel and the judge, Zambada planned to go one better and elaborate on a $6m payment to an \u201cincumbent\u201d Mexican president. He was stopped from doing so by a prosecutors\u2019 motion, upheld by Judge Cogan, \u201cprotecting individuals and entities who are not parties to this case and who would face embarrassment\u201d, he said. The trial chamber \u2013 and the Mexican people \u2013 cannot, then, know which president was allegedly paid by Guzm\u00e1n, and for what. A subsequent sidebar discussed the contents of a prosecution memorandum submitted under seal; the transcript of the sidebar was then itself sealed. When John Gotti \u2013 head of the Gambino mafia clan \u2013 went on trial in this same New York courthouse in 1992, it took just one \u201ccooperating witness\u201d to convict him. In Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s trial, Mexican narcos are lining up to testify: six so far, and as many as 10 more to follow. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman calls them \u201cdegenerates\u201d who will say anything to get sentences commuted. During the first week of the Guzm\u00e1n trial, on 9 November, Vicente Zambada Nieblo \u2013 \u201cEl Vicentillo\u201d \u2013 pleaded guilty in Chicago to overseeing logistics for the Sinaloa cartel and trafficking vast quantities of cocaine and heroin through that city. Vicentillo is El Mayo\u2019s son, and the accountant\u2019s nephew. His 19-page plea was entered suddenly, a year after Vicentillo had agreed with US authorities to cooperate \u201cin any matter\u201d \u2013 making him conveniently available to testify against Guzm\u00e1n in New York. Vicentillo does not contest a staggering $1.3bn forfeiture. But Zambada Nieblo is more than just a turncoat: a year-long investigation by the Mexican newspaper El Universal, published in October 2017, established definitively that Vicentillo had worked for the DEA while conducting his duties for the cartel. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers may not get to pursue these relationships, which complicate the usual narrative of good, honest DEA detective work, even though an addendum to a Department of Justice audit of the agency, published in March 2017, voiced \u201cspecific concerns about how the DEA used and paid confidential sources\u201d, with \u201cpotential implications for national security\u201d. Also excluded was an attempt by the defence to ask prosecution witnesses about \u201cOperation Fast and Furious\u201d, a project run by the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to allow weapons to enter Mexico illegally, through cooperating straw-buyers, in hopes of catching their final recipients. Of the 2,000 guns allowed to \u201cwalk\u201d between 2007 and 2011, only 665 were recovered, one of them in Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s\u2019s lair in 2014 \u2013 but none of this can feature at trial. The evidence about money has been detailed when it is \u201cback in Mexico\u201d, but coy when it moves beyond there. Mart\u00ednez flew planes loaded with cash \u2013 between $8m and $10m from Tijuana three times a month \u2013 and hauled a Samsonite case filled with $10m to \u201ca Mexico City bank\u201d monthly. Cash deposits are described hidden beneath beds and even underwater. But there the money-trail ends, though the US Senate\u2019s and Department of Justice\u2019s own investigations have established that hundreds of millions proceeded through the Wachovia and HSBC banks north of the border \u2013 these play no part in evidence hitherto. So the Guzm\u00e1n trial, as the US government and Judge Cogan conduct it, follows the focused \u201ckingpin\u201d strategy, which supposes that once a cartel leader is taken down, the war on drugs is being won. Yet more cocaine is leaving Colombia than ever, and last year was Mexico\u2019s most violent since this phase of the drug wars began. As his trial resumes next week, Guzm\u00e1n is old news back in Mexico: initiative is with the rising Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n and its leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, \u201cEl Mencho\u201d. One day, El Chapo himself might testify against El Mencho \u2013 if he ever gets caught; that may be Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s only chance of seeing his seven-year-old twin daughters as a free man.",

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola has admitted he does not know if Manchester City can handle the pressure of hunting down -Liverpool as J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side prepare to face another \u201cthunderstorm\u201d at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday. If City can overcome the leaders they will close the gap to four points but they have failed to beat Liverpool in their last four meetings and face opponents who have dropped only six points this season. But while Klopp has warned his players to expect \u201can intense game\u201d against a side he considers to be the best in Europe \u2013 despite three defeats in their last five league matches \u2013 Guardiola was asked if his players can live with the demand of trying to chase them. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cWhat do I think? Yes, we are ready. I don\u2019t have doubts but honestly I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the same as when we had 10 or 11 points [ahead last season], if you asked me if we would maintain that distance for a long time, I don\u2019t know. I have a game in my mind, I have what we want to do. I will speak with the players. That is what I feel but I am not good enough to anticipate what is going to happen.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is different pressure and we have to live it. We have to handle it. Maybe people expected we would always be top but we are -Manchester City, we are not Liverpool or Manchester United. We are Man City \u2013 it is quite usual in the history [to be behind]. That is why it is nice after what we have achieved in the last decade to still be up there.\u201d Liverpool were thrashed 5-0 in the corresponding match last season but followed up a 4-3 win at Anfield, with victory in both legs of the -Champions League quarter-final, winning 2-1 at the Etihad after Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s goal was disallowed for offside with City leading 1-0. Liverpool won 5-1 on aggregate. Klopp believes his players should be ready to face another battle as they attempt to extend a winning record against Guardiola that has seen the German emerge victorious in seven of their 17 meetings. \u201cI think we should. It will be a very intense game. That is how it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a thunderstorm. They said before the [second-leg] game they could do it from 3-0 down, and everyone knew they could. We knew it as well. We were a bit lucky, we know that, because they scored a second goal that the referee disallowed. Then we started controlling things a bit more towards the end of the first half. That can be the situation again, can be, but on the other side we are a different team as well. I don\u2019t want it to sound like a threat because it\u2019s not, it is just the situation. We have improved since last year, as we had to, but still this is the most difficult game to play because of their quality, the variations they are able to do and the different formations they can play. That makes it really special in the preparation.\u201d Victory for Liverpool would open up their lead over City to 10 points and Guardiola insisted tonight\u2019s meeting is \u201calmost a final\u201d for his side. He said: \u201cWe know how important it is. If we are not able to win, especially if we lose \u2013 10 points, goal difference 11 \u2013 if they continue that run it will be so difficult. It\u2019s almost a final for us. For them nothing changes [if they lose]. We have to face it like a football game and what we have to do to beat them. We know our strong points, what we are, and what we have to do.\u201d",

      "body": "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a Moto 3 smartphone and my wife has a similar earlier model. We are right on the edge of reception from EE. I can just get a very weak signal if I attach my phone to a selfie stick and lean out of a window, or walk up the bank behind the house. This is not ideal.</p> <p>Away from home, sometimes my wife\u2019s phone can get a strong signal whereas mine can\u2019t get a signal at all. This made me wonder if there was a measurement to assess how good a mobile phone is at receiving signals in areas of poor reception before you buy it \u2026 and if there is an easy way for an ordinary punter to understand it. <strong>Paul</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Phone manufacturers and others can and do test their phones, usually for certification purposes. The performance test results you want, if you can get them, are the Total Isotropic Sensitivity (TIS) value for reception and the Total Radiated Power (TRP) for transmission.</p> <p>These probably don\u2019t qualify as easy for an ordinary punter to understand. Also, they are derived by testing performance in ideal conditions with a simulated base station in an anechoic chamber, not with a fading signal on a wet and windy hillside.</p> <p>Either way, I don\u2019t think phone manufacturers are likely to use TIS in their marketing. There are too many variables for it to be a reliable guide to real-world reception. For example, studies have found significant differences between holding a phone in the left hand and holding it in the right hand, which I assume is connected with the way manufacturers position their antenna(s). The size of your hands and the angle at which you hold the phone also make a difference.</p> <p>The tests were created by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTIA_(organization)\">CTIA</a> \u2013 originally the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association \u2013 to certify wireless devices\u2019 over-the-air performance, and a brief glance at the <a href=\"https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ctia-test-plan-for-wireless-device-over-the-air-performance-ver-3-7-1.pdf\">591-page PDF</a> will show how complicated it is. For example, you could measure peak performance with a directional aerial, but then users would have to orient the phone towards the unseen transmitter for the best results. Instead, the CTIA requires the \u201caverage spherical effective radiated receiver sensitivity (TIS) to be measured\u201d. This should mean a phone works equally well in all directions, but it\u2019s complicated to calculate and still a compromise.</p> <p>Another problem is making antennas work with different 2G, 3G and 4G phone networks that operate at different frequencies. A phone that works well with GSM 900 might be terrible with UMTS 2100. The downside of having a phone that talks to most networks is that it won\u2019t be optimised for the one you actually use.</p> <p>Also, because human bodies have not been standardised, TIS and TRP measurements are made with dummy heads and hands filled with liquid. Results may vary if you use real people.</p> <p>In the end, the only measurements that matter are the ones you get with your head and hands with the specific frequencies used by your EE network. We are left with \u201cask a friend\u201d and the not-very-helpful \u201ctry it and see\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Just testing\u2026</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eadb517d6bf1e2af29ec019e49a0ceac8acb1300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eadb517d6bf1e2af29ec019e49a0ceac8acb1300/567_192_3365_2020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some dual-sim smartphones and non-smartphones can take two sim cards at once allowing two different mobile phone networks to be used simultaneously.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some dual-sim smartphones and non-smartphones can take two sim cards at once allowing two different mobile phone networks to be used simultaneously.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I couldn\u2019t find much public research into mobile phone reception with commercial phones, presumably because of some of the problems mentioned above. Professor Gert Fr\u00f8lund Pedersen tested nine phones in Denmark in 2012 (<a href=\"http://kom.aau.dk/~gfp/SmartphonesAntenneKvalitet2013.pdf\">PDF</a>), while in the UK, Ofcom used the CTIA test to check 10 off-the-shelf phones in 2016 (<a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/72231/mobile_handset_testing_1v01.pdf\">PDF</a>).</p> <p>Ofcom withheld the names of the phones it tested because there weren\u2019t enough samples to show statistically significant differences \u2013 it tested three of each device \u2013 and because \u201cno handset outperformed the others across different frequency bands and technologies\u201d. Knowing the names would therefore not help consumers.</p> <p>However, Ofcom did point out that the non-smartphones outperformed the smartphones, and that \u201csome of the smartphones tested required over 10x (10dB) more power than the best performing non-smartphone\u201d.</p> <p>You could always buy a cheap Nokia for making voice calls.</p> <p>Last year, Ireland\u2019s ComReg (Commission for Communications Regulation) tested 71 mobile phones that were available on the Irish market in June 2017. The aim was to \u201cquantify the minimum signal level(s) required to make or receive a mobile call and to stream data\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.stelladoradus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ComReg1805.pdf\">PDF</a>).</p> <p>ComReg names names and gives results, but only for TRP (active transmission) not TIS (reception). It doesn\u2019t explain why. The CTIA test recommends that TRP and TIS are tested concurrently, because a phone\u2019s internal components (processor, memory and so on) generate electrical noise that affects reception.</p> <p>StellaDoradus has published <a href=\"https://www.stelladoradus.com/which-mobile-phone-has-the-best-reception/\">a table of the results</a>, which includes some strikingly low numbers for some popular phones. I wouldn\u2019t use it as the sole basis for a purchasing decision.</p> <h2><strong>Sample variations</strong></h2> <p>Most tests assume that all models of a particular phone will perform in the same way, but Ofcom found differences. As with other products, phones that look identical can vary. In some cases, they may have been assembled in different countries, and use slightly different components. In others, the circuitry may have been revised between editions. Even if the internal components seem to be the same, there could be some sample variation, without a phone actually being faulty.</p> <p>This makes me wonder if your Moto 3 is below average in reception performance. In most cases, no one would ever know, but you are literally an \u201cedge case\u201d. With a new phone, it might be worth asking the supplier for a different sample, but it may be too late for that.</p> <h2><strong>Hands off</strong></h2> <p>It would be interesting to know what would happen if you swapped phones and sims with your wife. You may have a bigger capacitance than your wife, electronically speaking, and possibly much bigger hands. Both can and do affect reception. If your Moto 3 works better in her hands, then either you or your sim are degrading the performance. It might be worth getting a new sim.</p> <p>As you already know, using your phone on a selfie stick can improve performance.

      "bodyText": "I have a Moto 3 smartphone and my wife has a similar earlier model. We are right on the edge of reception from EE. I can just get a very weak signal if I attach my phone to a selfie stick and lean out of a window, or walk up the bank behind the house. This is not ideal. Away from home, sometimes my wife\u2019s phone can get a strong signal whereas mine can\u2019t get a signal at all. This made me wonder if there was a measurement to assess how good a mobile phone is at receiving signals in areas of poor reception before you buy it \u2026 and if there is an easy way for an ordinary punter to understand it. Paul Phone manufacturers and others can and do test their phones, usually for certification purposes. The performance test results you want, if you can get them, are the Total Isotropic Sensitivity (TIS) value for reception and the Total Radiated Power (TRP) for transmission. These probably don\u2019t qualify as easy for an ordinary punter to understand. Also, they are derived by testing performance in ideal conditions with a simulated base station in an anechoic chamber, not with a fading signal on a wet and windy hillside. Either way, I don\u2019t think phone manufacturers are likely to use TIS in their marketing. There are too many variables for it to be a reliable guide to real-world reception. For example, studies have found significant differences between holding a phone in the left hand and holding it in the right hand, which I assume is connected with the way manufacturers position their antenna(s). The size of your hands and the angle at which you hold the phone also make a difference. The tests were created by the CTIA \u2013 originally the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association \u2013 to certify wireless devices\u2019 over-the-air performance, and a brief glance at the 591-page PDF will show how complicated it is. For example, you could measure peak performance with a directional aerial, but then users would have to orient the phone towards the unseen transmitter for the best results. Instead, the CTIA requires the \u201caverage spherical effective radiated receiver sensitivity (TIS) to be measured\u201d. This should mean a phone works equally well in all directions, but it\u2019s complicated to calculate and still a compromise. Another problem is making antennas work with different 2G, 3G and 4G phone networks that operate at different frequencies. A phone that works well with GSM 900 might be terrible with UMTS 2100. The downside of having a phone that talks to most networks is that it won\u2019t be optimised for the one you actually use. Also, because human bodies have not been standardised, TIS and TRP measurements are made with dummy heads and hands filled with liquid. Results may vary if you use real people. In the end, the only measurements that matter are the ones you get with your head and hands with the specific frequencies used by your EE network. We are left with \u201cask a friend\u201d and the not-very-helpful \u201ctry it and see\u201d. Just testing\u2026 I couldn\u2019t find much public research into mobile phone reception with commercial phones, presumably because of some of the problems mentioned above. Professor Gert Fr\u00f8lund Pedersen tested nine phones in Denmark in 2012 (PDF), while in the UK, Ofcom used the CTIA test to check 10 off-the-shelf phones in 2016 (PDF). Ofcom withheld the names of the phones it tested because there weren\u2019t enough samples to show statistically significant differences \u2013 it tested three of each device \u2013 and because \u201cno handset outperformed the others across different frequency bands and technologies\u201d. Knowing the names would therefore not help consumers. However, Ofcom did point out that the non-smartphones outperformed the smartphones, and that \u201csome of the smartphones tested required over 10x (10dB) more power than the best performing non-smartphone\u201d. You could always buy a cheap Nokia for making voice calls. Last year, Ireland\u2019s ComReg (Commission for Communications Regulation) tested 71 mobile phones that were available on the Irish market in June 2017. The aim was to \u201cquantify the minimum signal level(s) required to make or receive a mobile call and to stream data\u201d (PDF). ComReg names names and gives results, but only for TRP (active transmission) not TIS (reception). It doesn\u2019t explain why. The CTIA test recommends that TRP and TIS are tested concurrently, because a phone\u2019s internal components (processor, memory and so on) generate electrical noise that affects reception. StellaDoradus has published a table of the results, which includes some strikingly low numbers for some popular phones. I wouldn\u2019t use it as the sole basis for a purchasing decision. Sample variations Most tests assume that all models of a particular phone will perform in the same way, but Ofcom found differences. As with other products, phones that look identical can vary. In some cases, they may have been assembled in different countries, and use slightly different components. In others, the circuitry may have been revised between editions. Even if the internal components seem to be the same, there could be some sample variation, without a phone actually being faulty. This makes me wonder if your Moto 3 is below average in reception performance. In most cases, no one would ever know, but you are literally an \u201cedge case\u201d. With a new phone, it might be worth asking the supplier for a different sample, but it may be too late for that. Hands off It would be interesting to know what would happen if you swapped phones and sims with your wife. You may have a bigger capacitance than your wife, electronically speaking, and possibly much bigger hands. Both can and do affect reception. If your Moto 3 works better in her hands, then either you or your sim are degrading the performance. It might be worth getting a new sim. As you already know, using your phone on a selfie stick can improve performance. You may also get better reception by not touching the phone and using the built-in speakerphone. You could also try using a signal booster or repeater. These used to be illegal, but on 12 April last year, Ofcom approved the use of some models in homes and road vehicles \u201cbut not in boats or static caravans\u201d. However, check carefully because illegal signal boosters are still available. Signal Box, or switch Otherwise, your best bet might be an EE Signal Box \u2013 which converts any broadband service into a local 3G mobile phone network \u2013 if you can get one. EE doesn\u2019t list them for sale on its consumer website, though you might still be able to persuade a customer service agent to sell or even give you one. EE does promote the Signal Box to business users, and you can buy them second hand on eBay. Alternatively, switch to Vodafone. Not only does this provide a better signal in your area, it will happily sell you its own femtocell, the Vodafone Sure Signal V3, for a very reasonable \u00a369.

Showcasing artworks made over the past 20 years, the exhibit touches upon time travel, Indigenous futurisms, aliens and constellations. \u201cBoth technology and art continue to reshape our understandings of the world we live in,\u201d said Hitomi Iwasaki, the curator at the Queens Museum. \u201cScience fiction further reimagines the difficulties that exist in this world and provides alternative possibilities \u2013 even the resilience of humanity can be found here in the crossroad of art and science fiction.\u201d",

Niemeyer came to Lebanon in 1962 and spent a month in Tripoli. \u201cHe was terrified of flying and travelled by boat,\u201d says Nazih Taleb, whose consultancy developed the technical drawings and construction plans for the fairground. As well as the existing buildings, the preliminary sketches included a playground, a bowling alley, housing and shops.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Niemeyer\u2019s designs for the Tripoli fair were modelled on Bras\u00edlia, but he also experimented with new structures</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Niemeyer, who designed some of the 20th century\u2019s most iconic modernist buildings, is best known for his work on Bras\u00edlia, a futuristic planned city built in the 1950s to serve as Brazil\u2019s new capital. The <a href=\"https://www.pritzkerprize.com/laureates/1988-niemeyer\">Pritzker prize-winning</a> architect, a communist, sought exile in Paris during Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, and designed the French Communist party\u2019s headquarters. A defining feature of Niemeyer\u2019s architecture was his use of curves on reinforced concrete, inspired, he said, by the female figure. But towards the end of his career, modernist development projects such as Bras\u00edlia were criticised as examples of utopian over-planning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"257d4783c67b231fdee2d6b11f967e2fc3e66bc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/257d4783c67b231fdee2d6b11f967e2fc3e66bc2/0_190_4704_2822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The fair\u2019s amphitheatre and arch.

Taleb says: \u201cThe curved structures were technically complex to build, and Niemeyer insisted that we maintained the exact curvature of his original drawings.\u201d</p> <p>The location chosen for the fairground was an area of orange orchards south of Tripoli. Odette Sawaya, whose house in the 60s stood at the edge of the city, then known for its fragrant orange blossoms, recalls a visit from ministers involved in mapping the fairground: \u201cWe went out on to the balcony so they could assess the grounds. All you could see were the orchards and the sea.\u201d The scent of orange blossoms has been lost due to extensive urban development of the city, and today Sawaya\u2019s balcony overlooks a multi-storey concrete apartment block.</p> <p>Bras\u00edlia was built in under four years, but the fair \u2013 mired in issues over land appropriation, construction mistakes and inflating costs \u2013 took more than a decade. Niemeyer expressed his concerns about the delays in a letter to the Lebanese government in the early 70s. After the country\u2019s descent into civil war Syrian forces occupied the complex until the late 90s. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"84666cc47d2b5d7047c38f3ab3f83856fa9c5e4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84666cc47d2b5d7047c38f3ab3f83856fa9c5e4a/79_291_3225_1935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An old postcard of Tripoli\u2019s orange orchards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An old postcard of Tripoli\u2019s orange orchards, part of which were used for the fairground</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Private collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"97839bb566d1ed3ca83694948dcda91b0445bb57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97839bb566d1ed3ca83694948dcda91b0445bb57/27_91_1226_736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tripoli Fair general manager Amado Chalhoub inspects construction progress, circa 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amado Chalhoub, Tripoli Fair general manager, inspects construction progress in about 1967</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wassim Naghi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Left: an old postcard of Tripoli\u2019s orange orchards, part of which were used for the international fair site.

A Chinese company\u2019s proposal to lease the site and turn it into a trade fair for Chinese products in the Middle East was dropped in 2007 due to security concerns. That year, the Lebanese army entered into a three-month conflict with Islamist groups living in the nearby Nahr el-Bared refugee camp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/03/syria-street-tripoli-lebanon-love-war-theatre-keeps-peace\">Love and war in Lebanon: how theatre is turning rival fighters into friends</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ongoing violence between the suburbs of Bab al-Tebbaneh and Jabal Mohsen was compounded by the fallout from the war in neighbouring Syria.

Since June, two contemporary art exhibitions organised by local and internationally based organisations have taken place in the site\u2019s buildings.</p> <p>The newly created Tripoli special economic zone has secured a lease on part of the fair\u2019s undeveloped grounds to build a tech hub and will launch an international tender for proposals for the development.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt could collapse at any time,\u201d says the architect and activist Wassim Naghi. The facade of the unfinished, subterranean space museum in Tripoli, Lebanon, is visibly decaying and its steel reinforcements are rusted \u2013 but that may not be its biggest problem. \u201cThe ageing concrete\u2019s carbonation is invisible,\u201d explains Naghi when we meet in his office in the centre of the city. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how bad it really is.\u201d Situated beneath an elevated concrete helipad, the museum was part of a planned permanent international fair designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer in the early 1960s that was expected to accommodate more than 2 million visitors a year. The 100-hectare (250-acre) site\u2019s 15 existing buildings also include a domed theatre, an atrium, an arch and collective housing. A 717-metre-long boomerang-shaped canopy was designed to house the permanent exhibition, alongside a separate, traditionally styled pavilion for exhibitions relating to Lebanon. But the country\u2019s 15-year civil war halted the project in the mid-1970s and today, the abandoned fairground stands empty save for joggers, dog walkers and occasional tourists. Some of the highlights of Niemeyer\u2019s expo site including the Lebanese pavilion, bottom left. Photographs: Chantale Fahmi/Walid Rashid Photography/Alamy Decades of neglect have endangered the fair\u2019s structures and Naghi is leading the campaign for its restoration. In 2016 the basement ceiling of its atrium collapsed, in part due to mistakes made in the initial construction of the building. The fairground, a major urban development project for the city, was part of a decentralisation policy adopted by then-president Fouad Chehab. Niemeyer came to Lebanon in 1962 and spent a month in Tripoli. \u201cHe was terrified of flying and travelled by boat,\u201d says Nazih Taleb, whose consultancy developed the technical drawings and construction plans for the fairground. As well as the existing buildings, the preliminary sketches included a playground, a bowling alley, housing and shops. Niemeyer, who designed some of the 20th century\u2019s most iconic modernist buildings, is best known for his work on Bras\u00edlia, a futuristic planned city built in the 1950s to serve as Brazil\u2019s new capital. The Pritzker prize-winning architect, a communist, sought exile in Paris during Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, and designed the French Communist party\u2019s headquarters. A defining feature of Niemeyer\u2019s architecture was his use of curves on reinforced concrete, inspired, he said, by the female figure. But towards the end of his career, modernist development projects such as Bras\u00edlia were criticised as examples of utopian over-planning. The fair\u2019s amphitheatre and arch. In September the fair site was placed on Unesco\u2019s list of properties being considered for nomination to its world heritage list. Photograph: Walid Rashid Photography Niemeyer\u2019s designs for the Tripoli fairground were modelled on Bras\u00edlia, but he also experimented with new structures for the space museum and the theatre beneath the dome, which was meant to have a rotating stage. \u201cThe Lebanon pavilion\u2019s pointed arches are the fair\u2019s only reference to a vernacular architecture,\u201d says the architectural historian Far\u00e8s el-Dahdah of Houston\u2019s Rice University. Taleb says: \u201cThe curved structures were technically complex to build, and Niemeyer insisted that we maintained the exact curvature of his original drawings.\u201d The location chosen for the fairground was an area of orange orchards south of Tripoli. Odette Sawaya, whose house in the 60s stood at the edge of the city, then known for its fragrant orange blossoms, recalls a visit from ministers involved in mapping the fairground: \u201cWe went out on to the balcony so they could assess the grounds. All you could see were the orchards and the sea.\u201d The scent of orange blossoms has been lost due to extensive urban development of the city, and today Sawaya\u2019s balcony overlooks a multi-storey concrete apartment block. Bras\u00edlia was built in under four years, but the fair \u2013 mired in issues over land appropriation, construction mistakes and inflating costs \u2013 took more than a decade. Niemeyer expressed his concerns about the delays in a letter to the Lebanese government in the early 70s. After the country\u2019s descent into civil war Syrian forces occupied the complex until the late 90s.

Photographs: private collection/Wassim Naghi The marginalisation of Tripoli, whose historical port was once more important than Beirut\u2019s, also contributed to the fair\u2019s decline. A Chinese company\u2019s proposal to lease the site and turn it into a trade fair for Chinese products in the Middle East was dropped in 2007 due to security concerns. That year, the Lebanese army entered into a three-month conflict with Islamist groups living in the nearby Nahr el-Bared refugee camp. Ongoing violence between the suburbs of Bab al-Tebbaneh and Jabal Mohsen was compounded by the fallout from the war in neighbouring Syria. About 70,000 refugees from Syria live in the city and 9% of its residents are unemployed. \u201cHad it been in any other city in Lebanon, the fair would have had more support from the government,\u201d says Naghi. With the local conflict now over, residents, civil society groups and international agencies are actively trying to restore the city\u2019s dynamic and change its public image. \u201cIt\u2019s the liveliest it has ever been,\u201d says Nadine Dib, who set up Warche 13, a creative space and cafe in Mina, the old port district, in 2016. Since June, two contemporary art exhibitions organised by local and internationally based organisations have taken place in the site\u2019s buildings. The newly created Tripoli special economic zone has secured a lease on part of the fair\u2019s undeveloped grounds to build a tech hub and will launch an international tender for proposals for the development. Two buildings \u2013 a customs house and an administrative office \u2013 will be renovated. The helipad, lit for the opening of the 2018 Cycles of Collapsing Progress exhibition. Photograph: Walid Rashid The city\u2019s revival could help raise funds for the fair\u2019s restoration. In September the fairground was placed on Unesco\u2019s list of sites being considered for nomination to its world heritage list. With EU funding, the fair\u2019s guesthouse was restored and reopened a couple of months ago as a workspace for local carpenters. Nonetheless, the restoration challenges are immense. Naghi estimates that up to $40m (\u00a331m) is needed to treat the concrete and make it safe again. \u201cLebanon has no regulations for protecting modern architectural heritage,\u201d says Dahdah, \u201cso conservation is a moot question.\u201d In the early 2000s, the fairground\u2019s collective housing unit was converted into a chain business hotel. \u201cIt\u2019s completely out of touch with the building\u2019s original design and function,\u201d says Naghi. It also reduces the chances of the site obtaining world heritage status. A further challenge will be reconnecting local residents with the abandoned site.

      "body": "<p>I never quite knew what the word \u201csophistry\u201d meant, until I read this book. I had a vague idea that it was something to do with making a false argument. But I looked the word up and saw that this wasn\u2019t quite right. Sophistry means the clever use of arguments that seem true. In Chaucer\u2019s time, it used to mean cunning, or craft. The original ancient Greek sophists were people, according to Plato, who were virtuoso athletes of words. Above all, sophists are plausible. That\u2019s what makes them so dangerous.</p> <p>This is what came to mind reading the latest screed by Anthony Warner, who worked for many years at Premier Foods, one of the biggest food companies in Britain, which manufactures Mr Kipling cakes, Angel Delight desserts and Batchelors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/24/instant-noodles-student-recipes-felicity-cloake-masterclass\" title=\"\">Super Noodles</a>, among many other branded processed foods. Ten years ago, the Belfast Telegraph described Warner as TV presenter Loyd Grossman\u2019s \u201cItalian development chef\u201d because Warner was the person who helped Grossman develop his own-brand pasta sauces. But that was before Warner transmogrified into \u201c<a href=\"https://angry-chef.com/\" title=\"\">The Angry Chef</a>\u201d, the name of an expletive-ridden blog that he started writing in 2016 \u201cexposing lies, pretension and stupidity in the world of food\u201d. He could have called himself \u201cThe Angry Consultant to the Food Industry\u201d but it wouldn\u2019t have had quite the same ring. In 2017 the blog gave rise to a book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/18/angry-chef-debunking-detox-diets-wellness-nutrition-alternative-facts\" title=\"\"><em>The Angry Chef: Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating</em></a>.</p> <p>To begin with, many in food writing circles considered Warner a breath of fresh air. I was one of them, going so far as to write a blurb for the book, welcoming it as a \u201cbracing and funny tirade against the nonsense and harm done by food fads\u201d. I liked the way he skewered the quackery of alkaline diets and the absurd overuse of coconut oil and other so-called superfoods. I knew that Warner worked for the food industry, but I didn\u2019t feel that this had an undue impact on his arguments. Maybe there was an element of \u201cmy enemy\u2019s enemy is my friend\u201d in my liking for Warner\u2019s writing. Over the course of my life, too many people close to me have developed eating disorders and when Warner attacked the restrictive rules and \u201cnutribollocks\u201d of the clean eating trend, his anger seemed righteous.</p> <p>But the more I read Warner\u2019s blogs and articles (he is now a columnist for the Sunday Times), the more I started to find his anger oddly limited. He seemed to have plenty of fury for the \u201cpretension and stupidity\u201d of health bloggers and detox regimes but remarkably little anger for the food industry that has marketed sugary junk foods to vulnerable consumers, including children, on an unprecedented scale, with catastrophic consequences for human health. When I went back and reread <em>The Angry Chef</em> I was struck that, in between the funny parts about liars and charlatans, there were curious overstatements and binary oppositions. In Warner\u2019s world, if you question the prevalence of sugar in our diets you are a prejudiced, judgmental, pseudo-scientific \u201cnutrition expert\u201d. \u201cTo give a child a bowl of breakfast cereal and a glass of orange juice is now to be a social pariah, guilty of the vilest abuse,\u201d he writes. Really? If that were true, our eating habits would be very different.</p> <p>And now we come to his new book on the causes of obesity, which suggests that everything you thought you knew about nutrition and weight is wrong. On first glance, there is much here that seems both plausible and just. For one thing, Warner recognises that obesity has complex and multifaceted causes and it is not \u2013 as so many persist in claiming \u2013 a collapse in willpower. Warner makes a plea to end the dreadful way in which people with obesity are stigmatised by the media. \u201cShaming fat people does not help them. It makes their lives harder. It makes their health worsen,\u201d he writes. He is right about this. Throughout the book, Warner positions himself not so much as an angry chef as a cuddly teddy bear on the side of tolerance, love and compassion. He urges us to \u201cstop judging people by how they look\u201d and to relish the simple things in life such as sharing sandwiches in the park.</p> <p>The strangeness of the book emerges when you start to examine what he is actually saying about the causes of modern obesity and, more widely, of diet-related illness such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/22/type-2-diabetes-obesity-now-affects-nearly-7000-young-britons\" title=\"\">type 2 diabetes</a> and heart disease. He implies that it is not really about carbs, nor about sugar and anyone who suggests otherwise is probably some snooty middle-class person who shops at Wholefoods. He writes derisively of New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s \u201cinfamous (failed) attempt to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/nyregion/bloomberg-plans-a-ban-on-large-sugared-drinks.html\" title=\"\">halt the sale of supersize soft drinks</a>\u201d in the city (although Warner admits we do need to cut down a bit on sugar \u201cif only because of the associated dental problems\u201d). Obesity is also not really about microbes, Warner insists. He lambasts microbe expert Tim Spector for an experiment involving Spector\u2019s student son showing that just 10 days of eating nothing but McDonald\u2019s meals led to a 40% reduction in the diversity of his gut bacteria. This was a \u201cshameless publicity stunt\u201d Warner writes, and anyway, it proves nothing.</p> <p>Warner also encourages us to discard the notion that obesity results from calorific confectionery being pushed on us in every supermarket and newsagent on a scale never seen in the past. The only reason that there is so much chocolate in the supermarket, according to Warner, is because of our moralising culture of guilt. \u201cIn places where Twix and Dairy Milk do not occupy the role of guilty pleasures, they fail to dominate the supermarket shelves.\u201d This is pure sophistry. He does not mention the fact \u2013 which is no secret, if you read trade journals on confectionery \u2013 that the excessive quantity of sweets in our shops is part of a deliberate strategy by retailers and manufacturers to create \u201cinterruption points\u201d as we walk around stores.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>What does he think caused the transformation of\u00a0our bodies over\u00a0the past few decades, if it isn\u2019t\u00a0food?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Warner\u2019s book, obesity is not about an over-supply of calories, and it is not about the rise of takeaways near schools or wider changes to our food environment, so there is little point in trying to reform the obesogenic environment we live in. \u201cOften the environmental account is little more than a thin disguise for contempt,\u201d he insists. \u201cMostly the idea is that fat people need to be coerced into more middle-class food options, cooking from scratch, meals round the table, less fried chicken, more hummus.\u201d By equating sound advice with coercion, he makes it impossible to offer sound advice. It is possible to hate fat-shaming and still to want to apportion some of the blame where it belongs, with the food industry. But that\u2019s precisely what Warner wants to rule out.</p> <p>So what does he think caused the transformation of our bodies over the past few decades, if it isn\u2019t food? Warner\u2019s candidates include poverty, stress and poor housing. He is right that all of these factors strongly correlate with poor diets, but he always seems to miss out the part of the argument that brings eating into the equation. One of his preferred explanations for obesity is genes. His proposition is that \u201clarger people go for larger people, and tend to produce more children when they do\u201d. It is certainly true \u2013 as genetic studies involving twins have confirmed \u2013 that our individual responses to food, including our appetite, have a strong genetic component. But Warner does not have a convincing explanation for why either genes or poverty would suddenly be driving weight gain, given the rapid rise in obesity across the world from 1980 onwards.</p> <p>At moments, his confusing arguments segue into outright inaccuracy. In Warner\u2019s closing chapter, he writes about Amsterdam, which may be the only place in the world \u2013 outside of famine zones \u2013 where child obesity is actually declining. In 2012, the city\u2019s deputy mayor Eric van der Berg launched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/14/amsterdam-solution-obesity-crisis-no-fruit-juice-enough-sleep\" title=\"\">\u201cAmsterdam healthy weight programme\u201d</a>, which included a whole tranche of measures, from workshops on healthy cooking for parents to bans on junk food marketing at sports events. In just four years, rates of child obesity fell by 12%. Amsterdam has become a beacon for nutrition campaigners around the world, proof that it is possible to make radical improvements to the environment in which children live and eat.</p> <p>How did Amsterdam do it? Warner wants us to believe that the success was \u201cunique to Amsterdam\u201d and not much to do with food. He insists that Van der Berg saw that the \u201cfocus should not be on anything as trivial as what children were eating\u201d. This is wildly misleading. If you look at the information given to families by the programme, it is very much about what children are eating (as well as about exercise, sleep and limiting the use of electronic devices). Children in Amsterdam are encouraged to avoid eating too much sugar and saturated fat and to eat four servings of vegetables and two of fruit every day, and to be active for at least an hour a day. The Amsterdam advice on children\u2019s food is quite specific, urging parents to limit \u201ccrisps, croissants, chips, pizza, sausage rolls\u201d as well as cookies, pastries, packaged snacks and soft drinks.</p> <p>Warner also claims that in Amsterdam, \u201cinstead of getting rid of school vending machines selling sugary drinks, the decision was taken to allow them\u201d while entrusting children to make \u201cbetter decisions\u201d. Again, this is an outright falsehood. One of the key elements in the Amsterdam programme was that at participating primary schools, children were allowed to drink only water and milk. \u201cDrink water from the tap\u201d has been one of the single biggest messages of the whole campaign, reinforced in schools and at home.</p> <p>If you think that the question of what children eat is \u201ctrivial\u201d, this is the book on obesity for you. It will chime with many people\u2019s wish not to be lectured at by people who claim to know better, and goes to great lengths to absolve the food industry and its relentless marketing of processed food from playing any role in modern diet problems.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Truth About Fat is published by OneWorld.

      "bodyText": "I never quite knew what the word \u201csophistry\u201d meant, until I read this book. I had a vague idea that it was something to do with making a false argument. But I looked the word up and saw that this wasn\u2019t quite right. Sophistry means the clever use of arguments that seem true. In Chaucer\u2019s time, it used to mean cunning, or craft. The original ancient Greek sophists were people, according to Plato, who were virtuoso athletes of words. Above all, sophists are plausible. That\u2019s what makes them so dangerous. This is what came to mind reading the latest screed by Anthony Warner, who worked for many years at Premier Foods, one of the biggest food companies in Britain, which manufactures Mr Kipling cakes, Angel Delight desserts and Batchelors Super Noodles, among many other branded processed foods. Ten years ago, the Belfast Telegraph described Warner as TV presenter Loyd Grossman\u2019s \u201cItalian development chef\u201d because Warner was the person who helped Grossman develop his own-brand pasta sauces. But that was before Warner transmogrified into \u201cThe Angry Chef\u201d, the name of an expletive-ridden blog that he started writing in 2016 \u201cexposing lies, pretension and stupidity in the world of food\u201d. He could have called himself \u201cThe Angry Consultant to the Food Industry\u201d but it wouldn\u2019t have had quite the same ring. In 2017 the blog gave rise to a book, The Angry Chef: Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating. To begin with, many in food writing circles considered Warner a breath of fresh air. I was one of them, going so far as to write a blurb for the book, welcoming it as a \u201cbracing and funny tirade against the nonsense and harm done by food fads\u201d. I liked the way he skewered the quackery of alkaline diets and the absurd overuse of coconut oil and other so-called superfoods. I knew that Warner worked for the food industry, but I didn\u2019t feel that this had an undue impact on his arguments. Maybe there was an element of \u201cmy enemy\u2019s enemy is my friend\u201d in my liking for Warner\u2019s writing. Over the course of my life, too many people close to me have developed eating disorders and when Warner attacked the restrictive rules and \u201cnutribollocks\u201d of the clean eating trend, his anger seemed righteous. But the more I read Warner\u2019s blogs and articles (he is now a columnist for the Sunday Times), the more I started to find his anger oddly limited. He seemed to have plenty of fury for the \u201cpretension and stupidity\u201d of health bloggers and detox regimes but remarkably little anger for the food industry that has marketed sugary junk foods to vulnerable consumers, including children, on an unprecedented scale, with catastrophic consequences for human health. When I went back and reread The Angry Chef I was struck that, in between the funny parts about liars and charlatans, there were curious overstatements and binary oppositions. In Warner\u2019s world, if you question the prevalence of sugar in our diets you are a prejudiced, judgmental, pseudo-scientific \u201cnutrition expert\u201d. \u201cTo give a child a bowl of breakfast cereal and a glass of orange juice is now to be a social pariah, guilty of the vilest abuse,\u201d he writes. Really? If that were true, our eating habits would be very different. And now we come to his new book on the causes of obesity, which suggests that everything you thought you knew about nutrition and weight is wrong. On first glance, there is much here that seems both plausible and just. For one thing, Warner recognises that obesity has complex and multifaceted causes and it is not \u2013 as so many persist in claiming \u2013 a collapse in willpower. Warner makes a plea to end the dreadful way in which people with obesity are stigmatised by the media. \u201cShaming fat people does not help them. It makes their lives harder. It makes their health worsen,\u201d he writes. He is right about this. Throughout the book, Warner positions himself not so much as an angry chef as a cuddly teddy bear on the side of tolerance, love and compassion. He urges us to \u201cstop judging people by how they look\u201d and to relish the simple things in life such as sharing sandwiches in the park. The strangeness of the book emerges when you start to examine what he is actually saying about the causes of modern obesity and, more widely, of diet-related illness such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. He implies that it is not really about carbs, nor about sugar and anyone who suggests otherwise is probably some snooty middle-class person who shops at Wholefoods. He writes derisively of New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s \u201cinfamous (failed) attempt to halt the sale of supersize soft drinks\u201d in the city (although Warner admits we do need to cut down a bit on sugar \u201cif only because of the associated dental problems\u201d). Obesity is also not really about microbes, Warner insists. He lambasts microbe expert Tim Spector for an experiment involving Spector\u2019s student son showing that just 10 days of eating nothing but McDonald\u2019s meals led to a 40% reduction in the diversity of his gut bacteria. This was a \u201cshameless publicity stunt\u201d Warner writes, and anyway, it proves nothing. Warner also encourages us to discard the notion that obesity results from calorific confectionery being pushed on us in every supermarket and newsagent on a scale never seen in the past. The only reason that there is so much chocolate in the supermarket, according to Warner, is because of our moralising culture of guilt. \u201cIn places where Twix and Dairy Milk do not occupy the role of guilty pleasures, they fail to dominate the supermarket shelves.\u201d This is pure sophistry. He does not mention the fact \u2013 which is no secret, if you read trade journals on confectionery \u2013 that the excessive quantity of sweets in our shops is part of a deliberate strategy by retailers and manufacturers to create \u201cinterruption points\u201d as we walk around stores. In Warner\u2019s book, obesity is not about an over-supply of calories, and it is not about the rise of takeaways near schools or wider changes to our food environment, so there is little point in trying to reform the obesogenic environment we live in. \u201cOften the environmental account is little more than a thin disguise for contempt,\u201d he insists. \u201cMostly the idea is that fat people need to be coerced into more middle-class food options, cooking from scratch, meals round the table, less fried chicken, more hummus.\u201d By equating sound advice with coercion, he makes it impossible to offer sound advice. It is possible to hate fat-shaming and still to want to apportion some of the blame where it belongs, with the food industry. But that\u2019s precisely what Warner wants to rule out.

The theory went that two strong bowling attacks would be evenly matched but Kohli\u2019s genius could be the determining factor. Well, the logic has proven sound, only the batsman to dominate proceedings has been Cheteshwar Pujara. </p> \n  <p>For the third time this tour India\u2019s No3 reached triple figures, and his knock at the SCG was his most fluent of the lot. Not for the first time he arrived at the crease following an early dismissal but after the recalled KL Rahul (9) fell cheaply, he occupied the crease with the aggressive Mayank Agarwal (77) before taking matters into his own hands during the afternoon and evening sessions. </p> \n  <p>Pujara was particularly dismissive of Marnus Labuschagne, the leg-spinning allrounder called-up to add a second spin option as well as bat at first drop. It is the latest in a long line of selection gambles that appears difficult to justify and unlikely to pay off. </p> \n  <p>The pitch served up by the SCG has played well so far, offering pace and bounce early while providing certainty for batsmen. India will hope the couple of shorter balls that kept low later in the day become a more regular occurrence. Once again they have the benefit of bowling last after winning another crucial toss.</p> \n  <p>To find out how big Pujara can go please join me and Adam and Geoff again tomorrow. Oh, and think of a new description for Pujara\u2019s wristy flick while you\u2019re at it. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b56923b4e058a1af127ffef0ebba4a97da02b6be\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b56923b4e058a1af127ffef0ebba4a97da02b6be/0_0_2419_3000/806.jpg\" alt=\"Cheteshwar Pujara starred on day one of the Sydney Test.\" width=\"806\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cheteshwar Pujara starred on day one of the Sydney Test.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Rycroft/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-03T07:21:22.301Z\">at 7.21am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c2db2cee4b0cebe7617f1b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-03T07:01:45.220Z\">7.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>90th over: India 303-4 (Pujara 130, Vihari 39) </strong>Lyon closes out the day with a regulation over of off-spin that India handle with the minimum of fuss.

I just spotted Darren Lehmann in the lunch queue and had half a mind to tell him that he\u2019d been badly snubbed in the Baldrick XI. Lovely OBO areas. India, once again, sucked the energy out of Australia\u2019s opening attack, just as they did in Melbourne on the opening day. Take note Australian top order: this is how you go about winning a Test Match. <br></p> \n  <p>To begin, a community service announcement to those in Sydney at a loose end: get along! There\u2019s nobody here. By that, what I mean is the SCG is at least a third empty with seats all over the ground. Indeed, if you want a full row to yourself, that won\u2019t be a problem. Remember a couple of summers ago when the SCG Trust said that they should have a second Test here each summer? Yeah, pull the other one. <br></p> \n  <p>We\u2019re about ten minutes away from the resumption for this second session and I\u2019m looking forward to your company throughout. Drop me a <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.casual@guardian.co.uk\">line</a>, ping me a <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam\">tweet</a>, give me your all and I\u2019ll do the same. <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQFPikYSalg\"> \n   <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qQFPikYSalg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n   <figcaption>\n    Good afternoon.\n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c2d66bfe4b072dc52e677da\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/geoff-lemon\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-03T01:41:33.499Z\">1.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunch \u2013 India 69-1 after winning the toss and batting</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>India\u2019s session. Once again they batted slowly and carefully, and weren\u2019t worried about the run rate. Once again Australia created plenty of close moments. And once again, the Indian batsmen defended and survived, and have given themselves the chance to prosper. Starc tried the pitched-up swing, then the barrage. Hazlewood took the only wicket to fall, nicking off KL Rahul which is currently not the greatest challenge in world cricket. But Agarwal followed up an impressive Melbourne debut by once more looking the part, while Che Pujara continued his excellent series.</p> \n  <p>After some final late votes, here\u2019s our Baldrick XI. I would have liked to get Gooch in there but he betrayed us with Advanced Hair. Good seam-bowling options, a classic English captain with an amateur\u2019s stats, and the greatest NZ bowling action of all time. We\u2019re set.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Bald XI</strong><br>1.

But then, that\u2019s an entirely pointless move given the SCG hasn\u2019t offered anything to spinners in about a decade.

Well, the logic has proven sound, only the batsman to dominate proceedings has been Cheteshwar Pujara. For the third time this tour India\u2019s No3 reached triple figures, and his knock at the SCG was his most fluent of the lot. Not for the first time he arrived at the crease following an early dismissal but after the recalled KL Rahul (9) fell cheaply, he occupied the crease with the aggressive Mayank Agarwal (77) before taking matters into his own hands during the afternoon and evening sessions. Pujara was particularly dismissive of Marnus Labuschagne, the leg-spinning allrounder called-up to add a second spin option as well as bat at first drop. It is the latest in a long line of selection gambles that appears difficult to justify and unlikely to pay off. The pitch served up by the SCG has played well so far, offering pace and bounce early while providing certainty for batsmen. India will hope the couple of shorter balls that kept low later in the day become a more regular occurrence. Once again they have the benefit of bowling last after winning another crucial toss. To find out how big Pujara can go please join me and Adam and Geoff again tomorrow. Oh, and think of a new description for Pujara\u2019s wristy flick while you\u2019re at it. 90th over: India 303-4 (Pujara 130, Vihari 39) Lyon closes out the day with a regulation over of off-spin that India handle with the minimum of fuss. The partnership moves on to 75, India in excess of 300, and Australia\u2019s chances of levelling the series already look bleak. 89th over: India 300-4 (Pujara 128, Vihari 38) Australia bowled short to Vihari to great effect earlier in the series but until this Cummins over they haven\u2019t bowled with similar menace today. Belatedly, Vihari struggles to fend one away under his left armpit, then struggles to withdraw his gloves to one that lifts outside his off stump. 88th over: India 300-4 (Pujara 128, Vihari 38) Australia\u2019s ineffectiveness with the new ball is such that Nathan Lyon is back on again for his 28th over of the day. A couple of singles ensure from a quiet over. Just two more overs left in the day. 87th over: India 298-4 (Pujara 127, Vihari 37) Cummins finally gets a turn with the new ball and he begins by offering Vihari some width, with predictable results. This is far from the most controlled shot India\u2019s No6 has played today but he still profits by four runs through the offside. Australia\u2019s attack looks a bit weary late on day one, and after a few bright signs in Hazlewood\u2019s first over with the new ball it has since refused to do anything spiteful in the air or off the pitch. 86th over: India 292-4 (Pujara 126, Vihari 32) Australia apparently haven\u2019t figured out Vihari likes to cut. Starc this time errs by slanting across a short and wide delivery first up that results in the ball scorching across the outfield to the point fence. This near run-a-ball knock from Vihari - especially against the new ball - has been impressive. When he arrived at the crease the day was in the balance, now India are once again powering into the ascendancy. 85th over: India 287-4 (Pujara 126, Vihari 27) Another beautiful backfoot shot from Vihari. He gets four with a precise drive to a ball that wasn\u2019t that short or wide but the execution made Hazlewood look popgun. 84th over: India 282-4 (Pujara 126, Vihari 22) Pujara\u2019s wrists earn him another couple of runs but Starc extracts a measure of revenge, collecting the No3 with a short ball that cannons into the batsman\u2019s left tricep. The bruise that will emerge as a result of that blow will be a work of art. 83rd over: India 280-4 (Pujara 122, Vihari 24) More classical run-scoring from Vihari, this time waiting in his crease, shifting his bodyweight en pointe, and carving a backfoot cut shot behind square for four. We haven\u2019t seen India counterattack Australia\u2019s quicks often this series but Vihari looked a million dollars playing that shot on his tiptoes. 82nd over: India 276-4 (Pujara 124, Vihari 18) Starc shares the new ball and he charges in from over the wicket to Vihari but there\u2019s no swing in the air or venom off the pitch. Vihari has looked in good touch since he arrived at the crease and here again he presents a straight bat to anything testing witht he presence of mind to guide a half-volley calmly through the covers for a lovely three. 81st over: India 271-4 (Pujara 122, Vihari 15) Hazlewood takes the virgin Kookaburra and his first delivery reveals appreciable swing away from the right-handed Vihari. The lights are taking effect at the SCG making this a testing little spell for India. The next delivery goes the other way, Vihari inside-edging his way to the non-striker\u2019s end. From that vantage point he can enjoy Hazlewood\u2019s line to Pujara starting too wide outside off stump, then over-correcting, allowing the centurion a gimme four on his pads. Australia take the second new ball immediately. 80th over: India 266-4 (Pujara 118, Vihari 14) Australia have raced through their overs in recent minutes, scurrying their way to the second new ball. Lyon is the latest to rattle through his work, India happy to see off the good balls and pinch singles where available. Ten overs or 45 minutes left in the day. \u201cHow many wickets have been caught by the wicket keeper or close in on the leg side in this series?\u201d asks Roland Smith. \u201cIs this a new weakness of batsmen bred on 20/20?\u201d 79th over: India 264-4 (Pujara 117, Vihari 13) Paine persists with Labuschagne and he\u2019s rewarded with a tidy over. Quicker from the leggie, hustling the batsmen with a line around off stump. 78th over: India 262-4 (Pujara 116, Vihari 12) More *as yet unnamed* wristy flick goodness from Pujara to keep India in the runs before the new ball can be taken. \u201cAfternoon Jonathan,\u201d a pleasure as always Phil Withall. \u201cThe importance of players like Pujara to a side becomes more pronounced with each innings he plays. Others contribute, not always very much, but having a player that is prepared to build an innings, to take runs when they are offered and just bat is incredibly important in Test cricket. Australia are lacking a player with this mindset, skill level and patience. I feel the home side will continue to struggle until such a batsman can be found.\u201d I think a certain Mr Smith may be in line to fill that particular gap pretty soon. 77th over: India 258-4 (Pujara 113, Vihari 11) Labuschagne gets a second over, but he might wish he hadn\u2019t. His second delivery is a junk full toss that Pujara wallops disdainfully over cow corner for four. Four other deliveries also go for runs. Not what the skipper is after with the second new ball on the horizon. 76th over: India 250-4 (Pujara 107, Vihari 9) Pujara\u2019s intent has been noticeable this innings, especially to Lyon, and he shows more attacking elan again this over, skipping down the pitch and belting Australia\u2019s GOAT along the carpet through mid-on for a handsome four. I\u2019ll field any offers and do my best to use them often enough to compel Susie Dent into including it in the OED. 75th over: India 246-4 (Pujara 103, Vihari 9) Paine shows he has a gambler\u2019s instinct by recalling Labuschagne. The leggie\u2019s opening over before Tea was dross but he gets another chance. The first couple of deliveries of his second spell are ominously dragged down but he recovers quickly, landing the next three, then relying on some sharp fielding to ensure an overpitched delivery only goes for one. Something to build on. 74th over: India 243-4 (Pujara 101, Vihari 8) Vihari has been reluctant to show us his shots so far this series but he\u2019s scoring at a decent clip so far in this knock, forcing Lyon through the covers for three to maintain the momentum created by Pujara. Speaking of the centurion, he is now in rare company. 73rd over: India 239-4 (Pujara 100, Vihari 5) After rollicking towards his century either side of Tea, Pujara is now inching his way there in singles. That is until Starc serves him a leg-stump half-volley that is clipped effortlessly wide of fine-leg for four. That\u2019s his third ton of the series, the 18th of his career and once again vital in the context of the match. All the noise pre-Adelaide was about Virat Kohli but Che Pujara has proven the main difference between these two sides over the past month. 72nd over: India 233-4 (Pujara 95, Vihari 4) There\u2019s a little happening out there now. Despite Pujara focussing on defence in this Lyon over he still offers a hint of a bat-pad catch and does well to dig out a quicker ball that doesn\u2019t get up. 71st over: India 232-4 (Pujara 94, Vihari 4) Starc immediately goes short to the new batsman Viahri from over the wicket but after a couple on target he offers some width that the No6 climbs all over and pummels through point for four. Starc\u2019s form this series has been patchy but he is always a wicket-taking threat. After an ordinary return over the big quick sends down a missile of a bouncer that climbs on Rahane, kisses the batsman\u2019s gloves and soars through to Paine behind the stumps. This has always felt like India\u2019s day but if Australia can winkle Pujara out before the close of play that opinion will have to be reappraised. 70th over: India 228-3 (Pujara 94, Rahane 18) When Lyon bowls to Pujara the batsman looks in total control and always seems able to rotate the strike by advancing down the pitch and whipping his wrists across the ball with the spin. With Rahane on strike the balance is more towards the bowler but in this over the offie lets himself down with a mixture of lines and lengths letting Rahane off the hook. 69th over: India 224-3 (Pujara 93, Rahane 15) Plenty of chat on TV about the lack of overs from Mitchell Starc today (just 12 to this point) but when he is finally recalled to the attack he watches his first two deliveries whistle to the boundary. Both came from the blade of the free-scoring Pujara, the first through mid-on, the second behind point, each oozing authority. A squirty inside-edge later in the over gives the bowler some encouragement but Rahane then pushes a couple intot he offside to make it a very healthy over for the tourists. 68th over: India 213-3 (Pujara 84, Rahane 13) Another maiden from Lyon sent down in the direction of Rahane. 67th over: India 213-3 (Pujara 84, Rahane 13) Cummins continues but he has the dubious honour of sending down a ball 67-overs soft to Che Pujara nearing his Cowan double century. The batsman glides a couple through the gully region in an over that resembled a net session. \u201cPujara seems to be in the Rahul Dravid mould. Man just bats and bats and bats,\u201d emails Amod Paranjape. \u201cSpeaking of Rahul Dravid do you know that three people by the name of Hanuma Vihari , Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw refer to him as their Mentor?\u201d 66th over: India 211-3 (Pujara 82, Rahane 13) Lyon and Rahane are back in their maiden groove. Meanwhile, more from Maxi-land. They (selectors) think that I\u2019ve got enough opportunities to have shown what I\u2019ve got in the Test arena, and they weren\u2019t happy with what they saw. Look, if I can pile some more runs on at the back end of this summer who knows, but, yeah, it\u2019s too hard to concentrate on anything too far ahead. They\u2019ve picked their squad at the moment and I wish them all the best. I\u2019ll be watching \u2013 I love watching the game \u2013 so I\u2019ll be still watching them.\u201d 65th over: India 211-3 (Pujara 82, Rahane 13) Cummins continues in an over elongated by a change of bowling boot. His line is straight, to the point of leaking onto the pads of both right-handers, but defence is the priority after one attempted guide into the onside finds a leading edge. \u201cMorning Jonathan,\u201d hi Gervase Greene. \u201cCan I just point out that Kohli\u2019s dismissal was eerily foretold in the 47th over by this very column (was it Adam?) in noting how Kohli is squeezed down the leg side and gloving it through leg slip or finer repeatedly. And so it proved, exactly. Spooky? A chink in the Kohli armour, methinks, and it is indeed unfortunate to have taken until India were halfway to a 1st innings total of 500-plus in a match they only need to draw for Australia\u2019s brains trust to have stumbled upon it.\u201d Adam will be chuffed someone spotted that nugget of clairvoyance. 64th over: India 210-3 (Pujara 82, Rahane 12) Magnificent batting from Che Pujara. He has looked more expansive today than at any point in the series and in this Lyon over he executes two glorious wristy flicks to work boundaries through midwicket from deliveries that pitched outside off stump. Lyon responds by moving from over to around the wicket. 63rd over: India 202-3 (Pujara 74, Rahane 12) 200 up for India courtesy of a couple through the covers off a controlled Rahane drive. Rahane and Pujara then exchange singles. The pronunciation of Labuschagne is going to generate a few winces during the allrounder\u2019s international career. Here\u2019s some advice from Patrick Cornish. \u201cDear Guardian team, please consult an Afrikaans speaker and tell everyone how the name Labuschagne is pronounced. It sounds rather like LABUS-Kachnee (ch as in \u201cchoir, not as in \u201crich\u201d). Not easy, but possible.\u201d 62nd over: India 198-3 (Pujara 73, Rahane 9) Lyon has tied down Rahane in recent overs and he has the Indian No5 moving in skittish fashion at the start of this over but the pressure is released with a sloppy shorter ball that\u2019s whipped behind square on the legside for a single. I know this kind of Twitter content is what many of you are here for. 61st over: India 197-3 (Pujara 73, Rahane 8) Cummins replaces Hazlewood and after extending the run of dot balls beyond 20 he concedes a couple to Pujara and the scoreboard gets moving once again. On TV Trent Copeland analyses that Hazlewood grubber a few overs back and identifies a bare patch that may well be cause for concern as this match goes on. John Cox has emailed in, entertaining the tantilising possiblity there could be a niche for climbing keepers. I\u2019m on board. \u201cOn Adam Parore climbing Mount Everest,\u201d John emails, \u201cI\u2019m going to stick my neck out and suggest that the best cricketer/climber is former England keeper Bruce French. His climbing exploits don\u2019t make the Internet much, but here\u2019s one in which he\u2019s briefly mentioned (non-climbers should skip from Bruce to the end).\u201d 60th over: India 195-3 (Pujara 71, Rahane 8) Third maiden in a row - once again Lyon to Rahane. This one contained a moral victory for the bowler late in the over though. Now, can Australia join these dots into a big W? 59th over: India 195-3 (Pujara 71, Rahane 8) Another maiden, this time Pujara addressing Hazlewood\u2019s short stuff with aplomb. \u201cHappy New Year, Jonathan.\u201d And the same to you Ian Forth. \u201cThe think-tank has identified Labuschagne as the guy to hold up an end for 15 or so overs today. OK then. Sydney is traditionally the Test in which the losing side in a series completely unravels, but was there any need to get quite such a helping hand from the selection panel?\u201d It is very England late 80s/early 90s. I wonder if they\u2019re going to go full Chris Cowdrey during the Sri Lanka series? 58th over: India 195-3 (Pujara 71, Rahane 8) Rahane is content to block out a maiden from Nathan \u201cGarry\u201d Lyon. \u201cI\u2019m puzzled,\u201d emails Sandra Gai Lucas. \u201cWhy is Nathan Lyon called Garry? Please explain. Thank you, Jonathan.\u201d Well, it\u2019s in reference to another famous Australian Lyon, Garry, a former Australian Rules footballer and now media personality. 57th over: India 195-3 (Pujara 71, Rahane 8) Geeeeeeee Whizzzzzzz! The first ball of Hazlewood\u2019s over is a half-tracker but it barely gets above shin height, beats Pujara\u2019s defensive stroke but does not have the brass neck to castle into his stumps. That is not the kind of misbehaviour either side wants to see so early in the Test - and especially not the curator. Pujara jogs to the refuge of the non-striker\u2019s end where he can mutter under his breath at Rahane receiving a rank lop hop that bounces predictably, allowing him to carve a boundary behind point. 56th over: India 189-3 (Pujara 70, Rahane 3) Couple more to Rahane, this time with a very well executed square cut to a Lyon delivery that allows him a smidgen of room outside his off stump. That attacking stroke is surrounded by defensive dots. 55th over: India 187-3 (Pujara 70, Rahane 1) Hazlewood has an over at the new batsman and he makes sure Rahane is familiar with the behaviour of this pitch from short of a length. There\u2019s nothing overly troubling in there though and he retains strike and gets off the mark with a final ball single. Great question. My default would be \u201ckeep your mouth shut\u201d but the way he has been so weirdly treated over recent seasons I have no problem with him expressing himself a little more candidly. What\u2019s the worst that will happen? He quadruples his salary as a T20 gun for hire? 54th over: India 186-3 (Pujara 70, Rahane 0) Lyon resumes his battle with Pujara but the batsman is well on top at the moment and he continues his march towards another century with a powerful pulled four and a delicately nudged two. 53rd over: India 180-3 (Pujara 64, Rahane 0) Have there been more legside dismissals than usual this series? It seems so from my reactionary perspective. Anyhow, Kohli\u2019s gone and Australia have their tails up after a torrid afternoon session. Oh my, that is a lovely post-Tea gift for Australia. Hazlewood\u2019s over is unremarkable until a short delivery leaking down the leg side catches Kohli\u2019s glove mid-pull and the ball travels comfortably into Paine\u2019s gloves. An unexpected breakthrough for Australia. Don\u2019t let me take responsibility for everything that gets posted on here this afternoon. Witticisms and wisdom are not only welcomed but encouraged, especially via Twitter - @JPHowcroft- or by email - jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com. I know baldies and bangers have been on the agenda so far, but whatever floats your collective boats, just keep that correspondence flowing. As is frustratingly common, the over rate has been appalling during the opening couple of sessions, meaning the final period of play will last the scheduled two hours plus the additional half hour and even then we might not have enough time to whirl through 38 overs to edge us up to the minimum required daily complement of 90. Tim Paine\u2019s hip pocket might get stung at some point soon especially if he\u2019s unable to rely on some quick overs of spin from Labuschagne. That over before the interval would not have done much for the skipper\u2019s confidence in the fifth member of his attack. Meanwhile, over in Maxi-land... Thank you very much Mr Collins, my favourite cricketing Adam since Adam Parore, a man with some choice claims to fame*, including: The first M\u0101ori to represent New Zealand in cricket. The only Test cricketer to climb Mt Everest. Highest ODI score without a boundary (96 vs India, in Baroda, 1994). Parore also features in one of the angriest and most brutal dismissals in international cricket history. The scorecard reads Parore b Lee, but that only tells a fraction of the story. *These are all shamelessly lifted from Wikipedia, so I can\u2019t vouch for their accuracy. 51st over: India 177-2 (Pujara 61, Kohli 23) Shooooot! Kohli, on the cusp of tea, gets a big stride in to Lyon before driving him against the spin through cover. Wonderful batting from this pair, their stand passing 50 with that shot as they go to tea. The visitors added 108 runs in the session, losing Agarwal (77) along the way, holing out to long-on off Lyon after hitting the spinner for a couple of sixes. All told, it\u2019s India\u2019s day at the SCG. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the OBO over to JP Howcroft for the final stanza. Bye! 51st over: India 173-2 (Pujara 61, Kohli 19) Oh dear, Labuschagne into the attack for the first time in this country and it has not gone well at all. On three occasions, the legspinner drops short with half-trackers and three times Pujara does the business, smashing them to the rope. Jim Maxwell on the ABC compares the over to the eight sent down by Johnny Watkins on this ground in 1973, \u201cwhen he got stage fright on debut and could barely land it on the pitch.\u201d Pujara raised his half-century, in 134 balls, with the first of those. It\u2019s the fourth time he\u2019s made it to 50 in this series. 50th over: India 161-2 (Pujara 49, Kohli 19) The Indian duo are breaking up the attack here now, Pujara tucking a couple off Lyon then cutting delicately for two more before pushing one to midwicket. Fine batting in the lead up to the tea interval. \u201cI\u2019m at the SCG where a couple of afternoon beers are just starting to wake the slightly soporific crowd in the members section,\u201d emails Ed Elias. \u201cGiven that Nathan Lyon looks like Fredo, the wayward brother in The Godfather, is his brother in fact the head of a significant crime syndicate? I missed the interview with Brendan \u2018il padrone\u2019 Lyon at lunchtime so I don\u2019t know.\u201d The perfect theory to drum up over a barrel in the SCG Members Bar. Catch you in there. 49th over: India 156-2 (Pujara 44, Kohli 19) Kohli\u2019s turn, albeit another boundary of the unconvincing variety. It\u2019s the pleave! Cummins had the Indian captain tangled up trying to let it go but he couldn\u2019t get his bat out of the way in time, the ball deflecting through the cordon along the ground for four. Even Our Pat might utter a swear word in response to that. 48th over: India 152-2 (Pujara 44, Kohli 15) It has been a while since Pujara unfurled those arms of his, but he does so to Lyon when the spinner drops short, smashing him to the midwicket boundary. And with that shot, India\u2019s 150 is raised. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gotten a lot of feedback about this already,\u201d writes Scott Probst, \u201cbut I\u2019ve just woken after night shift and found that the Australia selectors have continued their custom of taking part in an ayahuasca ceremony just prior to selecting the team. The mystical properties of halllucinogenic drugs use over the last 10 years is the only way to explain the progress (or otherwise) of the Australia team composition. On this occasion, the dream gods have discarded Finch, elevated Labuschagne, and retained a Marsh - we are but unknowing mortals searching for answers.\u201d I\u2019m going to take this as a comment on the basis that I don\u2019t think I can write another single word about selection. Until the First Test in Brisbane against Sri Lanka, that is. 47th over: India 148-2 (Pujara 40, Kohli 15) Not the most convincing shot from Kohli to take Cummins to the rope, gloving him around the corner to where a second or third leg slip might be stationed if such a thing existed. That\u2019s the second time he\u2019s had a bit of trouble getting the fast bowler down that way, after losing his wicket to him in the MCG second innings caught at leg gully. Cummins waits until the last ball to spit another bouncer at him, the Indian captain not taking the bait. 46th over: India 144-2 (Pujara 40, Kohli 11) Pujara pushes Lyon\u2019s first ball through cover, Kohli also taking a single with a tuck off his hip. Pujara kicked away the offie after dancing down the track later in the over but there\u2019s no meaningful lbw appeal. This is a shot I took of Pujara when he started his day. There\u2019s just no disturbing him. 45th over: India 142-2 (Pujara 39, Kohli 10) Kohli is back at at Cummins ball short of a length and looking to pull, but he doesn\u2019t get much of it, spilling out to the fielder for a couple rather than a boundary. The Aussie quick won\u2019t mind that. Sure enough, a couple of short balls follow but the Indian captain is back into his defensive posture. \u201cMorning, Adam.\u201d Afternoon, Simon Richards. \u201cJust catching up. Geoff posted Darude\u2019s \u2018Sandstorm\u2019 as an anthem. An earlier Ibiza banger was Hi-Lux\u2019s \u2018Never Felt This Way\u2019. Would love to see/hear a mash-up of that with footage of Bumble being \u201cmid-riffed\u201d by Thommo.\u201d What I know for sure on this topic is that Great Southern Land has to be replaced as the song that the Australian side run out to when they are starting a session. [Jed Bartlet] We can do better, we must do better! [/Jed Bartlet] 44th over: India 140-2 (Pujara 39, Kohli 8) Very good from Lyon, beating Pujara for the second time in as many overs with a delivery that didn\u2019t come back at the right-hander, bouncing past the edge. Andrew Samson informs us on SEN that it was the 1000th delivery Pujara has faced in this series (!). The only other time he achieved this feat was also against Australia, in the 2017 Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. The bulk of those must have been in his marathon at Ranchi where he batted for days, or so it felt. 43rd over: India 140-2 (Pujara 39, Kohli 8) After Hazlewood dotted them up for three overs on the bounce, Cummins is brought back for a burst at Kohli, against whom he has a wonderful record. Mindful of this, no doubt, the India skipper takes no risks here, defending and leaving in rotation. 42nd over: India 140-2 (Pujara 39, Kohli 8) After getting off the mark with a lavish drive, Kohli has wound it back just as he did in Perth. He\u2019s compact in response to Lyon, taking one behind square off his hip after getting into position early. Pujara finishes with another frolic down the strip, and why wouldn\u2019t he? According to CricViz, he averages more than 300 when advancing to spinners. 41st over: India 139-2 (Pujara 39, Kohli 7) Hazlewood putting in a shift here after Starc and Cummins struggled to penetrate immediately after lunch. Pujara knows the deal, showing respect when he has to play and getting out the way when he doesn\u2019t. 40th over: India 139-2 (Pujara 39, Kohli 7) Driiiift from Lyon, enough to bring Pujara forward from the crease rather than on the dance, the outside edge is beaten. The No3 is back to using his feet to defend before leaping right back to grab one off his thigh pad and retain the strike. 39th over: India 138-2 (Pujara 38, Kohli 7) Back to back maidens from Hazlewood either side of drinks, this time banging away at a consistent line and length at Kohli just on or outside the off-stump. There\u2019s a bouncer in there too, but just the one. The short-picked line of attack has been put away for now - or to Kohli, at least. 38th over: India 138-2 (Pujara 38, Kohli 7) Lyon to Kohli to begin, getting off strike straight away with a push down the ground, using his feet for the first time. Pujara does the same, to defend a couple of times then unable to beat midwicket. It is all worth it, through the No3 getting to the pitch of the final delivery and playing a quite magnificent off-drive that beats Lyon\u2019s dive one way and mid-off the other. Meanwhile, I missed this from Glenn Maxwell earlier in the session, tweeting like a man who knows his fate. The lesson to young cricketers: SAY NOTHING, be a footballer. 37th over: India 133-2 (Pujara 34, Kohli 6) It has taken Australia to the final over of the third hour to send down a maiden in this session, Josh Hazlewood keeping Pujara quiet in defence, ducking the final ball to earn his drink. A busy hour, India advancing the score from 69 to 133 but losing Agarwal just when the opener was heading to a ton. 36th over: India 133-2 (Pujara 34, Kohli 6) Pujara clips the first delivery of the new Lyon over to midwicket, where he\u2019s scored the bulk of this 18 runs in the 56 minutes since lunch. Kohli plays the off-spinner with respect, these two continuing their fine rivalry that has extended across five Test series and eight years now. To the final ball, the Indian captain uses the crease to get back, turning two to fine leg. 35th over: India 130-2 (Pujara 33, Kohli 4) Kohli is booed by the SCG crowd as he walks out, then again when they announce his name. The response from the Indian fans in the O\u2019Reilly and Trumper Stands is to roar even louder again in support of their number one. After watching a couple of balls from Hazlewood the superstar is off the mark with a glooooooooorious cover drive, on the up through the gap, no need to run for that. It\u2019s a stunningly beautiful shot. This should be fun. What?! Agarwal holes out! After smashing Lyon straight over his head for a second six earlier in the over, he went again at the final ball of the set and didn\u2019t get to the pitch, caught by Starc running around at long-on. Yes, that\u2019s how he was scoring but he\u2019s really thrown away a ton there. Well done Lyon, getting the wicket-taking ball to dip. 34th over: India 126-2 (Pujara 33) 33rd over: India 119-1 (Agarwal 71, Pujara 32) Hazlewood replaces Cummins from the Paddington End but it doesn\u2019t slow Agarwal, who is straight onto the front foot pushing one to midwicket. After watching the action from the non-strikers\u2019 end, Pujara makes the most of his chance to nail a cut shot forward of point, slamming into the boundary in front of the Bill O\u2019Reilly Stand. Have that. The NSW quick finds an extra yard later in the over, hitting him on the handle of the bat. Tasty cricket. 32nd over: India 113-1 (Agarwal 70, Pujara 27) Lyon is on and Agarwal is after him, dancing and clobbering the first ball of his new spell for SIX! Hazlewood was there on the long-on rope but the opener took him on and the lofted shot just had the legs to clear him. Such bold batting, fantastic to watch. Lyon bounces straight back, creating an error with Agarwal nearly spooning a catch back from a delivery that bounced more. Pujara\u2019s turn, who grabs a couple to cover to bring up the 100-run stand between the pair, the second 50 coming in 75 balls. Nine off the over; these two are flying. 31st over: India 104-1 (Agarwal 63, Pujara 25) \u201cThis is a dangerous period for Australia,\u201d Simon Katich says on SEN when Agarwal pulls Cummins off his hip for another four to start the over. It sure is. They have tried to bounce the opener out and it hasn\u2019t worked, coming out the other end of the barrage in lovely shape. Fuller now, he\u2019s driving a couple more before keeping the strike with another off the body. India have piled on 42 runs in the last ten overs with Agarwal well on his way to a maiden ton. 30th over: India 97-1 (Agarwal 56, Pujara 25) Lovely batting, the new Indian opener Agarwal staying still in the crease to square drive Starc for four, raising his half-century with the fine stroke from his 96th delivery. He keeps pushing through the over, driving a couple down the ground from the next ball and cutting the last delivery hard past point. It\u2019s ever so close to another boundary, Siddle the sub managing to save the fourth run with a outstretched hand, as confirmed by the third umpire after 70 or 80 replays. \u201cHappy New Year, Adam.\u201d And to you, Ian Forth. \u201cOnly three Indians have retired after 20+ tests with an average of 50+ and they are the predictable trio of Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. Heady company for Pujara. Numerous Aussies feature but only two retired with a 60+ average. Of course, the predictable duo of Bradman and Voges.\u201d 29th over: India 88-1 (Agarwal 47, Pujara 25) More good batting from Agarwal, inching closer to a half-century with a compact push through cover for a couple then a pull around the corner to fine leg. That\u2019ll do nicely. Pujara defends the rest of the Cummins over, banged in short of a length but not bothering him this time. 28th over: India 85-1 (Agarwal 44, Pujara 25) Starc to Pujara, who waits for a ball on his pads, which he clips away for two more. By his standards, he\u2019s positively motoring since lunch. The bouncer follows to finich, the No3 not getting out the way of it, the ball coming off his arm into the cordon, falling just short. Expect a lot more of that. 27th over: India 83-1 (Agarwal 44, Pujara 23) Runs! Three to begin when Pujara turns a full Cummins ball through midwicket for his second consecutive three, then five wides via a bouncer gone wrong, clearing everyone and slamming into the boundary. Agarwal defends then evades the rest of the attack, directed at his body for now. Blimey, this is a development: Sony are refusing to take Kerry O\u2019Keefe\u2019s commentary from Fox, so they are doing their own into India from the studio when he\u2019s on the mic. 26th over: India 75-1 (Agarwal 44, Pujara 20) Starc rather than Lyon to begin from the Randwick End and after Agarwal defends a quick delivery off the back foot, Labuschagne is audible on the commentary getting excited at short leg. Tim Paine did say yesterday that one of the Queenslander\u2019s best selling points it that \u201che doesn\u2019t shut up\u201d so, playing to his strengths there I guess. The opener then takes one through the gap at cover with a nice punch, Pujara placing three the other side of point along the ground to finish the productive over. Nice re-start from these two. 25th over: India 71-1 (Agarwal 43, Pujara 17) Pujara starts the new stanza with a single off Cummins behind square leg. I see on TV that his career average is now exactly 50, satisfying the obsessive-compulsive part of my brain. There are two catchers in on the legside - a bad pad and a leg gully - for Agarwal, who gloved a couple into that region before the break. He handles it well this time though, getting the full face of the bat to a delivery on his hip, down to fine leg to get his first run after lunch. This was a nice bit on Fox Cricket at lunch with Brendan Lyon, brother of Nathan. He\u2019s been widely credited with the Australian offie\u2019s improvement with the bat this summer. The players are back on the field! Mark Waugh on TV is calling for some short stuff at Pujara (16), which worked [after a day] against him in Melbourne. India are resuming on 69/1 with Agarwal (42) well on his way to a second half-century in as many Tests. Cummins has the ball in his hand, running away from my OBO position at the Paddington End. PLAY! From the vault. I remember watching this from the Clive Churchill Stand. Happy New Year! Thank you Geoff for that illuminating session. I just spotted Darren Lehmann in the lunch queue and had half a mind to tell him that he\u2019d been badly snubbed in the Baldrick XI. Lovely OBO areas. India, once again, sucked the energy out of Australia\u2019s opening attack, just as they did in Melbourne on the opening day. Take note Australian top order: this is how you go about winning a Test Match. To begin, a community service announcement to those in Sydney at a loose end: get along! There\u2019s nobody here. By that, what I mean is the SCG is at least a third empty with seats all over the ground. Indeed, if you want a full row to yourself, that won\u2019t be a problem. Remember a couple of summers ago when the SCG Trust said that they should have a second Test here each summer? Yeah, pull the other one. We\u2019re about ten minutes away from the resumption for this second session and I\u2019m looking forward to your company throughout. Drop me a line, ping me a tweet, give me your all and I\u2019ll do the same. India\u2019s session. Once again they batted slowly and carefully, and weren\u2019t worried about the run rate. Once again Australia created plenty of close moments. And once again, the Indian batsmen defended and survived, and have given themselves the chance to prosper. Starc tried the pitched-up swing, then the barrage. Hazlewood took the only wicket to fall, nicking off KL Rahul which is currently not the greatest challenge in world cricket. But Agarwal followed up an impressive Melbourne debut by once more looking the part, while Che Pujara continued his excellent series. After some final late votes, here\u2019s our Baldrick XI. I would have liked to get Gooch in there but he betrayed us with Advanced Hair. Good seam-bowling options, a classic English captain with an amateur\u2019s stats, and the greatest NZ bowling action of all time. We\u2019re set. Bald XI 1. Virender Sehwag 2. Brian Close 3. Hashim Amla 4. Jonathan Trott 5. Viv Richards 6. Ben Stokes 7. Syed Kirmani 8. Chris Harris 9. Nathan Lyon 10. Doug The Rug Bollinger 11. Frank Typhoon Tyson Edit: I can\u2019t believe I forgot Clarrie Grimmett. He\u2019s even good enough and bald enough to nudge out the G.O.A.T. That\u2019s it from me, Adam Collins will accompany you until tea. 24th over: India 69-1 (Agarwal 42, Pujara 16) The umpires race to squeeze one more over in before lunch, because the rate is dire this morning. Pujara uses his feet confidently against Lyon, coming down to find a single, then goes back to cut another. Four singles take the score easily on to 69, very nice. There\u2019s a quick stumping referral, but Agarwal is back. He blocks the last, and that will be lunch. 23rd over: India 65-1 (Agarwal 40, Pujara 14) He\u2019s hit! Pujara gets hit in the head by Hazlewood. Nasty one, hit the back of the helmet as Pujara ducked and took his eyes off the ball. Everyone has a shiver of concern at the SCG seeing that. There\u2019s a long delay as Pujara gets checked, but eventually he takes his new helmet and plays on. Receives another bouncer. Evades it. 22nd over: India 64-1 (Agarwal 39, Pujara 14) And Agarwal has triumphed! Mitch Starc ends his opening epic, and Nathan Lyon comes on for the first time today. That\u2019s a big win for the opening batsman. He and Pujara take a single apiece from the familiar comfort of off-spin. 21st over: India 62-1 (Agarwal 38, Pujara 13) Hazlewood carries on the bouncer attack to Agarwal, while mixing in some length deliveries. But it doesn\u2019t work. The opener remains. A few other votes for Sanath Jayasuriya in the Bald XI, who was as polished as they come, but he\u2019s in the naughty corner at the moment. Ruth Purdue suggests Shane Warne, but he\u2019s gone to such extreme medical lengths to appear forested that he could never qualify on ethical grounds. We need players who embrace the chrome. 20th over: India 62-1 (Agarwal 38, Pujara 13) Starc will continue. A ninth over straight. A few people were scornful after Melbourne about the supposed need for all-rounders, saying the frontline bowlers weren\u2019t doing that much work. If this is a response, Starc is humming a song by Sia: \u201cUh-oh, I\u2019ve got stamina.\u201d Very attacking field, too. No one protecting a run on the leg side. Bat-pad catchers either side of the wicket, unusual for a fast bowler. Harris at silly mid-off almost takes a catch as Agarwal fends a ball away. But the batsman once again survives the barrage. 19th over: India 61-1 (Agarwal 37, Pujara 13) As soon as a bowler pitches full, Agarwal edges. But again it\u2019s through the cordon for four. Hazlewood with the near miss. Bowls a bouncer to follow up, of course, then pitches fuller for a check-drive through the covers for three. So the runs are flowing again. 18th over: India 54-1 (Agarwal 30, Pujara 13) Starc carries on with this short-ball attack, but it isn\u2019t getting Agarwal out. He\u2019s riding out the storm, and Starc can\u2019t keep going forever. He\u2019s bowled eight overs on the bounce! Now. Bald bowlers. I\u2019m getting a few shouts for Chris Lewis, but his baldness was self-imposed. And a couple for Chris Martin, the Phantom. But he always struck me as a buzzcut man rather than a natural defoliator? Am I wrong? But the answer comes through, and once you see it, it\u2019s so obvious. Matthew Williams and a few others have the suggestion. \u201cDoug \u2018The Rug; Bollinger. They performed the heat map analysis on his head. It was fantastic.\u201d And he stripped the rug in the end, so he qualifies on every front. 17th over: India 53-1 (Agarwal 29, Pujara 13) If Cheteshwar Pujara were a bird, he\u2019d never get airborne. Unflappable. And entirely grounded. Low in his stance, compact in his strokes, able to defend whatever Josh Hazlewood sends down. Middling the ball first to point, then to square leg, but all he cares about is keeping it away from his stumps. \u201cSehwag hardly had any hair in the later years,\u201d emails SH. True that, there\u2019s our other opener. Where are my fast bowlers, though? David Meiklejohn has the answer. Frank Tyson. The Typhoon who looked like an accountant. Hell yes. 16th over: India 53-1 (Agarwal 29, Pujara 13) Agarwal fends away another Starc nasty off the glove for a single. Pujara looks much more composed in pressing a run into the leg side. Happy to put Agarwal back on strike: there ya go, champion. 15th over: India 51-1 (Agarwal 28, Pujara 12) Tim Paine reviews, after Cummins beats Pujara on the inside edge. But Marais Erasmus on the video forensics finds that the ball beat the inside edge and clipped the trouser pocket just after it passed the bat. That is a sensational decision, because there was a noise at just the right time. It convinced Paine, who was the one pushing for the review while Cummins was non-committal. Maiden. \u201cIf you are still looking for batsmen,\u201d writes Simon of our hairless quest, \u201chow about Amla?\u201d Great call. It\u2019s all hair from the ears down, none from the ears up. Bradman and de Villiers were both pretty short on top, but that\u2019s too easy. Dylan Wilson wants Tony Greig, Matthew Doherty wants South African domestic bowler Vince van der Bilj, who was indeed very bald but played all his cricket during apartheid isolation. Here\u2019s where I\u2019m at. We need some quicks. Nixon McLean? Vasbert Drakes? 1. 2. Brian Close 3. Hashim Amla 4. 5. Viv Richards 6. Tony Greig 7. Syed Kirmani 8. Chris Harris 9. 10. Nathan Lyon 11. 14th over: India 51-1 (Agarwal 28, Pujara 12) Get out of the way! Mitchell Starc is getting stroppy now. He\u2019s sick of being driven, so he bowls most of the over short at Agarwal. The last ball is the nastiest of the lot, up towards the head. Agarwal leaps and flinches, arching his back like a breaching dolphin, and the ball takes his gloves and maybe bat handle and clips the helmet, pogo-ing over the slip cordon and safely away for four! That was dramatic. But he survives, and the score passes 50. There\u2019s a delay as Agarwal gets checked by the physio and changes his helmet. 13th over: India 47-1 (Agarwal 24, Pujara 12) Cummins to continue after the bodily hydration interval. A single from the over. \u201cGood morning Geoff,\u201d writes Ravi Raman. \u201cSyed Kirmani is available for selection to the Clean Head XI.\u201d Glad we\u2019ve got a wicketkeeper, so far I\u2019m heavy on slow bowlers. Wait, here are some batsmen from Ian Forth. \u201cHappy New Year, Geoff. I\u2019d give a great deal to be on the Bald XI balcony when Boycott, Close and Sir Viv Richards were deciding when to declare. Also if Boycs had just instructed Matt Prior to go out and throw the bat, \u2018don\u2019t worry about your average\u2019.\u201d Ian, if we\u2019ve got Vic in the team, Boycott isn\u2019t getting anywhere near it. Ricky Ponting had a pretty fair helicopter pad by the end of his career, didn\u2019t he? 12th over: India 46-1 (Agarwal 23, Pujara 12) Starc into his fifth over, and Agarwal drives him majestically for four! That ball was wider, and the batsman stepped into it and used the full swing and the full flourish in sending it to the cover boundary. That was pretty. I saw a few people on the internet talking up the green pitch this morning, and using that dangerous phrase \u201cgood toss to lose\u201d. Incorrect. Starc follows up with a couple of bouncers, one too high, but one that makes Agarwal fend away towards a vacant leg gully region. That\u2019s drinks. James Walsh emails in. \u201cWhat\u2019s been so great about this series - and, indeed, Test matches this past year generally - is the whole concept of the draw feels increasingly like Grandpa Simpson explaining the fashion for onion-enhanced belts.\u201d Spot on \u2013 there was only one flat-track batting draw in 2018. Even the other couple of draws we had were exciting ones where rearguards held on. Australia in Dubai, Sri Lanka in New Zealand, and New Zealand and against England spring to mind. 11th over: India 41-1 (Agarwal 18, Pujara 12) How does Mayank Agarwal still not have a bat sponsor? He\u2019s the best opener India have used this series, without a doubt. Drives Cummins through cover again for four. Then a leg bye after Agarwal\u2019s hit on the body. Cummins didn\u2019t like that shot. I can sign a statutory declaration that Aditya Anchuri sent this before Rahul got out. \u201cI hope I\u2019m mistaken, but again India have made a massive selection blunder by bringing back KL Rahul. Honestly would have stuck with Vihari opening and brought in Hardik Pandya or Bhuvneshwar Kumar instead. This side is too spin heavy. If neither Pandya or Bhuvneshwar are match fit then they should be playing Ranji Trophy, not enjoying a nice Aussie holiday in the New Year.\u201d Can\u2019t believe that Bhuvi hasn\u2019t played a Test this tour. 10th over: India 36-1 (Agarwal 14, Pujara 12) Another good over from Starc, bringing a couple of leaves from Agarwal, then making him play as the line crept close to off stump. Just a single from the last ball as it got too straight. We\u2019re getting a lot of mail about Australia\u2019s selection. Says Rob: \u201cAnytime you can weaken your already weak batting lineup to introduce a 6th bowling option, you just have to do it. On a more serious note, do you think if Khawaja had opened and Finch batted #5 from the start of the series, it might have been slightly better?\u201d Slightly, yes, though Usman hasn\u2019t exactly set the world alight this series either. But Finch did well opening in the UAE, so it\u2019s understandable to give him a run and see if it worked. \u201cDoes anyone know who Maxwell has upset, and how?\u201d asks Grif. \u201cThe longer it goes on the less it looks like a cricketing decision. We\u2019ll look after him in sunny Manchester and show him some love, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be able to feel the adulation through his three sweaters in early April.\u201d \u201cAre they serious with these selections? I think I\u2019m going to treat Australian team selection like string theory or car engines. Complicated mysteries of the universe that are beyond my understanding.\u201d That email is apparently from David Warner, but I\u2019m going out on a limb to speculate that it\u2019s not our David Warner. 9th over: India 35-1 (Agarwal 13, Pujara 12) Defending, leaving, defending, then from the last ball of the Cummins over, Pujara stretches forward and opens the face a touch and steers a length ball into the ground past gully for four. I\u2019m giving him that one. 8th over: India 31-1 (Agarwal 13, Pujara 8) \u201cTropical Cyclone Penny is reforming in the Coral Sea,\u201d says the news report, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s referring to a weather system or a punk band. Hazlewood continues from the Randwick End, with the Clive Churchill Stand at his back. Pujara drives a single, Agarwal keeps out the rest. 7th over: India 30-1 (Agarwal 13, Pujara 7) First change, and it\u2019s Patrick Cummins. And listen to the ovation! They love it, this NSW crowd, even though both those bowlers are from this state. This over doesn\u2019t work so well for Cummins as some recent ones in Melbourne though, as Agarwal twice drives a brace into the off side, then feels sufficiently warmed up to play a crisp cover drive from the last ball for four. Raymond Reardon has had his imagination excited by my toupee reference, and is asking if there\u2019s a best XI of balding cricketers. Well, off the top of my head... Hanuma Vihari has to be in there, for his Kingpin work in Perth. Nathan Lyon, for the very public forum of his change, starting with a lush head of hair when he dismissed Kumar Sangakkara on debut in Galle in 2011, to the streamlined shaved look he has now, following Jimeoin\u2019s edict of \u201cYou can go, but you\u2019ll go now on my terms.\u201d Chris Harris would have to get a gig, for his flying-saucer bowling approach. And Ashton Agar, for his dramatically abrupt and tragically youthful change from teen dream to billiard equipment. 6th over: India 22-1 (Agarwal 5, Pujara 7) That\u2019s more like the Pujara we know and love. Vigil mode, as he sees out a Hazlewood maiden. 5th over: India 22-1 (Agarwal 5, Pujara 7) Nice delivery! Starc finds the inswinger with the new ball, threatening Agarwal, but this is a good opening batsman that India have found. He waits back, plays it late and squeezes it away behind square for three runs. Pujara is up for it this morning, he glances two and then checks a single out to cover, good sharp running. \u201cWhat\u2019s your prognosis for this Test, Doc Lemon? I plump for a draw, and so an Indian series.\u201d Please, Andrew Benton \u2013 Doctor Lemon is my father. Call me Zesty. But I don\u2019t know where the draw\u2019s coming from, unless you know about a Biblical deluge that the rest of us haven\u2019t been told about. I\u2019ll go on the line to predict that India will romp this in, given Australia\u2019s batting. 4th over: India 16-1 (Agarwal 2, Pujara 4) There is something almost sensual in Cowan\u2019s voice describing Pujara. \u201cHe plays the ball so late... softly squirting out to gully.\u201d I\u2019ll leave that image with you. Pujara gently wrists a couple of runs off his ankles to midwicket. Then repeats the dose to a shorter ball off the hip. Defended the rest. Black armbands ahoy, the Australians for former Test cricketer Billy Watson, and the Indians for Ramakant Achrekar, who coached Sachin Tendulkar. 3rd over: India 12-1 (Agarwal 2, Pujara 0) Agarwal off the mark as Starc pitches full, and a checked defensive shot fetches two past the bowler. Plays the shorter ball well, defending on his toes. Remember you can contact me via Twitter or on the email: Mirza Nurkic on the latter is claiming one of the anthems from earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s called Mirza on the dancefloor,\u201d is the claim. I\u2019ll allow it. 2nd over: India 10-1 (Agarwal 0, Pujara 0) A win for Hazlewood in his first over, as Pujara comes to the crease shadow-batting a forward defensive the whole way. That didn\u2019t take long. Rahul edges the first ball of JH\u2019s over into the ground again, coming half-forward and softly at the ball. But the third ball hits higher on the bat, towards the shoulder, and there\u2019s no keeping those ones down. Straight into the cordon where Marsh waits at first slip. 1st over: India 6-0 (Agarwal 0, Rahul 5) Away we go. Starc with the new ball, coming in with the Bradman Stand behind him from the Paddington End. An unconvincing start for both batsmen, Agarwal missing a full ball and surviving an appeal as it was angling down leg, then after he takes a leg bye, Rahul edges along the ground through gully for four. Then an inside edge for one, and Agarwal is beaten outside off by a beauty. Agarwal replaced Rahul in the last Test, but now they\u2019re playing a match together, as childhood friends who had a distant dream of doing exactly this. Nice stuff, though Starc wants to make it as brief as possible. Another play-and-miss ends the over. \u201cThat\u2019s the best over with the new ball Mitch Starc has bowled this summer,\u201d says Ed Cowan on ABC radio. \u201cThe key was the length.\u201d Great Southern Land is also arguably an anthem, and it echoes around the SCG as the teams walk out to the middle: eleven Australians and two Indians, and two Englishmen officiating: Kettleborough and Gould. Hold onto your toupees, we\u2019re about to take flight. This is an anthem. Need I go on? This is an anthem. Anthem time, everyone standing at the SCG. Pah. This is an anthem. This is... appealingly niche. When\u2019s the last time two left-arm spinners played as specialist bowlers? India are missing two Sharmas: Rohit is at home for the birth of his child, and Ishant has a rib injury. Ravi Ashwin is also not quite fit, so Ravindra Jadeja will retain his place, while the wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav will come in for Ishant. In the batting, Hanuma Vihari will drop from opener to No6 to replace Rohit, while KL Rahul comes back as opener. Got it? For Australia, Finch is out, Khawaja will open, Labuschagne at three, as speculated. Meanwhile, down the order, Peter Handscomb will come in for Mitchell Marsh. Paine stays at No7, with the same bowling quartet as the previous three Tests. India Agarwal Rahul Pujara Kohli Rahane Vihari Pant Jadeja Kuldeep Shami Bumrah Australia Harris Khawaja Labuschagne Shaun Marsh Head Handscomb Paine Cummins Starc Lyon Hazlewood Yep. That\u2019s it. Australia\u2019s job just got a whole lot harder. Kohli says \u201cit looks like a good wicket with some covering of grass on it, it will get tougher and tougher to bat and the spinners later will come into the game.\u201d Now then. It\u2019s been all but confirmed that Marnus Labuschagne will bat at No3. Fair enough in a way, he bats there for Queensland. Not so fair enough in another way, in that he averages 28 with the bat in the Shield this season, which isn\u2019t exactly your first criterion for your Test first drop. Speaking of, that means Aaron Finch will be the first drop of the day, out of the team with Usman Khawaja to open the batting. It\u2019s mostly a dubious call because the alibi for getting Labuschagne into the team was because he can bowl leg-spin, and Justin Langer and co. wanted another bowling option. But then, that\u2019s an entirely pointless move given the SCG hasn\u2019t offered anything to spinners in about a decade. A crazy selection choice, given Mitch Marsh couldn\u2019t find a run in Melbourne, might have been bringing in the next-best batsman in the country. For the next 17 minutes while selection dilemmas still exist, you can enjoy Adam Collins\u2019 preview about selection dilemmas. In 18 minutes we\u2019ll only have selection regrets. I\u2019d like to think that the Mudgee Guardian is our sister paper. What say you, Mudgee Guardian? We\u2019re 20 minutes from the toss. We don\u2019t have teams as yet, because both sides are still considering their options, or keeping the others guessing. There are a few permutations going about. The surface this morning is as follows. It\u2019s Test match, it\u2019s Test match time. (You know when I\u2019m wearing my Test match socks that means it\u2019s Test match time.) Happy 2019 to all you cricketing miscreants and layabouts and ruffians, and the respectable members of society amongst your number too. Here we go from Sydney, home of Moreton Bay figs and Kenneth Slessor, citadel of humidity and flashes of sparkling blue. The bridge is lit, the teams are gathered, and we\u2019re about to embark on the final voyage of this series to see whether India can mark a first ever series win in Australia, or whether the home side can claw back to 2-2.",

      "bodyText": "Earthworks for a new lithium hydroxide factory in Western Australia are expected to begin this month after the $1bn project received federal environmental approval. The plant owned by the world\u2019s largest lithium producer, the US chemical company Albemarle, was approved by the WA government in October and is estimated to create up to 500 jobs in construction, with another 100 to 500 operational jobs once it is operational. Australia\u2019s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the plant would provide a much-needed local jobs boost and supply a growing global demand for lithium, which is used in renewable energy storage. \u201cThis is a welcome investment and vote of confidence in our local lithium industry that will help attract further investment into the future,\u201d Birmingham said. Albemarle announced on Thursday that earthworks at the site at Kemerton Strategic Industrial Estate, just north of Bunbury, were on track to begin soon. \u201cAchieving this milestone underscores our commitment and confidence in developing LiOH [lithium hydroxide] operations and in our overall strategy to drive significant shareholder value and meet our customers\u2019 demands,\u201d said Eric Norris, the president of Albemarle\u2019s lithium division. The plant will process spodumene ore from the Greenbushes lithium mine, about 90km south of the industrial estate, and produce 60,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide annually with capacity to expand to 100,000 tonnes. It will also produce a byproduct of up to 200,000 tonnes of sodium sulfate, and a million tonnes of tailings per annum. The company has been ordered to identify a new breeding and foraging habitat for WA\u2019s three threatened black cockatoo species \u2013 Carnaby\u2019s cockatoo, Forest red-tailed cockatoo, and Baudin\u2019s black cockatoo \u2013 to offset habitat lost by clearing the 89ha plant site, including 54ha of coastal plain vegetation that is home to a number of threatened native orchids. The director of the Conservation Council of Western Australia, Piers Verstegen, said the environmental impacts of the project were \u201cmanageable\u201d. \u201cWe think on the whole it\u2019s a positive development for the south-west and one that could provide an alternative source of employment to the coal-based jobs in Collie,\u201d Verstegen said. Collie, about 70km east of Bunbury, is home to four of WA\u2019s five coal-fired power stations, fed by two open-cut coalmines. The Albemarle plan will run on gas, but Verstegen said he hoped the company would look into running it on renewable power. WA is the world\u2019s largest producer of lithium, and the plant at Kemerton is the second significant lithium hydroxide manufacturing plant approved in the state since 2016. The state established a task force aimed at promoting the lithium industry last year, and the premier, Mark McGowan, met with the directors of Albemarle on a trip to Washington DC in February.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a Sunday morning and I\u2019m on Rue Mouffetard, a bustling market street in Paris, skulking behind a pyramid of nectarines. My sights are set on a fluffy black poodle nuzzling the ankles of its owner, a stripey-trousered woman of a certain age.</p> <p>Raising my camera to my eye, I risk a few furtive shots but, irritatingly, the poodle keeps scampering out of the frame.

Like many amateur camera operators, I\u2019m a fan of the genre and the vintage work of stars such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/17/saul-leiter-review-foto-colectania-barcelona\" title=\"\">Saul Leiter </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/dec/27/photography\" title=\"\">Elliott Erwitt</a>. But the logistics are challenging. Since buying my first DSLR a few years ago, I have spent many hours pacing the streets of London in search of inspiration. People tend not to like a total stranger following them around taking photos of them and, as I am acutely aware of this, my compositions are frequently rushed and taken from peculiar angles. Magnum photographer Robert Capa\u2019s adage, \u201cIf your photos aren\u2019t good enough, you\u2019re not close enough,\u201d certainly applied to me, but I had no idea how to overcome it.</p> <p>Then, one day, inspiration struck. I was listening to <a href=\"https://valeriejardinphotography.com/podcast/\" title=\"\">the photography podcast Hit the Streets</a> when I heard its host, Val\u00e9rie Jardin, mention upcoming workshops in Paris. These sounded like exactly what I needed. Now I\u2019m here, I\u2019m not so sure.</p> <p>\u201cRemember, you\u2019re not doing anything wrong,\u201d Jardin, an energetic Frenchwoman, had told me. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/apr/18/street-photography-privacy-surveillance\" title=\"\">You\u2019re documenting life on the street</a>, which is important. It\u2019s best to start with a busy, touristy area where everyone has a camera. You\u2019ll feel more invisible. Not only is a lot happening, with plenty to catch your eye, but you\u2019ll be more at ease because of the crowd.\u201d</p> <p>The trouble is, that morning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/camera-club-blog/2011/nov/15/amateur-street-photography-camera-club\" title=\"\">I\u2019m not feeling remotely at ease</a>. \u201cIf you\u2019re nervous about going in close to people with your camera, photograph dogs \u2013 owners are always so proud of them,\u201d Jardin had suggested. \u201cCompliment the dog and then you can work your way up to asking for a photo of its owner, too.\u201d I snap the poodle again. The poodle looks confused. Its owner gives me a look that doesn\u2019t encourage me to ask if she would like to be photographed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12d8320d7ef134394138c6fc10610935d71de5fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12d8320d7ef134394138c6fc10610935d71de5fb/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Start with a poodle, then work your way up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Start with a poodle, then work your way up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anita Chaudhury/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We had begun the workshop by going through some of Jardin\u2019s work: highly stylised images of impeccably dressed people with a strong emphasis on dramatic natural light and silhouettes. Within minutes, my creative lethargy dissipated. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me before, but much of contemporary street photography and the way it is taught has a kind of \u201cGotcha!\u201d sensibility, where the onus is on viewing subjects as victims. Jardin\u2019s beautiful photos, while still obviously \u201cstreet\u201d, have a different quality. They are photos you might want to hang on your wall rather than expect to see in the pages of a tabloid \u2013 a far cry from the in-your-face quality seen in the work of star snappers such as Bruce Gilden, Martin Parr and Dougie Wallace.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m more and more resistant to calling myself a street photographer,\u201d Jardin had confided. \u201cI\u2019m recording life\u2019s beautiful moments, ordinary moments that become extraordinary when you freeze them in time. Street photography is one of the most difficult genres to master. You have no control over what other people are going to do, only control over your gear and your vision. There\u2019s a lot of luck involved, but without vision, luck doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>When Jardin takes me on to the streets, the biggest surprise is observing the simplicity of her camera settings. I suppose I had imagined there was some secret shutter-speed formula that would render light beautifully, if only someone would share it with me. In fact, she scarcely bothers with manual mode. Instead, her laser-like attention is on the people around her, and on the light.</p> <p>\u201cI never bring the camera to my eye; it\u2019s all done here,\u201d she says, tapping the LCD screen of her black-and-silver Fujifilm X100F. I would never have tried what the experts call \u201cshooting from the hip\u201d if I had been on my own, believing it was beyond me. But my coach is confident I can do it. \u201cThe trick is to always shoot at the same focal length; in time your eye will know exactly what you\u2019re going to get before you even press the shutter.\u201d</p> <p>Several shots of cobblestones and a dog\u2019s front paws later, I\u2019m getting the hang of it. One thing is for sure: people are a lot less bothered by my presence without a camera at my eye. I sneak a glance at a woman engrossed in Le Journal du Dimanche and press the button. Now that I\u2019ve turned off my camera\u2019s beeps, as suggested, things are a lot easier. I relax and start to have fun. \u201cI like the humour in your work,\u201d declares Jardin, when we review our images. \u201cKeep at it \u2013 I think you will get there.\u201d I\u2019m not even sure where \u201cthere\u201d is, but I feel 10ft tall.</p> <p>Back home, I resolve to be bolder about the photos I take. But despite following Jardin\u2019s advice to practise a different technique every day (silhouettes one day, panning the next), the discipline quickly becomes aimless and I feel deflated. Why am I doing this?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f31802bcddc6f039b48a07e8c21a08c59dd761df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f31802bcddc6f039b48a07e8c21a08c59dd761df/0_0_3367_5051/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jardin says: \u2018If you\u2019re going to shoot people from the back, it has to be super-interesting.\u2019\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jardin says: \u2018If you\u2019re going to shoot people from the back, it has to be super-interesting.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anita Chaudhury/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jardin agrees to give me some Skype coaching. During our first session she says I\u2019m facing a common problem. \u201cIf you go aimlessly into town with your camera, you\u2019re just going to get the same bunch of average shots of the same boring thing. What you want is a project that you can do anywhere, even if you\u2019re travelling or the weather is bad.\u201d Jardin has several such projects on the go, including people looking at modern art, beautiful smiles of strangers and hands. \u201cThe subject itself doesn\u2019t matter, but it should be something that you\u2019re naturally drawn to, so that you keep going with it.\u201d</p> <p>She is also keen to impress upon me that the scattergun approach I had been adopting wasn\u2019t likely to get the best results. \u201cBe discerning \u2013 don\u2019t settle!\u201d This was one of the benefits of having worked on the street directly with her; it soon became apparent that 95% of her time is spent observing and predicting people\u2019s behaviour. Being discerning about pressing the shutter is a skill I needed to learn.</p> <p>Suitably inspired, I choose two subject areas that I\u2019m always drawn to: London shoppers and reflections. Jardin books me in for a follow-up session so she can assess what I\u2019ve been up to. I must admit, this accountability in itself makes a huge difference. Just as I am slacking off on the whole thing, up pops a message from her: \u201cHow\u2019s the project going?\u201d That is enough to get me moving again.</p> <p>Over the course of a month, I assemble two albums and then narrow them down to five photos each. Some are new, some are images I had previously taken that fitted the theme. This is another thing I learned from Jardin \u2013 photography isn\u2019t just about taking photos. You want to create a body of work by editing your images and grouping them together in a meaningful collection. Like a lot of people, I take loads of photos and then do nothing with them.</p> <p>At our final critique session, I must confess that I\u2019m a little nervous. There is a particular mortification associated with presenting a photo to an expert and awaiting feedback. Whatever genre you favour, quite a lot can go awry with an image. Certainly, Jardin is robust in her observations about how each of my shots could be improved and is quick to pick up on recurring technical errors and bad habits. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to shoot people from the back, it has to be super-interesting. Far better to run ahead of people and catch them from the front further up the street.\u201d And: \u201cAgain, you\u2019ve shown too much detail of the surrounding buildings. I wish you\u2019d gone in closer to your subject. If you can\u2019t bear to do that, then get a longer lens.\u201d</p> <p>But she is also warm-hearted and generous with her praise.</p> <p>\u201cI love, love, love the man outside the shop with the bag. He looks as still as the mannequins in the store. And the Caf\u00e9 Rouge one, it\u2019s my favourite. I love the interconnection between the human element and the backdrop. Bus, red building, red coat. That shows you visualised the strongest possible subject and then you were patient.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8aad5c9bb3e8623ccbcf5a53d89113eafdd539aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8aad5c9bb3e8623ccbcf5a53d89113eafdd539aa/0_0_4862_3241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One that Jardin liked.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One that Jardin liked: \u2018I love the interconnection between the human element and the backdrop.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anita Chaudhury/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She even goes so far as to suggest I enter some shots to a photo competition, something I would never have thought about doing. She also puts things into perspective: \u201cYou should be really happy to have got so many good shots. Many street photographers believe a strike rate of one in 100 is good going.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, having a professional scrutinise both my work and my working methods has been a revelation. It has made me stop dwelling on the skills I lack (such as photographing anything that is moving faster than a snail). Instead, I\u2019ve started to appreciate what is unique about my photos: colour, drama, texture; things I would never have noticed on my own.</p> <p>Most significant of all about working with a creative coach is that, because they take you seriously, you start taking yourself seriously. I now print my photos and have produced cards using the images. I\u2019m also going to start a photography foundation course in 2019, something I previously lacked the confidence to pursue. Who knows, I might even start a project about dogs and their owners.</p> <p><em>Val\u00e9rie Jardin is the author of </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/street-photography-523890.html\" title=\"\"><em>Street Photography: Creative Vision Behind the Lens</em></a><em>. </em><em>Her workshops are at </em><a href=\"http://valeriejardinphotography.com/workshop-registration/\" title=\"\"><em>valeriejardinphotography.com</em></a><em> </em></p>",

Now I\u2019m here, I\u2019m not so sure. \u201cRemember, you\u2019re not doing anything wrong,\u201d Jardin, an energetic Frenchwoman, had told me. \u201cYou\u2019re documenting life on the street, which is important. It\u2019s best to start with a busy, touristy area where everyone has a camera. You\u2019ll feel more invisible. Not only is a lot happening, with plenty to catch your eye, but you\u2019ll be more at ease because of the crowd.\u201d The trouble is, that morning I\u2019m not feeling remotely at ease. \u201cIf you\u2019re nervous about going in close to people with your camera, photograph dogs \u2013 owners are always so proud of them,\u201d Jardin had suggested. \u201cCompliment the dog and then you can work your way up to asking for a photo of its owner, too.\u201d I snap the poodle again. The poodle looks confused. Its owner gives me a look that doesn\u2019t encourage me to ask if she would like to be photographed. We had begun the workshop by going through some of Jardin\u2019s work: highly stylised images of impeccably dressed people with a strong emphasis on dramatic natural light and silhouettes. Within minutes, my creative lethargy dissipated. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me before, but much of contemporary street photography and the way it is taught has a kind of \u201cGotcha!\u201d sensibility, where the onus is on viewing subjects as victims. Jardin\u2019s beautiful photos, while still obviously \u201cstreet\u201d, have a different quality. They are photos you might want to hang on your wall rather than expect to see in the pages of a tabloid \u2013 a far cry from the in-your-face quality seen in the work of star snappers such as Bruce Gilden, Martin Parr and Dougie Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m more and more resistant to calling myself a street photographer,\u201d Jardin had confided. \u201cI\u2019m recording life\u2019s beautiful moments, ordinary moments that become extraordinary when you freeze them in time. Street photography is one of the most difficult genres to master. You have no control over what other people are going to do, only control over your gear and your vision. There\u2019s a lot of luck involved, but without vision, luck doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d When Jardin takes me on to the streets, the biggest surprise is observing the simplicity of her camera settings. I suppose I had imagined there was some secret shutter-speed formula that would render light beautifully, if only someone would share it with me. In fact, she scarcely bothers with manual mode. Instead, her laser-like attention is on the people around her, and on the light. \u201cI never bring the camera to my eye; it\u2019s all done here,\u201d she says, tapping the LCD screen of her black-and-silver Fujifilm X100F. I would never have tried what the experts call \u201cshooting from the hip\u201d if I had been on my own, believing it was beyond me. But my coach is confident I can do it. \u201cThe trick is to always shoot at the same focal length; in time your eye will know exactly what you\u2019re going to get before you even press the shutter.\u201d Several shots of cobblestones and a dog\u2019s front paws later, I\u2019m getting the hang of it. One thing is for sure: people are a lot less bothered by my presence without a camera at my eye. I sneak a glance at a woman engrossed in Le Journal du Dimanche and press the button. Now that I\u2019ve turned off my camera\u2019s beeps, as suggested, things are a lot easier. I relax and start to have fun. \u201cI like the humour in your work,\u201d declares Jardin, when we review our images. \u201cKeep at it \u2013 I think you will get there.\u201d I\u2019m not even sure where \u201cthere\u201d is, but I feel 10ft tall. Back home, I resolve to be bolder about the photos I take. But despite following Jardin\u2019s advice to practise a different technique every day (silhouettes one day, panning the next), the discipline quickly becomes aimless and I feel deflated. Why am I doing this? Jardin agrees to give me some Skype coaching. During our first session she says I\u2019m facing a common problem. \u201cIf you go aimlessly into town with your camera, you\u2019re just going to get the same bunch of average shots of the same boring thing. What you want is a project that you can do anywhere, even if you\u2019re travelling or the weather is bad.\u201d Jardin has several such projects on the go, including people looking at modern art, beautiful smiles of strangers and hands. \u201cThe subject itself doesn\u2019t matter, but it should be something that you\u2019re naturally drawn to, so that you keep going with it.\u201d She is also keen to impress upon me that the scattergun approach I had been adopting wasn\u2019t likely to get the best results. \u201cBe discerning \u2013 don\u2019t settle!\u201d This was one of the benefits of having worked on the street directly with her; it soon became apparent that 95% of her time is spent observing and predicting people\u2019s behaviour. Being discerning about pressing the shutter is a skill I needed to learn. Suitably inspired, I choose two subject areas that I\u2019m always drawn to: London shoppers and reflections. Jardin books me in for a follow-up session so she can assess what I\u2019ve been up to. I must admit, this accountability in itself makes a huge difference. Just as I am slacking off on the whole thing, up pops a message from her: \u201cHow\u2019s the project going?\u201d That is enough to get me moving again. Over the course of a month, I assemble two albums and then narrow them down to five photos each. Some are new, some are images I had previously taken that fitted the theme. This is another thing I learned from Jardin \u2013 photography isn\u2019t just about taking photos. You want to create a body of work by editing your images and grouping them together in a meaningful collection. Like a lot of people, I take loads of photos and then do nothing with them. At our final critique session, I must confess that I\u2019m a little nervous. There is a particular mortification associated with presenting a photo to an expert and awaiting feedback. Whatever genre you favour, quite a lot can go awry with an image. Certainly, Jardin is robust in her observations about how each of my shots could be improved and is quick to pick up on recurring technical errors and bad habits. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to shoot people from the back, it has to be super-interesting. Far better to run ahead of people and catch them from the front further up the street.\u201d And: \u201cAgain, you\u2019ve shown too much detail of the surrounding buildings. I wish you\u2019d gone in closer to your subject. If you can\u2019t bear to do that, then get a longer lens.\u201d But she is also warm-hearted and generous with her praise. \u201cI love, love, love the man outside the shop with the bag. He looks as still as the mannequins in the store. And the Caf\u00e9 Rouge one, it\u2019s my favourite. I love the interconnection between the human element and the backdrop. Bus, red building, red coat. That shows you visualised the strongest possible subject and then you were patient.\u201d She even goes so far as to suggest I enter some shots to a photo competition, something I would never have thought about doing. She also puts things into perspective: \u201cYou should be really happy to have got so many good shots. Many street photographers believe a strike rate of one in 100 is good going.\u201d Ultimately, having a professional scrutinise both my work and my working methods has been a revelation. It has made me stop dwelling on the skills I lack (such as photographing anything that is moving faster than a snail). Instead, I\u2019ve started to appreciate what is unique about my photos: colour, drama, texture; things I would never have noticed on my own. Most significant of all about working with a creative coach is that, because they take you seriously, you start taking yourself seriously. I now print my photos and have produced cards using the images. I\u2019m also going to start a photography foundation course in 2019, something I previously lacked the confidence to pursue. Who knows, I might even start a project about dogs and their owners. Val\u00e9rie Jardin is the author of Street Photography: Creative Vision Behind the Lens.

      "bodyText": "The mother of a medical student facing more than 20 years in prison for protesting against the Nicaraguan government is appealing to the international community to put pressure on president Daniel Ortega\u2019s regime. Amaya Eva Coppens, a Belgian-Nicaraguan dual national, is due to stand trial in the capital Managua after being \u201cabducted\u201d in a raid by more than 30 riot police and paramilitaries on 10 September. The 24-year-old activist, who had been studying in the city of Le\u00f3n, is among more than 600 political prisoners detained since April when the state reacted with violence to demonstrations against planned social security reforms. In an emotional appeal, her mother Tamara Zamora told the Guardian: \u201cAmaya is a citizen of both Belgium and the European Union so I\u2019m calling on the international community to use their powers to apply political pressure. \u201cWe want to draw attention not only to Amaya\u2019s case, but to those of others who are less visible. We want other governments to demand an end to this dictatorship to stop the repression.\u201d Described by her family as \u201cpassionate and tenacious\u201d with a \u201cstrong social conscience\u201d, Coppens is facing charges of terrorism, possession of firearms and being an accomplice to the kidnapping of police officers. Others facing similar charges have been handed sentences of up to 30 years, according to human rights groups. Coppens was involved in the first protest on 18 April against Ortega\u2019s plan to reduce benefits for pensioners. The following day she was beaten by police but saved by her peers. She went on to become a key figure in the student movement, attending to the injured and bringing food to protesters amid a violent clampdown during which snipers targeted demonstrators under what Amnesty International described as Ortega\u2019s shoot to kill strategy. Since May, Coppens had been moving between addresses. Her two brothers moved to Belgium amid fears for their safety, but she insisted on staying. Zamora broke down in tears as she described the day her daughter was eventually tracked down. \u201cShe was at a safe house but someone had betrayed [her], reporting her location. About 30 men arrived in trucks and one put a gun to her head, saying: \u2018We\u2019ve finally got you\u2019.\u201d Coppens was taken to the El Chipote maximum security jail in Managua and held for eight days before being transferred to the La Esperanza prison for women. \u201cThe first time I was allowed to see her I felt completely heartbroken,\u201d said Zamora. \u201cI knew she was sad and could see the realisation in her face this was not going to be a short-term thing.\u201d The parents\u2019 second visit was on their daughter\u2019s 24th birthday on 31 October. \u201cShe was in much better shape and told us she had been exercising and staying strong so she could continue the fight,\u201d her mother recalled. More than 152,000 people have signed a petition to free Coppens and other political prisoners. Zamora, whose husband is Belgian, said she thinks her daughter\u2019s status as a dual national has prevented her from being tortured like other detainees. But she added: \u201cThe Belgian authorities haven\u2019t done much as there is no embassy in Nicaragua.\u201d The family was told by the consulate that assistance would be limited because only one parent is Belgian. Lawyers for the family have warned them to expect a sentence \u201cin excess of 20 years\u201d when Coppens stands trial this year. \u201cThese are political trials,\u201d said Zamora. \u201cEven if you have the best lawyer in the world our kids will be found guilty and sentenced. The only way out of this is a change in government.\u201d The husband of another detainee, 37-year-old dentist Irlanda Jerez, agreed. Daniel Esquivel said: \u201cIn terms of justice we have very little hope. The regime controls the judges and the legal system \u2013 it\u2019s a political issue and the only solution will be a political one.\u201d He explained how charges brought against his wife were a smokescreen designed to silence her. \u201cShe did not have any trouble with the government prior to the protests but she\u2019s always had strong political opinions and started sharing these widely [on social media] after we became involved in the protests,\u201d said Esquivel. The authorities soon began digging into her past to see what they could use to attack her, claims Esquivel. They found details of a property dispute in 2016 which Jerez won on appeal in the supreme court. Six vehicles surrounded her car in Managua on 18 July and Jerez was seized by armed police and subsequently charged in relation to the 2016 case. She was sentenced to five years in jail. Esquivel said the inmates continue the resistance from behind bars by singing the Nicaraguan national anthem and weaving blue and white wrist bands. But he fears for his wife\u2019s safety. She was allegedly attacked on 26 October when 20 to 25 men wielding AK47s stormed the prison.

A Belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they were doing everything possible to support her case. \u201cOur embassy based in Panama has provided consular assistance from the beginning. We have been there at each stage of her case but because she is a dual national the assistance we can provide under international law is limited,\u201d said Matthieu Branders. \u201cWe cannot intervene on judicial matters but our minister met with the Nicaraguan minister for national affairs in September at the general assembly in New York, and asked that the investigation was conducted properly to ensure a speedy release.\u201d The Nicaraguan government has not responded to a request for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Whale whisperer Hori Parata was just seven years old when he attended his first mass stranding, a beaching of porpoises in New Zealand\u2019s Northland, their cries screeching through the air on the deserted stretch of sand. Seven decades later, Parata, 75, has now overseen more than 500 strandings and is renowned in New Zealand as the leading M\u0101ori whale expert, called on by tribes around the country for cultural guidance as marine strandings become increasingly complex and fatal. \u201cMan\u2019s greed in the ocean is hurting the whales,\u201d says Parata, a fierce and uncompromising elder of the Ng\u0101tiwai tribe of eastern Northland. Hori Parata at his P\u0101taua farm, the place where he was born and grew up \u201cWe\u2019re having to put up with a lot of stuff today. The public want to hug the whales, they want to touch them, they want to feel good \u2013 that\u2019s not the thing. We feel that is ridiculous.\u201d Whale experts regard New Zealand \u2013 or Aotearoa as it is called by M\u0101ori \u2013 as the whale stranding capital of the world, with more than 5,000 incidents recorded since 1840, and an average of 300 individual animals beaching themselves each year. Kauri (Te Kaurinui Robert) Parata, watched by his father, Hori Parata, carves a traditional M\u0101ori design at their home in Whang\u0101rei. Kauri is a member of the Manu Taupunga group that is the organising arm of the whale-body recovery operation started by his father Concrete information on why whales strand remains elusive, but \u201csickness, navigational error, geographical features, a rapidly falling tide, being chased by a predator, or extreme weather\u201d are all thought to contribute, according to the New Zealand Department of Conservation. Climate change is to blame too, scientists think, with warming ocean temperatures moving whales\u2019 prey closer to the shore and forcing them to pursue their food into shallow waters. Clockwise from top: small whale bones; squid beaks, from the stomach of a sperm whale; the baleen filter-feeder system recovered from a stranded pygmy right whale. \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 strandings November marked the beginning of whale stranding season, and it started with a surge in incidents, according to whale rescue group Project Jonah, with 140 pilot whales beaching and dying on Stewart Island, 10 rare pygmy whales on Ninety Mile beach, 51 stranded and dead on the Chatham Islands and a spate of individual cases around the country. And as more whales beach and die \u2013 from exhaustion, heat stroke or seagulls feasting on their flesh \u2013 an acute sense of grief is growing among New Zealand\u2019s indigenous people, who regard whales as their ancestors and taonga (treasures). \u201cThese days it is like a zoo. People just want to come and gawk at us, without even trying to understand what is happening with the animals and the environment,\u201d says Parata, bristling with anger. \u201cWhen will we talk about what is hurting these animals out on the sea? They are drowning out there, they can\u2019t breathe, they beach themselves to be with the Aunties.\u201d Ng\u0101tiwai believe the whales beach when they are ready to die and want to return to their families, the M\u0101ori people. Then, their human families use the whales\u2019 gift of their bodies for sacred carvings, for traditional medicines, and even for compost. There are marked tribal differences across New Zealand and while some tribes work to refloat stranded whales, others like Parata\u2019s Ng\u0101tiwai stand back and allow the Department of Conservation and volunteer groups to take the lead in rescue efforts. Then the tribe moves in en masse and holds a karakia (prayer), names each animal and sets to work removing their bones, blubber, eyes and teeth for cultural purposes. Buck Cullen with his daughter Kaiarahi (10 months) in his backyard, where he is storing a pair of massive sperm whale jawbones. Cullen is an integral member of Hori Parata\u2019s whale recovery team But indigenous elders say they aren\u2019t being listened to when they tell the government their whale kin are sick, and trying to escape an increasingly polluted and unpredictable ocean. Earlier this year in South Taranaki, a mass stranding that was described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d left the local M\u0101ori tribe scrambling. Security was brought in when thieves attacked a sperm whale with an axe, trying to remove valuable teeth from its jaw. 12 par\u0101oa whales (sperm whales) recently stranded on the South Taranaki coast of Kaupokonui, on a scale not seen near this location in recent memory Parata and his 22-year-old son, Te Kaurinui Robert Parata, were called in to assist. Te Kaurinui was called after the first whale his father ever named, and left university this year to return to Whang\u0101rei and study whale tikanga (protocol) and carving. He says mass strandings are getting more local and international attention and money from donations, but traditional knowledge is being dismissed as overly spiritual. Clockwise from top: Te Kaurinui Parata, in front of the carving shed at Hihiaua Cultural Centre in Whang\u0101rei; Parata holds three whale teeth recovered from a beached whale \u2013 the middle one shows marks where a poacher had attempted to hack it out with an axe before the recovery group arrived; the Pou, a tribal identifier, in front of the carving shed. \u2018We need to listen\u2019 M\u0101ori harvest rights over dead whales have only been officially recognised since 1998, and the practice still elicits horror from some New Zealanders and visitors. \u201cOur own ancestors wouldn\u2019t say to go down there and hug the whales. That\u2019s a modern thing,\u201d says Te Kaurinui. The Ng\u0101tiwai are investigating a possible link between the crisis of the dieback disease killing New Zealand\u2019s native kauri trees \u2013 and threatening the giant T\u0101ne Mahuta, which may be 2,000 years old \u2013 and the increase in whale strandings. Parata and his family believe whale oil and byproducts could be used to try to cure Kauri dieback, and want more government money and attention directed towards indigenous knowledge of the interconnectedness of the New Zealand environment, and possible indigenous solutions. \u201cPeople dismiss us when we tell them our spiritual understanding of whales \u2013 why they are beaching, why they are hurting,\u201d says Te Kaurinui.

From the top of the Valmalenco cable car we followed snow trails through the woods to the enchanting Lago Pal\u00f9, where we walked across the frozen lake to a little igloo with ice table and stools. Fifteen minutes further on we reached the cosy Rifugio Pal\u00f9 overlooking the lake below, where we stopped for a hearty lunch in the sunshine before jumping aboard its motor-sledge, which whisked us back to the cable car station. All three generations enjoyed the winter adventure. Martha Hales Snow tubing, Kyrgyzstan Having no skiing skills, the best fun I ever had was snow tubing in Kyrgyzstan.

Bound in red leather embossed with gold, the world\u2019s smallest edition of Dante\u2019s classic poem, which was printed by the Salmin Brothers in Padua, is one of almost 50 officially designated miniature books housed in the London Library. Nomenclature is important here: according to the US-based Miniature Book Society, a miniature book \u201cis no more than three inches in height, width, or thickness\u201d, and while the London Library has some 350-odd \u201csmall\u201d books, of less than five inches, it has only 47 true miniatures.

Bryce said that when he \u201cdescended to the miniature, mite and midget size\u201d he had \u201cmany a scoff and jeer as to the absurdity of the production\u201d. This edition of the Bible, just an inch across, comes with a tiny magnifying glass tucked into a pocked in its cover (unlike the Dante, which is small but perfectly legible, this book would be impossible to read without one). There is also a miniature edition of Kate Greenaway\u2019s Alphabet from the 1880s, and Dunia Garcia-Ontiveros, who looks after the London Library\u2019s collection, points to the 1828 edition of Horace\u2019s odes, the second book to be published using Henri Didot\u2019s microscopic type. In a display of virtuosity, the text also contains a number of ornamental lines, the centre of which is formed by the letters \u201cHenri Didot\u201d printed even smaller than the type of the main text. I peer over the pages attempting to spot these; at last, using the zoom function on my phone, I find them.</p> <p>\u201cIn its quality, it\u2019s unparallelled,\u201d says Garcia-Ontiveros. \u201cHe\u2019s showing off. It was published in the 1820s, that\u2019s quite early. I\u2019m not surprised people called it a miracle.\u201d</p> <p>The earliest miniature books in the collection date to the 16th century. Books were often made small, according to Garcia-Ontiveros, because they were religious texts \u2013 so people wanted to keep them close as they felt emotionally connected to them \u2013 or because they were controversial and had \u201cto be secreted about one\u2019s person\u201d, such as Charles Knowlton\u2019s <a href=\"https://librarycompany.org/2013/09/18/a-few-of-our-favorite-things-part-one-charles-knowltons-fruits-of-philosophy/\">1832 guide to birth control, The Fruits of Philosophy</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e499c93d61f070b3e00c022ef33a5f8af791f3f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e499c93d61f070b3e00c022ef33a5f8af791f3f6/0_165_1439_1797/801.jpg\" alt=\"Jagadish Shukla, a magician, holds his miniature copies of a Koran, the Bhagavad Gita and the Bible in Bangalore in 2001.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jagadish Shukla holds miniature copies of a Koran, the Bhagavad Gita and the Bible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Indranil Mukherjee/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But miniature books have a much longer history. The British Library points to two small cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia.

      "bodyText": "It is known as the \u201cfly\u2019s eye Dante\u201d: an 1878 edition of the Divine Comedy which is so small \u2013 just 11/4 by 13/4 inches \u2013 that it is said to have taken 11 years to print, and to have damaged the eyes of both its compositor and corrector. Bound in red leather embossed with gold, the world\u2019s smallest edition of Dante\u2019s classic poem, which was printed by the Salmin Brothers in Padua, is one of almost 50 officially designated miniature books housed in the London Library. Nomenclature is important here: according to the US-based Miniature Book Society, a miniature book \u201cis no more than three inches in height, width, or thickness\u201d, and while the London Library has some 350-odd \u201csmall\u201d books, of less than five inches, it has only 47 true miniatures. The library decided they were being overshadowed by their larger cousins, so now they are gathered together in a glass-fronted cabinet. Alongside the Dante, there is the smallest AuthorisedVersion of the Bible, first printed by David Bryce of Glasgow in 1896. Bryce said that when he \u201cdescended to the miniature, mite and midget size\u201d he had \u201cmany a scoff and jeer as to the absurdity of the production\u201d. This edition of the Bible, just an inch across, comes with a tiny magnifying glass tucked into a pocked in its cover (unlike the Dante, which is small but perfectly legible, this book would be impossible to read without one). There is also a miniature edition of Kate Greenaway\u2019s Alphabet from the 1880s, and Dunia Garcia-Ontiveros, who looks after the London Library\u2019s collection, points to the 1828 edition of Horace\u2019s odes, the second book to be published using Henri Didot\u2019s microscopic type. In a display of virtuosity, the text also contains a number of ornamental lines, the centre of which is formed by the letters \u201cHenri Didot\u201d printed even smaller than the type of the main text. I peer over the pages attempting to spot these; at last, using the zoom function on my phone, I find them. \u201cIn its quality, it\u2019s unparallelled,\u201d says Garcia-Ontiveros. \u201cHe\u2019s showing off. It was published in the 1820s, that\u2019s quite early. I\u2019m not surprised people called it a miracle.\u201d The earliest miniature books in the collection date to the 16th century. Books were often made small, according to Garcia-Ontiveros, because they were religious texts \u2013 so people wanted to keep them close as they felt emotionally connected to them \u2013 or because they were controversial and had \u201cto be secreted about one\u2019s person\u201d, such as Charles Knowlton\u2019s 1832 guide to birth control, The Fruits of Philosophy. But miniature books have a much longer history. The British Library points to two small cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia. Both concerned with trading information about animals and provisions, one is dated to around 2325BC and measures 15/8 by 11/2 inches; the other is dated 2200BC and measures 17/8 by 11/4 inches. In AD770, the Japanese empress Shotoku gave orders for the printing of 1m copies of a prayer scroll a mere 23/8 inches tall, the D\u2019harani prayer. These writings were made miniature, writes the British Library\u2019s Annalisa Ricciardi, \u201cso that men and women of faith could easily bring with them their collection of psalms and devotional books, students could carry their small library in a pocket, smugglers of ideas could easily hide tiny booklets in a secret bottom of their cape, merchants could quickly retrieve from their belt a tiny but complete guide on the equivalence of grains prices, scales, measures and conversion, and foreign currencies value meanwhile closing a deal, or sharp businessmen could brilliantly define a legal contract\u201d. Technological developments in the 1800s made it possible to print text even more. \u201cThat\u2019s when you get the truly mind-bogglingly tiny books,\u201d says Garcia-Ontiveros, citing everything from the Horace to Bryce\u2019s Bible to a complete set of Shakespeare\u2019s plays that can be held cupped in two hands. Simon Garfield, who recently published In Miniature: How Small Things Illuminate the World, says his favourite is the Sherlock Holmes story How Watson Learned the Trick, which was written in the 1920s by Arthur Conan Doyle. \u201cIt\u2019s bound in red leather, measures under 4cm by 3cm and contains 503 words.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Don\u2019t let May run down the clock\u2019 Good morning, I\u2019m Warren Murray and it is my genuine pleasure to bring you the first Guardian morning briefing of 2019. Jeremy Corbyn has indicated he is still a long way from charting a course to a second Brexit referendum, as MPs prepare for the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on Theresa May\u2019s proposed withdrawal deal. A new study reveals an overwhelming majority of party members want the Labour leader to sideline his instincts and back a second referendum \u2013 though most remain loyal to his leadership. Labour decided at its annual conference in Liverpool to try to force a general election \u2013 only if that failed could a second referendum be considered. \u201cThe issue of another referendum was of course one of the options,\u201d Corbyn said yesterday, \u201cbut that was very much after the votes have taken place in parliament.\u201d Corbyn said May should return to Brussels once her deal was voted down to find an agreement that Labour could support, including a full customs union. Some Labour MPs including Chi Onwurah want article 50 extended so that May cannot \u201crun down the clock\u201d towards a hard Brexit. Over the festive period, the PM has embarked on telephone diplomacy with EU leaders including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, as she tries to get legally binding reassurances on the Irish border backstop. Cabinet ministers have privately urged the prime minister to prioritise securing an agreement that would bring the DUP, which is propping up her government, back on board. * * * News from space \u2013 China\u2019s state media is this morning reporting the first ever soft landing on the far side of the moon, achieved by its Chang\u2019e 4 spacecraft. Much further afield \u2013 and looking so much more like a conjoined potato than an unfinished snowman if you ask the Briefing \u2013 Ultima Thule has been photographed as the New Horizons space probe zipped past the \u201ctrans-Neptunian object\u201d 4bn miles from Earth. It must be hard to get a decent shot when you\u2019re doing 31,500mph but Nasa has promised better photos to come. * * * New year catch-up \u2013 It\u2019s our first chat in a while so let\u2019s do the rounds \u2026 &gt; The US remains in the grip of a government \u201cshutdown\u201d. Donald Trump overnight arranged a border security briefing to try and convince Democrats to fund his Mexico border wall but it didn\u2019t work. The shutdown enters its 13th day on Thursday. &gt; Two people were arrested as suspected people smugglers last night as part of the response to Channel crossings. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, is being criticised for saying it should be harder to seek asylum and migrants should have stayed in France. &gt; Shares in Apple have tumbled after it cut sales forecasts, citing the unforeseen \u201cmagnitude\u201d of the economic slowdown in China. Apple has said it expects sales revenue of around $84bn, down from an earlier estimate of $89bn-$93bn. &gt; The populist Jair Bolsonaro has been sworn in as Brazil\u2019s president and wasted no time in handing over chunks of the Amazon to agribusiness. Indigenous campaigners warn of an increase in deforestation and violence against indigenous people. &gt; Overcrowding on trains is at its worst in years, according to a Labour trawl of official figures. Separate numbers show that in 2017 trains were cancelled or ran late at the highest rate in 17 years. The release of the figures coincides with anger over the average 3.1% increase in fares. * * * Still going solo \u2013 Eight and a half years after 16-year-old US sailor Abby Sunderland had to abandon a round-the-world attempt, her yacht Wild Eyes has remarkably been found still afloat (though admittedly upside down) off the coast of South Australia. The barnacle-encrusted hull was first sighted by a tuna fishing spotter plane and then investigated by a police helicopter and commercial boats. Sunderland was rescued on 12 June 2010 midway between Madagascar and Western Australia in the Indian Ocean after Wild Eyes had its mast snapped off in the wild weather. The Californian said footage of the rediscovered yacht made her \u201cvery emotional \u2026 It brought back many memories, good and not so good, but it was neat to see it after so long. It looked a little creepy but that\u2019s to be expected after so long.\u201d Lunchtime read: Exercise in futility Our relationship with exercise is complicated. We all know it\u2019s necessary, and as the new year rolls around we anticipate finding the drive we need. But in the end hundreds of millions of us can\u2019t face actually doing it. Is it possible the problem lies at the heart of the idea of exercise itself? Sedentary lifestyles, argues Vybarr Cregan-Reid, are the real problem. Modern life and work are less physically demanding than ever, and even if we go to the gym on a Saturday morning, our absolute inactivity at other times can still be damaging to the body. The answer, writes Cregan-Reid, is to build activity into our everyday lives. Sport The World Anti-Doping Agency has been warned by its own athlete committee that if it does not ban Russia again it will have failed clean athletes. Russian authorities ignored a 31 December deadline to hand over doping data from their Moscow lab. Goals from Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford have continued Manchester United\u2019s resurgence and left Newcastle looking over their shoulder. Over at Manchester City, Barney Ronay writes that Pep Guardiola\u2019s side face the new challenge of winning ugly after Liverpool leapt from four points behind City to seven points clear at the top. Kevin De Bruyne is back in contention for City\u2019s pivotal Premier League clash with Liverpool. Play is under way in the fourth test between Australia and India at the SCG \u2013 the tourists won the toss and have gone in to bat. And never let it be said darts players are unconcerned with political matters \u2013 Michael van Gerwen has used the occasion of his third PDC world championship title to refer to Brexit as \u201cBrex-shit\u201d. Business Asian markets have been mixed after that Apple downgrade of sales projections.

The magistrate, Richard Pithouse, allegedly made the comments while presiding over a preliminary hearing for a compensation claim in November, and they were reported in the Herald Sun. Pithouse reportedly suggested the woman had put herself into the position of allegedly being assaulted, because she had been drinking alcohol, and that she must have \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d. Hennessy referred Pithouse to the Judicial Commission of Victoria last week, saying his comments were not in line with community expectations and \u201chave caused distress to sexual assault survivors\u201d. \u201cWhile these matters are subject to investigation it\u2019s not appropriate to comment further,\u201d she said. The commission confirmed it had received the complaint and said it would be carefully considered. If accepted, the complaint will be considered by a three-person investigation panel, made up of two current or former members of the judiciary or the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal (Vcat) and one community member of high standing. The panel has the power to recommend a judicial officer be removed from their role if there\u2019s proven misbehaviour, or to recommend they be counselled about their conduct. Guardian Australia approached the magistrates court to ask if Pithouse, the chief magistrate or the court would comment. A spokeswoman from the magistrates court said Pithouse would continue to sit in the court while the commission completed its review. Nine months ago Pithouse was ordered to write a letter of apology and make a $650 donation to charity for failing to stop after swiping a parked ute in his work car, a Ford Territory, in September 2017. He reported the incident to police 35 minutes after it happened. The case was heard by a visiting magistrate from New South Wales and no criminal conviction was recorded. Pithouse was appointed to the bench in 2008 and has attracted both criticism and some formal complaints over his 10-year career, including for his refusal in 2010 to hear a victim impact statement from a sexual assault victim, and for reportedly saying of a domestic violence victim in 2017 \u2013 who declined to make a sworn statement against her abuser \u2013 that it was \u201cher right to be beaten up if she wants to, I suppose\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers are facing the biggest shortage of skilled workers since 1989 amid record levels of UK employment and falling numbers of EU27 nationals coming to the country to work since the Brexit vote. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said more than four-fifths of manufacturers struggled to hire the right staff in the final months of 2018. In a survey of more than 6,000 employers across the country, the lobby group found 81% of manufacturers and 70% of service sector firms reported difficulties with finding staff with the right qualifications and experience. Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, said the government urgently needed to recognise the magnitude of the recruitment difficulties firms faced as ministers prepared to introduce restrictions on EU nationals working in the UK after Brexit. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, is looking to cut immigration from the EU by 80% after Britain leaves, including through the extension of a \u00a330,000-a-year minimum salary threshold already applied to non-EU workers. Marshall said: \u201cBusiness concerns about the government\u2019s recent blueprint for future immigration rules must be taken seriously \u2013 and companies must be able to access skills at all levels without heavy costs or bureaucracy.\u201d The recruitment difficulties come as the UK employment rate stands at the highest level since 1971, while unemployment is at its lowest since 1975, making it harder for companies to hire new workers without offering higher wages. Net migration from the rest of EU to the UK has also slumped to a six-year low. The weaker pound has made it less attractive for foreign nationals to come to Britain to work, while Brexit has also raised the prospect of tougher immigration rules in future. The BCC said the economy also appeared to be \u201cstuck in a weak holding pattern\u201d at the start of the year owing to Brexit uncertainty, with companies reporting stagnant levels of growth and faltering business confidence. While manufacturers are coming under pressure from labour shortages, the service sector, which includes banks, hotels and restaurants, and accounts for about four-fifths of the economy, reported weaker domestic sales. Production in the manufacturing sector hit its fastest pace of growth in six months in December as firms stockpiled in preparation for potential border holdups in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index rose from 53.6 in November to 54.2 last month, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. Above 50 indicates economic growth. The latest snapshot raises the prospect that Brexit uncertainty may perversely benefit the economy in the short-term by prompting companies to raise their activity levels in preparation for potential disruption from the UK leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal. The Bank of England has previously said that the majority of businesses in Britain have done little to prepare for a no-deal scenario, while the government has started to tell more companies to make preparations as it steps up its plans. Economists, however, said the growth in activity was likely to be temporary. Disruption after 29 March could curtail activity, while any removal of Brexit risks could lead businesses to run down their stockpiled goods rather than placing new orders.",

The Guardian revealed this year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/17/nearly-1m-tonnes-every-year-supermarkets-shamed-for-plastic-packaging\"> supermarkets alone put 1m tonnes of plastic packaging</a> on to the market.</p> <p>But they are increasingly aware that if their customers lose faith they will lose money. Almost a quarter of consumers surveyed earlier this year said they were extremely concerned about plastic packaging. More than half said they were doing what they could to reduce their use of plastic.</p> <p>In Australia, public pressure led many supermarkets this year to announce they were phasing out single-use plastic bags. These include Coles, Woolies and Harris Farm.<br><br>Just producing plastic uses huge resources \u2013 it takes around <a href=\"https://www.unric.org/en/latest-un-buzz/28776-100-billion-plastic-bags-used-annually-in-the-us\">12m barrels of oil</a> to make the 100bn plastic bags used annually in the United States alone.</p> <p>This year Britain\u2019s Iceland supermarket has led the way \u2013 and others are beginning to follow suit. Iceland has pledged to eliminate plastic packaging on its own goods in five years.</p> <p>So what can you do to reduce your own plastic footprint and put pressure on supermarkets and manufacturers to move towards reuseable plastic items and hugely increase the amount of recycled plastic in their products? Here are 10 top tips:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Start at home. Do a plastic audit of your household. Shower bottles, deodorants, washing up liquids, shampoo bottles. Aim to make reductions here by ditching shower gel for soap and the plastic cotton buds for biodegradable ones; buy liquid detergent in recycled plastic bottles and find a refill station to fill them up. Shampoo bars and toilet paper in recycled packaging are also available.</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>In the US, 1bn plastic toothbrushes are thrown out each year, creating some 50m pounds of waste. Try using bamboo toothbrushes instead which only take about six months to biodegrade back into the soil when you have to replace your brush.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Carry reuseable fabric shopping bags.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Try buying wholesale and putting dried products such as rice, pasta and<br>lentils into glass jars to avoid buying products wrapped in plastic.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Recycle old plastic children\u2019s toys. Search for a toy library in your<br>area to borrow from or donate to. And consider charity shops when looking for gifts.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong><strong> </strong>Carry a reuseable coffee cup or flask; 7m plastic-lined coffee cups are thrown away in the UK every day.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong><strong> </strong>Say no to plastic cutlery. Carry a fork with you or use a compostable alternative.</p> <p><strong>8.</strong><strong> </strong>Ditch cling film wrap for your food. It cannot be recycled in most UK collections. Foil is recyclable, so use foil instead or reuseable plastic boxes.</p> <p><strong>9.</strong> Use an electric razor instead of plastic disposable one.</p> <p><strong>10.</strong> Write to companies whose packaging is non-recyclable, asking them to consider using less destructive materials. Maybe even think about starting a social media campaign to raise awareness. Strength in numbers!</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3, 4 and 18 January 2019. An earlier version suggested that 12m oil barrels produced 100m plastic bags. That figure is more like 100bn bags. In addition, the estimate of 1bn plastic toothbrushes being thrown out each year relates just to the US, not globally. This has been corrected. It was further amended to remove a reference to a branded product, and to refer to biodegradable cotton buds rather than recyclable ones.</p>",

With dire predictions that if nothing is done there will be more plastic in the seas by weight than fish by 2050, it has become evident that we cannot recycle our way out of the plastic problem. More than 8m tonnes of plastic end up in our oceans each year. Meanwhile virgin plastic production continues apace and is set to to leap by 40% over the next 10 years as more products are made from virgin plastic than from recycled. But consumer pressure can force change. The Guardian revealed this year that supermarkets alone put 1m tonnes of plastic packaging on to the market. But they are increasingly aware that if their customers lose faith they will lose money. Almost a quarter of consumers surveyed earlier this year said they were extremely concerned about plastic packaging. More than half said they were doing what they could to reduce their use of plastic. In Australia, public pressure led many supermarkets this year to announce they were phasing out single-use plastic bags. These include Coles, Woolies and Harris Farm. Just producing plastic uses huge resources \u2013 it takes around 12m barrels of oil to make the 100bn plastic bags used annually in the United States alone. This year Britain\u2019s Iceland supermarket has led the way \u2013 and others are beginning to follow suit. Iceland has pledged to eliminate plastic packaging on its own goods in five years. So what can you do to reduce your own plastic footprint and put pressure on supermarkets and manufacturers to move towards reuseable plastic items and hugely increase the amount of recycled plastic in their products? Here are 10 top tips: 1. Start at home. Do a plastic audit of your household. Shower bottles, deodorants, washing up liquids, shampoo bottles. Aim to make reductions here by ditching shower gel for soap and the plastic cotton buds for biodegradable ones; buy liquid detergent in recycled plastic bottles and find a refill station to fill them up. Shampoo bars and toilet paper in recycled packaging are also available. 2. In the US, 1bn plastic toothbrushes are thrown out each year, creating some 50m pounds of waste. Try using bamboo toothbrushes instead which only take about six months to biodegrade back into the soil when you have to replace your brush. 3. Carry reuseable fabric shopping bags. 4. Try buying wholesale and putting dried products such as rice, pasta and lentils into glass jars to avoid buying products wrapped in plastic. 5. Recycle old plastic children\u2019s toys. Search for a toy library in your area to borrow from or donate to. And consider charity shops when looking for gifts. 6. Carry a reuseable coffee cup or flask; 7m plastic-lined coffee cups are thrown away in the UK every day. 7. Say no to plastic cutlery. Carry a fork with you or use a compostable alternative. 8. Ditch cling film wrap for your food. It cannot be recycled in most UK collections. Foil is recyclable, so use foil instead or reuseable plastic boxes. 9. Use an electric razor instead of plastic disposable one. 10. Write to companies whose packaging is non-recyclable, asking them to consider using less destructive materials. Maybe even think about starting a social media campaign to raise awareness. Strength in numbers! \u2022 This article was amended on 3, 4 and 18 January 2019. An earlier version suggested that 12m oil barrels produced 100m plastic bags. That figure is more like 100bn bags. In addition, the estimate of 1bn plastic toothbrushes being thrown out each year relates just to the US, not globally. This has been corrected. It was further amended to remove a reference to a branded product, and to refer to biodegradable cotton buds rather than recyclable ones.",

      "body": "<p>This is the time of year when trainers are mined from under beds and gym kits are disinterred from the bottom drawer. Google searches relating to physical fitness peak in January. Many people even trawl the web to find out about \u201cdesk exercises\u201d and \u201cworkouts on the go\u201d in case they are too busy to use their new gym memberships.</p> <p>Our relationship with exercise is complicated. Reports from the UK and the US show it is something we persistently struggle with. As the new year rolls around, we anticipate having the drive to behave differently and become regular exercisers, even in the knowledge that we will probably fail to do so. Why do we want to exercise? What do we expect it to do for us? We all know we are supposed to be exercising, but hundreds of millions of us can\u2019t face actually doing it. It is just possible the problem lies at the heart of the idea of exercise itself.</p> <p>Exercise is movement of the muscles and limbs for a specific outcome, usually to enhance physical fitness. As such, for most of us, it is an optional addition to the working day \u2013 yet another item on a long list of responsibilities alongside the fulfilment of parental duties or earning money to put food on the table. But because the principal beneficiary of exercise is ourselves, it is one of the easiest chores to shirk. At the end of the working day, millions of us prefer to indulge in sedentary leisure activities instead of what we all think is good for us: a workout. </p> <p>Fitness crazes are like diets: if any of them worked, there wouldn\u2019t be so many. CrossFit, the intensely physical, communal workout incorporating free weights, squats, pull-ups and so forth, is still less than 20 years old. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/10/fitness-tips-spinning-class-beginners-bike-exercise\" title=\"\">Spin classes</a> \u2013 vigorous group workouts on stationary bikes \u2013 have only been around for about 30. Aerobics was a craze about a decade before that, although many of its high-energy routines had already been around for a while. (The pastel horror of 1970s Jazzercise is probably best forgotten.) Before that, there was the jogging revolution, which began in the US in the early 1960s. The Joggers Manual, published in 1963 by the Oregon Heart Foundation, was a leaflet of about 200 words that sought to address the postwar panic about sedentary lifestyles by encouraging an accessible form of physical activity, explaining that \u201cjogging is a bit more than a walk\u201d. The jogging boom took a few years to get traction, hitting its stride in the mid- to late-80s, but it remains one of the most popular forms of exercise, now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/oct/01/parkrun-five-mlllion-runners\" title=\"\">also in groups</a>.</p> <p>The exercise craze that dominated the 1950s was, oddly, not even an exercise. The vibrating exercise belt promised users could achieve effortless weight loss by having their midriffs violently jiggled. It didn\u2019t work, but you can still find similar machines available for purchase today.</p> <p>These fads even came with their own particular fashions \u2013 legwarmers, leotards, Lycra. So is our obsession with fitness doomed to be the stuff of embarrassing passing \u201cphases\u201d? Is exercise itself a fad?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It is not news that we are becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/11/moving-every-half-hour-could-help-limit-effects-of-sedentary-lifestyle-says-study\" title=\"\">more sedentary</a> as a species. The problem has been creeping up on us for generations. As industry and technology solved the physical demands of manual labour, they created new challenges for the human body.</p> <p>Evidence about bone strength and density gleaned from fossils of early humans suggests that, for hundreds of thousands of years, normal levels of movement were <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/49236-bone-density-human-evolution.html\" title=\"\">much higher</a> than ours today. And the range of work required of the human body to subsist was sizeable: everything from foraging for food and finding water to hunting, constructing basic shelters, manufacturing tools and evading predators. The fossil record tells us that many prehistoric humans were stronger and fitter than today\u2019s Olympians.</p> <p>A hundred years ago, while life was easier than it had been for our hunter-gatherer forebears, it was still required that shopping was fetched, floors scrubbed, wood chopped and washing done by hand. Modern urban environments do not invite anything like the same kinds of work from the body. It is not easy to clock up those miles when cities are built to prioritise cars and treat pedestrians as secondary. We are not assisted by our environments to move like we used to, for reasons tied up with motivation, safety and accessibility.</p> <p>Technological innovations have led to countless minor reductions of movement. To clean a rug in the 1940s, most people took it into their yard and whacked the bejeezus out of it for 20 minutes. Fast-forward a few decades and we can set <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/25/roomba-maker-could-share-maps-users-homes-google-amazon-apple-irobot-robot-vacuum\" title=\"\">robot vacuum cleaners</a> to wander about our living rooms as we order up some shopping to be delivered, put on the dishwasher, cram a load into the washer-dryer, admire the self-cleaning oven, stack some machine-cut logs in the grate, pour a glass of milk from the frost-free fridge or thumb a capsule into the coffee maker. Each of these devices and behaviours is making it a bit more difficult for us to keep moving regularly throughout our day.</p> <p>As we step through various innovations, we tend to think of the work that is no longer required as \u201csaved\u201d. Cleaning a rug once burned about 200 calories, while activating a robo-vac uses about 0.2 \u2013 an activity drop of a thousandfold, with nothing to replace it. Nobody, when they buy a labour-saving device, thinks: \u201cHow am I going to replace that movement I have saved?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fe04f090e775272b581a90f76f730e383265120\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fe04f090e775272b581a90f76f730e383265120/78_0_1003_1139/881.jpg\" alt=\"a woman using a smartphone charge cable as a skipping rope\" width=\"881\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A great deal of energy is also saved in the kinds of work that we now do. Towards the end of the 19th century, the labour market began to change radically. Office clerks were the fastest-growing occupational group in the latter half of the period. The UK census of 1841 suggests that 0.1% of working people performed administrative or office work at that time. By 1891, the number had increased twentyfold, and only kept increasing. One recent US survey estimated that 86% of today\u2019s workforce is in sedentary employment.</p> <p>As a result of our leisurely lifestyles, our bones are thinner and our muscles weaker, and while these are not problems in themselves, they are part of the larger, fleshier story whereby the diminution of movement is shackling humans to the very biggest global killers. Heart disease and strokes are responsible for about <a href=\"https://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/resources/atlas/en/\" title=\"\">17 million deaths a year</a>, according to the World Health Organization.</p> <p>All-day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/23/fitness-tracker-device-activity-apple-health\" title=\"\">activity trackers</a> like the Apple Watch and the Fitbit (which is only a decade old this year) have attempted to make an intervention into this sandpit of sedentariness. Widespread use of wearables may be helping people to move more, but technology created this problem of sedentary work and leisure, and cannot solve it alone.</p> <p>A 2015 report by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges called <a href=\"http://www.aomrc.org.uk/reports-guidance/exercise-the-miracle-cure-0215/\" title=\"\">Exercise \u2013 the Miracle Cure</a> said that regular exercise can assist in the prevention of strokes, some cancers, depression, heart disease and dementia, reducing risk by at least 30%. With regular exercise, the risk of bowel cancer drops by 45%, and of osteoarthritis, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes by a whopping 50%.</p> <p>Exercise, in these terms, is not a fad, or an option, or an add-on to our busy lifestyles: it is keeping us alive. But before it can work for us, our whole approach needs to change.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As a result of the Miracle Cure report, doctors were urged to promote regular exercise among their patients. Humans obviously need regular activity, but the modern world strives to take exertion out of our lives. Modernity is characterised by imperatives to simplify, improve and maximise efficiency. In much the same way, medical bodies trying to motivate the population to exercise promise big results with the absolute minimum of disruption to our busy, seated lives.</p> <p>Anyone researching exercise strategies this new year will find that the government recommends \u201cat least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or brisk walking every week and strength exercises on 2 or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms)\u201d.</p> <p>If 150 minutes \u2013 or half an hour five times a week \u2013 is too much for you, and the data suggests that for most of us it is, another public health strategy promotes the efficacy of being active for just 10 minutes a day. Public Health England launched its <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/active10/home\" title=\"\">Active10</a> campaign on the grounds that just 10 minutes\u2019 brisk walking each day \u201ccounts as exercise\u201d and \u201ccan reduce your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia and some cancers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f1fd8504dde173ac371841aa59f2b981edef2e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f1fd8504dde173ac371841aa59f2b981edef2e9/0_0_1317_1153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a woman doing pullups with the hand-holds on a train carriage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"875\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Even less time is required for high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which can involve bouts of just 20 seconds of intense effort a few times a week. It seems there is good evidence for the efficacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/11/can-high-intensity-interval-training-delay-the-ageing-process\" title=\"\">very short bursts</a> of strenuous anaerobic exercise, such as sprinting or cycling hard, followed by a brief recovery period. Interval training may improve insulin sensitivity and oxygen circulation, and increase muscle mass. But one of the early researchers into HIIT, kinesiologist Dr Martin Gibala, worried that despite its benefits, it required \u201can extremely high level of subject motivation\u201d, because all-out exertion is unpleasant and can lead to dizziness, vomiting or injury. \u201cGiven the extreme nature of the exercise,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit is doubtful that the general population could safely or practically adopt the model.\u201d</p> <p>While all of these three modes of exercise are effective in different ways, and each has its proponents and committed followers, none is an all-round solution for a \u201cfit\u201d human body. But the problem is not really with the exercises themselves; it is what we tend to do in between those bursts of activity.</p> <p>The health effects of being sedentary are as common and recognisable as they are serious. Anxiety, depression, heart disease, breast and colon cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and the <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/lifestyle-and-exercise/back-pain-leading-cause-of-disability-study-finds/\" title=\"\">leading cause of global disability</a>, back pain, are all driven by sedentary behaviours.</p> <p>For our bodies to function properly, they operate on the assumption that we will be burning calories throughout the day, and not in short bursts. It is clear that periods of sedentariness are bad for the human body, and some exercise is always going to be better than none; the issue is not really to do with the types of exercise, but with our approach to them and what we expect them to achieve. We know from the data that the human relationship with exercise is predominantly characterised as both optional and additional to an otherwise sedentary life, which itself causes a ton of problems. As long as physical activity is divorced from the real work of our lives, we will find reasons for not doing it.</p> <p>No matter how low the institutional expectations for physical activity drop, more of us fail to meet them each year. A Public Health England survey last year <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brisk-walking-and-physical-inactivity-in-40-to-60-year-olds/brisk-walking-and-physical-inactivity-in-40-to-60-year-olds\" title=\"\">found that</a> people in England are becoming so inactive that 40% of those aged between 40 and 60 walk briskly for less than 10 minutes a month. The reasons are numerous, but they seem to be connected to our notion of exercise, and the difference between short bursts of running or cycling and low-level, sustained physical activity. If we go back to the beginnings of exercise, we can see why it is still so problematic for us today.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The rise of exercise is synonymous with the rise of leisure. We associate this with the start of the Industrial Revolution, but in fact it dates from much earlier. Once humans settled and began to build, several thousand years ago, hierarchies began to form, particularly in cities, as did the gap between master and servant. To be one of the elite meant others were doing the physical work for you. For the masters, there was time to fill, and into this space grew the idea of leisure. Exercise also emerges here, in the imbalance created in the spread of labour performed across a population. Ever since, we have seen a powerful link between exercise and inequality.</p> <p>The wealthy men of ancient Greece, deprived of work by their slaves and with little else to do, invented a new place called the gymnasium, an open space in the city where they could strip off and gambol about naked, competing in made-up challenges to keep each other fit for war.</p> <p>Later, the Romans also celebrated the value of exercise. Cicero, the Roman politician and lawyer, said: \u201cIt is exercise alone that supports the spirits and keeps the mind in vigour.\u201d Pliny the Younger, a writer and also a lawyer, said: \u201cIt is remarkable how one\u2019s wits are sharpened by physical exercise.\u201d Like their Greek gym buddies, these men were privileged and wealthy. They understood that even though the slave class did their work for them, exercise and physical activity were essential for a long and sane life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0b249dee2fed00b70402aa6dd20ef462e31ada77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b249dee2fed00b70402aa6dd20ef462e31ada77/0_0_2208_3214/687.jpg\" alt=\"The Gymnasticon, an exercise machine invented and patented by Francis Lowndes circa 1797\" width=\"687\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gymnasticon, an exercise machine invented and patented by Francis Lowndes in 1797.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wellcome Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the Greeks and Romans, exercise all but disappeared from western culture. It didn\u2019t resurface properly until the 18th century, when inactivity became a problem for a certain class of gentleman. In 1797, the Monthly Magazine announced a new patent for Francis Lowndes\u2019 Gymnasticon, the earliest of the static exercise machines \u2013 a frame in which the user sat, turning a spindle with his arms and operating a treadle with his feet. The article noted that \u201cwhen peculiar or sedentary occupations enforce confinement to the house, it promises to be equally useful to the healthy as to the sick. The merchant, without withdrawing his attention from his accounts, and the student, while occupied in writing or reading, may have his lower limbs kept in constant motion by the slightest exertion, or, the assistance of a child.\u201d The handle on the contraption\u2019s lower spindle was arranged so that, if desired, a child could be employed to turn the wheel, to save the user valuable energy.</p> <p>In the early 20th century, calisthenics became popular among people with limited means of expending physical energy. In the opening pages of EM Forster\u2019s Howards End, from 1910, we are introduced to the Wilcox family as they come and go in their country-house garden. They are \u201cnew money\u201d; they see the world instrumentally, and are mostly allergic to it, too. A visitor reports the scene in a letter: \u201cThen Evie comes out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a greengage tree \u2013 they put everything to use \u2013 and then she says \u2018a-tissue,\u2019 and in she goes.\u201d Like inactivity, hay fever only seemed to afflict those higher up the social scale.</p> <p>In 1831 the Journal of Health defined calisthenics as \u201ca reasonable, methodical, and regular employment of the exercises best calculated to develop the physical powers of young girls, without detriment to the perfecting of the moral faculties\u201d. Its adoption was necessary because \u201cyoung girls have not the same freedom as boys in their outdoor exercise, and their customary amusements and occupations, when not at school, are of a more sedentary nature\u201d.</p> <p>Since our modern way of life denies many of us the physical exertion that kept our ancestors healthy, one way to gain social capital is to add it back in.</p> <p>Any kind of communal exercise gives us a sense of belonging, of shared values and endeavours, aside even from its more general physical and mental benefits. When people gather together in a gym or in an exercise class, at least one aspect of what they are doing is joining together in a civic activity that ensures their collective survival, just like the ancient Greeks before them.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>If being fit promotes long life, you might expect being an elite athlete to help you reach a ripe old age. It doesn\u2019t. Olympians buy themselves <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e8338\" title=\"\">an extra 2.8 years</a> on average, according to a 2012 study. Devoting your life to sport and exercise will buy you more time, but once you factor in the Olympians\u2019 lifelong sustained attention to diet and healthy living, as well as tens of thousands of hours spent training, 2.8 years might not really seem sufficient recompense.</p> <p>Instead, the fittest and healthiest people on the planet have never been to a gym. These people, who report high levels of wellbeing and live extraordinarily long lives, inhabit what have been called \u201cblue zones\u201d \u2013 areas where lifestyles lead to peculiar longevity. The term was coined by two demographers, Gianni Pes and Michel Poulain, who, while collecting data on clusters of centenarians on the island of Sardinia, identified places of especially high longevity on their map with a blue felt-tip pen. Because clusters of long-lived people are often found in geographically remote places (also including parts of Okinawa, Costa Rica and Greece), jackpot genes seem like a strong candidate to explain their longevity. But <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/geronj/article-abstract/48/6/B237/549845?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">a famous study</a> of Danish twins has concluded that a long life seems to be only \u201cmoderately heritable\u201d. Over the years, many studies have looked at the lifestyles of<strong> </strong>people in \u201cblue zones\u201d and found that a number of their customs and habits contribute to a long life (everything from a sense of belonging and purpose to not smoking, or eating a predominantly plant-based diet). In the list of contributory factors, there is a noticeable absence of exercise.</p> <p>I travelled to Sardinia to meet Pes and find out more about his work. He has a vested interest in longevity. His great uncle was a supercentenarian (living beyond 110). The years that Pes is interested in finding out more about are the good ones, not those spent with 24-hour care in a nursing home (there are also none of these in Sardinia\u2019s blue zones). A trial by a group of gerontologists based at Boston University reported that 10% of supercentenarians made it to the final three months of their lives without being troubled by major age-related diseases.</p> <p>In my conversation with Pes, he repeatedly stressed that while diet and environment are important components of longevity, being sedentary is the enemy, and sustained, low-level activity is the key that research by him and others has uncovered: not the intense kinds of activity we tend to associate with exercise, but energy expended throughout the day. The supercentenarians he has worked with all walked several miles each day throughout their working lives. They never spent much time, if any, seated at desks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4580ca89a12e18abe4938317eeeb785cb2972afa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4580ca89a12e18abe4938317eeeb785cb2972afa/0_35_1163_1090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a man watching TV while running on a treadmill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"937\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Pes has recently been studying workers in one of the island\u2019s regions of longevity, Seulo (population around 1,000). He discovered one group of women who had spent their working lives seated, but nonetheless reached a great age. They had been working treadles (pedal-powered sewing machines), which meant they had regularly burned sufficient calories to derive the longevity benefits of remaining active. (Lowndes\u2019 Gymnasticon, which works like a treadle, is starting to look a little less ridiculous as a solution for sedentary workers.)</p> <p>For all the trillions invested in healthcare year on year, there are regions in high-income nations (such as the UK and the US) where life expectancy is still as low as it was in the mid-60s. In Tower Hamlets, one of the poorer parts of London, men <a href=\"https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/Documents/Borough_statistics/Research-briefings/BP2018_8_Health_and_Wellbeing.pdf\" title=\"\">can only expect</a> an average of 61 years of good health \u2013 and women just 56.</p> <p>So far, researchers agree that sustained periods of low-level activity seem to work well. Aiming for 10,000 steps a day is a good idea, but 15,000 better resembles the distances likely covered by our prehistoric ancestors, and indeed by those Sardinian centenarians.</p> <p>For those of us who can\u2019t move to Sardinia and become a shepherd, a review published in the Lancet in 2016 found that \u201chigh levels of moderate-intensity physical activity (ie, about 60-75 min per day) seem to eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time\u201d.</p> <p>So even if we go to the gym on a Saturday morning, our absolute inactivity at other times can still be damaging to the body. Low and moderate activity for longer or sustained periods seems to produce the best results. It looks like excessive high-intensity activity (the kind we see in elite athletes) drives metabolism and cell turnover, and may even, when all factors are taken into account, accelerate the ageing process.</p> <p>As those all-day activity trackers continue to mature into their second decade, they will no doubt find better ways of encouraging us out of our chairs. At the moment, though, they can only count the things we have done, not the opportunities for movement we have missed. They make us more likely to be attentive to our activity than our inactivity.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>After two centuries of trying, we should accept that exercise is not working as a global fitness strategy while it remains an addition to the working day. In the long view, it is starting to look a lot like a fad. Government guidelines in the UK and other countries that encourage sport and exercise are failing.

      "bodyText": "This is the time of year when trainers are mined from under beds and gym kits are disinterred from the bottom drawer. Google searches relating to physical fitness peak in January. Many people even trawl the web to find out about \u201cdesk exercises\u201d and \u201cworkouts on the go\u201d in case they are too busy to use their new gym memberships. Our relationship with exercise is complicated. Reports from the UK and the US show it is something we persistently struggle with. As the new year rolls around, we anticipate having the drive to behave differently and become regular exercisers, even in the knowledge that we will probably fail to do so. Why do we want to exercise? What do we expect it to do for us? We all know we are supposed to be exercising, but hundreds of millions of us can\u2019t face actually doing it. It is just possible the problem lies at the heart of the idea of exercise itself. Exercise is movement of the muscles and limbs for a specific outcome, usually to enhance physical fitness. As such, for most of us, it is an optional addition to the working day \u2013 yet another item on a long list of responsibilities alongside the fulfilment of parental duties or earning money to put food on the table. But because the principal beneficiary of exercise is ourselves, it is one of the easiest chores to shirk. At the end of the working day, millions of us prefer to indulge in sedentary leisure activities instead of what we all think is good for us: a workout. Fitness crazes are like diets: if any of them worked, there wouldn\u2019t be so many. CrossFit, the intensely physical, communal workout incorporating free weights, squats, pull-ups and so forth, is still less than 20 years old. Spin classes \u2013 vigorous group workouts on stationary bikes \u2013 have only been around for about 30. Aerobics was a craze about a decade before that, although many of its high-energy routines had already been around for a while. (The pastel horror of 1970s Jazzercise is probably best forgotten.) Before that, there was the jogging revolution, which began in the US in the early 1960s. The Joggers Manual, published in 1963 by the Oregon Heart Foundation, was a leaflet of about 200 words that sought to address the postwar panic about sedentary lifestyles by encouraging an accessible form of physical activity, explaining that \u201cjogging is a bit more than a walk\u201d. The jogging boom took a few years to get traction, hitting its stride in the mid- to late-80s, but it remains one of the most popular forms of exercise, now also in groups. The exercise craze that dominated the 1950s was, oddly, not even an exercise. The vibrating exercise belt promised users could achieve effortless weight loss by having their midriffs violently jiggled. It didn\u2019t work, but you can still find similar machines available for purchase today. These fads even came with their own particular fashions \u2013 legwarmers, leotards, Lycra. So is our obsession with fitness doomed to be the stuff of embarrassing passing \u201cphases\u201d? Is exercise itself a fad? * * * It is not news that we are becoming more sedentary as a species. The problem has been creeping up on us for generations. As industry and technology solved the physical demands of manual labour, they created new challenges for the human body. Evidence about bone strength and density gleaned from fossils of early humans suggests that, for hundreds of thousands of years, normal levels of movement were much higher than ours today. And the range of work required of the human body to subsist was sizeable: everything from foraging for food and finding water to hunting, constructing basic shelters, manufacturing tools and evading predators. The fossil record tells us that many prehistoric humans were stronger and fitter than today\u2019s Olympians. A hundred years ago, while life was easier than it had been for our hunter-gatherer forebears, it was still required that shopping was fetched, floors scrubbed, wood chopped and washing done by hand. Modern urban environments do not invite anything like the same kinds of work from the body. It is not easy to clock up those miles when cities are built to prioritise cars and treat pedestrians as secondary. We are not assisted by our environments to move like we used to, for reasons tied up with motivation, safety and accessibility. Technological innovations have led to countless minor reductions of movement. To clean a rug in the 1940s, most people took it into their yard and whacked the bejeezus out of it for 20 minutes. Fast-forward a few decades and we can set robot vacuum cleaners to wander about our living rooms as we order up some shopping to be delivered, put on the dishwasher, cram a load into the washer-dryer, admire the self-cleaning oven, stack some machine-cut logs in the grate, pour a glass of milk from the frost-free fridge or thumb a capsule into the coffee maker. Each of these devices and behaviours is making it a bit more difficult for us to keep moving regularly throughout our day. As we step through various innovations, we tend to think of the work that is no longer required as \u201csaved\u201d. Cleaning a rug once burned about 200 calories, while activating a robo-vac uses about 0.2 \u2013 an activity drop of a thousandfold, with nothing to replace it. Nobody, when they buy a labour-saving device, thinks: \u201cHow am I going to replace that movement I have saved?\u201d A great deal of energy is also saved in the kinds of work that we now do. Towards the end of the 19th century, the labour market began to change radically. Office clerks were the fastest-growing occupational group in the latter half of the period. The UK census of 1841 suggests that 0.1% of working people performed administrative or office work at that time. By 1891, the number had increased twentyfold, and only kept increasing. One recent US survey estimated that 86% of today\u2019s workforce is in sedentary employment. As a result of our leisurely lifestyles, our bones are thinner and our muscles weaker, and while these are not problems in themselves, they are part of the larger, fleshier story whereby the diminution of movement is shackling humans to the very biggest global killers. Heart disease and strokes are responsible for about 17 million deaths a year, according to the World Health Organization. All-day activity trackers like the Apple Watch and the Fitbit (which is only a decade old this year) have attempted to make an intervention into this sandpit of sedentariness. Widespread use of wearables may be helping people to move more, but technology created this problem of sedentary work and leisure, and cannot solve it alone. A 2015 report by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges called Exercise \u2013 the Miracle Cure said that regular exercise can assist in the prevention of strokes, some cancers, depression, heart disease and dementia, reducing risk by at least 30%. With regular exercise, the risk of bowel cancer drops by 45%, and of osteoarthritis, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes by a whopping 50%. Exercise, in these terms, is not a fad, or an option, or an add-on to our busy lifestyles: it is keeping us alive. But before it can work for us, our whole approach needs to change. * * * As a result of the Miracle Cure report, doctors were urged to promote regular exercise among their patients. Humans obviously need regular activity, but the modern world strives to take exertion out of our lives. Modernity is characterised by imperatives to simplify, improve and maximise efficiency. In much the same way, medical bodies trying to motivate the population to exercise promise big results with the absolute minimum of disruption to our busy, seated lives. Anyone researching exercise strategies this new year will find that the government recommends \u201cat least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or brisk walking every week and strength exercises on 2 or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms)\u201d. If 150 minutes \u2013 or half an hour five times a week \u2013 is too much for you, and the data suggests that for most of us it is, another public health strategy promotes the efficacy of being active for just 10 minutes a day. Public Health England launched its Active10 campaign on the grounds that just 10 minutes\u2019 brisk walking each day \u201ccounts as exercise\u201d and \u201ccan reduce your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia and some cancers\u201d. Even less time is required for high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which can involve bouts of just 20 seconds of intense effort a few times a week. It seems there is good evidence for the efficacy of very short bursts of strenuous anaerobic exercise, such as sprinting or cycling hard, followed by a brief recovery period. Interval training may improve insulin sensitivity and oxygen circulation, and increase muscle mass. But one of the early researchers into HIIT, kinesiologist Dr Martin Gibala, worried that despite its benefits, it required \u201can extremely high level of subject motivation\u201d, because all-out exertion is unpleasant and can lead to dizziness, vomiting or injury. \u201cGiven the extreme nature of the exercise,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit is doubtful that the general population could safely or practically adopt the model.\u201d While all of these three modes of exercise are effective in different ways, and each has its proponents and committed followers, none is an all-round solution for a \u201cfit\u201d human body. But the problem is not really with the exercises themselves; it is what we tend to do in between those bursts of activity. The health effects of being sedentary are as common and recognisable as they are serious. Anxiety, depression, heart disease, breast and colon cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and the leading cause of global disability, back pain, are all driven by sedentary behaviours. For our bodies to function properly, they operate on the assumption that we will be burning calories throughout the day, and not in short bursts. It is clear that periods of sedentariness are bad for the human body, and some exercise is always going to be better than none; the issue is not really to do with the types of exercise, but with our approach to them and what we expect them to achieve. We know from the data that the human relationship with exercise is predominantly characterised as both optional and additional to an otherwise sedentary life, which itself causes a ton of problems. As long as physical activity is divorced from the real work of our lives, we will find reasons for not doing it. No matter how low the institutional expectations for physical activity drop, more of us fail to meet them each year. A Public Health England survey last year found that people in England are becoming so inactive that 40% of those aged between 40 and 60 walk briskly for less than 10 minutes a month. The reasons are numerous, but they seem to be connected to our notion of exercise, and the difference between short bursts of running or cycling and low-level, sustained physical activity. If we go back to the beginnings of exercise, we can see why it is still so problematic for us today. * * * The rise of exercise is synonymous with the rise of leisure. We associate this with the start of the Industrial Revolution, but in fact it dates from much earlier. Once humans settled and began to build, several thousand years ago, hierarchies began to form, particularly in cities, as did the gap between master and servant. To be one of the elite meant others were doing the physical work for you. For the masters, there was time to fill, and into this space grew the idea of leisure. Exercise also emerges here, in the imbalance created in the spread of labour performed across a population. Ever since, we have seen a powerful link between exercise and inequality. The wealthy men of ancient Greece, deprived of work by their slaves and with little else to do, invented a new place called the gymnasium, an open space in the city where they could strip off and gambol about naked, competing in made-up challenges to keep each other fit for war. Later, the Romans also celebrated the value of exercise. Cicero, the Roman politician and lawyer, said: \u201cIt is exercise alone that supports the spirits and keeps the mind in vigour.\u201d Pliny the Younger, a writer and also a lawyer, said: \u201cIt is remarkable how one\u2019s wits are sharpened by physical exercise.\u201d Like their Greek gym buddies, these men were privileged and wealthy. They understood that even though the slave class did their work for them, exercise and physical activity were essential for a long and sane life. After the Greeks and Romans, exercise all but disappeared from western culture. It didn\u2019t resurface properly until the 18th century, when inactivity became a problem for a certain class of gentleman. In 1797, the Monthly Magazine announced a new patent for Francis Lowndes\u2019 Gymnasticon, the earliest of the static exercise machines \u2013 a frame in which the user sat, turning a spindle with his arms and operating a treadle with his feet. The article noted that \u201cwhen peculiar or sedentary occupations enforce confinement to the house, it promises to be equally useful to the healthy as to the sick. The merchant, without withdrawing his attention from his accounts, and the student, while occupied in writing or reading, may have his lower limbs kept in constant motion by the slightest exertion, or, the assistance of a child.\u201d The handle on the contraption\u2019s lower spindle was arranged so that, if desired, a child could be employed to turn the wheel, to save the user valuable energy. In the early 20th century, calisthenics became popular among people with limited means of expending physical energy. In the opening pages of EM Forster\u2019s Howards End, from 1910, we are introduced to the Wilcox family as they come and go in their country-house garden. They are \u201cnew money\u201d; they see the world instrumentally, and are mostly allergic to it, too. A visitor reports the scene in a letter: \u201cThen Evie comes out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a greengage tree \u2013 they put everything to use \u2013 and then she says \u2018a-tissue,\u2019 and in she goes.\u201d Like inactivity, hay fever only seemed to afflict those higher up the social scale. In 1831 the Journal of Health defined calisthenics as \u201ca reasonable, methodical, and regular employment of the exercises best calculated to develop the physical powers of young girls, without detriment to the perfecting of the moral faculties\u201d. Its adoption was necessary because \u201cyoung girls have not the same freedom as boys in their outdoor exercise, and their customary amusements and occupations, when not at school, are of a more sedentary nature\u201d. Since our modern way of life denies many of us the physical exertion that kept our ancestors healthy, one way to gain social capital is to add it back in. Any kind of communal exercise gives us a sense of belonging, of shared values and endeavours, aside even from its more general physical and mental benefits. When people gather together in a gym or in an exercise class, at least one aspect of what they are doing is joining together in a civic activity that ensures their collective survival, just like the ancient Greeks before them. * * * If being fit promotes long life, you might expect being an elite athlete to help you reach a ripe old age. It doesn\u2019t. Olympians buy themselves an extra 2.8 years on average, according to a 2012 study. Devoting your life to sport and exercise will buy you more time, but once you factor in the Olympians\u2019 lifelong sustained attention to diet and healthy living, as well as tens of thousands of hours spent training, 2.8 years might not really seem sufficient recompense. Instead, the fittest and healthiest people on the planet have never been to a gym. These people, who report high levels of wellbeing and live extraordinarily long lives, inhabit what have been called \u201cblue zones\u201d \u2013 areas where lifestyles lead to peculiar longevity. The term was coined by two demographers, Gianni Pes and Michel Poulain, who, while collecting data on clusters of centenarians on the island of Sardinia, identified places of especially high longevity on their map with a blue felt-tip pen. Because clusters of long-lived people are often found in geographically remote places (also including parts of Okinawa, Costa Rica and Greece), jackpot genes seem like a strong candidate to explain their longevity. But a famous study of Danish twins has concluded that a long life seems to be only \u201cmoderately heritable\u201d. Over the years, many studies have looked at the lifestyles of people in \u201cblue zones\u201d and found that a number of their customs and habits contribute to a long life (everything from a sense of belonging and purpose to not smoking, or eating a predominantly plant-based diet). In the list of contributory factors, there is a noticeable absence of exercise. I travelled to Sardinia to meet Pes and find out more about his work. He has a vested interest in longevity. His great uncle was a supercentenarian (living beyond 110). The years that Pes is interested in finding out more about are the good ones, not those spent with 24-hour care in a nursing home (there are also none of these in Sardinia\u2019s blue zones). A trial by a group of gerontologists based at Boston University reported that 10% of supercentenarians made it to the final three months of their lives without being troubled by major age-related diseases. In my conversation with Pes, he repeatedly stressed that while diet and environment are important components of longevity, being sedentary is the enemy, and sustained, low-level activity is the key that research by him and others has uncovered: not the intense kinds of activity we tend to associate with exercise, but energy expended throughout the day. The supercentenarians he has worked with all walked several miles each day throughout their working lives. They never spent much time, if any, seated at desks. Pes has recently been studying workers in one of the island\u2019s regions of longevity, Seulo (population around 1,000). He discovered one group of women who had spent their working lives seated, but nonetheless reached a great age. They had been working treadles (pedal-powered sewing machines), which meant they had regularly burned sufficient calories to derive the longevity benefits of remaining active. (Lowndes\u2019 Gymnasticon, which works like a treadle, is starting to look a little less ridiculous as a solution for sedentary workers.) For all the trillions invested in healthcare year on year, there are regions in high-income nations (such as the UK and the US) where life expectancy is still as low as it was in the mid-60s. In Tower Hamlets, one of the poorer parts of London, men can only expect an average of 61 years of good health \u2013 and women just 56. So far, researchers agree that sustained periods of low-level activity seem to work well. Aiming for 10,000 steps a day is a good idea, but 15,000 better resembles the distances likely covered by our prehistoric ancestors, and indeed by those Sardinian centenarians. For those of us who can\u2019t move to Sardinia and become a shepherd, a review published in the Lancet in 2016 found that \u201chigh levels of moderate-intensity physical activity (ie, about 60-75 min per day) seem to eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time\u201d. So even if we go to the gym on a Saturday morning, our absolute inactivity at other times can still be damaging to the body. Low and moderate activity for longer or sustained periods seems to produce the best results. It looks like excessive high-intensity activity (the kind we see in elite athletes) drives metabolism and cell turnover, and may even, when all factors are taken into account, accelerate the ageing process. As those all-day activity trackers continue to mature into their second decade, they will no doubt find better ways of encouraging us out of our chairs. At the moment, though, they can only count the things we have done, not the opportunities for movement we have missed. They make us more likely to be attentive to our activity than our inactivity. * * * After two centuries of trying, we should accept that exercise is not working as a global fitness strategy while it remains an addition to the working day. In the long view, it is starting to look a lot like a fad. Government guidelines in the UK and other countries that encourage sport and exercise are failing. These strategies struggle because we are trying to get people to give up what little leisure time they have to pursue activities that require substantial additional effort. Perhaps instead we should encourage people to make the kinds of daily decisions that result in a healthier life. What is needed are the kinds of strategies that would make exercise unnecessary. Urban planning that better addresses the outdoor experience and encourages movement would be a key part of this change. But on an individual level, we can think about returning a little of the friction that technology has so subtly smoothed out for us, and make it easy to get things done. Exercise becomes physical activity when it is part of your daily life. A year ago, my car lease came up for renewal.

So it\u2019s easy to see why access to elite institutions has come to be seen as the litmus test of how equal our higher education system is.

Combining an austerity agenda with increasing tuition fees was not compatible with an egalitarian notion of access to education.

      "bodyText": "Elitism and Oxbridge: it is the hardy perennial of debate about the state of our universities. Last month yet another report \u2013 this one from the Sutton Trust \u2013 highlighted the extent to which Oxford and Cambridge remain dominated by students from the south-east of England, many of them selected from a small number of elite fee-paying and selective state schools. The stark inequity of Oxbridge and Russell Group admissions has been a recurrent theme for at least a decade. Despite genuine efforts to increase access for students from marginalised communities, progress has been achingly slow. So it\u2019s easy to see why access to elite institutions has come to be seen as the litmus test of how equal our higher education system is. But a preoccupation with squeezing a few more poorer students through the narrow gates of elite colleges, desirable though that is, has eclipsed the real problem bedevilling our university system: a fair deal for the institutions that are educating everybody else. In post-1992 universities, funding has been slashed and finances threatened for access and foundation courses in further education colleges, and for learning courses in community centres. And in the post-2010 era of cuts, the notion of lifelong learning has virtually fallen off the radar. Combining an austerity agenda with increasing tuition fees was not compatible with an egalitarian notion of access to education. It was much easier to focus attention on numbers of young people from working-class and ethnic-minority communities entering elite universities, than on older students doing access courses at FE colleges or taking part-time degrees at former polytechnics or the Open University. The fairytale of social mobility for a few trumped the less glamorous reality of educational access for the many. As a result, education policy has become dominated by the impossible dream of perfect social mobility. Of course there is no doubt about the need to diversify elite institutions and change their cultures, but the danger is that we then see educational inequality as solely a problem of individual success stories rather than collective provision. There is nothing democratic or egalitarian about concentrating vast financial resources in the education of a narrow elite while dismantling the educational institutions that serve the rest. The cultural and economic democracy we need is not compatible with a model of higher education that is so deeply hierarchical. Our priority should be to increase the prospect of good jobs and fulfilling careers, especially in the marginalised communities that have expressed their anger through the Brexit vote. We don\u2019t need to redouble our attention on wealthy elite universities in south-east England. What we need is to redistribute cultural and economic wealth away from these bastions of privilege. Faiza Shaheen, the director of the Class thinktank, has spoken about the need to go beyond the language of social mobility and think about what collective success in education looks like. The alternatives to a hierarchical system are not hard to find. A recent book by Bristol academics, Who Are Universities For?, outlines a flatter model in which, crucially, it is far easier to move from work into education and back again. The argument is that, in recruitment to higher education, students from local communities should be a greater priority \u2013 meaning inclusive curricula which reflect the intake. Instead of deep divisions between academic and vocational courses, a modular system of credits for individual courses would allow greater movement between different institutions and subjects. Eventually the old divisions characterising the traditional degree structure would dissolve into a more fluid model of education, which people dip in and out of over the course of their lives. Yet the educational solutions we need cannot stop with fairer access. We also need universities that are run democratically in the interests of students and staff \u2013 and serve their local community. At the University of Leicester in 2016, staff and local people campaigned against the university managers\u2019 decision to close down the lifelong learning centre, Vaughan College. The managers ignored the voices of staff and students, and the centre will finally close in 2020. But staff from the college have refounded it as a cooperative, running courses for adult learners with the aim of continuing to provide access to higher education for adults in the city. Similar experiments in cooperative education have been developed in Lincoln, and a separate project to establish a cooperative university with full degree-awarding powers is currently under way. These are the kinds of projects that can really contribute to a more egalitarian university system. In a country that has been divided by Brexit and is still to find its post-industrial identity, we need to jettison the idea of universities as the dreaming spires to which a lucky few can find their way. This means dismantling and transforming our ideas about what education is and who it is for. The beginnings of a new educational politics are visible in places like Lincoln and Leicester; what is needed among researchers and policymakers is the courage to respond collectively to foster and deepen these ideas. If education is to be transformational and to play a role in the economic, social and regional redistribution our country needs, then those who work in universities have to question what our collective role is and what we want it to be. And the answer has to be bigger than widening access to Oxford and Cambridge. \u2022 Sol Gamsu is a sociology lecturer at Durham University and a researcher on education and inequality \u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2019, correcting the claim that Lincoln is the site of a project to set up a cooperative university with full degree-awarding powers",

Which is how the film gets you to understand some of what Chantal is going through. Because she is seduced by him in very much the same way, thrilled by his flattering attentions and his interest in her education, talking to her about books and art. And poor Rachel, with her inferiority complex, simply accepts that this is what is going to happen. Perhaps she thinks that Chantal has somehow inherited her ex-lover\u2019s callousness and there is nothing to be done. She has tragically misread the situation and when she shyly starts having a friendship with a new man, Franck (Ga\u00ebl Kamilindi), an even greater emotional humiliation is in store.</p> <p>Corsini is a film-maker who has always been drawn to the themes of female sexuality and the challenge and transgression that it represents. This is her best picture so far. She invests the relationship between Chantal and Rachel with enormous power and their final encounter is almost unbearably emotional. Chantal learns that some kinds of love are possible after all.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-2QL8tjP2I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B-2QL8tjP2I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

Because she is seduced by him in very much the same way, thrilled by his flattering attentions and his interest in her education, talking to her about books and art. And poor Rachel, with her inferiority complex, simply accepts that this is what is going to happen. Perhaps she thinks that Chantal has somehow inherited her ex-lover\u2019s callousness and there is nothing to be done. She has tragically misread the situation and when she shyly starts having a friendship with a new man, Franck (Ga\u00ebl Kamilindi), an even greater emotional humiliation is in store. Corsini is a film-maker who has always been drawn to the themes of female sexuality and the challenge and transgression that it represents. This is her best picture so far. She invests the relationship between Chantal and Rachel with enormous power and their final encounter is almost unbearably emotional. Chantal learns that some kinds of love are possible after all.",

The media will bang on about dementia and loneliness, but ignore them. Concentrate on the upside.</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>Take yourself out of your comfort zone. Resist being pigeonholed; keep experimenting; challenge yourself and society\u2019s stereotyping of you.</p> <p><strong>3. </strong>Try to stay healthy. Eat well and take lots of exercise \u2013 it\u2019s good for brain and body. Exercise doesn\u2019t have to mean playing competitive ice hockey; the odd brisk walk will keep you in shape.</p> <p><strong>4. </strong>Look for positive role models. Helen Mirren, David Attenborough and, best of all, Michelangelo, who lived until the ripe old age (in 16th-century terms) of 88 and spent the final 20 years of his life designing and overseeing the construction of St Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome. Now that\u2019s a way to go out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ff387c5c6b8b96b231de78ce6d6ed0a34dac1bf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff387c5c6b8b96b231de78ce6d6ed0a34dac1bf8/485_0_2111_2111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Mirren\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Positive role model: Helen Mirren.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. </strong>Seek to become the person you always wanted to be. One reason many people are at their happiest in their 60s is that they feel freer and less beholden to others. They contain all their previous selves and can start to make sense of them.</p> <p><strong>6. </strong>Don\u2019t just maintain social connections with your own age group: mix across the generations as much as you can. Inter-generational contact has become increasingly difficult, but if we can do it we benefit \u2013 and society benefits.</p> <p><strong>7. </strong>Be willing to let stuff go. If that friendship isn\u2019t working, drop it. Streamline your life. There is less time left, so make it count.</p> <p><strong>8. </strong>Ageing should be a process of opening rather than closing doors. \u201cWe will lose some things \u2013 speed, stamina, a bit of mental agility \u2013 but in many other respects we gain,\u201d says Honor\u00e9. We learn new skills, have greater social awareness, are likely to be more altruistic, are \u201clighter\u201d in our approach to life \u2013 because we are less hung up on creating a good impression \u2013 and can see the bigger picture. It may be that we are in a position to make a greater contribution to society in our 60s and 70s than in our so-called prime.</p> <p><strong>9. </strong>Honesty is the best policy. Don\u2019t try to pretend you are not 75 or 85 or whatever age you are. \u201cAs soon as we start lying about our age, we\u2019re giving the number a terrible power \u2013 a power it doesn\u2019t deserve,\u201d says Honor\u00e9. People do it because there are so many ageist assumptions attached to age, but the way to fight back is to subvert those assumptions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c870dd94718208168f4175985a4e797c407930f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c870dd94718208168f4175985a4e797c407930f2/1046_0_3407_3407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Older couple kissing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Love and romance is not just the preserve of the young.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WIN-Initiative/Neleman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>10. </strong>Society tells us that sex, love and romance belong to the young, but it\u2019s not true. Plenty of older people continue to experience the joy of sex. But there are no rules: have as much \u2013 or as little \u2013 as you want. Some older people see it as a blessed release to escape the shackles of falling in love (and lust), but others can\u2019t imagine life without it. Whatever turns you on.</p> <p><strong>11. </strong>Ignore people who say you can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks. You can. Despite the common perception that creativity is the preserve of the young, we can get more creative as we get older. Our neural networks loosen up and we have the confidence and freedom to challenge groupthink. Honor\u00e9 was encouraged last year when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/03/older-artists-on-turner-prize-shortlist-after-it-axes-upper-age-limit\" title=\"\">the Turner prize abolished its age limit for artists</a>.

Embrace it \u2013 just not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s useful to know our lives are bookended,\u201d says Honor\u00e9. \u201cWhen time is running out, it becomes more precious. It gives life shape and, in some ways, meaning.\u201d Don\u2019t dwell morbidly on it, but don\u2019t shy away from it either. The closer you get to it, the less you are likely to fear it and the greater your focus will be on the things that really matter.</p>",

Third, migration experts from EU countries, which have dealt with more than 1.8 million arrivals since 2014 \u2013 the majority from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq \u2013 are unequivocal that the relentless focus on policing, defence and surveillance has not prevented migrants from entering Europe, but has increased the likelihood that they will die attempting to do so.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5001acf8-c169-4238-b9c1-5975d5dc6091\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rkrqusd6WdI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The truth is that Britain\u2019s stance towards migrants has never had much to do with reason and everything to do with a cultural hostility that stretches back centuries.

She plays a game called Skyrim for up to 12 hours at a time, comments on her progress on YouTube, and has become a hero in the gaming world. Honor\u00e9 likes the fact that her style of play is more stately and less frenetic than most: a nice union of an old head and a young heart. \u201cShe completely torpedoes the idea that tech is only for the young,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd is also saying: \u2018I can play your games but I\u2019ll play them on my terms and in my way and I\u2019ll still thrive.\u2019 She was having a great time, and making friends across the generational line, so she incarnates so much of what the book is about.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Velma Bascome</strong>, who Honor\u00e9 describes in his book, with a hint of the ageism he\u2019s left behind, as a \u201cknitting granny from central casting\u201d. Bascome, who is in her early 70s, works for a fashion company in New York producing high-end knitwear. \u201cKnitting grannydom is such a cliche of old age for women and not an especially flattering one,\u201d Honor\u00e9 says. \u201cThis takes that image and subverts it. Yes, she\u2019s still knitting, but she\u2019s knitting in a kickass kind of way. She\u2019s successful, very cool, great company and loving her life. She\u2019s also a good example of creativity marching on into later life. She was coming up with new ways of finishing garments that are now being used across the whole range of the company. She\u2019s the company\u2019s star knitter, and is knitting the thirtysomething knitters into the ground.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Steve Cronshaw</strong> is a retired engineer from the UK and a keen racing cyclist who was deadly serious about the sport in his 20s and remained an enthusiast. Honor\u00e9 found the 60-year-old hurtling around a velodrome in a tournament for veteran track cyclists in Roubaix, northern France, and says the inspiring thing about him was that he could cycle faster at 60 than he did at 40. Honor\u00e9 had been having doubts about the book when he met Cronshaw and was wondering whether he could find a positive message in ageing. Cronshaw helped convince him that he could, not least as the cyclist had had to overcome his own doubts about middle-aged men in Lycra. \u201cAt first he was appalled by the Mamils and the middle-aged flesh,\u201d recalls Honor\u00e9, \u201cso he had to overcome his own ageism and chamber-of-horrors story.\u201d Cronshaw did it and was now happily squeezing his body into Lycra to set new world records for his age group.</p> <p><strong>Jeanne d\u2019Arc Zarazir</strong> (\u201cJaco\u201d) was a Lebanese TV star in her mid-80s who appeared in a Candid Camera-type programme in which she and other oldies played tricks on unsuspecting members of the public. In his book, Honor\u00e9 describes several of the pranks \u2013 going shopping at a pharmacy for Viagra, buying pregnancy test kits and posing as doddery medics taking blood samples from anxious patients. He met Jaco just before she died in 2017, and admired her unquenchable joie de vivre. \u201cShe had such a spirit of laughter,\u201d he says. \u201cHer obituaries said she was the funniest woman in Lebanon, even though she didn\u2019t become a TV star until she was in her 80s. She was a walking, talking example of the idea that it\u2019s never too late to dream a new dream or find a new love.\u201d</p>",

Jeanne d\u2019Arc Zarazir (\u201cJaco\u201d) was a Lebanese TV star in her mid-80s who appeared in a Candid Camera-type programme in which she and other oldies played tricks on unsuspecting members of the public. In his book, Honor\u00e9 describes several of the pranks \u2013 going shopping at a pharmacy for Viagra, buying pregnancy test kits and posing as doddery medics taking blood samples from anxious patients. He met Jaco just before she died in 2017, and admired her unquenchable joie de vivre. \u201cShe had such a spirit of laughter,\u201d he says. \u201cHer obituaries said she was the funniest woman in Lebanon, even though she didn\u2019t become a TV star until she was in her 80s. She was a walking, talking example of the idea that it\u2019s never too late to dream a new dream or find a new love.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Fijian prime minister has declared the Australian-born Isis recruiter Neil Prakash will not be allowed into the country, in the latest development of an ongoing disagreement over Prakash\u2019s citizenship. Voreqe Bainimarama, the prime minister and minister for foreign affairs, told the Fiji Sun newspaper Prakash \u201ccannot come here because he does not qualify\u201d. \u201cAt any rate, he is a terrorist and a member of Isis. We don\u2019t entertain them nor do we accommodate them,\u201d Bainimarama said. Australia\u2019s home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has defended the cancellation of Prakash\u2019s citizenship and maintained the 27-year-old is a citizen of Fiji despite the insistence of Fijian immigration authorities to the contrary. Under Australian law a dual national can be stripped of their Australian citizenship if they have committed terrorist acts, but international law prohibits rendering a person stateless. Prakash\u2019s citizenship was revoked over his ties to Islamic State, and on government legal advice that he was a dual national with Fiji. Prakash was informed on 21 December, but it was only publicly revealed on Friday. On Tuesday the head of Fiji\u2019s immigration department said he had learned of the case through the media and had searched their records for Prakash, finding no sign of him ever being a citizen, seeking citizenship, or his father seeking it on his behalf. Dutton responded that the citizenship was withdrawn \u201cautomatically\u201d after an assessment by the Citizenship Loss Board. He said the government\u2019s advice from the solicitor general was that Prakash was indeed a Fijian citizen. However, Fijian immigration law has changed several times in the years since Prakash\u2019s birth in Melbourne in 1991 to a Fijian-Indian father and Cambodian mother. According to legal analysis obtained by Guardian Australia, it would appear the only way in which Prakash could have become and remained a Fijian citizen was under laws brought in following the 2006 coup. Under the 1990 constitution Prakash\u2019s father would have given up his Fijian citizenship if he had become an Australian citizen prior to Prakash\u2019s birth, and would have been unable to pass on Fijian citizenship to his son. If Prakash\u2019s father had instead kept Fijian citizenship and thus passed it on to his son, under the 1997 constitution, Prakash \u2013 an Australian by birth \u2013 would have automatically forfeited his Fijian citizenship at the age of 22. In 2009 the 1997 constitution was suspended, and under the Citizenship of Fiji Decree 2009, anyone born outside of Fiji was allowed to apply for citizenship, if their parent was a Fijian national at the time of that child\u2019s birth. However, the Fijian immigration department maintains there has never been an application by or on behalf of Prakash. Prakash remains in a Turkish jail, facing terrorism charges which carry prison sentences of up to 15 years. Australia has sought his extradition over his alleged role in two terrorism plots, including one to target Anzac Day services in Melbourne in 2015, and over his travel to Syria to fight with Isis. Fiji has not sought his extradition, and it was not clear whether Bainimarama\u2019s comments meant Prakash would be barred from Fiji because he wasn\u2019t a citizen, or because of his terrorist affiliations. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, will travel to Fiji later this month, when it\u2019s expected discussions will include Prakash. Bainimarama\u2019s office has not responded to requests for comment. Confusion over international citizenship law has been something of a theme in the Australian parliament, with a number of MPs found to be potentially or actually ineligible because they had dual citizenship they weren\u2019t aware of, or which they hadn\u2019t properly rescinded. The Prakash case also highlights concerns with the Coalition\u2019s proposed terrorism legislation, which would dilute the required level of belief that an individual was a dual national in order to cancel their Australian citizenship. The new laws, if passed, would allow a minister to strip someone with a terrorism conviction of Australian citizenship regardless of the severity of the conviction and need only be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d that the person would hold a second citizenship. Dutton also said the government had informed Fiji about Prakash, a claim rejected by the director of Fiji\u2019s immigration department, Nemani Vuniwaqa. On Thursday the Herald Sun reported Dutton had argued with the department of foreign affairs and trade over informing Fiji and other nations that Australia would be stripping the citizenship of Prakash and four other terrorists. The shadow minister for trade and investment, Jason Clare, called on Dutton to release the legal advice about Prakash. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see this bloke as an Australian citizen, I\u2019d rather see him as a citizen of the afterworld,\u201d Clare told media. \u201cBut Peter Dutton\u2019s the minister here and he\u2019s got a responsibility to make the decisions according to the law, to make sure he gets them right and it looks, from what the Fijian prime minister\u2019s just said this morning, that Peter Dutton\u2019s stuffed up.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Australian dollar was hit hard overnight, Australian time, slumping below 70 US cents before a sharp and more extreme move saw it temporarily crash to a low of 67.40 US cents. It subsequently recovered marginally, but remains weak at around 69.40 US cents. Rather than focus on the micro aspects of minute-by-minute or hour-by-hour moves in the dollar, which can be more noise than substance, the trend for the dollar over the past year has been down. In January 2018, the Australian dollar was trading at 81.50 US cents. There is increasing concern from global investors that all is not well with the Australian economy. Policy is in a do-nothing phase. Entrenched low wages growth is hampering growth in household spending. This is being complemented, in a negative way, by a sharp fall in wealth as house prices drop and the share market weakens, both of which will be a negative for the economy during 2019. This is because householders are simply not getting the income growth nor wealth accumulation needed to allow them to keep spending at a rate that will see the economy expand at a pace that will generate upside wage and inflation momentum. Strategies aimed at reducing debt and paring back new borrowings mean, by definition, weaker economic growth over the near term. The rosy forecasts from the Reserve Bank of Australia and Treasury published just last month are a pipe dream. Investors know this and are selling Australian dollars and buying government bonds as a result. No credible forecaster believes the RBA\u2019s growth and wages forecasts. This assessment has driven an about-face in market expectations for official interest rates. Investors and the market are treating the RBA forecasts and rhetoric \u2013 that \u201cthe next move in the cash rate is more likely to be an increase than a decrease\u201d \u2013 with disdain. Interest rate futures are pricing in the strong possibility of an interest rate cut in late 2019 or early 2020, with the economic growth deceleration, problems with wages and the failure of the RBA to meet its inflation target as primary reasons. A slowing in global growth is also impacting. If the RBA is to deliver a decent and sustained trend rate of economic growth \u2013 that is one that will underpin an economy that will deliver an improved and tighter labour market that in turn drives an acceleration in inflation back to the mid-point of its target range \u2013 lower interest rates are needed. The RBA board next meets on 5 February, and if it is to maintain a semblance of credibility, it will drop its rose-coloured view of the local economy and acknowledge the downside momentum unfolding before its eyes. It will need to flag the need for easier policy. The dollar is set to take another hit on the back of this change in official view. Also impacting the value of the Australian dollar are the increasing weighty problems in the Chinese economy. China takes around one-third of Australia\u2019s merchandise exports, which makes it a vital part of any assessment of the economy and the Australian dollar. Chinese economic growth has slowed to its weakest pace in two decades and a further slowing in 2019 is assured. The trade and tariff war with the US is undermining the manufacturing sector and to the extent the major buyers of Chinese goods are also experiencing a stalling in growth, the global outlook has taken a turn to the downside. The economies of the US, eurozone and Japan are also slowing and registering worryingly low inflation, particularly in the context of how stimulatory monetary policy has been for a decade or more. The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are keeping monetary policy tilted towards extreme stimulus, notwithstanding occasional rhetorical flourishes from some of the more hawkish members of each institution. Even the US Federal Reserve, which has hiked its interest rates to 2.5% over the past two years, is poised to pause its rate-hiking cycle. It could even reverse some of those interest rate hikes later this year as the US economy enters a period of more problematic growth and severe budget problems. In simple terms, the Australian dollar tends to be strong when the global economy and local economic growth is strong, and it tends to fall in times of economic weakness. What we are witnessing now is no different from this well-established trend. The 10c decline in the Australian dollar over the course of the past year is well within the range of normal moves seen since it was floated in 1983. Given the unfolding slump in housing, the labour market, global growth and the major commodity price indices, we might see something close to another 10c decline in the Australian dollar over the year ahead.",

Overwhelmed by the offerings \u2013 cured pigs heads hanging from hooks, a literal tower of cheeses \u2013 she holds her hand to her chest, before clutching a pile of fresh parsley and getting high off the herbaceous supply. The produce is bountiful, spilling from wicker baskets, and the stallholders are all in good spirits, throwing their arms up with delight whenever Meryl so much as glances in their direction. The scene is pure Hollywood, a Nora Ephron fairytale and yet, to me, always represented the quintessential market experience \u2013 simple yet pretentious, indulgent yet wholesome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2013/jun/25/market-shopping-top-tips\">How to enjoy a food market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Growing up, the only markets I encountered were the sort you might find in a beachy tourist town. Targeting the seasick and sunburnt, they hawked jars of coloured bath salts, knitted coathangers and other gifts you give to people you love but don\u2019t care enough about to really get to know. I\u2019d heard about farmers markets, but they seemed to only exist in other places, for <em>other</em> people. For the longest time, I knew two things to be true \u2013 markets were largely glorified carboot sales, and try as you might, you could not buy asparagus outside of a tin.</p> <p>It all changed a year ago, when I moved to Brisbane\u2019s West End and discovered the bustling markets at Davies Park. Where some markets feel akin to a hedge maze, these border a football oval and follow a comforting L-shape. Aside from the secondhand book stall and the man selling holistic healing from a card table, the markets are occupied by fruit and vegetable growers, bakers and buskers.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019d often felt the markets had failed to live up to their promise. There\u2019s a scene in Julie &amp; Julia, where Meryl Streep, embodying food writer Julia Child, breezes through a row of Parisian street stalls. Overwhelmed by the offerings \u2013 cured pigs heads hanging from hooks, a literal tower of cheeses \u2013 she holds her hand to her chest, before clutching a pile of fresh parsley and getting high off the herbaceous supply. The produce is bountiful, spilling from wicker baskets, and the stallholders are all in good spirits, throwing their arms up with delight whenever Meryl so much as glances in their direction. The scene is pure Hollywood, a Nora Ephron fairytale and yet, to me, always represented the quintessential market experience \u2013 simple yet pretentious, indulgent yet wholesome. Growing up, the only markets I encountered were the sort you might find in a beachy tourist town. Targeting the seasick and sunburnt, they hawked jars of coloured bath salts, knitted coathangers and other gifts you give to people you love but don\u2019t care enough about to really get to know. I\u2019d heard about farmers markets, but they seemed to only exist in other places, for other people. For the longest time, I knew two things to be true \u2013 markets were largely glorified carboot sales, and try as you might, you could not buy asparagus outside of a tin. It all changed a year ago, when I moved to Brisbane\u2019s West End and discovered the bustling markets at Davies Park. Where some markets feel akin to a hedge maze, these border a football oval and follow a comforting L-shape. Aside from the secondhand book stall and the man selling holistic healing from a card table, the markets are occupied by fruit and vegetable growers, bakers and buskers. One busker belts Pretty Vacant by the Sex Pistols at the exact same time each Saturday, while another has taken to playing John Williams\u2019 Indiana Jones theme on the flute.

      "bodyText": "Eight and a half years after it was abandoned in the middle of the Indian Ocean when 16-year-old solo sailor Abby Sunderland had to be rescued in rough seas, a yellow yacht named Wild Eyes has been found floating upside down off the coast of South Australia. The 40-foot yacht was encrusted with barnacles, the signature eyes on the hull scratched and faded. Its mast snapped off in the wild weather that forced Sunderland\u2019s rescue midway through her world record attempt to be the youngest solo sailor to circumnavigate the globe in 2010. Sunderland, who said she saw the footage of the rediscovered yacht on the news, said she was \u201cvery emotional\u201d. \u201cMy heart skipped a beat,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIt brought back many memories \u2013 good and not so good \u2013 but it was neat to see it after so long. It looked a little creepy but that\u2019s to be expected after so long.\u201d The yacht was spotted from the air by a tuna spotter plane about 12.30pm on Monday, 11 nautical miles from Vivonne Bay on Kangaroo Island. The South Australian police helicopter and two commercial fishing vessels were sent to investigate and identified the yacht. It had not been seen since Sunderland was picked up and rescued by the French ship Ile de la Reunion on 12 June 2010, midway between Madagascar and Western Australia. In a blog post written on the Ile de la Reunion hours after she was picked up, Sunderland said: \u201cThe long and the short of it is, well, one long wave, and one short mast (short meaning two inch stub.) ... am still trying to get over the fact that I will never see my Wild Eyes again.\u201d A month later, after she had returned home to California, she said it was unlikely the boat would ever be found. \u201cA lot of people have been asking about Wild Eyes,\u201d she wrote on 5 July, 2010. \u201cShe was still afloat when I boarded the Ile de la Reunion. She could end up on a beach in Western Australia at some point, but it\u2019s just a guess, we don\u2019t know for sure. \u201cShe would have to be very lucky to wash up on a beach, and not get smashed on the rocks or something like that. While I do wish that she would be found and fixed up, it\u2019s not all that likely she will be found.\u201d Sunderland, now 25, set sail from Marina del Rey in California on 23 January in 2010 but had to restart her world record attempt at Cabo San Lucas in Mexico 10 days later due to electrical problems and higher-than-expected fuel and power use from her navigation and communication systems. Her family had bought the Australian-built Wild Eyes and in October the year before, just months after her elder brother Zach became the first person under the age of 18 to sail solo around the world, with stops and assistance, and kitted it out specifically for her journey. She said on Thursday that she was curious to see whether any of her video equipment, which was recording her journey, had survived. She had closed the hatch of the racing yacht before disembarking, which may have protected the inside. \u201cIt would be great to try and retrieve the boat but given the costs I don\u2019t think that will happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI always knew the boat was high quality and very safe so it doesn\u2019t really surprise me that it\u2019s still floating.\u201d Sunderland intended to beat her brother\u2019s record and complete a non-stop circumnavigation, but had to stop in Cape Town for repairs in May. She activated her emergency satellite beacons after being tumbled about in 60-knot winds and 50-foot waves about 2,000 miles east of Madagascar. Her parents were heavily criticised for allowing her to undertake the attempt, and Sunderland in turn criticised the media saying that her age had nothing to do with encountering a storm in the southern ocean, something she said happened to all sailors. Australian Jessica Watson, who is just five months older than Sunderland, is the youngest person ever to complete a solo non-stop circumnavigation and arrived home in Sydney on 15 May 2010, three days before her 17th birthday and six days before Sunderland departed Cape Town.",

      "bodyText": "An architect described as a 21st-century Frank Matcham \u2013 the legendary designer of the London Palladium and Coliseum \u2013 has been named the most influential person in British theatre. Steve Tompkins has been responsible for a string of transformative theatre building projects including at the Royal Court, Young Vic, Bush, National Theatre and Bridge Theatre in London and the Liverpool Everyman, his first theatre built from scratch for which he won the Stirling Prize in 2014. The completion last year of redevelopments at Bristol Old Vic and Battersea Arts Centre (BAC) in London has helped propel him to the top of the annual 100-strong power list published by the Stage. Tompkins, who was 23rd in last year\u2019s list, has overtaken better known theatre names such as the producer Sonia Friedman (who is second on the list), Andrew Lloyd Webber (third) and Cameron Mackintosh (fourth). The Battersea job was particularly challenging. Tompkins and his practice, Haworth Tompkins, had been working on transforming the town hall building into a 21st-century arts centre when a fire in 2015 left the grand hall a charred shell. It reopened last summer, with some of the scorch marks kept deliberately. David Jubb, the BAC\u2019s departing artistic director, called Tompkins a theatremaker. \u201cAs well as being an architect he is a programmer, producer, artist, environmentalist, entrepreneur, romantic, pragmatist and humanitarian. When Steve leads a project he invites everyone to be creative.\u201d Jubb said Tompkins succeeded in making theatre buildings that encouraged interaction, \u201cin other words to bring communities together to make change\u201d. Alistair Smith, the editor of the Stage, said Tompkins could be seen as a modern-day successor to Matcham, the Victorian architect responsible for many important theatres including London\u2019s Hippodrome and Hackney Empire. There was a crucial difference, though. \u201cUnlike Matcham, whose theatres divided audiences by class, Tompkins\u2019 approach is all about democratising theatregoing \u2026 He is literally and physically transforming British theatre and his legacy will be experienced by millions of theatregoers for years to come.\u201d Tompkins, whose background is in social housing, said he was \u201cthrilled and slightly taken aback\u201d at the accolade, which he said was recognition for a wider collective effort. \u201cTheatres are the places where individuals meet to affirm the things that we share in common.

In a report prepared ahead of the chancellor\u2019s government spending review, which is due later this year, the Resolution Foundation said that the additional funds could be raised to help finance the higher spending on public services needed to meet the demand of Britain\u2019s ageing population. It comes after Hammond used the autumn budget to declare that austerity would end after almost a decade of government cuts under the Conservatives, with a pledge that the spending review would raise departmental spending by an average of 1.2% a year in real terms over the five years from 2021. Designed to set spending allocations for Whitehall departments, from prisons to transport and education, the outcome of the review is expected to be unveiled with the autumn budget this year. Wider health cost pressures are set to raise the price tag of the welfare state by \u00a336bn a year by 2030 and \u00a383bn by 2040, even if the current level of support is only maintained rather than increased. The Resolution Foundation warned that, should the government opt to fund the increase through income taxes, the basic rate of income tax would need to rise from 20p in the \u00a31 to 39p. It said that simple tweaks to wealth taxes could be used instead as a \u201cdown payment\u201d to share the burden more equitably, at a time when total wealth in Britain has risen to a record \u00a312.8tn, more than seven times the size of the UK economy. Options include limiting entrepreneurs\u2019 relief to save \u00a31.6bn a year and implementing changes to council tax in England that have already been made in Scotland \u2013 including increases in the top bands \u2013 to raise \u00a31.4bn a year. Clamping down on inheritance tax loopholes, a change to pensions tax relief to cap the tax-free lump sum, and scrapping Help to Buy and lifetime ISAs could also help boost the government\u2019s coffers, it said. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cYes, this is politically difficult, but the good news is that relatively large sums can be raised simply by tightening up our existing wealth taxes and subsidies.
