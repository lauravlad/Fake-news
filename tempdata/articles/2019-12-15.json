      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson made a raft of promises and comments indicating future policy during the election campaign. Our specialist reporters take a look at what we can now expect from the government on key policy areas.</p> \n<h2><strong>Health</strong></h2> \n<p>Johnson said the NHS would be his government\u2019s top priority. He has made an array of pledges \u2013 on funding, staffing and new facilities \u2013 aimed at reviving a visibly ailing service that hospital bosses say is \u201con its knees\u201d. Johnson\u2019s voluble support for an institution \u201cthat represents the very best of our country\u201d means he will be closely scrutinised over the delivery of his promises, several of which may prove very challenging.</p> \n<p>Johnson has promised to increase the budget of the NHS in England by \u00a320.5bn in real terms (after inflation) by 2023-24. That is less than the equivalent \u00a326bn extra that Labour offered. While that will be the biggest uplift in cash terms the NHS has ever received, the annual 3.4% rises are smaller than the NHS\u2019s historical average and less than health thinktanks believe it needs, given demand for care is going up very rapidly. </p> \n<p>The Conservatives have committed to building 40 new hospitals in England by 2030. Only six of these \u2013 which will receive \u00a32.7bn and should be ready by 2025 \u2013 have been identified so far. Twenty-one other NHS trusts will share \u00a3100m seed money to help them draw up plans for the 34 other projects. Experts say the 40 will cost up to \u00a324bn, although the government\u2019s estimate is \u00a313bn. It is unclear whether the money will come from the NHS\u2019s capital budget or be over and above the sums Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have pledged.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6e4923da-fd05-4190-b5ac-0cb4efa3bf7e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/97bug1-rttM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Lack of staff remains the NHS\u2019s number one problem. Johnson was scorned for pledging to recruit 50,000 extra nurses and then admitting that 18,500 of them would come from stopping existing staff quitting early. Restoring maintenance grants of up to \u00a38,000 a year for student nurses should improve recruitment, but nursing leaders doubt the 50,000 pledge will be met. There is similar scepticism about the aim of recruiting 6,000 more GPs, given numbers have actually fallen since a 2015 pledge to grow the family doctor workforce by 5,000. Without more GPs the promise of 50m extra appointments a year will prove illusory, even with more physiotherapists, pharmacists and other health professionals working in surgeries to take some of the pressure off family doctors.</p> \n<p>Waiting times for A&amp;E care, planned operations and cancer treatment have worsened so sharply in recent years that the Health Foundation thinktank is warning that \u201cthe safety net [of the NHS] \u2026 is at risk of breaking down\u201d. Delays are the worst since records began. The millions of people affected by longer and longer waits are likely to become Johnson\u2019s biggest NHS problem. He has no obvious plan to resolve this beyond more money, more staff and backing for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/07/what-is-the-nhs-long-term-plan-and-can-it-achieve-its-aims\">NHS long-term plan</a>, which aims to keep people healthier. <strong>Denis Campbell</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Brexit</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abe2450b9fd42660db1e8eb9d3ab3d2f3bb6299d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abe2450b9fd42660db1e8eb9d3ab3d2f3bb6299d/0_209_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove speaks at a final general election campaign event in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Gove speaks at a final general election campaign event in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Michael Gove has said a new Brexit deal will be concluded by the end of next year. High-level political negotiations will start in February, and the detail of getting Britain ready for Brexit is where the devil lies.</p> \n<p>Much work has been done on the new systems that must be in place for the worst possible outcome of talks in relation to the Dover-Calais crossing and other UK-EU trade issues. No work has been done on the Great Britain to Northern Ireland routes that must now be treated as a UK-EU border under the Johnson deal. HMRC has previously said it would take five years to get what was known as a maximum facilitation customs IT arrangement in place.</p> \n<p>If tariffs on goods exported from the UK into the EU apply after 2020, a new tariff rebate system has to be bolted on to cover goods that go from Great Britain to Northern Ireland only. This would apply, for instance, to all goods going from Tesco warehouses in the UK to supermarket shelves in Belfast, Derry or Armagh.</p> \n<p>Border inspection posts will have to be built from scratch for sanitary and phytosanitary checks on all animals and fresh food going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The EU has already said it would prefer them to be in ports such as Stranraer and Liverpool to prevent potential disease in animals, plants or timber pallets making its way on to the island of Ireland.</p> \n<p>The Northern Ireland office has had several meetings with business leaders on what checks will be necessary but these cannot be determined in detail until after Brexit on 31 January.</p> \n<p>Under the withdrawal agreement, specialist committees to determine this detail cannot be appointed until the withdrawal agreement is ratified. This means they could be up and running by February, leaving 11 months for preparation. But as HMRC has warned previously, IT systems take years, not months, to build. <strong>Lisa O\u2019Carroll</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Education</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b68c039c683e5c64ce6167b5bb2eac29ea531101\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68c039c683e5c64ce6167b5bb2eac29ea531101/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pupils at St Ninians primary school in Stirling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pupils at St Ninians primary school in Stirling.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allan Milligan/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The new government\u2019s policies on education in England are less oven-ready and more baked in, with the bulk of policies on schools, colleges and universities having been announced before the election campaign began.</p> \n<p>In terms of reforms, the signature policies are set in place, as they have been since David Cameron: converting schools into academies and using tuition fees and student loans to fund demand for higher education. While Theresa May wanted to revise the fees and loans system, Boris Johnson has shown little appetite to do so other than trimming the interest rates charged to students.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives\u2019 slim manifesto offers more money for schools, reversing the real-terms cuts since 2009. Johnson\u2019s intention is to raise per-pupil spending to at least \u00a34,000 in primaries and \u00a35,000 in secondaries, although many schools in deprived and urban areas are already higher. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, had announced plans to raise pay for newly qualified teachers to \u00a330,000, to shore up recruitment. Existing teachers, however, are unhappy at the Conservative election pledge to beef up Ofsted inspections.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/johnson-warned-majority-will-not-speed-up-brexit-talks\">Johnson is warned his big win will not speed up Brexit deal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Promises on early years education were vague, with a \u201c\u00a31bn childcare fund\u201d in England and no new funding commitments for children and young people\u2019s mental health. On post-16 education, the Conservatives had already promised \u00a3400m over the next parliament \u2013 nowhere near enough to arrest the fall in per-student funding, especially in sixth forms.</p> \n<p>With Michael Gove at the heart of government, a Johnson regime is unlikely to tinker much with school structures, although there may be legislative moves to convert all maintained schools into academies. Otherwise there are some creaking policies that need urgent repair: further eduction colleges, apprenticeships and early years provision are all likely to demand attention from Williamson or whoever succeeds him. And while vice-chancellors will be relieved that tuition fees remain, they will be anxious to know more about post-Brexit research funding. <strong>Richard Adams</strong></p> \n<h2>Law and order</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"393eae2f64e23fca51f689af61c374977747ca26\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/393eae2f64e23fca51f689af61c374977747ca26/0_0_5462_3619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaks during his visit at the police in West Yorkshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaks during his visit at the police in West Yorkshire.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Conservatives\u2019 hardline approach on crime and justice under Johnson became clear as soon as he took office: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/election-fact-check-will-there-really-be-20000-new-police-officers\">20,000 new police officers</a> on the streets was one of his first pledges. The recruitment is more of a restoration as the Conservative-led governments of the last nine years have cut the same number.</p> \n<p>But it set a tone for Johnson\u2019s outlook. This was cemented with plans to expand the use of stop and search powers, done by reducing the level of authorisation needed for officers to deploy a form of the tactic and lowering the degree of certainty required by the authorising officer that serious violence may occur. The government is also funding an increase in Tasers.</p> \n<p>Plans to increase sentences for some sexual and violent offenders were frequently promoted by Johnson and his team during the election campaign, particularly around the London Bridge terrorist attack, a move that drew criticism from the family of one of the victims.</p> \n<p>At the Tory party conference in September, the justice secretary announced that offenders guilty of violent and sexual crimes that carry a maximum sentence of life and who are sentenced to at least four years in prison will be required to serve two-thirds of the sentence in prison before being released on licence, as opposed to the midway point.</p> \n<p>During the campaign they pledged to give all child murderers a \u201cwhole life order\u201d, condemning them to die in jail without release. In reality this would apply to very few cases and was dismissed by critics as populist electioneering.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/rise-in-violent-not-due-to-police-cuts-alone-figures-show\">serious violent crime strategy</a> acknowledges that violent crime has a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d. There was very little mention in the Conservative manifesto about tackling these more complex issues behind crime. <strong>Jamie Grierson</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Media</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54562de6de469ce814976cfd2a3429cbc01b3c1b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54562de6de469ce814976cfd2a3429cbc01b3c1b/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson was interviewed by Andrew Neil during his Tory leadership campaign in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson was interviewed by Andrew Neil during his Tory leadership campaign in July.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>During the campaign the Conservatives thumbed their noses at the BBC by refusing to let the prime minister do an interview with Andrew Neil, raised questions over the future of the licence fee, and threatened the future of Channel 4.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s less clear is which bits were bellicose briefing from Conservative press aides keen to change an on-the-day narrative and which were real policies for the future of the media. Johnson\u2019s rumination that it is time to look at whether the licence fee charged on households owning a particular device is sustainable in the current environment \u2013 made in response to a question at a campaign event rather than as a pre-planned intervention \u2013 was telling.</p> \n<p>Abolition would be hard and would require legislation, since the BBC\u2019s royal charter guarantees the licence fee\u2019s existence until 2027. A bigger risk factor for the BBC is negotiations over the cost of the licence fee for the 2022-27 period.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson made a raft of promises and comments indicating future policy during the election campaign. Our specialist reporters take a look at what we can now expect from the government on key policy areas. Health Johnson said the NHS would be his government\u2019s top priority. He has made an array of pledges \u2013 on funding, staffing and new facilities \u2013 aimed at reviving a visibly ailing service that hospital bosses say is \u201con its knees\u201d. Johnson\u2019s voluble support for an institution \u201cthat represents the very best of our country\u201d means he will be closely scrutinised over the delivery of his promises, several of which may prove very challenging. Johnson has promised to increase the budget of the NHS in England by \u00a320.5bn in real terms (after inflation) by 2023-24. That is less than the equivalent \u00a326bn extra that Labour offered. While that will be the biggest uplift in cash terms the NHS has ever received, the annual 3.4% rises are smaller than the NHS\u2019s historical average and less than health thinktanks believe it needs, given demand for care is going up very rapidly. The Conservatives have committed to building 40 new hospitals in England by 2030. Only six of these \u2013 which will receive \u00a32.7bn and should be ready by 2025 \u2013 have been identified so far. Twenty-one other NHS trusts will share \u00a3100m seed money to help them draw up plans for the 34 other projects. Experts say the 40 will cost up to \u00a324bn, although the government\u2019s estimate is \u00a313bn. It is unclear whether the money will come from the NHS\u2019s capital budget or be over and above the sums Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have pledged. Lack of staff remains the NHS\u2019s number one problem. Johnson was scorned for pledging to recruit 50,000 extra nurses and then admitting that 18,500 of them would come from stopping existing staff quitting early. Restoring maintenance grants of up to \u00a38,000 a year for student nurses should improve recruitment, but nursing leaders doubt the 50,000 pledge will be met. There is similar scepticism about the aim of recruiting 6,000 more GPs, given numbers have actually fallen since a 2015 pledge to grow the family doctor workforce by 5,000. Without more GPs the promise of 50m extra appointments a year will prove illusory, even with more physiotherapists, pharmacists and other health professionals working in surgeries to take some of the pressure off family doctors. Waiting times for A&amp;E care, planned operations and cancer treatment have worsened so sharply in recent years that the Health Foundation thinktank is warning that \u201cthe safety net [of the NHS] \u2026 is at risk of breaking down\u201d. Delays are the worst since records began. The millions of people affected by longer and longer waits are likely to become Johnson\u2019s biggest NHS problem. He has no obvious plan to resolve this beyond more money, more staff and backing for the NHS long-term plan, which aims to keep people healthier. Denis Campbell Brexit Michael Gove has said a new Brexit deal will be concluded by the end of next year. High-level political negotiations will start in February, and the detail of getting Britain ready for Brexit is where the devil lies. Much work has been done on the new systems that must be in place for the worst possible outcome of talks in relation to the Dover-Calais crossing and other UK-EU trade issues. No work has been done on the Great Britain to Northern Ireland routes that must now be treated as a UK-EU border under the Johnson deal. HMRC has previously said it would take five years to get what was known as a maximum facilitation customs IT arrangement in place. If tariffs on goods exported from the UK into the EU apply after 2020, a new tariff rebate system has to be bolted on to cover goods that go from Great Britain to Northern Ireland only. This would apply, for instance, to all goods going from Tesco warehouses in the UK to supermarket shelves in Belfast, Derry or Armagh. Border inspection posts will have to be built from scratch for sanitary and phytosanitary checks on all animals and fresh food going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The EU has already said it would prefer them to be in ports such as Stranraer and Liverpool to prevent potential disease in animals, plants or timber pallets making its way on to the island of Ireland. The Northern Ireland office has had several meetings with business leaders on what checks will be necessary but these cannot be determined in detail until after Brexit on 31 January. Under the withdrawal agreement, specialist committees to determine this detail cannot be appointed until the withdrawal agreement is ratified. This means they could be up and running by February, leaving 11 months for preparation. But as HMRC has warned previously, IT systems take years, not months, to build. Lisa O\u2019Carroll Education The new government\u2019s policies on education in England are less oven-ready and more baked in, with the bulk of policies on schools, colleges and universities having been announced before the election campaign began. In terms of reforms, the signature policies are set in place, as they have been since David Cameron: converting schools into academies and using tuition fees and student loans to fund demand for higher education. While Theresa May wanted to revise the fees and loans system, Boris Johnson has shown little appetite to do so other than trimming the interest rates charged to students. The Conservatives\u2019 slim manifesto offers more money for schools, reversing the real-terms cuts since 2009. Johnson\u2019s intention is to raise per-pupil spending to at least \u00a34,000 in primaries and \u00a35,000 in secondaries, although many schools in deprived and urban areas are already higher. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, had announced plans to raise pay for newly qualified teachers to \u00a330,000, to shore up recruitment. Existing teachers, however, are unhappy at the Conservative election pledge to beef up Ofsted inspections. Promises on early years education were vague, with a \u201c\u00a31bn childcare fund\u201d in England and no new funding commitments for children and young people\u2019s mental health. On post-16 education, the Conservatives had already promised \u00a3400m over the next parliament \u2013 nowhere near enough to arrest the fall in per-student funding, especially in sixth forms. With Michael Gove at the heart of government, a Johnson regime is unlikely to tinker much with school structures, although there may be legislative moves to convert all maintained schools into academies. Otherwise there are some creaking policies that need urgent repair: further eduction colleges, apprenticeships and early years provision are all likely to demand attention from Williamson or whoever succeeds him. And while vice-chancellors will be relieved that tuition fees remain, they will be anxious to know more about post-Brexit research funding. Richard Adams Law and order The Conservatives\u2019 hardline approach on crime and justice under Johnson became clear as soon as he took office: 20,000 new police officers on the streets was one of his first pledges. The recruitment is more of a restoration as the Conservative-led governments of the last nine years have cut the same number. But it set a tone for Johnson\u2019s outlook. This was cemented with plans to expand the use of stop and search powers, done by reducing the level of authorisation needed for officers to deploy a form of the tactic and lowering the degree of certainty required by the authorising officer that serious violence may occur. The government is also funding an increase in Tasers. Plans to increase sentences for some sexual and violent offenders were frequently promoted by Johnson and his team during the election campaign, particularly around the London Bridge terrorist attack, a move that drew criticism from the family of one of the victims. At the Tory party conference in September, the justice secretary announced that offenders guilty of violent and sexual crimes that carry a maximum sentence of life and who are sentenced to at least four years in prison will be required to serve two-thirds of the sentence in prison before being released on licence, as opposed to the midway point. During the campaign they pledged to give all child murderers a \u201cwhole life order\u201d, condemning them to die in jail without release. In reality this would apply to very few cases and was dismissed by critics as populist electioneering. The government\u2019s own serious violent crime strategy acknowledges that violent crime has a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d. There was very little mention in the Conservative manifesto about tackling these more complex issues behind crime. Jamie Grierson Media During the campaign the Conservatives thumbed their noses at the BBC by refusing to let the prime minister do an interview with Andrew Neil, raised questions over the future of the licence fee, and threatened the future of Channel 4. What\u2019s less clear is which bits were bellicose briefing from Conservative press aides keen to change an on-the-day narrative and which were real policies for the future of the media. Johnson\u2019s rumination that it is time to look at whether the licence fee charged on households owning a particular device is sustainable in the current environment \u2013 made in response to a question at a campaign event rather than as a pre-planned intervention \u2013 was telling. Abolition would be hard and would require legislation, since the BBC\u2019s royal charter guarantees the licence fee\u2019s existence until 2027. A bigger risk factor for the BBC is negotiations over the cost of the licence fee for the 2022-27 period. This gives the corporation two years to make the case that the licence fee should keep rising, with the alternative being accepting cuts in the year of the organisation\u2019s 100th anniversary. Even more worrying for the public broadcaster are comments by the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, that the party is seriously looking at decriminalisation of failure to pay the TV licence, which could undermine the BBC\u2019s revenue collection process. Channel 4\u2019s future will be up for debate towards the end of the parliamentary session in 2024. Conservative aides already exasperated with the channel\u2019s output have been watching clips of the its overnight election coverage featuring an audience booing the exit poll. A new culture secretary will have to decide on how to regulate the internet to reduce online harms, including whether to found a new regulator to take on the task, although the Conservative manifesto was characteristically vague on detail. With Labour blaming rightwing newspapers for its defeat, the British media industry is facing a tough period with reduced public support at a time when many traditional outlets were already struggling. Jim Waterson Constitution Opaque pledges in the Conservative manifesto to overhaul \u201cthe relationship between the government, parliament and the courts\u201d have raised fears that the independence of the judiciary and the Human Rights Act could come under attack. One inevitable casualty will be the little-loved Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Only a page in the manifesto is dedicated to constitutional issues. While lack of detail may veil radical intentions, it could also disguise a lack of worked-through policies. The rapid turnover of justice secretaries and the distraction of Brexit have prevented passage of legislation even with cross-party support, such as the divorce, dissolution and separation bill introducing no-fault divorce and the domestic abuse bill, which bans cross-examination of victims by abusive ex-partners. Repeated promises to protect members of the armed forces against \u201cvexatious legal claims\u201d have run into disputes between the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry of Defence over the extent of immunity offered in historical cases. That constitutional revolution is not a day one priority is acknowledged by statements that \u201cafter Brexit\u201d and \u201cin our first year we will set up a constitution, democracy &amp; rights commission that will examine these issues in depth\u201d. Similarly, a commitment to update the Human Rights Act to ensure \u201ca proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government\u201d is vague. It is less explicit than May\u2019s promise to leave the European court of human rights, announced in 2016. There has, however, been a ferment in Conservative-inclined thinktanks suggesting, in the wake of successive government defeats in the supreme court, there could be political appointments of senior judges. Others such as Martin Howe QC have proposed replacing the supreme court with a \u201clower-key and less activist\u201d set of judges. Could a manifesto reference to \u201caccess to justice for ordinary people\u201d hint at one-nation conservatism? Lawyers are desperate for a crumbling justice system stripped of legal aid to be better funded: the Ministry of Justice has had a 40% budget cut since 2010, the worst in Whitehall. One Tory manifesto pledge, repeatedly made but never delivered, might, ironically, have defeated the 2016 Brexit referendum. Abolishing the 15-year limit on Britons abroad voting in parliamentary elections would enfranchise nearly a million pro-EU voters.

      "body": "<p>In the maelstrom of debate about Boris Johnson\u2019s victory, and amid the acrid \u201cself-reflection\u201d now facing Labour, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of some of the wider issues raised by the election campaign. One of the most important, perhaps, is the relationship between journalism, politics and truth.</p> <p>Cast your mind back to the days when the election still seemed to many, including pollsters, to be in the balance. Last Monday, in fact. The somewhat surreal day began with Johnson refusing to look at a photo of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr lying on the floor of the Leeds General Infirmary (LGI), captured by the Yorkshire Post, continued with leading journalists promoting a false story about Labour activists punching a Tory adviser, and ended with a concerted fake news campaign on social media to show that the photo was in fact fake news. At the heart of all this lay fundamental issues about political scrutiny, journalistic ethics and the creation of news.</p> <p>Politicians have always attempted to gain power while minimising the scrutiny they face. What was once a tactic has now become a culture. Elections are stage-managed as never before, and serious discussion of policies replaced by a careful choreography of soundbites, slogans and social media ads.</p> <p>Perhaps no single event (or non-event) better demonstrated politicians\u2019 contempt for scrutiny than <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-savage-andrew-neil-refuses-to-face-bbc-host-2019-12?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s refusal</a> to be questioned by Andrew Neil. Johnson\u2019s team clearly calculated that, Neil having eviscerated both Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn, it was less damaging to be seen as being frit by taking the political equivalent of the fifth amendment, than melting like an ice sculpture in the heat of a TV inquisition. And, given the election result, they have been proved right.</p> <p>Politicians are not obliged to be interviewed by anyone in particular. Nevertheless, hiding behind a political burqa, to borrow a Johnsonian image, is to turn voters into letterboxes into which to deposit carefully curated political messages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73bc675bccdfb95925e8153c428ea943227e68ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73bc675bccdfb95925e8153c428ea943227e68ae/0_189_4447_2668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to be grilled by Neil made not just Johnson but Neil, too, into a central character in the story.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to be grilled by Andrew Neil made not just Johnson but Neil, too, into a central character in the story.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem is not just that politicians try to shield themselves from scrutiny. It is also that journalists have become complicit in this process. The dependence of journalists on their relationship with party machines to gain access to interviews and gossip makes them vulnerable to being gamed. Political parties routinely feed journalists with half-truths or untruths, traceable only to anonymous \u201csources\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday, both the BBC political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, and her ITV equivalent, Robert Peston, were briefed by Tory sources that one of the health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s advisers had been punched by a Labour protester outside LGI. There was no such incident, but both tweeted it as if it were a fact. Only later, when a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1204110491242643457\" title=\"\">video came to light, did the truth emerge</a>.</p> <p>Ironically, even the desire to subject politicians to scrutiny can itself distort the picture, turning journalists themselves into the news. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/06/conservatives-dismiss-andrew-neil-demands-for-johnson-interview\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s refusal to be grilled by Neil</a> made Neil, too, a central character in the story. Neil\u2019s three-minute monologue to camera challenging the prime minister to appear on the show was pure theatre, and went viral. It may have been necessary in the context of Johnson\u2019s refusal to be interviewed, but it was also problematic, turning the spotlight on to Neil.</p> <p>Similarly, when ITV\u2019s Joe Pike confronted Johnson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joepike/status/1204018593656180736\" title=\"\">over the photo of the boy on a hospital floor</a>, it made for compelling viewing. But, again, it turned the interview itself into the news item, and the act itself of getting Johnson to look at a photo on a phone seemed designed as theatre. Social media has further distorted the relationship between journalism and politics. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can be invaluable tools through which to find information and break news. They can also help degrade the meaning of journalism. In the context of the 24-hour instant news culture, the desire to get a story out as quickly as possible leaves little time for traditional journalistic virtues such as checking details or verifying sources.</p> <p>Disinformation is not just about spreading news that\u2019s false. It\u2019s also about portraying real news as fake. On Tuesday, dozens of Twitter and Facebook accounts claimed to have a friend who was a nurse at LGI who had witnessed little Jack being placed on the floor by his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcowenjones/status/1204183081009262592\" title=\"\">mother to stage a photograph that might shame the Tories</a>. Not just the story, but the wording in all these accounts was identical, suggesting an organised disinformation campaign, though by whom is unclear. Nevertheless, mainstream journalists, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allisonpearson/status/1204139762950520834\" title=\"\">including the </a><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/allisonpearson/status/1204139762950520834\" title=\"\">Telegraph</a></em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/allisonpearson/status/1204139762950520834\" title=\"\"> columnist Allison Pearson</a>, accepted them as true, pushing them further into the outside world and providing them with an aura of authenticity.</p> <p>The problem revealed here is a culture simultaneously too sceptical and not sceptical enough. Too many journalists have become too credulous about stories from anonymous \u201csources\u201d. At the same time, people have become so cynical about journalism that any news can now potentially be seen as fake.

      "bodyText": "In the maelstrom of debate about Boris Johnson\u2019s victory, and amid the acrid \u201cself-reflection\u201d now facing Labour, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of some of the wider issues raised by the election campaign. One of the most important, perhaps, is the relationship between journalism, politics and truth. Cast your mind back to the days when the election still seemed to many, including pollsters, to be in the balance. Last Monday, in fact. The somewhat surreal day began with Johnson refusing to look at a photo of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr lying on the floor of the Leeds General Infirmary (LGI), captured by the Yorkshire Post, continued with leading journalists promoting a false story about Labour activists punching a Tory adviser, and ended with a concerted fake news campaign on social media to show that the photo was in fact fake news. At the heart of all this lay fundamental issues about political scrutiny, journalistic ethics and the creation of news. Politicians have always attempted to gain power while minimising the scrutiny they face. What was once a tactic has now become a culture. Elections are stage-managed as never before, and serious discussion of policies replaced by a careful choreography of soundbites, slogans and social media ads. Perhaps no single event (or non-event) better demonstrated politicians\u2019 contempt for scrutiny than Johnson\u2019s refusal to be questioned by Andrew Neil. Johnson\u2019s team clearly calculated that, Neil having eviscerated both Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn, it was less damaging to be seen as being frit by taking the political equivalent of the fifth amendment, than melting like an ice sculpture in the heat of a TV inquisition. And, given the election result, they have been proved right. Politicians are not obliged to be interviewed by anyone in particular. Nevertheless, hiding behind a political burqa, to borrow a Johnsonian image, is to turn voters into letterboxes into which to deposit carefully curated political messages. The problem is not just that politicians try to shield themselves from scrutiny. It is also that journalists have become complicit in this process. The dependence of journalists on their relationship with party machines to gain access to interviews and gossip makes them vulnerable to being gamed. Political parties routinely feed journalists with half-truths or untruths, traceable only to anonymous \u201csources\u201d. On Tuesday, both the BBC political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, and her ITV equivalent, Robert Peston, were briefed by Tory sources that one of the health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s advisers had been punched by a Labour protester outside LGI. There was no such incident, but both tweeted it as if it were a fact. Only later, when a video came to light, did the truth emerge. Ironically, even the desire to subject politicians to scrutiny can itself distort the picture, turning journalists themselves into the news. Johnson\u2019s refusal to be grilled by Neil made Neil, too, a central character in the story. Neil\u2019s three-minute monologue to camera challenging the prime minister to appear on the show was pure theatre, and went viral. It may have been necessary in the context of Johnson\u2019s refusal to be interviewed, but it was also problematic, turning the spotlight on to Neil. Similarly, when ITV\u2019s Joe Pike confronted Johnson over the photo of the boy on a hospital floor, it made for compelling viewing. But, again, it turned the interview itself into the news item, and the act itself of getting Johnson to look at a photo on a phone seemed designed as theatre. Social media has further distorted the relationship between journalism and politics. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can be invaluable tools through which to find information and break news. They can also help degrade the meaning of journalism. In the context of the 24-hour instant news culture, the desire to get a story out as quickly as possible leaves little time for traditional journalistic virtues such as checking details or verifying sources. Disinformation is not just about spreading news that\u2019s false. It\u2019s also about portraying real news as fake. On Tuesday, dozens of Twitter and Facebook accounts claimed to have a friend who was a nurse at LGI who had witnessed little Jack being placed on the floor by his mother to stage a photograph that might shame the Tories. Not just the story, but the wording in all these accounts was identical, suggesting an organised disinformation campaign, though by whom is unclear. Nevertheless, mainstream journalists, including the Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson, accepted them as true, pushing them further into the outside world and providing them with an aura of authenticity. The problem revealed here is a culture simultaneously too sceptical and not sceptical enough. Too many journalists have become too credulous about stories from anonymous \u201csources\u201d. At the same time, people have become so cynical about journalism that any news can now potentially be seen as fake. It\u2019s the cynicism that can turn any truth into a lie that is truly corrosive. The obsession with social media has led many to neglect another part of the media ecosystem that is also of vital importance \u2013 local newspapers. In the age of global communication, it is easy to condescend to local papers as quaint and old-fashioned. Yet they play a vital role in sustaining both journalism and democracy. It was the Yorkshire Evening Post that broke the story about Jack Williment-Barr and subsequently played a major role in responding to the attempts to dismiss it as fake news. Some of the best investigative journalism these days emerges from local papers \u2013 for instance, in the work of the Manchester Evening News\u2019 Jennifer Williams. Regional papers bring scrutiny to social issues often ignored by national journalists. They also provide a voice to people and areas often unheard, and play a vital role in meshing together our social fabric. But they are also under threat. Between 2005 and 2018, 245 local titles were lost. The result is both a journalistic void and a democratic deficit. \u201cI know it\u2019s fashionable,\u201d reads Kuenssberg\u2019s Twitter bio, \u201cbut even in 2019 there is nothing big or clever about shooting the messenger.\u201d There is much truth to this \u2013 blaming the media for political failures and frustrations is both fashionable and often misplaced.

      "body": "<p>This is the most decisive election result for over a decade. Boris Johnson asked the country for a mandate to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, and last Thursday voters delivered him an overwhelming majority. The result settles once and for all the vexed question of when and whether we will leave the European Union: Britain\u2019s formal exit will happen at the end of next month. But the conclusiveness of the result should not obscure the massive uncertainty that hangs over our future: over what type of Brexit we choose once we have left, a decision that will have huge implications for our economic wellbeing and the integrity of the union.</p> <p>This is the largest Conservative majority the country has seen since 1987, delivered on the biggest share of the vote won by any party since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first victory in 1979. For Labour, this defeat is its fourth in a row, producing the smallest cohort of MPs the party has seen since 1935. Britain\u2019s electoral map has been upended as the Conservatives have swept to victory with a raft of seats in the north and the Midlands that were not so long ago seen as impregnable Labour strongholds.</p> <p>This new political reality leaves challenges for Britain\u2019s political leaders. A newly triumphantJohnson leads a party stunned by the scale of its victory, a party that will have to confront the challenge of delivering Brexit without inflicting enormous damage on its fragile new electoral coalition. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\" title=\"\">Nicola Sturgeon</a> has been returned with a fresh mandate to champion Scottish independence but no obvious route to securing an independence referendum. Labour and the Liberal Democrats face months of agonising introspection and internal conflict as they embark on the process of choosing new leaders adequate to the task of rebuilding their shattered parties, and finding ways to reconnect with the voters who abandoned them.</p> <h2>Only the start of the EU conversation<br></h2> <p>From his podium outside Downing Street last Friday, Johnson struck a tone of unity and inclusion, in sharp contrast to the tenor of his divisive election campaign. He pledged to lead a \u201cone nation\u201d Conservative government that will bring together the nations of the United Kingdom, and reflect the sentiments of both those who voted to Leave and to Remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum.</p> <p>It is hard to overstate how dramatic a shift from the Tory approach to governing witnessed over the past nine years this would require. It would demand an entirely different strategy for achieving a new relationship with the EU from the one Johnson has pursued to date; an undoing of the painful austerity of the past decade that has most sharply hit low-income families and less affluent areas; and an unravelling of the toxic legacy of Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment.</p> <p>Leaving the EU on 31 January 2020 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement will not see \u201cBrexit done\u201d in any but the most superficial sense. Our exit will be only the start of the conversation about what our final relationship with the EU will look like. Do we want a closely aligned relationship, which would minimise the economic damage and protect the Good Friday agreement? Or do we want to diverge sharply from European regulations and standards in order to align more closely with the low-regulation economy of the United States and end free movement, the price of which would be sharpening economic inequalities, a grave risk to the union and a watering-down of worker and consumer protections?</p> <h2>New Tory voters, new Tory MPs<br></h2> <p>Like May before him, Johnson has always prioritised his own political interest over that of the country. The absence of a Conservative majority since 2017 has given undue influence to the hard Eurosceptic flank of the party, and both May and Johnson have been willing to dance to its tune as the price of its support. Johnson has been willing to pursue the hardest of Brexits, which would risk the integrity of the union and impose huge economic pain, as the price of power.</p> <p>His resounding election victory must shift this calculus. Not only does it reduce the influence of his party\u2019s most fanatical Eurosceptics; it has brought in a fresh wave of MPs who represent areas of the country whose economies would be wrecked by a hard Brexit. This provides him with the political imperative to tack towards a soft Brexit that minimises its economic impact, protects the union and recognises that over half of voters did not give his version of Brexit their seal of approval last week.</p> <p>The same imperative operates when it comes to reversing the past decade of spending cuts. Johnson\u2019s manifesto offered far too little on this, including nothing about the slashing of tax credits that has left many working parents thousands of pounds a year worse off. By 2023, more than half of families with children will have been shifted on to universal credit \u2013 which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/14/universal-credit-hardship-tories\" title=\"\">far less generous</a> than the system it replaces \u2013 and many of these will be new Conservative voters, living in constituencies with new Conservative MPs. Johnson ignores this at his peril.</p> <p>But while his majority could push him towards a softened approach, his election campaign risks an altogether different political legacy. Johnson will no doubt extract a dangerous lesson from his win: that putting out untrue claims about your opponents, blaming them for events that happen on your watch, and avoiding scrutiny at all costs is an effective political strategy.</p> <p>At least he can no longer rely on the toxic, populist narrative of \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d. He controls the Commons. If in five years, Britain is languishing in the wake of a catastrophic Brexit, the responsibility will lie with him, and him alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea18adcdcd1e5f4bf67ac3f235946cd87d1cc862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea18adcdcd1e5f4bf67ac3f235946cd87d1cc862/0_49_4134_2481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn leaves his house in London after Labour\u2019s election defeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn leaves his house in London after Labour\u2019s election defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Labour\u2019s dilemmas<br></h2> <p>Corbyn\u2019s momentous defeat leaves Labour with different dilemmas. The party has lost more than 2.5 million voters in just two years. But there were still more voters who did not endorse Johnson than those who did; many of whom will fear the consequences of another five years of Conservative government. Labour owes it to them to undertake a full and honest reflection of why it lost, rather than descending into sectarian blame games.</p> <p>Supporters of Corbyn have tried to write off Labour\u2019s losses as a consequence of Brexit above all else. On this account, the referendum created a lose-lose situation by opening up a new cleavage that divided Labour\u2019s electoral coalition. In eventually swinging behind support for a referendum on any deal, Labour sacrificed its heartland support.</p> <p>Those who have spent the past two years arguing for a referendum \u2013 this newspaper included \u2013 must take stock and reflect why the case never resonated with enough MPs and voters for it to happen. But Labour\u2019s lack of leadership on Brexit \u2013 its abject refusal to adopt a clear position early on \u2013 undoubtedly did the argument for a fresh referendum significant damage.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s problems go beyond Brexit. Its vote share declined most in Leave-supporting areas, but <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50770798\" title=\"\">also dropped</a> in areas of the country that voted to Remain. Polling suggests that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpiniumResearch/status/1205510937995812864\" title=\"\">the most important factor</a> in voters deserting the party for the Conservatives was not Brexit, but Corbyn\u2019s leadership, reinforcing reports from Labour MPs throughout the campaign. And Brexit is a symptom of Labour\u2019s problems in its heartlands, not the cause. Under our electoral system, Labour can only win decent majorities by building a coalition of socially liberal and socially conservative voters from every corner of the UK. The decline in working-class support for Labour has been long-term and structural.</p> <h2>Corbyn must accept the voters\u2019 verdict<br></h2> <p>While we have always recognised that Corbyn energised a new generation of members and activists, it has been clear that he was not the leader to address this long-term structural decline. There have been plenty of warning signals, including the no confidence motion backed by over 80% of the parliamentary party in 2016. Dire personal ratings added to the picture. Still, Corbyn \u2013 hampered by an evident deficit in political skills and strategic vision, encumbered instead by a worn-out and irrelevant set of dogmas \u2013 persisted in the belief that he was right, and his critics wrong. The dreadful price is that Labour looks further away than ever from delivering for the communities most in need of a Labour government.</p> <p>Now Corbyn must accept the voters\u2019 verdict: they did not see in him a prime minister; they did not see in his manifesto a credible agenda for change. He cannot lead the Labour party through the painful reflection it must now undertake; he must resign with immediate effect, paving the way for a caretaker leader.</p> <p>The danger is that the forthcoming leadership contest will quickly become dominated by factional infighting rather than an honest debate about what Labour needs. The party\u2019s members have an awesome responsibility ahead: to select a new leader who can excite younger voters, while rebuilding bridges with those working-class voters who deserted it, and who will not shy from confronting head-on the antisemitism crisis that has engulfed the party in recent years.</p> <h2>Questions remain<br></h2> <p>This election may have shaken up Britain\u2019s electoral landscape, but none of the existential questions facing our country have gone away. How do we balance the trade-offs involved in Brexit? What is the UK\u2019s future as a union of four nations? How do we make it a greener and kinder country in which to live, in which older people do not go without basic care and children get an equal chance in life regardless of who their parents are?</p> <p>Labour has, for now, forfeited its chance to lead a government to address these challenges, and the country\u2019s immediate future yet again lies in the hands of a Conservative prime minister. For the fourth time in a decade, the party must embark on the process of reflection and rebuilding. Britain cannot afford for it to make the wrong choice again.</p>",

Under our electoral system, Labour can only win decent majorities by building a coalition of socially liberal and socially conservative voters from every corner of the UK. The decline in working-class support for Labour has been long-term and structural. Corbyn must accept the voters\u2019 verdict While we have always recognised that Corbyn energised a new generation of members and activists, it has been clear that he was not the leader to address this long-term structural decline. There have been plenty of warning signals, including the no confidence motion backed by over 80% of the parliamentary party in 2016. Dire personal ratings added to the picture. Still, Corbyn \u2013 hampered by an evident deficit in political skills and strategic vision, encumbered instead by a worn-out and irrelevant set of dogmas \u2013 persisted in the belief that he was right, and his critics wrong. The dreadful price is that Labour looks further away than ever from delivering for the communities most in need of a Labour government. Now Corbyn must accept the voters\u2019 verdict: they did not see in him a prime minister; they did not see in his manifesto a credible agenda for change. He cannot lead the Labour party through the painful reflection it must now undertake; he must resign with immediate effect, paving the way for a caretaker leader. The danger is that the forthcoming leadership contest will quickly become dominated by factional infighting rather than an honest debate about what Labour needs. The party\u2019s members have an awesome responsibility ahead: to select a new leader who can excite younger voters, while rebuilding bridges with those working-class voters who deserted it, and who will not shy from confronting head-on the antisemitism crisis that has engulfed the party in recent years. Questions remain This election may have shaken up Britain\u2019s electoral landscape, but none of the existential questions facing our country have gone away. How do we balance the trade-offs involved in Brexit? What is the UK\u2019s future as a union of four nations? How do we make it a greener and kinder country in which to live, in which older people do not go without basic care and children get an equal chance in life regardless of who their parents are? Labour has, for now, forfeited its chance to lead a government to address these challenges, and the country\u2019s immediate future yet again lies in the hands of a Conservative prime minister. For the fourth time in a decade, the party must embark on the process of reflection and rebuilding. Britain cannot afford for it to make the wrong choice again.",
