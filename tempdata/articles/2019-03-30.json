      "body": "<p>Britain is the fifth richest country in the world. Yet figures out last week show that more than 4 million children \u2013 almost one in three \u2013 are living below the relative poverty line. That\u2019s one in three children growing up in families that face a daily struggle to make ends meet, where parents sometimes have to go without to ensure their children can eat and where the cost of school uniforms can <a href=\"https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/news-and-blogs/press-releases/school-uniform-costs-force-families-into-debt\" title=\"\">push parents into debt</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s nothing short of a national disgrace. Yet these figures merited hardly a mention in last week\u2019s parliamentary debates. It\u2019s become a cliche to observe that Brexit is sucking the political oxygen out of all other issues. And it\u2019s a cliche the prime minister would like us to buy into. If only we could get Brexit done with, we could get on to other things, or so she would have us believe. \u201cYou, the public, have had enough,\u201d she declared in a disastrously judged <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/theresa-mays-brexit-statement-in-full-prime-minister-blames-mps-for-failing-to-make-a-choice-on-eu-a4097126.html\" title=\"\">televised address</a> two weeks ago that sought to set her up as the champion of the people against a parliament trying to thwart democracy. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children\u2019s schools, our National Health Service, knife crime.\u201d</p> <p>What brazen cheek. It\u2019s not just that Theresa May is wrong to blame parliament for withholding support from her blank-cheque withdrawal agreement that would hand the power over our future relationship with the EU to a future Conservative prime minister, whose identity is yet to be determined. It\u2019s that the 10 years of spending cuts and the consequent shrinking of the state that have fuelled rising child poverty are not the consequence of forces beyond our control, forces furthermore that we have been unable to confront because of Brexit. Instead, the factors that have created this reservoir of poverty are the result of longstanding political choices, first made by David Cameron and George Osborne, then later enthusiastically embraced by May and Philip Hammond.</p> <p>It is a flavour of what could yet be to come. Make no mistake \u2013 a smaller state is a core ideological tenet of the Eurosceptic right flank of the Tory party to which May is now in hock, which stands a good chance of capturing the party, and therefore the nation, in any forthcoming Conservative leadership battle. The country didn\u2019t vote to put them in power. But if parliament rolls over and lets the prime minister cede control to these Tory ideologues, child poverty will get much worse before it gets better. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/02/child-poverty-britain-set-to-soar-to-new-record-ifs\" title=\"\">Institute for Fiscal Studies has forecast</a> that almost four in 10 children will be living in relative poverty by 2022 as a result of planned government policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/10/the-observer-view-on-the-callous-cuts-to-school-funding\">The Observer view on the callous cuts to school funding | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Increasing levels of child poverty are the direct result of the strategy pursued by Tory-led governments since 2010. Child poverty rates fell between 1997 and 2010 as a result of Labour government policies to support more parents into work and help low-income working families with tax credits. Since 2010, much of that work has been undone. Conservative ministers claim work continues to be the best route out of poverty. Yet 70% of children living in poverty are in working families; too much work is so low paid that it does not allow parents to provide for their children. And since 2010, Conservative chancellors have slashed the benefits and income top-ups that support working families. We are supposed to believe that this was the inevitably tough, but regrettable, consequence of the financial crisis. But even as they were cutting away this support, they delivered tax cuts worth billions a year, disproportionately<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/28/the-observer-view-on-the-budget-and-the-decade-of-austerity\" title=\"\"> benefiting more affluent families</a>.</p> <p>Austerity hasn\u2019t only had deleterious effects on family incomes. All around us, the state is crumbling. <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/comms/R150.pdf\" title=\"\">Schools are facing the biggest cut to per-pupil funding</a> for three decades; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/10/the-observer-view-on-the-callous-cuts-to-school-funding\" title=\"\">some schools are having to finish early</a> on a Friday to cope with these budget cuts. Today, we report how in one school in south London, teachers have taken voluntary pay cuts worth thousands of pounds to safeguard two teaching assistant positions. And spending on vital children\u2019s services has <a href=\"https://www.ncb.org.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/Turning%20the%20tide%20report_final.pdf\" title=\"\">fallen six times as fast</a> in the least affluent areas of the country compared with the richest.</p> <p>Rising child poverty; cuts to school funding; cutting back services for children and families in the poorest areas: these are not actions that can be wiped away in a year or two. They are policies that will blight a whole generation of children\u2019s lives for decades to come in greater inequality in employment outcomes, health outcomes and wellbeing.</p> <p>Everywhere you look, the warning lights of a nation in decline are blinking furiously. New data shows that improvements in life expectancy have come to a grinding halt and that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47721167\" title=\"\">life expectancy for women</a> in the poorest areas has significantly fallen in a matter of a few years. This cannot be separated from the longer waiting lists and cancelled operations that have resulted from a stretched NHS and the weak approach the government has taken to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/observer-view-tory-environment-and-obesity-plans\" title=\"\">reducing obesity</a> for fear of upsetting the food industry. Knife crime is on the rise, reflecting cuts to policing and the youth services that keep young people safely off the streets.</p> <p>So don\u2019t fall for the prime minister\u2019s woeful entreaties that if only we could get Brexit done and dusted, the government could focus on fixing what\u2019s going wrong. The type of Brexit that the right of the Tory party is set on delivering will bring more austerity: more child poverty, bigger inequalities in life expectancies, more knife crime. Yes, the fight over Brexit is making it harder for parliament to hold the government to account for the damage it is wreaking to the country. But it is a fight that has to be won to prevent things from getting even worse.</p>",

If only we could get Brexit done with, we could get on to other things, or so she would have us believe. \u201cYou, the public, have had enough,\u201d she declared in a disastrously judged televised address two weeks ago that sought to set her up as the champion of the people against a parliament trying to thwart democracy. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children\u2019s schools, our National Health Service, knife crime.\u201d What brazen cheek. It\u2019s not just that Theresa May is wrong to blame parliament for withholding support from her blank-cheque withdrawal agreement that would hand the power over our future relationship with the EU to a future Conservative prime minister, whose identity is yet to be determined. It\u2019s that the 10 years of spending cuts and the consequent shrinking of the state that have fuelled rising child poverty are not the consequence of forces beyond our control, forces furthermore that we have been unable to confront because of Brexit. Instead, the factors that have created this reservoir of poverty are the result of longstanding political choices, first made by David Cameron and George Osborne, then later enthusiastically embraced by May and Philip Hammond. It is a flavour of what could yet be to come. Make no mistake \u2013 a smaller state is a core ideological tenet of the Eurosceptic right flank of the Tory party to which May is now in hock, which stands a good chance of capturing the party, and therefore the nation, in any forthcoming Conservative leadership battle. The country didn\u2019t vote to put them in power. But if parliament rolls over and lets the prime minister cede control to these Tory ideologues, child poverty will get much worse before it gets better. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has forecast that almost four in 10 children will be living in relative poverty by 2022 as a result of planned government policies. Increasing levels of child poverty are the direct result of the strategy pursued by Tory-led governments since 2010. Child poverty rates fell between 1997 and 2010 as a result of Labour government policies to support more parents into work and help low-income working families with tax credits. Since 2010, much of that work has been undone. Conservative ministers claim work continues to be the best route out of poverty. Yet 70% of children living in poverty are in working families; too much work is so low paid that it does not allow parents to provide for their children. And since 2010, Conservative chancellors have slashed the benefits and income top-ups that support working families. We are supposed to believe that this was the inevitably tough, but regrettable, consequence of the financial crisis. But even as they were cutting away this support, they delivered tax cuts worth billions a year, disproportionately benefiting more affluent families. Austerity hasn\u2019t only had deleterious effects on family incomes. All around us, the state is crumbling. Schools are facing the biggest cut to per-pupil funding for three decades; some schools are having to finish early on a Friday to cope with these budget cuts. Today, we report how in one school in south London, teachers have taken voluntary pay cuts worth thousands of pounds to safeguard two teaching assistant positions. And spending on vital children\u2019s services has fallen six times as fast in the least affluent areas of the country compared with the richest. Rising child poverty; cuts to school funding; cutting back services for children and families in the poorest areas: these are not actions that can be wiped away in a year or two. They are policies that will blight a whole generation of children\u2019s lives for decades to come in greater inequality in employment outcomes, health outcomes and wellbeing. Everywhere you look, the warning lights of a nation in decline are blinking furiously. New data shows that improvements in life expectancy have come to a grinding halt and that life expectancy for women in the poorest areas has significantly fallen in a matter of a few years. This cannot be separated from the longer waiting lists and cancelled operations that have resulted from a stretched NHS and the weak approach the government has taken to reducing obesity for fear of upsetting the food industry. Knife crime is on the rise, reflecting cuts to policing and the youth services that keep young people safely off the streets. So don\u2019t fall for the prime minister\u2019s woeful entreaties that if only we could get Brexit done and dusted, the government could focus on fixing what\u2019s going wrong. The type of Brexit that the right of the Tory party is set on delivering will bring more austerity: more child poverty, bigger inequalities in life expectancies, more knife crime. Yes, the fight over Brexit is making it harder for parliament to hold the government to account for the damage it is wreaking to the country. But it is a fight that has to be won to prevent things from getting even worse.",

Ending the impasse over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/09/1846-corn-laws-abolished\" title=\"\">Corn Laws</a>, dealing with Irish independence, legislating the extension of the vote from 1832 onwards, and more recently dealing with the undemocratic power of the House of Lords all required the same innovative leadership and the courage to break with the past that we need today.</p> <p>But from next week we face a challenge comparable to, or greater than, all of these: how we deal with both a stalemate on policy, and a complete breakdown of trust between parliament and the public. And there can be no outcome acceptable to the British people that does not find new and effective ways of engaging with them.</p> <p>But as one door closes, another is opening. Last week the European council showed an openness to what we might call \u2013 if the word \u201cmeaningful\u201d had not been so devalued \u2013 a meaningful extension: a longer negotiating period, not as a delaying tactic or for a return to vicious squabbling, but to reunite a divided country. And we should do what should have been done three years ago: establish region-by-region public hearings to allow straight talking and clear thinking about the concerns that brought about Brexit in the first place. A year\u2019s extension would allow us to pursue a British version of Ireland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/citizens-assembly-ireland-abortion-referendum\" title=\"\">successful experience in participatory democracy when they held citizens\u2019 assemblies</a>, to find common ground on deeply divisive issues in advance of a referendum.</p> <p>There were many concerns raised by the British public in the 2016 EU referendum, such as the state of our manufacturing and our industrial towns, and a feeling that our politicians had let us down and had lost the plot in our post-imperial journey. But when it came to the specifics of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe, the issues that dominated were those of \u201ctaking back control of our borders\u201d, and \u201ctaking back control of our laws\u201d. These issues have been little discussed over the past three years as parliament has been engrossed in the minutiae of Brexit, and possible solutions to them need to be scrutinised in nationwide consultations in advance of any future referendum.</p> <p>Options for more \u201ccontrol of our laws\u201d could include parliament passing a UK law that any decision of the European court that offends our national and constitutional identity, and is thus in violation of article 4 (2) of the treaty of Lisbon, is unconstitutional.

      "bodyText": "After a week that ended in an atmosphere of chaos, confusion, acrimony, hostility and mistrust, MPs are once again trying to construct a Brexit majority for something \u2013 or anything. Having lived for years now away from the Westminster bubble, I am clear that even if parliament struggles to an 11th-hour compromise on Monday, there will be little buy-in from the public. And even if for a moment there are sighs of relief, the country will still be as divided as ever. Opinion poll after opinion poll has rejected not just Theresa May\u2019s deal and the no-deal option, but the Canada, Norway, Switzerland and Efta options, the last three of which would leave Britain as a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker. And while MPs deserve credit for trying, there is unlikely to be a majority in the country for a deal cobbled together over a weekend on the basis of MPs\u2019 third or fourth choices that could decide the next 100 years of our history. There are some precedents from the last two centuries to guide us when there is both a standoff between government and parliament, and a deadlock within parliament itself. Ending the impasse over the Corn Laws, dealing with Irish independence, legislating the extension of the vote from 1832 onwards, and more recently dealing with the undemocratic power of the House of Lords all required the same innovative leadership and the courage to break with the past that we need today. But from next week we face a challenge comparable to, or greater than, all of these: how we deal with both a stalemate on policy, and a complete breakdown of trust between parliament and the public. And there can be no outcome acceptable to the British people that does not find new and effective ways of engaging with them. But as one door closes, another is opening. Last week the European council showed an openness to what we might call \u2013 if the word \u201cmeaningful\u201d had not been so devalued \u2013 a meaningful extension: a longer negotiating period, not as a delaying tactic or for a return to vicious squabbling, but to reunite a divided country. And we should do what should have been done three years ago: establish region-by-region public hearings to allow straight talking and clear thinking about the concerns that brought about Brexit in the first place. A year\u2019s extension would allow us to pursue a British version of Ireland\u2019s successful experience in participatory democracy when they held citizens\u2019 assemblies, to find common ground on deeply divisive issues in advance of a referendum. There were many concerns raised by the British public in the 2016 EU referendum, such as the state of our manufacturing and our industrial towns, and a feeling that our politicians had let us down and had lost the plot in our post-imperial journey. But when it came to the specifics of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe, the issues that dominated were those of \u201ctaking back control of our borders\u201d, and \u201ctaking back control of our laws\u201d. These issues have been little discussed over the past three years as parliament has been engrossed in the minutiae of Brexit, and possible solutions to them need to be scrutinised in nationwide consultations in advance of any future referendum. Options for more \u201ccontrol of our laws\u201d could include parliament passing a UK law that any decision of the European court that offends our national and constitutional identity, and is thus in violation of article 4 (2) of the treaty of Lisbon, is unconstitutional. Options for more \u201ccontrol of our borders\u201d could include registering migrants as they arrive, as Germany does, and imposing a time limit on any stay without gaining employment, as in Belgium. And outlawing, as France has, social dumping: the practice of paying Latvian workers only Latvian wages while working in France. All these changes are achievable within the EU\u2019s freedom of movement rules. After Monday a year-long extension to conduct public hearings \u2013 once at the bottom of the list of options \u2013 may not just be the best alternative to no deal, but the only alternative. I have reason to believe that the problems raised by the European election timetable can be negotiated away by indirect elections \u2013 selecting a contingent of MPs from our own parliament \u2013 and by not participating in the election of the presidents of the European commission and parliament. If we do not now promote the open and informed public debate that\u2019s required, future historians will conclude that our country turned its back not only on our long history of internationalism and engagement, but also on our once globally renowned traditions of pragmatism, rationality and evolutionary progress. However, by striking out on a new path, we can still save our country from decades of recriminations and decline at home, and diminution in the eyes of the world. \u2022 Gordon Brown was prime minister from 2007 to 2010",
