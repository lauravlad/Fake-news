But this would be extraordinary risky. Even a PM without a majority has considerable power at his or her disposal (particularly over spending and patronage), and it is quite possible that Corbyn could negotiate a Brexit outcome more acceptable to the public than Johnson\u2019s.</p> \n  <p>Another option would be to resign as prime minister on the basis that another Tory willing to request an article 50 extension (Dominic Raab? Michael Gove?) might take over. That way Johnson could keep his promise about not requesting an article 50 extension himself. But presumably he would only do this if he were confident that the replacement PM would stand aside for him again at some point in the future. That might also be a very risky assumption.

The court was considering two cases. Here is an excerpt.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The first case was commenced in the outer house of the court of session for orders obliging the prime minister to comply with his duties under the Benn Act (a) to send a letter asking for an extension and (b) not to frustrate the Act by e.g. asking other member states to veto the UK\u2019s request for an extension.</p> \n   <p>On Monday the outer house <a href=\"https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/docs/default-source/cos-general-docs/pdf-docs-for-opinions/2019csoh77.pdf?sfvrsn=0\">said</a> that Boris Johnson: \u201cis subject to the obligations of the [Benn] Act; (b) in the event of neither of the conditions in section 1(1) or (2) being satisfied, the first respondent will comply with section 1(4) no later than 19 October 2019; and (c) that he will not frustrate the purpose of the [Benn] Act or the purpose of any of its provisions. In other words, there can be no doubt that the first respondent now accepts that he must comply with the requirements of the [Benn] Act and has affirmed that he intends to do so.\u201d</p> \n   <p>If Boris Johnson adheres to these statements the entire purpose of the litigation \u2013 that a man elected from 160,000 members of the Conservative party should comply with a law enacted by 46 million elected \u2013 will be satisfied.</p> \n   <p>The second case was commenced in the inner house asking the court, if the prime minister (a) fails to send (as required by section 1 of the Benn Act) the letter asking for an extension or (b) fails to agree an extension offered by the EU (as required by section 3 of the Benn Act), to complete those acts itself.</p> \n   <p>And earlier this morning the inner house held the cases over to 21 October \u2013 the first working day after the prime minister\u2019s obligation to send the Benn Act letter expires. So if the facts do require it, it can make appropriate orders against the prime minister.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9db3378f083d8b3b9d88b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-09T10:16:40.962Z\">11.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scottish court postpones decision on whether to intervene to force Boris Johnson to comply with Benn Act</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Press Association has just snapped this.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Judges at Scotland\u2019s highest civil court will not rule on a legal bid aimed at forcing the prime minister to send a letter requesting a Brexit extension if no withdrawal deal is reached by October 19 until after that date. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9db2638f083d8b3b9d88a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-09T10:14:53.832Z\">11.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The proportion of live births in England and Wales to women born outside the UK has fallen for the first time in nearly three decades, the Press Association reports.

Here are five for starters.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) MPs would have to vote for the Saturday session to go ahead in the first place</strong>. The government has been wary of scheduling timetable votes because, unless they have opposition agreement, they tend to lose (which is why the Commons sat during the Tory conference), and it is possible that the Speaker could allow any vote to be hijacked by a move allowing backbenchers control of the Commons timetable.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) If Johnson wants to force MPs to choose between delaying Brexit and a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, he is likely to find that they take the same decision they did when the passed the Benn Act, which effectively ruled out the no-deal option. </strong>That passed its second reading by a majority of 29.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Any other attempt to get MPs to make a forced choice could fail - because parliamentary procedure does not work like that.</strong> According to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/09/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-plans-emergency-saturday-sitting-of-parliament-after-eu-summit-live-news?page=with:block-5d9d8d228f084ab8417353fa#block-5d9d8d228f084ab8417353fa\">9.14am), </a>Johnson is interested in the idea of forcing MPs to make a choice - perhaps between a no-deal Brexit and revoking article 50 (ie, cancelling Brexit). But parliament does not have a system for allowing MPs to vote either/or on a proposition. MPs just vote on motions, which they either pass or reject. In practice, MPs would almost certainly vote against no deal, and against revoking article 50.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Forcing MPs to make a choice could lead to them uniting behind an alternative PM. </strong>Johnson does not have a majority in the Commons, but he has not been replaced because opposition MPs and rebel Tories (who now sit as independents) cannot agree on who could lead an interim government in his place. This seems unlikely to change, although under pressure anything is possible. It is very, very hard to imagine Labour backing anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn as leader of an interim government, but Corbyn himself has not explicitly ruled this out.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) Johnson insists he will not ask for a Brexit delay, even though the Benn Act would require him to, but he also claims he would obey the law.</strong> He has failed to explain how he would resolve this contradiction. His advisers seem to think that the authority of the referendum somehow overrides the authority of parliament, but by summoning parliament to meet on Saturday 19 October, possibly only a few days ahead of a supreme court hearing about the Benn Act, it might make it harder for Johnson to argue that he can legitimately bypass what parliament wants.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9d9be38f081108db9c4db4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-09T08:39:18.971Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>According to<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/business-faq-page/\"> the House of Commons website,</a> the Commons has only sat on Saturdays four times since 1939.</p> \n  <p>Three of those sittings were prompted by way or military conflict: 2 September 1939 (the day before Britain declared war on Germany); 3 November 1956 (the Suez crisis); and 3 April 1982 (the invasion of the Falklands). </p> \n  <p>The other took place on 30 July 1949, when the last sitting before the summer recess was on a Saturday.

MPs are heading for a Brexit showdown as they will be called to sit for a special parliamentary session on Saturday 19 October \u2013 less than two weeks before Britain\u2019s scheduled departure from the EU. Michel Barnier has called on Boris Johnson to rein in the Downing Street aides responsible for attacking the German chancellor this week as the EU doubled down on its rejection of the prime minister\u2019s proposals. Pro-remain campaigners are preparing to launch contempt proceedings against Boris Johnson if he attempts to renege on promises to seek an extension to Brexit. Boris Johnson could be summoned by the London assembly after failing to provide details of his contact with a US businesswoman and explain how any potential conflict of interest was addressed. Sir John Sawers, a former head of MI6, has said Brexit negotiations have got to \u201can extraordinarily damaging state\u201d because unnamed Downing Street officials have been briefing that the UK might withdraw security cooperation with the EU. Two million people have asked to stay in the UK after Brexit under the government\u2019s EU settlement scheme, latest figures show. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is my colleague Severin Carrell\u2019s story on the Scottish court of session postponing a decision on whether to intervene to force Boris Johnson to comply with the Benn act requiring him to request a Brexit delay in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The full text of the judgment is here. These are from the lawyer Jolyon Maugham, one of the people who took the issue to court. And this is from the SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who took these cases to court alongside Maugham and the businessman Dale Vince. Cherry said: This decision is a victory for the petitioners and everyone who wants the Tory government to obey the law, and call for an extension, so we can avoid a devastating no-deal Brexit. As a result of this vital court action, the Tory government has been forced to concede the prime minister will comply with the law, and promise to send a letter requesting a Brexit extension. Crucially, he has also had to admit that he will not frustrate the purpose of the Benn act. The court\u2019s decision is a clear signal it will keep a watch on Boris Johnson\u2019s actions \u2013 and is holding a sword of Damocles over him in case he breaks his promise. The Tory prime minister must obey the law and call for an extension, or face the consequences \u2013 including the ability for Scotland\u2019s supreme court to force a request for an extension. A YouGov analysis of 300 surveys shows firm evidence that Britain has turned against Brexit since 2016, according to a report by Nicholas Cecil in the Evening Standard. Cecil says: One of the most striking findings is that 204 out of 226 polls since July 2017 have shown remain ahead, with just seven for leave, and 15 ties. So far this year, just one poll in the series has put Leave ahead, compared to 74 for staying in the EU. The Scottish government has produced an interactive Brexit vulnerabilities map, showing which parts of Scotland would lose out most from Brexit. There is a news release about it here, and the map is here. Rural areas and islands are most at risk, it says. Earlier I referred to today\u2019s Sun story quoting unnamed No 10 sources (them again) saying that Boris Johnson thought there was a reason why he would be able to stay PM, even if he lost a confidence vote in the Commons and MPs wanted someone else to head a government. (See 12.38pm.) If you are interested in the rights and wrongs of this argument, there is a good Twitter thread on this from Philippe Lagass\u00e9, a professor at a Canadian university and a specialist in Westminster politics. It starts here. And here is his conclusion. If you want to know more about the origins of the Lascelles principles (named after Sir Alan Lascelles, private secretary to George VI, who set them out in a letter to the Times using the pseudonym Senex, this thread, by Catherine Haddon from the Institute for Government, is worth reading. Boris Johnson has promised centrist Conservative MPs he will not go into an election arguing for a no-deal Brexit and would never make a pact with Nigel Farage. Damian Green, the leader of the One Nation group of 80 Tory MPs, told the Guardian that Johnson \u201clooked [him] in the eye\u201d as he pledged that he party will not shift to endorsing a no-deal Brexit as the Conservatives\u2019 central policy. Green said he believed Johnson\u2019s reassurances, after he and Gillian Keegan, James Brokenshire and Victoria Prentis all met the prime minister in Downing Street to deliver the message that large numbers of Tory MPs would find a no-deal policy \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Green said: We went in to say that no deal as the prime aim of government policy would be unacceptable in a manifesto and we were reassured that wasn\u2019t the prime minister\u2019s aim, that he still wants to get a deal now and still thinks that would be the best outcome. He has no intention of putting a no-deal policy in a manifesto. This arose from a meeting of the one nation caucus earlier in the week. It was the principle point and we also wanted to be assured again that the Conservative party wouldn\u2019t do a deal with the Brexit party. We looked each other in the eye. I accept and believe the reassurances. We accept that no deal has to be a possibility and the one nation caucus has by and large always been supportive of the government\u2019s policy. What we want is for that to continue. Centrist Tory MPs are worried about what would happen if the party had to fight an election before Brexit has happened, after being forced into a three-month extension by the Benn act. Publicly, Johnson will not concede this is a possibility because he insists Brexit will happen on 31 October but most MPs think this is the most likely scenario \u2013 that his government will have to submit to the delay, possibly following a court order, and then he will immediately challenge Labour to an election to be held in late November. In the debate in the European parliament the Brexit party MEP Belinda de Lucy strongly criticised David Sassoli, the European parliament\u2019s president, for discussing Brexit with John Bercow, the Commons Speaker. (See 3.53pm.) She said that this showed Sassoli was directly intervening in the UK\u2019s domestic politics and that he was trying to stop Brexit. \u201cIt is immoral - shame on you,\u201d she said. Guy Verfhofstadt, the liberal MEP and former Belgian PM who chairs the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, told De Lucy that it was ridiculous for her accuse MEPs of being undemocratic when her own party was not represented in the UK parliament. He also criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan, saying: I will be less diplomatic than Michel Barnier. I think that the proposal that Boris Johnson has put forward was not serious at all. Not serious at all because it was in fact a virtual proposal. It was not a real proposal. It gives a veto to the DUP in a number of issues. It is putting customs facilities, not on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, but in all the other parts of the island of Ireland that we don\u2019t know yet. And finally the proposal is to downgrade the political declaration on the future relationship by undercutting, by making a Singapore-at-the-sea, at the North Sea, like the [Brexit party], by in fact destroying the ecological social and labour standards. Here are some of the key quotes from the European parliament hearing. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, criticised the UK government for engaging in a \u201cblame game\u201d. He said Brexit was the choice of the British people. He went on: Although we are respecting that choice. As it stands, we will remain in discussion with the United Kingdom on the terms of its departure. And, personally, I don\u2019t exclude a deal. We are, Michel [Barnier] and myself, working on a deal. And we are not accepting this blame game, which started in London. Juncker said the British should not forget the need for the European parliament to agree any Brexit deal. I would like to repeat, to the attention of our British friends, that there is not only a parliament in Westminster which has to agree, there is a parliament here. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said an agreement was not currently possible. He said: To put things very frankly, though, and to try and be objective, this particular point, we are not really in a position where we are able to find an agreement. David Sassoli, president of the European parliament, said that any Brexit extension should be to allow the British public to express their views - either through an election, or a referendum. He also revealed that he had discussed Brexit with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. (See 2.45pm.) Tytti Tuppurainen, the Finnish Europe minister, said that a no-deal Brexit was a \u201cdangerously realistic\u201d scenario. (See 2.51pm.) This is from my colleague Rowena Mason. Obviously, this does not mean Boris Johnson has given up trying to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. It means that, if Brexit does get extended against his wishes, and he has to fight an election, he says he will not campaign on a Brexit party-style no-deal platform, as an unnamed No 10 insider (almost universally assumed to be Dominic Cummings) told the Spectator earlier this week. Michel Barnier has now finished. Here is some comment on what he had to say. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming From Mail Online\u2019s James Tapsfield From RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly Barnier says there are other issues dividing the two sides, including what to put in the political declaration. He says there is a risk of having just a very basic free trade agreement. That might involve tax dumping and social regulation dumping (ie, the UK trying to undercut the EU.) He says the EU wants a fair and level playing field. He says, when Brexit happens, it will be long term. He says it is creating serious and specific problems. We need operational, legally-binding solutions \u2013 today, not tomorrow. He says the EU will remain calm, vigilant and constructive. And he says it will be respectful of the UK and its leaders. He says he will be available 24/7 in the coming days to try to reach an agreement. He will respect his mandate, he says. He says it might be \u201cvery difficult\u201d. But, he goes on: If there is goodwill on both sides, I think an agreement is still possible. Barnier turns to his third point - the consent mechanism. He says the EU wants a more important role for the Northern Irish institutions. He says the UK plan would involve a unilateral decision being taken by the Northern Irish authorities. That means they could unilaterally decide not to introduce these arrangements. Barnier turns to the second issue. There must be operational solutions, he says. He says the UK plan does not give the same security as the backstop, because it relies on ideas being worked out during the transition. The UK proposes having a joint committee to find solutions during the transition. But what happens if it can\u2019t? The UK or the EU would then have to impose unilateral checks. But what would happen if the UK did not enforce any checks? He says the UK plan has led to three concerns. First, the border issue. Boris Johnson has rejected the backstop, a safety net agreed with Theresa May, he says. He says the UK and the EU agree on regulatory alignment for goods in Northern Ireland. But there is a dispute about customs. The EU wanted a backstop to avoid border checks. But the UK is asking the EU to accept a system that has not been properly tested, relying on exemptions and derogations and technology that has not been properly tested. He says the EU needs the integrity of the single market and customs union, and proper checks. There must be credible controls, he says. The single market must be credible to consumers and companies. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is speaking now. He says the UK have a competent and professional negotiating team. But he says the two sides are not in a position to reach an agreement. Time is pressing, he says. Juncker turns to Brexit. He says it was the choice of the UK. He says he is not ruling out a deal. And he does not accept this blame game, \u201cwhich started in London\u201d. He says he would like to repeat, for the sake of the British, that the European parliament would have to approve a Brexit deal, as well as the UK parliament. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, is speaking now. He starts with non-Brexit issues. He is currently talking about EU enlargement (the opposite of Brexit). Tuppurainen says the UK crashing out of the EU is a \u201cdangerously realistic\u201d scenario, she says. She says EU leaders will have to take stock at the summit. Tytti Tuppurainen, the Finnish Europe minister, is speaking now. Finland has the rotating presidency of the EU. She is covering the non-Brexit issues coming up at the summit. And she says the UK plans do not yet provide a basis for an agreement. But the EU will continue to work with UK to get an agreement, she says. Sassoli says MEPs do not want to see no deal. And MEPs want to uphold the rights of citizens. He says he spoke to John Bercow, the Speaker, today. He says any request for an extension should allow the British people to give their views \u2013 either in an election or a referendum. He says he and Bercow agreed on the importance of parliament. David Sassoli, the president of the European parliament, starts by telling MEPs about his talks with Boris Johnson yesterday. He says \u201cnot much progress\u201d has been made since the European parliament last debated this. He says the parliament\u2019s approach is simple; it thinks an orderly exit is the best outcome. But the parliament \u201cwill not accept an agreement at any cost\u201d. It will not accept anything that threatens the Good Friday agreement and the peace process, and the integrity of the single market. He says he told Johnson that the UK plans were not seen by MEPs as \u201ca basis that would allow us to reach an agreement\u201d. MEPs wanted \u201coperable\u201d ideas, he says. After some preliminary business, the European parliament is now starting to talk about next week\u2019s EU summit. David Sassoli, the president of the European parliament, is opening the session now. The European parliament\u2019s plenary session is about to start. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, are there. They will be updating MEPs on Brexit. There is a live feed here. Here are two stories about splits in the Conservative party around today that are worth flagging up. Sebastian Payne in the Financial Times (paywall) says at least 50 Conservative MPs would revolt against a general election manifesto that pledged to pursue a no-deal Brexit. Scores of Tory MPs oppose the idea and some are considering running on a softer individual Brexit platform or even standing aside as a Conservative candidate. One minister predicted that \u201cat least 50 colleagues could not back no-deal, including several in the cabinet\u201d. Another said: \u201cSo much depends on the language but for me there has to be at least a nod to getting a deal.\u201d Those MPs who would find a manifesto containing a purely no-deal Brexit policy problematic to support include culture secretary Nicky Morgan, justice secretary Robert Buckland and Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith. Damian Green, leader of the One Nation caucus of approximately 60 moderate Tory MPs, is due to lead a delegation to meet Boris Johnson on Wednesday. They are expected to tell the prime mister they cannot support a manifesto based on pursuing a no-deal Brexit. This reaction was prompted by the anonymous No 10 briefing to the Spectator on Monday night saying the Tories would fight the next election on a no-deal platform. Alex Wickham at BuzzFeed says a rift has opened up at the top of Boris Johnson\u2019s government between advisers loyal to the prime minister\u2019s controversial chief aide Dominic Cummings and other senior Johnson allies. The key dividing line is between the Vote Leave grouping which sees leaving the EU as the end goal and is willing to achieve it by any means necessary, and a group of advisers led by [Edward] Lister who see Johnson\u2019s administration as a long-term project beyond Brexit, multiple government sources told BuzzFeed News. The Cummings faction \u2013 which crucially retains the support of the prime minister and forms his inner circle \u2013 is determined to secure an election and produce a hardline pitch to leave voters which seeks to nullify Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party and blame the EU for the breakdown in negotiations, if it cannot agree a deal with Brussels or keep the PM\u2019s promise to deliver Brexit by 31 October. The Vote Leavers hope that an uncompromising Brexit pitch would deliver a majority and that Johnson could then take the UK out of the EU without a deal, or offer Brussels new terms less attractive than his current proposal. A Tory election campaign against the Brexit party would have to harden its position on any future agreement with the EU, offering a reduced Brexit bill and rejecting European court of justice involvement overseeing citizens\u2019 rights, as well as no compromise on the backstop, a government official said. Jeremy Corbyn has said the opposition might try to legislate again to ensure that Boris Johnson complies with the Benn act requiring him to request a Brexit extension in the event of no deal. Responding to the news that Johnson intends to hold a sitting of parliament on Saturday 19 October, Corbyn said: The prime minister has an opportunity on the 19th to announce that he has obeyed the law, signed the letter, and sent it off to Brussels to ask for the extension which will give us time to work out a sensible relationship with Europe. The idea that the prime minister will break the law yet again is something that needs to be borne in mind here. We will do everything we can in parliament, including legislating if necessary, to ensure that parliament makes that application to obey the EU No 2 Act [ie, the Benn act], which is the one that prevents us going into a no-deal crash-out on 31 October. Corbyn also said that in the event of Boris Johnson losing a confidence vote, he should be the person invited to form a government. He said: A caretaker government would be one appointed on the basis that the government has collapsed and the leader of the opposition is invited to form an administration. When this government collapses I will accept that invitation and form an administration solely for the purposes of preventing a crash-out. There is no process other than the leader of the opposition being invited to form that government and that\u2019s what we will follow. Corbyn was speaking to the media on a visit to a wind turbine plant in Southampton, where he was promoting Labour\u2019s plans to create 70,000 offshore windfarm jobs. And this is what Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM), told the Irish parliament about the anonymous briefing from Number 10 criticising him. He said: To be honest, I don\u2019t want to give much response to anonymous briefings of that nature. I don\u2019t think much of an anonymous briefing whether they come from Downing Street or if they come from my own ranks, quite frankly. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, has said that his party would not accept the proposal floated in the Times today (see 11.41am) for a change to the consent mechanism applying to the new version of the Northern Ireland backstop. Under the government\u2019s plans these arrangements would only come into force if the Northern Ireland assembly voted in favour, which in practice would give the DUP a veto. Under an alternative plan reportedly being considered by the EU, the arrangements would apply unless both factions in the assembly \u2013 unionists and nationalists \u2013 voted to end them. Wilson said this proposal was not surprising, but that it had already been rejected by the UK government. Parliament has been clear that such proposals would never be approved. It is not a serious proposal and should not be treated as such. It is a non-runner. Whilst the United Kingdom government has put forward sensible and realistic proposals, it is disappointing that the European Union has retreated to its previous failed plans. This proposal not only rewrites but actually turns the Belfast agreement\u2019s consent mechanism on its head. The United Kingdom must leave the European Union as one country and any decision to enter into regulatory alignment must have the consent of both unionists and nationalists. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM) has told the Irish parliament that the British government\u2019s Brexit stance is causing \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d. He explained: Part of the difficulty at the moment is the position of the UK government, that Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union and must be part of the UK customs union no matter what the people of Northern Ireland think. That\u2019s their position at the moment and that\u2019s one that is a great difficulty for us because the position of the British government is that the UK must leave the European Union and Northern Ireland must come out of the customs union, whether they like it or not. That creates huge difficulties for us because we want there to be a deal that respects the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland, and indeed the people in this republic too. Here is the Press Association story about the hustings held at Westminster earlier today for the candidates who want to replace John Bercow as Speaker. John Bercow has been described as a \u201cplayground bully\u201d by an MP running to replace him as Commons speaker. Shailesh Vara said he believe Bercow has \u201ctarnished the role of Speaker with his biasness\u201d and said he insults and demeans his colleagues. The nine MPs who have put themselves forward to replace Bercow as Speaker took part in a hustings event in Westminster. Vara was joined by Sir Henry Bellingham, Chris Bryant, Harriet Harman, Meg Hillier, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Dame Eleanor Laing, Sir Edward Leigh and Rosie Winterton. Candidates were asked about Bercow and impartiality, and Vara said: \u201cNo, Speaker Bercow has not been impartial. \u201cAnd frankly speaking, I think he\u2019s tarnished the role of the Speaker with his biasness.\u201d He added: \u201cI would say one other thing that recently we\u2019ve had a lot of debate about the standards of MPs in the Commons. \u201cAnd given that Speaker Bercow has at times behaved like a verbal playground bully in the way that he treats his colleagues, he insults them, demeans them. \u201cI hope that he loses all authority to lecture to MPs as to how they should behave when his own behaviour is in question. \u201cSo I think that the Speaker should always be courteous and polite, authoritative, yes, but not demeaning to his colleagues.\u201d Bellingham said he thought Bercow had been a \u201cfantastic\u201d Speaker, but added: \u201cThe problem with John Bercow is that many of the excellent work he\u2019s done has been impaired by, A, having favourites, I think, in some ways. \u201cAnd, B, too often grandstanding remarks that frankly are a waste of space and time.\u201d Bryant, who wants to be \u201can umpire, not a player\u201d, said of the Speaker role: \u201cI think having an impartial Speaker is absolutely essential to the good functioning of our democracy.\u201d Harman said the role was to be the \u201cchampion of parliament in our parliamentary democracy\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd that\u2019s not them being neutral or impartial, it\u2019s being absolutely a champion of parliament.\u201d Leigh said Bercow is \u201cperceived by a large part of the nation not to be impartial\u201d and said the next Speaker needs to be \u201cmore in the mould\u201d of former speaker Betty Boothroyd. The election of the next Commons speaker will take place on 4 November, after Bercow, who has held the office since 2009, takes the chair for the final time on 31 October. Britain would still have to pay into the EU budget until the end of next year even if it leaves without a deal on 31 October, G\u00fcnther Oettinger, the EU budget commissioner, has said. Speaking at a news conference in Brussels he said the UK was fully signed up to the EU budget for 2020 - its final year of EU contributions. Even if the UK refused to pay up immediately, the EU would recover its money \u201cat a later stage\u201d, he said. He explained: In the 2020 draft budget, the UK is a full partner with all rights and obligations in terms of monies paid and monies received and that is how we understand the law. If the British are not prepared to pay, we are sure we will get the money at a later stage but not immediately. Boris Johnson has often said that if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal, it would no longer have to pay the \u00a339bn owed under the withdrawal agreement. But even though the exact formula used to decide the UK\u2019s legal obligations in that agreement would no longer be agreed between the two parties, British government officials admit that the UK would still owe a very considerable sum to the EU. There has been some interesting speculation in the comments about what might happen at the emergency Saturday sitting of parliament planned for 19 October. Here are two of the more intriguing questions, with my replies. Could Boris Johnson use the sitting to hold a confidence vote? Yes, he could. But even if he won a confidence vote, and argued that that vote effectively overturned the Benn Act (and it is almost impossible to imagine him winning a vote on that basis), the Benn Act would still be law. Until it gets repealed or amended, it still stands. If he lost the confidence vote, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act MPs would have 14 days to pass a confidence motion in another administration. If that did not happen, there would be an election - with polling day after 31 October. But the Benn Act would still stand - and so there would be no guarantee of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. And Johnson would also be taking the risk that parliament would choose an alternative PM during that 14-day period. The Sun today is running a story saying some in No 10 think that, even in these circumstances, Johnson could remain in office. But experts are extremely sceptical. These are from Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor. Could Johnson resign as PM? This is a possibility. People do not normally give up the office of PM voluntarily, but precedent has long since ceased to a reliable guide to what might happen in the Brexit saga. One option would be to resign as a government, and to invite the Queen to make Jeremy Corbyn, or someone else prime minister, on the assumption that Johnson could then get back into power after an election fought on a \u201cBrexit betrayal\u201d platform. But this would be extraordinary risky. Even a PM without a majority has considerable power at his or her disposal (particularly over spending and patronage), and it is quite possible that Corbyn could negotiate a Brexit outcome more acceptable to the public than Johnson\u2019s. Another option would be to resign as prime minister on the basis that another Tory willing to request an article 50 extension (Dominic Raab? Michael Gove?) might take over. That way Johnson could keep his promise about not requesting an article 50 extension himself. But presumably he would only do this if he were confident that the replacement PM would stand aside for him again at some point in the future. That might also be a very risky assumption. Once people get appointed PM, they tend to want to stay. The People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, says an emergency Saturday sitting on 19 October would give supporters even more of a reason to attend its march in London on the same day. It is put out this statement from the Labour MP Jess Phillips, who backs the campaign. She said: The 19th of October was already set to be a historic day, with hundreds of thousands of people coming to London to demand that the final decision on Brexit is not made by Boris Johnson but by all of us. With the news that Boris Johnson is planning an emergency session of parliament on the same day, there could not be a more important moment for everyone who cares about our country and our future to march, and to insist that we are all given the final say. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, will be giving MEPs an update on the Brexit talks this afternoon alongside Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission. Speaking to Sky News this morning, Barnier said he thought a deal would be \u201cvery difficult, but possible\u201d. He confirmed that the technical talks were carrying on and that he would be having a working lunch with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, tomorrow. In what seemed a dig at London, and the unattributable briefings hostile to Angela Merkel that were coming out of Downing Street yesterday, he said: The EU will remain calm, vigilant, respectful - respectful - and constructive. Asked if a deal was still possible, he replied: I think the deal is possible and very difficult, but possible. The leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland has said that reports that the EU would replace a Stormont veto on future Brexit arrangements was a non-starter. Michelle O\u2019Neill told Sky News that the devolved assembly should not have any role in the final deal whether the voting system allowed for a veto or not. \u201cLet\u2019s just rule that out. It\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d she said. She added there was \u201cno situation\u201d in which the local assembly can have the final say. Such decisions on constitutional matters had to be taken by governments, not regional assemblies she said. Under Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal Stormont would have the final say on this next year and every four years thereafter. But because of a particular voting mechanism in Stormont designed to ensure no one community can vote for something that would be harmful to another, there was concern that this could hand a de factor veto to the Democratic Unionist party. According to the Times (paywall), the EU is now suggesting eliminating concerns by creating a new requirement that there would have to be a \u201cdouble majority\u201d in Stormont - ie both Sinn Fein and the DUP would have to agree to future arrangements. Sinn Fein\u2019s objection is that such a role for Stormont would plunge Northern Ireland into a unwelcome constitutional crisis every four years. One source said: The institutions are already fragile and to add this into the mix is unwelcome and will destabilise the institutions further and threaten the Good Friday Agreement. They are just not plausible. Other parties including the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist party made the same point to Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith in face-to-face meetings on Friday. UUP leader Robin Swann said on Friday: Northern Ireland would be locked into continual political debates about Brexit and alignment with the rest of the UK or EU. They would set the theme of every Assembly and Westminster election. It plunges Northern Ireland into a referendum in the Assembly Chamber every four years with high stakes consequences for our people. It will keep our businesses and agri-food sector in a perpetual cycle of uncertainty. An emergency sitting of parliament on Saturday 19 October would coincide with what is expected to be a large People\u2019s Vote rally in London, Anna Soubry, the leader of the Independent Group for Change MPs, points out. In a blog for the Good Law Project\u2019s website, the lawyer Jolyon Maugham has published a clear summary of what has happened in the Scottish court of session hearing about the Benn Act. The court was considering two cases. Here is an excerpt. The first case was commenced in the outer house of the court of session for orders obliging the prime minister to comply with his duties under the Benn Act (a) to send a letter asking for an extension and (b) not to frustrate the Act by e.g. asking other member states to veto the UK\u2019s request for an extension. On Monday the outer house said that Boris Johnson: \u201cis subject to the obligations of the [Benn] Act; (b) in the event of neither of the conditions in section 1(1) or (2) being satisfied, the first respondent will comply with section 1(4) no later than 19 October 2019; and (c) that he will not frustrate the purpose of the [Benn] Act or the purpose of any of its provisions. In other words, there can be no doubt that the first respondent now accepts that he must comply with the requirements of the [Benn] Act and has affirmed that he intends to do so.\u201d If Boris Johnson adheres to these statements the entire purpose of the litigation \u2013 that a man elected from 160,000 members of the Conservative party should comply with a law enacted by 46 million elected \u2013 will be satisfied. The second case was commenced in the inner house asking the court, if the prime minister (a) fails to send (as required by section 1 of the Benn Act) the letter asking for an extension or (b) fails to agree an extension offered by the EU (as required by section 3 of the Benn Act), to complete those acts itself. And earlier this morning the inner house held the cases over to 21 October \u2013 the first working day after the prime minister\u2019s obligation to send the Benn Act letter expires. So if the facts do require it, it can make appropriate orders against the prime minister. The Press Association has just snapped this. Judges at Scotland\u2019s highest civil court will not rule on a legal bid aimed at forcing the prime minister to send a letter requesting a Brexit extension if no withdrawal deal is reached by October 19 until after that date. The proportion of live births in England and Wales to women born outside the UK has fallen for the first time in nearly three decades, the Press Association reports. Some 28.2% of births in 2018 were to women not born in the UK, down slightly on 28.4% in 2017. It is the first year-on-year decrease since 1990, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In total, just over a third (33.8%) of babies born in England and Wales in 2018 had at least one parent who was born outside the UK, the Press Association reports. This was also a small decrease on the previous year. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will be in Brussels tomorrow for a meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Downing Street has announced. It is being described as more of a stocktaking exercise than as a sign that progress is being made. Two million people have asked to stay in the UK after Brexit under the government\u2019s EU settlement scheme, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. Here full story is here. And here is the Home Office report (pdf) with the figures. Thank you to all of those who responded to my question about the 1949 Saturday sitting. I have updated the post at 9.39am to include some of them. To get the update to appear, you may need to refresh the page. If you want to know what Boris Johnson\u2019s message to parliament would be on Saturday 19 October, in the event of the UK and the EU failing to agree a Brexit deal at the summit ending the day before, this probably sums it up quite well. But there do seem to be quite a few problems with the notion that an emergency Saturday sitting of parliament on 19 October could give Johnson a means of resolving this crisis. Here are five for starters. 1) MPs would have to vote for the Saturday session to go ahead in the first place. The government has been wary of scheduling timetable votes because, unless they have opposition agreement, they tend to lose (which is why the Commons sat during the Tory conference), and it is possible that the Speaker could allow any vote to be hijacked by a move allowing backbenchers control of the Commons timetable. 2) If Johnson wants to force MPs to choose between delaying Brexit and a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, he is likely to find that they take the same decision they did when the passed the Benn Act, which effectively ruled out the no-deal option. That passed its second reading by a majority of 29. 3) Any other attempt to get MPs to make a forced choice could fail - because parliamentary procedure does not work like that. According to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg (see 9.14am), Johnson is interested in the idea of forcing MPs to make a choice - perhaps between a no-deal Brexit and revoking article 50 (ie, cancelling Brexit). But parliament does not have a system for allowing MPs to vote either/or on a proposition. MPs just vote on motions, which they either pass or reject. In practice, MPs would almost certainly vote against no deal, and against revoking article 50. 4) Forcing MPs to make a choice could lead to them uniting behind an alternative PM. Johnson does not have a majority in the Commons, but he has not been replaced because opposition MPs and rebel Tories (who now sit as independents) cannot agree on who could lead an interim government in his place. This seems unlikely to change, although under pressure anything is possible. It is very, very hard to imagine Labour backing anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn as leader of an interim government, but Corbyn himself has not explicitly ruled this out. 5) Johnson insists he will not ask for a Brexit delay, even though the Benn Act would require him to, but he also claims he would obey the law. He has failed to explain how he would resolve this contradiction. His advisers seem to think that the authority of the referendum somehow overrides the authority of parliament, but by summoning parliament to meet on Saturday 19 October, possibly only a few days ahead of a supreme court hearing about the Benn Act, it might make it harder for Johnson to argue that he can legitimately bypass what parliament wants. According to the House of Commons website, the Commons has only sat on Saturdays four times since 1939. Three of those sittings were prompted by way or military conflict: 2 September 1939 (the day before Britain declared war on Germany); 3 November 1956 (the Suez crisis); and 3 April 1982 (the invasion of the Falklands). The other took place on 30 July 1949, when the last sitting before the summer recess was on a Saturday. (Anyone know why?) UPDATE: Thank you to all those of you who responded to my question about the 1949 sitting. You can read the Hansard of the day here. And here are some of the replies. These are from Chris White, a former Tory special adviser in the chief whip\u2019s office and the leader of the Commons\u2019 office, on the plan for a Saturday sitting of parliament on 19 October. This week has been seen as the effective deadline for a Brexit deal because, in practice, for an agreement to be signed, the framework would have to be in place by the weekend or early next week ahead of the EU summit starting on Thursday 17 October. The crucial decisions at these summits tend to get taken over dinner in the evening, with talks sometimes going on into the early hours. The summit is due to end on Friday. And this morning the BBC is reporting that Boris Johnson is now considering holding an emergency sitting of parliament on Saturday 19 October to allow MPs to decide the next step forward. On the Today programme Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC\u2019s political editor, said this sitting could be used to allow MPs to approve a deal reached at the summit, in the very unlikely event that the UK and the EU do come to an agreement. In the more probable event of there being no deal, Johnson would use the sitting to reveal how he would try to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, despite the Benn Act, Kuenssberg said. She also said he would use the session to try to force parliament to take a decision, possibly making MPs to choose between no deal and an extension, or no deal and revoking article 50. Downing Street are confirming that this is a plan, although it would be subject to the usual conditions, ie MPs would have to vote for the sitting on the Saturday to go ahead in the first place. There seems to be at least one very obvious flaw in this proposal; parliament has already expressed a view on no deal versus delaying Brexit. It would prefer to delay Brexit, which is why it passed the Benn Act. It is hard to see what Johnson could do to reverse this vote, although doubtless some ingenious ideas are being kicked around in Dominic Cummings office. More on this shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Home Office publishes EU settlement scheme figures. 10am: Candidates to replace John Bercow as Commons Speaker take part in a press gallery hustings. The candidates are; Sir Henry Bellingham, Chris Bryant, Harriet Harman, Meg Hillier, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Dame Eleanor Laing, Sir Edward Leigh, Shailesh Vara and Rosie Winterton. 11am: The Scottish court of session is due to deliver its judgment in the appeal against the ruling saying there was no need to issue an order compelling Boris Johnson to comply with the Benn Act. 1.35pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, speaks at at NHS Providers conference. 2pm: The European parliament hears an update from the European commission and council ahead of next week\u2019s EU summit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Pro-remain campaigners are preparing to launch contempt proceedings against Boris Johnson if he attempts to renege on promises to seek an extension to Brexit. Jolyon Maugham QC has sought legal advice on starting court proceedings for contempt next week in the Scottish courts, after senior judges in Edinburgh delayed a decision on ordering the prime minister to comply with the Benn act. Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, has already cleared time for an emergency hearing in the court of session at noon on Monday 21 October, where he could issue court orders forcing Johnson to send a letter to the EU asking for an extension to article 50 until 31 January. The UK government\u2019s lawyers promised the court Johnson would honour the requirements of the European Union (withdrawal) (No 2) act by sending the letter if he fails to secure support in the House of Commons for Brexit by Saturday 19 October. The government also promised neither the prime minister nor any other minister or official would try to frustrate the Benn act by sidestepping it or undermining its provisions, despite Johnson\u2019s repeated pledge the UK would leave the EU on 31 October come what may. But Maugham, who took the court action against Johnson along with Dale Vince, the millionaire owner of the Ecotricity green energy company, and Joanna Cherry QC, a Scottish National party MP, said he believed the prime minister was still trying to do this. He confirmed he had asked a leading Scottish QC to prepare a civil action for contempt against Johnson, which would be lodged with the courts next week if there were fresh evidence the prime minister planned to obstruct moves towards an extension of article 50. \u201cIt would be a terrible mistake for the prime minister to imagine such a gross contempt would go unpunished,\u201d Maugham said after the ruling on Wednesday. \u201cThis is serious. This isn\u2019t some trivial administrative breach. This is a deliberate defiance of the will of parliament and the will of the court. If he is in breach of the law, there will be very serious consequences for him personally.\u201d Maugham, Vince and Cherry included a proposal to the court last week that Johnson could be jailed or fined for breaching the act. That was not formally proposed in the court hearing last Friday before Lord Pentland, but remains part of their legal submissions. It became clear on Wednesday that Johnson\u2019s hopes of securing a last-minute deal with the EU were doomed after the collapse of talks with the German government and disclosure from the Irish government that there was no prospect of a deal before 31 October. Johnson has asked for a rare Saturday sitting of the Commons on 19 October for emergency debates and votes. In a highly unusual but significant ruling, Carloway, sitting with Lord Drummond Young and Lord Brodie, said the court needed to wait to see what happened next week before deciding whether it had to enforce the Benn act. \u201cThe political debate requires to be played out in the appropriate forum,\u201d the judges ruled. \u201cThe court may only interfere in that debate if there is demonstrable unlawfulness which it requires to address and to correct. At present, there has been no such unlawfulness.\u201d The three judges agreed with Pentland, who ruled on Monday that there was no proof Johnson was actively taking steps to undermine the Benn act and the government was entitled to have political arguments about its Brexit strategies. Carloway said the situation was very fluid and if Johnson did try to thwart or sidestep the act, this would become clearer after midnight on 19 October. If he breaks his promises to the court, it could issue an interdict, or injunction, ordering Johnson to send the extension request, or it could do so, using unique powers open to Scottish judges known as nobile officium (noble office). That empowers a court to take action on a legal matter where the responsible person fails to do so, or in order to remedy a deficiency. It would be unprecedented but in that situation, the court would write, sign and send the letter specified in the legislation to Brussels and the other 27 EU member states. The judges also hinted strongly in their ruling that they could find Johnson in contempt of court, without a specific application by Dale, Maugham and Cherry, if the prime minister failed to honour the promises government lawyers had made to the court. The government had refused to give the court sworn undertakings, a legally binding pledge that Johnson would do as he had promised, but Carloway implied the \u201cdetailed and specific averments\u201d made by its lawyers were enough. Therefore, coercive orders, such as interdicts or nobile officium rulings, were not needed at this stage. Cherry said Johnson and his aides had to understand the significance of the court suspending judgment.

No one can accept a solution that gave Northern Ireland\u2019s politicians a veto on border arrangements. More surprising is the failure of the rebel alliance of MPs to agree a way forward.

Tom Cannon Manchester \u2022 In Wednesday\u2019s Morning Briefing you suggest that Boris Johnson will \u201ctrigger\u201d a general election. Perhaps this should be \u201cattempt to trigger\u201d or even \u201cbeg the opposition for an election\u201d as we do have the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. I suggest the other parties leave Johnson to stew by having an opposition of national unity, abstaining in the vote on the Queen\u2019s speech (which no doubt will have some provocative proposals) and thus effectively giving the opposition control over a decidedly minority government\u2019s agenda. The opposition parties will then have the power to trigger an election at a time of their choosing \u2013 for example, during the chaos of a Tory hard Brexit.
