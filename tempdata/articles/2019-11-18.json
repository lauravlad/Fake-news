Given that she was speaking only hours before Boris Johnson announced that he was abandoning a proposed further cut in corporation tax, her comment could be seen as an implicit criticism of the policy her leader was about to announce. She told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve reduced corporation tax from 28% to 19%, making it the lowest in the G20, is we\u2019ve seen an increase in the amount of tax taken by the exchequer.</p> </blockquote> <p>This afternoon the <strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong>, the tax and spending thinktank, has published <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/election/2019/article/cancelling-further-cut-to-corporation-tax-rate-leaves-revenue-the-same-as-before-the-2008-crisis\">a short briefing note</a> on the Johnson announcement. It says that, while Leadsom may be correct in saying overall revenue has gone up while the rate has gone down, she would have been wrong if she was implying a causal relationship. The IFS says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Corporation tax revenue has increased since 2010 even while the headline rate has been cut. But that does not mean that rate reductions have increased revenue.</p> <p>First ... much of the rise in revenue since 2010 is simply recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and recession. We would have expected a recovery in profits even if the corporation tax rate had not been cut.</p> <p>Second, while the government has reduced the headline rate of corporation tax, at the same time it has increased corporation tax in other ways, including reducing capital allowances for investment, introducing the bank surcharge, restricting companies\u2019 ability to offset past losses against future profits, and a raft of anti-avoidance measures ... Taken together these measures recoup around \u00a310bn of the \u00a313bn spent reducing the headline rate.</p> </blockquote> <p>The IFS also says the Johnson decision to abandon the proposed cut in corporation tax will free up \u00a36bn for the government to spend on other things.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T16:20:48.997Z\">at 4.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dd2bc2c8f08eeb483f19ba6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T15:44:11.748Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>These are from the Press Association\u2019s <strong>Ian Jones.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1196358967280226304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How the polls have moved over the past six weeks. <br><br>A 10-point Tory lead has become a 13-point Tory lead. <a href=\"https://t.co/KuTWEb55LU\">pic.twitter.com/KuTWEb55LU</a></p>&mdash; Ian Jones (@ian_a_jones) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1196358967280226304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1196393957787361281\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Tories&#39; average poll rating is now the highest it has been this year. <a href=\"https://t.co/37LNpovTAQ\">pic.twitter.com/37LNpovTAQ</a></p>&mdash; Ian Jones (@ian_a_jones) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1196393957787361281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dd2bbcf8f08aab51e1c1410\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T15:42:55.855Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour has softened its pledge to find a path to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/24/labour-set-to-commit-to-net-zero-emissions-by-2030\">net zero carbon emissions by 2030</a> after unions pushed for a target of significant progress rather than a firm commitment, my colleagues <strong>Rowena Mason, Heather Stewart </strong>and<strong> Matthew Taylor</strong> report.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/18/labour-persuaded-to-soften-pledge-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2030\">Labour persuaded to soften pledge of net zero emissions by 2030</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dd2b5f28f08eeb483f19b7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T15:20:20.063Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In an interview with BBC News <strong>Jo Swinson</strong>, the Lib Dem leader, has just ridiculed the idea that Brexit would be \u201cdone\u201d under Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to pass his withdrawal agreement.

We see it on both sides of the political divide.</p> <p>On the right, we have the threat of \u2013 even preference for \u2013 no deal as the end point of our Brexit negotiations ...</p> <p>For some on the right \u2013 this preference for no deal is driven by a zeal for something beyond this and that is the wholesale deregulation of the UK economy.</p> <p>But I want to be clear that this is not what British firms, large or small, want. They are intent on improving the quality of good jobs and not diminishing them.</p> <p>They accept Brexit and will do all they can to make it work. But when no deal becomes an ideology of its own, seemingly intent on ignoring the impact on jobs and livelihoods, then we have a problem.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ideology from the left is at least as damaging. The Labour party is proposing the biggest programme of renationalisation this country has ever seen at great cost with uncertain returns to the taxpayer and with no clear route to better customer service.</p> <p>Its most recent proposed nationalisation of part of BT was a bolt from the blue and has sent a chill through boardrooms at home and abroad. With many firms questioning whether their investment is safe. And some thinking: are we next?</p> <p>These ideologies from both sides are causing great harm to our economy.

These are from members of the CBI audience, not journalists.</p> <p><em>Q: What is your attitude towards the sharing economy?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says he approves of sharing, not wasting.</p> <p><em>Q: What are you going to do to disprove claims that Labour is \u201cfor the many, not the Jew\u201d, and to show that you care about antisemitism and racism?</em><br></p> <p>Corbyn says racism is a scourge and an evil for all of us. Whether it is antisemitism, Islamophobia, or any other form of racism, it is evil. He says it has no place in a civilised society. Labour will continue to fund protection for synagogues and other places of worship, and it will continue to fund anti-racist education in schools.</p> <p>He says Labour will audit the way the public sector recruits to promote diversity.</p> <p>He says he was brought up to hate racism. He has opposed it all his life. He says he will carry that attitude into Downing Street.</p> <p><em>Q: You have not mentioned industrial strategy. Are you going to follow the current government\u2019s strategy?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says Labour will increase corporation tax, but not beyond 2010 levels.</p> <p>Poverty is a terrible waste, he says. Children growing up in poverty can find it hard to learn if they do not have space to do their homework. </p> <p><em>Q: How will a four-day week help productivity?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says this will be funded and paid for by productivity increases. He says over many years working times have come down as a result of productivity increases.</p> <p>He ends by saying he thinks everyone would support a fairer and more egalitarian society.</p> <p>And that\u2019s it.

In many rural areas it hardly exists. So getting businesses to move there is unrealistic.</p> <p>He says the government did not allocate enough money for this. And private firms were taking too long. This has led to some groups having to organise their own provision.</p> <p>Corbyn says Labour\u2019s proposals is a fair and good one. You accept the case for universal provision of energy services, and mail services. These days universal provision of broadband is essential.</p> <p><em>Q: Can you name a FTSE 100 company you admire?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says most companies have social impact funds. And most of them give to social enterprises. His concern is about the behaviour of some oil and mineral companies.</p> <p>He says he is not anti these companies. But where social or environmental damage has been causes, firms have an obligation to behave differently.</p> <p><em>Q: Would you nationalise bus services outside London?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says bus services outside London were deregulated. He says mayors like Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester want to be able to run regulated bus services. Some can do this, and some can\u2019t. Labour would extend these powers, so they can run these services. And it would legislate for integrated transport systems. </p> <p><em>Q: Isn\u2019t it clear that your Brexit policy won\u2019t sort out Brexit quickly?</em></p> <p>Corbyn says his party represents people who voted leave and remain. There has been a huge demand for a second referendum. Labour\u2019s approach is sensible and credible, he says.</p> <p>He says he wants to bring uncertainty to an end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dff9e582f39ac1740d5b84ef7fd0e95b47ce7140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dff9e582f39ac1740d5b84ef7fd0e95b47ce7140/0_65_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn speaking at the CBI annual conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn speaking at the CBI annual conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T12:11:11.194Z\">at 12.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dd284458f08aab51e1c1181\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-18T11:45:36.341Z\">11.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn tells his audience that there are many things they agree on.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What a Labour government will do is raise the platform on which our whole society stands so that businesses and individuals can build themselves up even higher and reach their dreams.</p> <p>You know despite people\u2019s differences, there are things we can all agree on.

By comparison, the decision to abandon the proposed corporation tax cut does seem to amount to a big ticket spending announcement. Boris Johnson said it would raise \u00a36bn for the NHS. It may be one of the biggest Tory election announcements we\u2019ve had so far.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why Johnson announced this, or even why he opted for the \u00a36bn figure. This is the exact figure announced by Labour last week when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/labour-nhs-rescue-package-to-be-paid-for-by-higher-taxpayers-says-mcdonnell\">it announced its own spending increase for the NHS. </a>Here is an extract from the notes from the Labour press notice issued at the time. (Bold type in original.)</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Labour\u2019s funding plan would deliver:</strong> A real terms increase of \u00a326bn (\u00a340bn in cash terms) from 2018-19 to 2023-24 \u2013 the period over which the Conservatives promised \u00a320bn more.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, Johnson has neutralised the Labour bid to outspend the Tories on the NHS.</p> <p>(At least, he has if his figures are accurate - at the moment we have had no detail of what is is proposing.)</p> <p>In one sense this is a win for Labour; it shows that Jeremy Corbyn has been setting the agenda, and he just justifiably argue that this means the opposition is changing the policy of the governing parties.</p> <p>But in campaign terms, this is a setback for Corbyn. At least one element of his distinctive pitch on the NHS has now been eliminated - even though there are still plenty of other differences been Labour and Tory health policy. (Spending totals aren\u2019t everything.)</p> <p><em>UPDATE: </em>Looking at the Treasury red book from 2016, when this corporation tax cut was announced, it looks as if the \u00a36bn figure that Johnson announced is a cumulative, five-year figure, not an annual figure, which would mean he was a long way off matching what Labour has promised.

      "bodyText": "We have now closed today\u2019s live blog. Thanks for all your comments and for reading. Here are our latest political stories and my colleague Andrew Sparrow\u2019s roundup from earlier. At a Hope Not Hate summit in London this evening the former prime minister Gordon Brown will say the UK\u2019s \u201cbitter divisions are now not just over Brexit, but between north and south, rich and poor and between the four nations\u201d. And he is to warn it could take a generation to \u201cdrain the poison that is increasingly infecting\u201d national life, with the rebuilding of national unity to require \u201ctackling head-on divisive nationalisms and racism - not least with new laws to root out anti-Semitism and Islamophobia\u201d. He will also caution that \u201cnationalists on both sides are more interested in exploiting divisions rather than ending them\u201d. It will take far more than an election - perhaps a generation - to end our country\u2019s now-widening divisions and to drain the poison that is increasingly infecting our national life. A huge majority of people in Britain - 77% - now think that Brexit is fuelling prejudice and is making our country more divided than ever. With more parliamentary candidates than ever sacked because of racism, sexism or homophobia, more and more social media activists exploiting the internet to troll and abuse, and with fake news debasing our public discourse, and with - it is sad to say - so many women giving up as MPs in the face of threats of violence, our country\u2019s bitter divisions are now not just over Brexit but between north and south, rich and poor and between the four nations that, until recently, formed a cohesive United Kingdom. With the SNP now threatening the hardest of \u2018hard\u2019 separations and the Conservatives whipping up English nationalism with their claim Scotland will run England if there was a Labour government, nationalists on both sides are more interested in exploiting divisions rather than ending them. His comments came as a Hope Not Hate poll found only 7% of the black and minority ethnic community believe racism is not on the rise. Endorsing the Labour party, Brown said all the UK \u201cwill have to work far harder to heal the wounds of recent years\u201d, and politicians need to \u201creach out to and enter into a dialogue\u201d with the public. \u201cIt will need measures to end the economic insecurity that is the breeding ground for populist nationalism.\u201d Here is an edited extract of his speech published earlier: ITV should not be allowed to give Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn the opportunity to \u201csidestep\u201d debating Brexit, the Liberal Democrats have said after the High Court ruled the debate between the two party leaders tomorrow evening will go ahead as planned. In a statement following the decision, Lib Dem president Sal Brinton said: The Liberal Democrats\u2019 position in this election and that of our leader is unique - Jo Swinson is the only leader of a national party fighting to stop Brexit. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn should not be allowed to sidestep debating the issue of Brexit with someone who wants to remain, and ITV should not give them the opportunity to do so. That is why this is an incredibly disappointing verdict. Not just for the Liberal Democrats but also for democracy in this country, and for every remainer who deserves to have a voice in this debate. This law needs to change. ITV needs to change. Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats brought this court case because our politics needs to change too. Televised debates between political party leaders should be framed in stronger legislation. But more than that, our democracy should not be in the hands of invisible corporate structures, and arrangements for such debates should always be accessible and transparent. Earlier, (see 5.10pm) the SNP said excluding Nicole Sturgeon from the debate meant Scots were being treated as second-class citizens. ITV said in a statement: \u201cWe welcome the court\u2019s decision and will continue with our comprehensive election coverage as planned.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn has paid tribute to a Labour campaigner with terminal breast cancer who died days after describing being left in hospital without treatment for hours. Jayne Rae, 53, from Whittle-le-Woods in Lancashire, died on Monday morning after a year with the disease. In a video shared by the Labour leader on Sunday she painted a grim picture of the difficulties patients faced in accessing treatment. \u201cI have never seen people lying in corridors covered in blood, dying, doctors under stress, nurses unable to help to the point of they were crying in frustration,\u201d she said, adding that her mother was \u201cbegging\u201d staff for help as she spent several hours waiting for treatment in \u201cextreme pain\u201d. Corbyn tweeted following news of her death: \u201cIncredibly sad to hear that Jayne died this morning. Jayne\u2019s life ended as she lived it: making the world a better place for others. Jayne sent me this video which shows her passion for defending our NHS and making sure it\u2019s there for everyone whenever they need it.\u201d An ITV election debate featuring just Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn is due to go ahead tomorrow night after a legal challenge from the Lib Dems and the SNP failed. The two smaller parties both objected to their leaders not being included, but the high court concluded that this was not a matter over which it could exercise judicial review and that, even if it could, ITV was not ignoring its impartiality obligations. The SNP says this means Scottish voters are being treated like second-class citizens. Even though leaders\u2019 debates have been a feature of ever UK election since 2010, tomorrow\u2019s will be the first to feature just the PM and the leader of the opposition and smaller parties argue that this means voters are being given the impression that the election is a binary choice between two parties. There is some evidence to suggest that, in England at least, voters are already coming to this conclusion, before the first debate has already aired. Opinion polls may not be accurate predictors of final election outcomes, but they are seen as being reliable guides to shifts in opinion during campaigns, and so far the GB-wide polls have been showing support for the two main parties rising since the campaign started, and the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit party seeing their vote squeezed (particularly the Brexit party, whose vote may even be collapsing.) Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson all gave speeches at the CBI\u2019s annual conference, which led to the event becoming something of an electoral beauty parade for the benefit of corporate Britain. And corporate Britain was not over-impressed. In a speech Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said extremists on the right and the left in politics were causing \u201cgreat harm to the economy\u201d. My colleague Phillip Inman, economics editor of the Observer, says it was Swinson who got the best reception. After her speech Paul Drechsler, a former CBI president, posted this on Twitter. Boris Johnson has told business leaders he will shelve a planned cut in corporation tax, claiming he would put \u00a36bn into public services instead. In his speech he did not commit to ringfencing the money for the NHS, but he strongly implied that this was where much of it was going. He told his audience: We understand that it is ... you who are creating the wealth that actually pays for the NHS. And, by the way, because the NHS is the nation\u2019s priority, and because we believe emphatically in fiscal prudence, I hope you will understand if I also announce today that we are postponing further cuts in corporation tax. And before you storm the stage and protest, let me remind you that this saves \u00a36bn that we can put into the priorities of the British people, including the NHS. As explained earlier, this surprise move neutralises the Labour announcement last week to beef up spending on the NHS - also to tune of \u00a36bn a year. In a Guardian fact check, my colleague Richard Partington explains that Johnson\u2019s announcement also undercuts frequent Tory claims that cutting the headline rate of corporation tax is the best way to increase total revenue from it. Swinson has confirmed that the Lib Dems would abolish business rates, and replace them with a commercial landowner levy. This policy would \u201cshift the burden from the tenant to the landlord so that we can breathe new life into our high streets\u201d, she told the CBI. Corbyn has told the CBI that Labour\u2019s nationalisation programme does not represent a return to the failed policies of the past. He told the conference: We will bring some key services into public ownership. I make no apology for that. It\u2019s not an attack on the foundations of a modern economy; it\u2019s the very opposite. It\u2019s the norm in many European countries. It\u2019s taking the essential steps to build a genuinely mixed economy for the 21st century. Even the city editor of the Financial Times called the privatisation of water an \u201corganised rip off.\u201d So I understand you are cautious about some of our plans but your businesses, your workers and your consumers have been failed by rip-off energy bills and poor rail and bus services. And I think many of you know that because you know things can\u2019t go on as they are. Labour has softened its pledge to find a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 after unions pushed for a target of significant progress rather than a firm commitment. Jennifer Arcuri, the US businesswoman at the centre of conflict of interest allegations against Boris Johnson, has said she warned the prime minister last week that she would speak out against him after he repeatedly refused to take her calls. Extinction Rebellion activists have begun hunger strikes outside a number of UK political party headquarters to push for more robust policies on tackling the climate emergency in the general election. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Mattha Busby is now taking over. ITV\u2019s Rachel Younger has more on the reason for the high court\u2019s decision not to allow the Lib Dem/SNP legal challenge to tomorrow\u2019s two-party election leaders\u2019 debate. From my colleague Jim Waterson The SNP has said the high court decision allowing ITV to go ahead with an election leaders\u2019 debate excluding Nicola Sturgeon means that Scottish voters are being treated as \u201csecond-class citizens\u201d. This is from Ian Blackford, the party\u2019s leader at Westminster. This election is a chance for people in Scotland to vote to escape Brexit, to protect the NHS and to choose their own future with independence \u2013 yet they will not hear that argument in the debate tomorrow night. Instead, they will only hear from the leaders of two parties who both want to pursue Brexit - taking Scotland out of the EU against its will \u2013 who want to lock Scotland into the union. That means the views of around 50% of Scottish voters who favour independence and around 70% who favour remain will be completely ignored. Nicola Sturgeon was ready, willing and able, to take on Johnson and Corbyn in tomorrow night\u2019s debate \u2013 now it is incumbent on them to commit to the all party debate on 1st December or tell everyone what they are so scared of. It was already clear that the Westminster political system is utterly broken and incapable of properly representing Scotland\u2019s interests. What is now clear is that the UK broadcasting system is similarly incapable. Indeed the result of the decision to exclude the SNP is to discriminate against Scottish voters and to effectively treat them as second-class citizens. The SNP says decisions about who gets invited to election debates should be taken by an independent body, not by politicians or broadcasters. A Labour government would launch an investigation into British colonialism and its legacy today, the party\u2019s election manifesto is expected to declare, according to this HuffPost UK story by Paul Waugh. David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary who is trying to defend his South West Hertfordshire seat as an independent, having been thrown out of the parliamentary party for rebelling over Brexit, has been campaigning today with Amber Rudd, another former Tory cabinet minister who resigned the whip over Brexit. Willie Rennie, the Liberal Democrat leader in Scotland, has claimed the Lib Dems are \u201cstronger\u201d as a party after their time in coalition with the Tories. But he admitted he has \u201cregrets\u201d about some of the policies that were introduced. He told BBC Radio Scotland. In terms of the welfare stuff, there was some stuff as part of the coalition we had to vote through. There are a lot of things we managed to achieve in return. There are some regrets I have, of course I have that, I think the \u2018bedroom tax\u2019 should never have happened and said so at the time .... Yes, I regret some of the things but I can tell you we\u2019re a stronger party as a result because we understand much more about the hard choices you have to make in government and it has been really instructive for us in terms of our current campaign to stop Brexit. We are resolute in trying to stop doing the damage the Conservatives can do to our country. They are hell bent on this dangerous Brexit. Speaking at a Unite conference in Brigton, the union\u2019s general secretary, Len McCluskey, described Boris Johnson as \u201cEton\u2019s answer to Del Boy\u201d. He said: Ultimately this election is about trust. Who do we trust to charter our communities out of the troubled waters, to a better future? Is it Boris Johnson, a man whose privileged upbringing has given him such an arrogant sense of entitlement to rule, and would appear to be prepared to stop at nothing to keep the keys to Number 10. Eton\u2019s answer to Del Boy. Or is it Jeremy Corbyn, the only leader able and determined to speak for our whole nation, on Brexit as on other issues. And here is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s story on the high court decision. The Press Association has just snapped this. The Liberal Democrats and SNP have lost a high court challenge against ITV over its decision to exclude their party leaders from a televised election debate. Patience Wheatcroft, a Conservative member of the House of Lords and former editor of the Sunday Telegraph, has announced that she is supporting the Lib Dem Chuka Umunna to be the next MP for the Cities of London and Westminster. She is a strong opponent of Brexit and supports a second referendum. Here is the CBI reaction to Jo Swinson\u2019s speech. This is from Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI\u2019s director general. It was good to hear commitments from the Liberal Democrats on working with firms to tackle climate change, improve skills and backing business as a force for good. Increasing investment in infrastructure will better connect the UK\u2019s regions and nations, close productivity gaps and facilitate a step change in exports. The Liberal Democrats recognise the broken business rates system needs fundamental reform. But moving to a land value tax is mired in complexity, and it remains unclear how it would cut overall costs or provide a level playing field. Much more detail will be needed. Employee engagement is hugely important, but there are numerous ways to ensure staff views are represented at the highest levels rather than simply asking employees to sit on boards. We have not written much here today about Jennifer Arcuri, who has been giving interviews about her friendship with Boris Johnson, which has now led to him being subject to various investigations into whether he abused his position as London mayor because her firm benefited from sponsorship and trade mission access during his term in office. But my colleague Marina Hyde has been watching, and she has a great write-up here. And here is an extract. The most worrying moment for Johnson\u2019s team will have been the bit where [Victoria] Derbyshire told the otherwise elliptic Arcuri she could help him out by saying there was no conflict of interest. Quick as a flash she shot back: \u201cAnd he could help me out. Like, two months ago.\u201d She\u2019d sent him a text, she revealed. \u201cYou wanna read it?\u201d she asked, reaching for her phone. \u201c\u2018Is this the price of loyalty? To be hung up on, ignored and blocked? Why would I remain silent if you can\u2019t even speak to me?\u2019\u201d So there you have Jennifer Arcuri in all her, like, glory \u2013 this election\u2019s picaresque anti-heroine. And I\u2019m afraid we all know what happens to those. In the story of Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, who would definitely have been monstered on GMB, Thomas Hardy is clear: \u201cThe woman pays.\u201d And so with Jennifer of the Arcuris. The woman pays. The prime minister? Nah, seems unlikely. But that\u2019s business. Try not to choke on it. On the Today programme this morning Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said that cutting the rate of corporation tax had led to the overall income to the government from this tax going up. Given that she was speaking only hours before Boris Johnson announced that he was abandoning a proposed further cut in corporation tax, her comment could be seen as an implicit criticism of the policy her leader was about to announce. She told the programme: What we\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve reduced corporation tax from 28% to 19%, making it the lowest in the G20, is we\u2019ve seen an increase in the amount of tax taken by the exchequer. This afternoon the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the tax and spending thinktank, has published a short briefing note on the Johnson announcement. It says that, while Leadsom may be correct in saying overall revenue has gone up while the rate has gone down, she would have been wrong if she was implying a causal relationship. The IFS says: Corporation tax revenue has increased since 2010 even while the headline rate has been cut. But that does not mean that rate reductions have increased revenue. First ... much of the rise in revenue since 2010 is simply recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and recession. We would have expected a recovery in profits even if the corporation tax rate had not been cut. Second, while the government has reduced the headline rate of corporation tax, at the same time it has increased corporation tax in other ways, including reducing capital allowances for investment, introducing the bank surcharge, restricting companies\u2019 ability to offset past losses against future profits, and a raft of anti-avoidance measures ... Taken together these measures recoup around \u00a310bn of the \u00a313bn spent reducing the headline rate. The IFS also says the Johnson decision to abandon the proposed cut in corporation tax will free up \u00a36bn for the government to spend on other things. These are from the Press Association\u2019s Ian Jones. Labour has softened its pledge to find a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 after unions pushed for a target of significant progress rather than a firm commitment, my colleagues Rowena Mason, Heather Stewart and Matthew Taylor report. In an interview with BBC News Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has just ridiculed the idea that Brexit would be \u201cdone\u201d under Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to pass his withdrawal agreement. That would not be Brexit over, she said. She said it would just be the end of \u201cseries one\u201d; there would be a whole \u201cbox set\u201d yet to come, because of the post-Brexit trade negotiation with the EU. Swinson said the Lib Dem policy of abandoning Brexit and staying in the EU was the only way of resolving this quickly. The Federation of Small Businesses has welcomed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s promise to tackle the late payments crisis, which has left many small businesses waiting without cash for invoices to be honoured. \u201cOur late payment crisis remains the biggest scourge afflicting the UK\u2019s small business community. It destroys 50,000 firms a year at a cost of at least \u00a32.5bn to the economy,\u201d said chairman Mike Cherry. Q: Could the Lib Dems work with Labour if it replaced its leader? Swinson says, if the Lib Dems do not get a majority, they will still want to stop Brexit. She says neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn deserve to be PM. Lib Dems votes will not put either of them there, she says. She says there is a real fear in the Jewish community about Corbyn becoming prime minister. There is no way the Liberal Democrats could vote for him to be PM on that basis, she says. Jo Swinson is now taking questions. Q: Won\u2019t your plan to abolish business rates, and replace them with a levy on landlords, just lead to rents going up? Swinson says business rates can be a crippling cost. Swinson says the offer from the two main parties is a \u201cterrible choice\u201d. The Conservatives do not respect the rule of law. And Labour thinks little of property rights, she says. Swinson says the Lib Dems would scrap business rates and replace them with a levy on landowners. The party would also give every adult in England a \u00a310,000 \u201cskills wallet\u201d so that they can invest in training. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is addressing the CBI conference now. She says any party that wants to get Brexit done, or get Brexit sorted, cannot be said to be the party of business. She says the Liberal Democrats are the only party that can really claim to be the party of business because they are opposed to Brexit. A Tory official has been in touch to say that an Office for Budget Responsibility report earlier this year said cutting corporation tax from 19% to 17% would have cost the Treasury \u00a35.4bn by 2023-24. (See para 4.36 on page 83 here [pdf].) (So, when Boris Johnson told the CBI abandoning this tax cut would save \u00a36bn for the NHS and other public services, it seems he was generously rounding up the total.) From Sky\u2019s business correspondent Paul Kelso, who\u2019s at the CBI conference: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claims small businesses would benefit from a \u201cclean break\u201d Brexit. Jo Swinson is to present the Liberal Democrats as \u201cthe natural party of business\u201d when she speaks to the CBI conference this afternoon, primarily as the party wants to prevent Brexit. Swinson, with an ever-growing entourage of reporters and TV crews in tow, took one of the Lib Dem battlebuses to Kings Langley, just north of London, to visit Imagination Technologies, a sizeable UK firm which specialises in graphics processing and other computing functions, though from the marketing and intellectual property side, rather than manufacturing. This was explained at some length to Swinson as she toured a big room in the firm\u2019s HQ lined with various laptops, phones and tablets using the company\u2019s products. At one point she was shown a device designed to answer voice questions, which happily provided details about Imagination Technologies. \u201cWhich UK party wants to stop Brexit?\u201d Swinson asked it, getting a long, slightly awkward silence in response. Speaking to reporters at the visit, Swinson said she would have some \u201csome very specific\u201d policies to announce at the CBI, but provided a message that was, as is much the party does in this election, centred around Brexit: The Liberal Democrats are now the natural party of business. Instead of the Brexit plans of the Conservatives and the Labour party, that are going to hit the economy hard, the Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit. We also want to make sure that businesses can get the skills and the talent they need. Earlier, in her speech to the CBI conference, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, its director general, said that extremists on the right and the left in politics were causing \u201cgreat harm to the economy\u201d. (See 10.17am.) She was referring to Tory Brexiters who favour a no-deal Brexit, and Labour Corbynites pushing a nationalisation agenda. Here are the full quotes from her speech. I believe we are facing a danger that could get in the way of a bright future. And it takes the form of extreme ideology. We see it on both sides of the political divide. On the right, we have the threat of \u2013 even preference for \u2013 no deal as the end point of our Brexit negotiations ... For some on the right \u2013 this preference for no deal is driven by a zeal for something beyond this and that is the wholesale deregulation of the UK economy. But I want to be clear that this is not what British firms, large or small, want. They are intent on improving the quality of good jobs and not diminishing them. They accept Brexit and will do all they can to make it work. But when no deal becomes an ideology of its own, seemingly intent on ignoring the impact on jobs and livelihoods, then we have a problem. Meanwhile, ideology from the left is at least as damaging. The Labour party is proposing the biggest programme of renationalisation this country has ever seen at great cost with uncertain returns to the taxpayer and with no clear route to better customer service. Its most recent proposed nationalisation of part of BT was a bolt from the blue and has sent a chill through boardrooms at home and abroad. With many firms questioning whether their investment is safe. And some thinking: are we next? These ideologies from both sides are causing great harm to our economy. Not just in the future but right now. The Overseas Development Institute is holding what it says may be the only general election hustings devoted to the topic of overseas aid. It is just starting now, and there is a live feed here. Those taking part include Ray Collins, the former Labour general secretary, Lady Sheehan from the Lib Dems, Natalie Bennett from the Greens and Elizabeth Babade from the Brexit party. Tory sources are saying that the \u00a36bn figure for the amount saved by not going ahead with next year\u2019s corporation tax is an annual figure, not a cumulative, five-year figure. (See 12.44pm.) More on how much the government will save by abandoning the corporation tax cut from 19% to 17% due to come into force next year. In 2016 the Treasury said this tax cut was worth just \u00a3945m a year. (See 12.44pm.) Earlier this year my colleague Richard Partington said that this cut was expected to cost the Treasury much more than originally assumed. \u201cAn analysis based on HMRC data suggests that the loss of revenue from the planned cuts, initiated by former chancellor George Osborne but supported by incumbent Philip Hammond, could add up to more than \u00a36bn,\u201d his report said. And, according to Newsnight\u2019s Ben Chu, in 2017 the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that by 2022 this tax cut would cost almost \u00a37bn. These are from Newsnight\u2019s economics editor, Ben Chu. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has put out a statement saying Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to abandon the corporation tax cut planned for next year will not repair the damage caused by Tory tax cuts. He said: Johnson has announced a temporary pause in the Tories\u2019 race to the bottom on corporation tax It cannot compensate for the lives that have been lost and will not repair the damage done to our communities to pay for the Conservatives\u2019 handouts to big business since 2010. The government\u2019s own figures show that billions have been lost to the public purse, which has had real consequences across the country. Labour is committed to gradually raising corporation tax to 26%, which would still be lower than the 28% level it was at when Labour left office in 2010. This is from Nick Macpherson, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury, on Boris Johnson\u2019s corporation tax announcement - an effective tax rise. The main rate of corporation tax is 19%, but it was due to fall to 17% in April next year. At the time this cut was announced, by George Osborne in the March 2016 budget, the Treasury said this would cost \u00a3945m in 2020-21. It is not clear yet why Johnson is saying this would raise \u00a36bn for the NHS. He may be using a cumulative, five-year figure - in which case what he has announced today is a long way off matching the Labour plans, which Labour itself says would lead to health spending being \u00a36bn a year higher in real terms than under current government plans. (See 11.26am.) UPDATE: I\u2019m still waiting for clarification from CCHQ, but there have been reports saying that the corporation tax cut was going to cost far more than assumed in 2016, and that \u00a36bn a year is a fair figure. (See 1.13pm.) FURTHER UPDATE: The \u00a36bn figure is an annual figure, the Tories say. (See 1.26pm.) Extinction Rebellion protesters have been at Labour HQ this morning as part of their campaign for parties to commit to much tougher action to deal with the climate crisis, including reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2025. The group says it is going to target all the UK political parties. And here is the CBI response to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech. This is from Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general. It\u2019s time to see Labour open the door to real and lasting partnership with business, not stick with outdated ideologies that would close it in their face. The challenge is not what Labour wants to achieve, it\u2019s how. Firms share many of the same ambitions, on skills, climate change, delivering high-paid jobs and making sure that the proceeds of growth are felt across the country \u2013 but those challenges need a joint response. Some of Labour\u2019s proposals do open the door to partnership. Greater flexibility on the apprenticeship levy is something firms have long asked for. A step up in all forms of vocational training for school leavers and those switching careers offers opportunities and works for the economy. Re-skilling the economy to achieve net zero and adapt for increased automation is critical, and apprenticeships can have a big role to play in this. But false instincts for mass nationalisations and forcing inclusive ownership schemes on to thriving businesses does little more than frighten off investors from backing the UK, with pensioners and savers having to foot the bill. A high-growth, fair mixed economy is within our grasp, but only if business is welcomed and supported as a provider of opportunity, not falsely portrayed as the root cause of inequality. Here is the CBI reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s speech. This is from Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general. Conservative commitments to unblock the pent-up potential of British enterprise will be welcomed by businesses who have faced an ever-growing burden of costs and uncertainty. Postponing further cuts to corporation tax to invest in public services could work for the country if it is backed by further efforts to the costs of doing business and promote growth. Reforming business rates has been a key priority for CBI members. This means that we will finally get to grips with a broken system that damages investment and jobs and could breathe new life into our high streets and other sectors. Business welcomes the prime minister\u2019s passion for levelling up opportunities throughout the country through investment in education, infrastructure and technology. But his words must become firm commitments in the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto in order to get the UK economy back on track. Action at home must be accompanied by the right type of Brexit certainty. That means a new relationship with the EU that maintains frictionless trade, keeps close regulatory alignment and supports our services sector. Unnecessary deadlines and damaging cliff-edges should be replaced by taking the time needed to secure a sustainable, ambitious relationship. Corbyn is taking three more questions. These are from members of the CBI audience, not journalists. Q: What is your attitude towards the sharing economy? Corbyn says he approves of sharing, not wasting. Q: What are you going to do to disprove claims that Labour is \u201cfor the many, not the Jew\u201d, and to show that you care about antisemitism and racism? Corbyn says racism is a scourge and an evil for all of us. Whether it is antisemitism, Islamophobia, or any other form of racism, it is evil. He says it has no place in a civilised society. Labour will continue to fund protection for synagogues and other places of worship, and it will continue to fund anti-racist education in schools. He says Labour will audit the way the public sector recruits to promote diversity. He says he was brought up to hate racism. He has opposed it all his life. He says he will carry that attitude into Downing Street. Q: You have not mentioned industrial strategy. Are you going to follow the current government\u2019s strategy? Corbyn says Labour will increase corporation tax, but not beyond 2010 levels. Poverty is a terrible waste, he says. Children growing up in poverty can find it hard to learn if they do not have space to do their homework. Q: How will a four-day week help productivity? Corbyn says this will be funded and paid for by productivity increases. He says over many years working times have come down as a result of productivity increases. He ends by saying he thinks everyone would support a fairer and more egalitarian society. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: Do you accept your surprise announcement to nationalise BT Openreach worried business? Corbyn says every business has been arguing for years they need better broadband. In many rural areas it hardly exists. So getting businesses to move there is unrealistic. He says the government did not allocate enough money for this. And private firms were taking too long. This has led to some groups having to organise their own provision. Corbyn says Labour\u2019s proposals is a fair and good one. You accept the case for universal provision of energy services, and mail services. These days universal provision of broadband is essential. Q: Can you name a FTSE 100 company you admire? Corbyn says most companies have social impact funds. And most of them give to social enterprises. His concern is about the behaviour of some oil and mineral companies. He says he is not anti these companies. But where social or environmental damage has been causes, firms have an obligation to behave differently. Q: Would you nationalise bus services outside London? Corbyn says bus services outside London were deregulated. He says mayors like Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester want to be able to run regulated bus services. Some can do this, and some can\u2019t. Labour would extend these powers, so they can run these services. And it would legislate for integrated transport systems. Q: Isn\u2019t it clear that your Brexit policy won\u2019t sort out Brexit quickly? Corbyn says his party represents people who voted leave and remain. There has been a huge demand for a second referendum. Labour\u2019s approach is sensible and credible, he says. He says he wants to bring uncertainty to an end. Corbyn tells his audience that there are many things they agree on. What a Labour government will do is raise the platform on which our whole society stands so that businesses and individuals can build themselves up even higher and reach their dreams. You know despite people\u2019s differences, there are things we can all agree on. None of us wants to live in a society where we have to step over rough sleepers on our way to work. None of us wants to live in a society where foodbank collection points are needed in every supermarket. None of us wants to live in a society where one in three children grows up in poverty. I just want to live in a decent society. And I know you do too. It doesn\u2019t have to be an either/or choice because the opportunities created for businesses under a Labour government will be immense. Corbyn says Labour\u2019s plans mean tackling inequality and addressing the climate crisis can go hand in hand. Our green industrial revolution means that tackling the climate crisis and reducing inequality can go hand in hand because the inequality that scars our society is not inevitable; it\u2019s not an act of God or a law of physics. It\u2019s the result of deliberate government policy that has made us one of the most unequal countries in Europe both between the billionaires at the very top and everybody else and between the different parts of the UK. This inequality is unsustainable and immoral. Ending it requires government action so that investment reaches all and people are supported to unlock their talents. Corbyn is now giving details of Labour\u2019s proposed 320,000 new climate apprenticeships. Corbyn claims the PM wants to hand over parts of the NHS to American companies under a trade deal with the US. He claims that this could lead to \u00a3500m a week handed over to US drug companies. Labour would legislate to stop this, he says. (The \u00a3500m per week figure is not particularly plausible, because it is an extreme, worst-case scenario. This Channel 4 News FactCheck explains why.) Corbyn says Labour supports the proposals in the CBI\u2019s own manifesto for the election. Contrary to what some people claim, Labour does not think the state can address all the problems facing the country without help from business, he says. Corbyn says Labour will ask big businesses to pay their fair share of tax. And some services will be brought back into public ownership. But this is normal in many parts of Europe, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is addressing the CBI now. He starts by saying that, if Labour is elected, the CBI will see more infrastructure being built than it has ever dreamt of. And he says small businesses will benefit from Labour plans to ensure that suppliers have their invoices paid on time. Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the CBI, but there is a problem with the autocue. The business tax cuts announced by the Conservative party overnight (see 11.02am) did not have a price tag attached, but they all seemed to involve a relatively small outlay from the exchequer. By comparison, the decision to abandon the proposed corporation tax cut does seem to amount to a big ticket spending announcement. Boris Johnson said it would raise \u00a36bn for the NHS. It may be one of the biggest Tory election announcements we\u2019ve had so far. It is not hard to see why Johnson announced this, or even why he opted for the \u00a36bn figure. This is the exact figure announced by Labour last week when it announced its own spending increase for the NHS. Here is an extract from the notes from the Labour press notice issued at the time. (Bold type in original.) Labour\u2019s funding plan would deliver: A real terms increase of \u00a326bn (\u00a340bn in cash terms) from 2018-19 to 2023-24 \u2013 the period over which the Conservatives promised \u00a320bn more. In other words, Johnson has neutralised the Labour bid to outspend the Tories on the NHS. (At least, he has if his figures are accurate - at the moment we have had no detail of what is is proposing.) In one sense this is a win for Labour; it shows that Jeremy Corbyn has been setting the agenda, and he just justifiably argue that this means the opposition is changing the policy of the governing parties. But in campaign terms, this is a setback for Corbyn. At least one element of his distinctive pitch on the NHS has now been eliminated - even though there are still plenty of other differences been Labour and Tory health policy. (Spending totals aren\u2019t everything.) UPDATE: Looking at the Treasury red book from 2016, when this corporation tax cut was announced, it looks as if the \u00a36bn figure that Johnson announced is a cumulative, five-year figure, not an annual figure, which would mean he was a long way off matching what Labour has promised. See 12.44pm. I will post more when I get more clarification on this. FURTHER UPDATE: The Tories have now confirmed that the \u00a36bn figure is an annual figure, not a cumulative figure. (See 1.26pm.) Q: The CBI think you are wrong about how long it will take to negotiate a trade deal and about immigration. Are they wrong? Johnson says he has a deal that will protect the needs of business and industry. On immigration, he favours immigration. But you must have democratic control. An Australian-style points system would be of great value in showing people that the UK does have control of the system. Q: Did you share the incredulity of the rest of the UK about Prince Andrew\u2019s interview? Johnson says he does not want to be drawn into commentary about that. Q: If you win the election, will you keep Sajid Javid as chancellor? Johnson says he will. He says Javid is doing a fantastic job. Johnson promises to keep Sajid Javid as chancellor if he wins election. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: To get Brexit done, you will have to get a deal by next June, or delay the transition? Johnson claims that people said he would not be able to change the withdrawal agreement. But he did get it changed. He says the UK and the EU are already \u201cin a state of grace\u201d on tariffs and regulatory alignment. They are off to a flying start. He does not see why the trade deal cannot be negotiated next year. Q: Will you encourage the Duke of York to cooperate with the US inquiry into Jeffrey Epstein? Nice try, says Johnson. And Johnson adds a new announcement. Johnson says the Tories would postpone further cuts in corporation tax. That would free up \u00a36bn for the NHS, he says. Corporation tax was due to fall from 19% to 17%. Johnson says he is announcing package of measures to help business flourish. Here is how they were summed up in an overnight press notice from the Conservative party. (Bold from original release.) A business rates cut. The burden of business rates will be reduced as part of a fundamental review. A jobs tax cut. National insurance contributions will be cut by \u00a31,000 for over half a million employers. A construction tax cut. Tax relief on the purchase, building or leasing of a structure will be increased by 1%. A research tax cut. We will review the scope of R&amp;D tax credits and increase the rate by 1%. Johnson says the country needs a government that \u201cbelieves in business\u201d and understands the importance of wealth creators. He claims more businesses have been created in the UK since 2010 than in France and Germany combined. Johnson is broadening out his speech now to wider policy areas. The Tories would cut crime, he says, and invest in education. Young people must be able to, literally, find work, he says. And that is why infrastructure is so important, he says. He says, as well as focusing on big infrastructure projects, Johnson says he wants to focus on smaller transport projects too: better roads, better buses, more cycleways. He loves cycleways, he says. He says, by doing this, government can create \u201cthe platform for growth\u201d. And, if it does that, the market will respond, he says. Johnson says he wants to cut the productivity gap in the UK. But he will do that not be decapitating the tall poppies, but by levelling up. Johnson claims Jeremy Corbyn would be dependent on an alliance with the SNP. And he says Corbyn\u2019s position on the EU is \u201cpositively mind-boggling\u201d. He says it is still not clear whether or not Corbyn will campaign for the deal he will negotiate with the EU. Or, like Alec Guinness in the Bridge on the River Kwai, will he blow up the bridge he has himself constructed? Johnson says there is a pent-up, tidal wave of investment waiting to come into the UK once Brexit is resolved. He says he would not normally introduced party politics into a speech like this. But this is an election campaign, he says. He says the Tory Brexit deal is ready to go. You just add hot water and stir, he says (using his Pot Noodle simile again). He says the Conservative plan would give stability and certainty to business. It is a Blue Peter deal - \u201chere\u2019s one I prepared earlier\u201d. And he says every single Conservative party candidate has explicitly backed his deal. (In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph yesterday, he said they had been asked to give a pledge to that effect.) Johnson says the economy is not achieving as much as it could. There is so much more natural energy to unleash, he says. The country is being held back by politics, by parliament, he says. He is using a version of the passage released in advance. (See 9.29am.) Boris Johnson starts by saying it is a pleasure to be at this venue, a hotel near the O2 arena. He says as London mayor he gave planning permission for it to be built. He is now delivering his familiar riff about who much the UK exports to the rest of the world. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, introduces Boris Johnson. She says, as London mayor, he was very pro-enterprise. This is his first speech to the CBI as prime minister, she says. These are from the BBC\u2019s business editor, Simon Jack, on the speech and Q&amp;A from Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general. All the main UK parties are proposing a resolution to the Brexit deadlock. In his speech to the CBI later Boris Johnson will argue that the Conservatives would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d early next year so that the government can focus on the people\u2019s priorities. Jeremy Corbyn is also promising to \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d, although under his plan it would take six months, for a renegotiation and a referendum. In his speech opening the CBI conference, John Allan, the Tesco chairman and CBI president, claimed that both main parties were being simplistic. He said: Currently no party has the answers. It\u2019s not as simple as \u2018getting Brexit done\u2019. Or \u2018sorting Brexit in six months\u2019. Or even \u2018stop Brexit\u2019. Whatever happens in this election we\u2019ll be negotiating with the EU for years to come. Whether as a close friend or distant neighbour. So we need to have an honest conversation. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, is speaking at the conference now. She has just argued that business is at risk from ideologues on both the right and the left in politics: from those on the right, who want a no-deal Brexit because it will lead to deregulation; and from those on the left pushing a nationalisation agenda. I will post the quotes shortly. The CBI conference has started. John Allan, the CBI president, is giving the opening speech. There is a live feed here. Prof Sir John Curtice, the elections expert who is in charge of the exit poll used by the BBC and other broadcasters, told the Today programme this morning that he thought Labour had made \u201ca bit of ground at the expense of the Liberal Democrats amongst remain voters\u201d during the campaign so far but that it was still struggling with leave voters. The Labour party has spent most of the last week not talking about Brexit but trying to persuade voters on the leave side of the argument to come to the Labour party on the basis of its domestic agenda. The truth is the polls suggest this is not having any cut-through at all. Labour\u2019s share of the vote amongst leave voters \u2013 a grand total of 14% \u2013 is exactly the same now as it was a week ago, and that\u2019s the other clear message from the polls. Curtice also said the Liberal Democrats were finding it difficult to win over remain voters from the Conservatives. Equally for the Liberal Democrats, another absolutely clear message, that a lot of them think they can forge ahead by taking away remain voters from the Conservatives \u2013 well, I have to say the polls suggest that so far again their strategy is not doing much good. Curtice said there was a \u201cbinary choice\u201d when it came to Brexit at the election. Either we get a Conservative majority, and in the wake of that majority Boris Johnson will be able to pursue Brexit along the lines he proposes - and at the moment that is the direction in which the polls are quite firmly pointing - or perhaps we get a hung parliament and given that Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru are apparently all on the same page in wanting to have a second referendum, then presumably that is what would happen in the wake of a hung parliament. The leaders of the three main UK parties will be speaking at the CBI conference in London today and, as my colleague Peter Walker reports in his preview story, they will all be making arguments about why their policies are advantageous to business. But it is not just business who will be listening, and the speeches will also illustrate how the leaders are trying to frame the election. For Labour, it is about reversing a decade of austerity, and Jeremy Corbyn will be speaking about the number of apprentices that could be created by his party\u2019s \u00a3250bn green transformation fund. But for the Tories primarily the election is about Brexit, and Boris Johnson will argue that he needs a majority because parliament has been trying to \u201csabotage the democratic will of the people\u201d. Here is an extract from his speech released overnight by CCHQ. Johnson is expected to say: Let\u2019s not beat around the bush, big business didn\u2019t want Brexit. You made that clear in 2016 and this body said it louder than any other. But what is also clear is that what you want now - and have wanted for some time - is certainty. So that you can plan and invest, so you can grow and expand, so that you can create jobs and drive prosperity. Whilst you didn\u2019t want it, the people did vote for it. And so it was for politicians to deliver it. It has been politicians in a broken parliament \u2013 not you \u2013 that have failed in this and in some cases actively tried to sabotage the democratic will of the people. This is why we had to have this election. Our hung and broken parliament was set on prolonging this delay. It is interesting to note that Johnson is admitting that big business does not want Brexit. Four years ago the CBI conference in London was disrupted by two protesters from Vote Leave, the organisation that Johnson subsequently went on to lead (in November 2015 he still had not yet committed himself to the leave cause), who accused the CBI of being the voice of Brussels, and not representative of business. One of the protesters said at the time: We\u2019re worried about the CBI misrepresenting British businesses\u2019 views. We don\u2019t want the British public to be swayed by the CBI making claims about the views of British businesses when in reality a lot of particularly small and medium-sized businesses in the UK feel that the EU hinders rather than helps them. At its party conference in September Labour passed a motion saying the party should work \u201ctowards a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030\u201d. But that does not necessarily mean the 2030 target will be in the party\u2019s manifesto, and on the Today programme this morning Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, implied the manifesto target will be looser. This is from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith. UPDATE: This is what Gardiner told Today: We will have a power sector 90% powered by renewables by 2030. That is absolutely in line with achieving the overall targets that we have set which is to make sure that well before 2050 we have achieved the net-zero which we need to do ... The target that we\u2019ve already committed to is to make sure that we have a net-zero economy well before 2050. What we\u2019ve said is that we\u2019ll be making sure that the power sector \u2013 and this was the key thing that intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) said \u2013 that you have to have halved your emissions by 2030 in order to have a chance of achieving the targets, the global targets, that we need. Here are the election items in the diary for today. 10.15am: The Liberal Democrat and the SNP take legal action in the high court against their exclusion from the ITV leaders\u2019 debate taking place tomorrow. 10.40am: Boris Johnson speaks to the CBI conference. 11.15am: Jeremy Corbyn speaks to the CBI conference. 2.25pm: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, speaks to the CBI conference. In an interview on the Today programme Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said that if the Conservatives won the election their immigration rules would be \u201cfair to the world\u201d and not just the EU. She explained: The immigration rules at the moment allow free movement from all EU nations and then quite significantly tighter rules from the rest of the world. Our immigration rules will be fair to the world once we leave the European Union. What that means is, instead of being open, free-access to benefits, to work and to coming here without a job to the EU but tight for the rest of the world, what we will have is a system that can control the types of workers that we need in our economy, that can be driven by the needs to the UK economy, and that will be fair to the entire world instead of just free movement from the EU. Labour\u2019s David Lammy has accused her of \u201cmigrant bashing\u201d. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Sarah Marsh. As my colleague Matthew Weaver reports, Boris Johnson is facing fresh pressure over his relationship with the American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. Arcuri gave an interview to ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain this morning and, although she has refused to say whether she had an affair with Johnson when he was London mayor, she described their relationship as \u201cvery special\u201d. Asked directly on\u201cwas it an affair\u201d, Arcuri replied: I\u2019m not going to answer that question, but as you can tell there was a very special relationship there and when it did come out, half the people already assumed the affair and told me to admit. The other half just wanted me to deny, deny, deny. We will be pausing the live blog for a while and resuming shortly. Thank you The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, are also speaking at the CBI conference. Labour has promised to create a climate apprenticeship programme that will train an average of 80,000 people a year. Under the plans, they said they will deliver 320,000 apprenticeships in England during their first term in government, with the programme creating 886,000 by 2030. The conference comes after the CBI director general, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, said Corbyn\u2019s nationalisation plans would \u201cfreeze investment\u201d, and called on Labour to work with business. She told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cWe look at the policies on the table and we have real concerns that they are going to crack the foundations of our economy.\u201d Boris Johnson will announce cuts to national insurance and business tax in a speech today. The prime minister will tell leaders at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) annual conference on Monday that the Tories will put an end to Brexit \u201cuncertainty and confusion\u201d if they are returned to power on 12 December. Johnson will increase the employment allowance from \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000, providing a cut in NI of up to 1,000 for more than half a million businesses. They have also promised to increase the structures and buildings allowance (SBA) from 2% to 3% to increase the tax relief on the purchase, building or leasing of a structure. Johnson is expected to say: Let\u2019s not beat around the bush. Big business didn\u2019t want Brexit. You made that clear in 2016 and this body said it louder than any other. But what is also clear is that what you want now \u2013 and have wanted for some time \u2013 is certainty. So that you can plan and invest, so you can grow and expand, so that you can create jobs and drive prosperity. He is expected to add: While you didn\u2019t want it, the people did vote for it. And so it was for politicians to deliver it. Mike Cherry, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: These measures lay down a gauntlet to other parties, and we hope there will be more to come at this election. Actions to reduce the cost of employment and fix business rates should be complemented with clear commitments to tackle the scourge of late payments and help ensure the government is helping the self-employed. For example, through introducing a \u2018self-employment legislative lock\u2019 and measures to help the self-employed have better access to maternity, paternity and adoption support, and mortgages and pensions. That\u2019s it from me, I am now handing over to my colleague Sarah Marsh, who will then pass the baton to Andrew Sparrow. Thanks for reading. If you need to wake up fast, click on this offering on rail transport from Jeremy Corbyn and turn the volume up to 11. That\u2019s the papers. Time for a little more on the latest from the Arcuri investigation from Matthew Weaver. The London assembly\u2019s oversight committee is going to review a case stemming from 2010, when Johnson failed to declare an interest after having affair with the City Hall adviser Helen Macintyre, who later had a child with him. At the time, Johnson acknowledged that a potential conflict of interest had not been disclosed and vowed to \u201cbear in mind the definition of close associate for the future\u201d. Len Duvall, a Labour assembly member who chairs the committee, said: \u201cI\u2019m looking at the paperwork into Helen Macintyre. We need to understand that because he was advised to make those declarations in the future. The question is why did he hide the new relationship with Arcuri?\u201d You can read more here. The i takes a similar tack to the Guardian, with the calls for Andrew to meet the FBI following his interview. It notes that he could face a subpoena to testify if he were to travel to the US. The Financial Times reports on the latest developments in the Saudi Aramco IPO and gives its picture slot to the unrest in Hong Kong at the weekend. The Daily Express sticks to the election schedule, and gives Boris Johnson\u2019s business boost top billing, but mentions Andrew\u2019s widely derided TV interview in a blurb at the top. The Daily Mirror has its own exclusive, quoting a former royal protection officer\u2019s view of Andrew\u2019s denials regarding Virginia Giuffre\u2019s allegations that he had sex with her when she was 17. The Daily Mail engages in damage limitation for Andrew, quoting the prince\u2019s friends as saying he regretted not showing more sympathy for Epstein\u2019s victims. The Sun says Andrew told the Queen the interview was \u201ca great success\u201d, and reports on criticism of Jeremy Corbyn for saying he would be prepared to give up the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear deterrent. The Times says Prince Andrew is defiant despite the fallout, and pushes its exclusive about the encounter by Emily Maitlis. It gives its fifth column to Johnson\u2019s attempt to heal the rift with business caused by Brexit. The Telegraph splashes with an unhappy Queen (in a very striking hat), quoting a royal source as saying she did not give the BBC interview her blessing. It gives Boris Johnson its anchor spot underneath with his pitch to businesses at the CBI today. Today\u2019s newspapers are almost entirely taken up with the fallout from Prince Andrew\u2019s Newsnight interview about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, variously described as a \u201ccar crash\u201d or a \u201cgreat success\u201d on today\u2019s front pages. Today\u2019s Guardian focuses on Epstein\u2019s victims, with their lawyers demanding that Andrew speak to the FBI. Happy Monday to you and welcome to today\u2019s politics liveblog. I will be showing you the lie of the land for the first hour before handing over to my colleagues. Here\u2019s what we can expect today \u2026 At a glance: Investigators looking into Boris Johnson\u2019s relationship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri will also review an affair with an adviser that he failed to declare while mayor of London. On the campaign trail, he is preparing to woo business owners with a range of tax cuts at the Confederation of British Industry conference. He will promise tax relief for the construction and research industries, plus a tax cut for small employers by raising the allowance for their national insurance bills from \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000. Jeremy Corbyn will also speak at the CBI. Labour will unveil a compromise position on immigration this week that would not commit fully to free movement after Brexit but would expand the rights of migrants to bring family members to the UK. The Liberal Democrats are challenging ITV in the high court this morning over its exclusion of leader, Jo Swinson, from its televised debate. Two judges in London will also hear a similar action by the SNP. Swinson will be in Hertfordshire this morning. That\u2019s enough chat for now \u2013 off we go!",

He did not commit to ringfencing the money for the NHS, but he strongly implied this was where much of it was going. He told his audience:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We understand that it is ... you who are creating the wealth that actually pays for the NHS.</p> <p>And, by the way, because the NHS is the nation\u2019s priority, and because we believe emphatically in fiscal prudence, I hope you will understand if I also announce today that we are postponing further cuts in corporation tax.</p> <p>And before you storm the stage and protest, let me remind you that this saves \u00a36bn that we can put into the priorities of the British people, including the NHS.</p> </blockquote> <p>This surprise move neutralises the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/labour-vows-to-outspend-tories-with-26bn-rescue-plan-for-nhs\">Labour announcement last week to beef up spending on the NHS</a> - also to tune of \u00a36bn a year.

Johnson, Corbyn and Swinson try to win over business Johnson, Corbyn and Jo Swinson all gave speeches at the CBI\u2019s annual conference, which led to the event becoming something of an electoral beauty parade for the benefit of corporate Britain. And corporate Britain was not over-impressed. In a speech Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said extremists on the right and the left in politics were causing \u201cgreat harm to the economy\u201d. My colleague Phillip Inman, economics editor of the Observer, says it was Swinson who got the best reception. After her speech Paul Drechsler, a former CBI president, posted this on Twitter. Boris Johnson has told business leaders he will shelve a planned cut in corporation tax, claiming he would put \u00a36bn into public services instead. He did not commit to ringfencing the money for the NHS, but he strongly implied this was where much of it was going. He told his audience: We understand that it is ... you who are creating the wealth that actually pays for the NHS. And, by the way, because the NHS is the nation\u2019s priority, and because we believe emphatically in fiscal prudence, I hope you will understand if I also announce today that we are postponing further cuts in corporation tax. And before you storm the stage and protest, let me remind you that this saves \u00a36bn that we can put into the priorities of the British people, including the NHS. This surprise move neutralises the Labour announcement last week to beef up spending on the NHS - also to tune of \u00a36bn a year. In a Guardian fact check, my colleague Richard Partington explains that Johnson\u2019s announcement also undercuts frequent Tory claims that cutting the headline rate of corporation tax is the best way to increase total revenue from it. Swinson has confirmed that the Lib Dems would abolish business rates, and replace them with a commercial landowner levy. This policy would \u201cshift the burden from the tenant to the landlord so that we can breathe new life into our high streets\u201d, she told the CBI. Corbyn told the CBI that Labour\u2019s nationalisation programme does not represent a return to the failed policies of the past. He told the conference: It\u2019s not an attack on the foundations of a modern economy; it\u2019s the very opposite. It\u2019s the norm in many European countries. It\u2019s taking the essential steps to build a genuinely mixed economy for the 21st century. Even the city editor of the Financial Times called the privatisation of water an \u2018organised rip off\u2019. So I understand you are cautious about some of our plans but your businesses, your workers and your consumers have been failed by rip-off energy bills and poor rail and bus services. And I think many of you know that because you know things can\u2019t go on as they are. Meanwhile Labour has softened its pledge to find a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 after unions pushed for a target of significant progress rather than a firm commitment. Jennifer Arcuri, the US businesswoman at the centre of conflict of interest allegations against Boris Johnson, has said she warned the prime minister last week that she would speak out against him after he repeatedly refused to take her calls. Extinction Rebellion activists have begun hunger strikes outside a number of UK political party headquarters to push for more robust policies on tackling the climate emergency in the general election.

In Stirling, where the contest is between the Tories and the Scottish National party, unionist remainers like me are faced with a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea.</p> <p>As you rightly said, Stephen Kerr, the Tory candidate for Stirling, has revealed himself to be a solid Brexiter. He voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal on all three occasions and for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, and supported Johnson during the Tory leadership contest. The SNP is anti-Brexit, but sees the election as a stepping stone to Scottish independence.</p> <p>So what is a Stirling unionist remainer to do? Indeed, what are such voters elsewhere in Scotland to do? With a heavy heart, I think the answer is to vote SNP.

      "bodyText": "Living in the Stirling parliamentary constituency, I appreciated your profile of it (Report, 18 November), but I felt it skirted around a critical issue that is replicated in many other parts of Scotland. In Stirling, where the contest is between the Tories and the Scottish National party, unionist remainers like me are faced with a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea. As you rightly said, Stephen Kerr, the Tory candidate for Stirling, has revealed himself to be a solid Brexiter. He voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal on all three occasions and for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, and supported Johnson during the Tory leadership contest. The SNP is anti-Brexit, but sees the election as a stepping stone to Scottish independence. So what is a Stirling unionist remainer to do? Indeed, what are such voters elsewhere in Scotland to do? With a heavy heart, I think the answer is to vote SNP. The priority has to be to stop Brexit and therefore do everything possible locally to prevent a Tory majority across the UK. Should Brexit be stopped, the debate around Scottish independence will reshape dramatically, and it can right now be regarded as an issue for the future. Christine Howe Killearn, Stirling \u2022 Graham Judge (Letters, 14 November) says the decision of ITV and BBC to not include Jo Swinson in the head-to-head debates is undemocratic.

A number of opinion polls have consistently recorded Brexit as the most significant question. Voters are now more likely to identify as leave or remain than as supporters of one of the two main political parties.\u201d</p> <p>The party could make a complaint to the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom afterwards, Vassall-Adams said, but \u201cby that stage the damage would be done\u201d. He added: \u201cTV debates are an important national event in the course of a general election campaign. This [programme] will reach every home in the country and attract millions of viewers.\u201d</p> <p>There was a record audience of 10 million in 2010, for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/15/leaders-debate-nick-clegg-tv\">election debates that involved David Cameron, Ed Milliband, and Nick Clegg</a>, he said. \u201cTV debates are highly influential with voters. They provide a unique opportunity for viewers to see the party leaders live during a debate.\u201d</p> <p>Broadcasters are subject to Ofcom\u2019s code, which includes a duty to preserve due impartiality and to give due weight to an appropriately wide range of significant views. \u201cThere\u2019s no more important time to preserve impartiality than at the time of an election,\u201d Vassall-Adams said.</p> <p>ITV\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate would fail to achieve due impartiality, he added. \u201cMr Corbyn is a lifelong Eurosceptic \u2026 There will be no one in the debate who represents remain. The voice of remain has been excluded.</p> <p>\u201cThe [party\u2019s] position is that the obvious way to remedy this problem would be to include Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. They are the third party nationally in the polls and the greatest electoral supporters of remain.\u201d</p> <p>The high court should not dictate to ITV who should be included in the debate, he added. It was a matter for ITV to decide by respecting its broadcasting duties. Television companies were used to rapid turnarounds in news programmes and could easily adapt the debate in time for Tuesday evening\u2019s broadcast, he noted.</p> <p>The court has agreed to hear similar representations from the SNP. The party\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, was in court to take part in the case. The SNP, it is understood, is requesting an order for Tuesday\u2019s ITV debate, in its current format, to be halted.</p> <p>But one of the presiding judges said there were significant implications for such a challenge. Could it be argued that any election debate involving two parties, for example, supporting abolition of the Trident nuclear deterrent should not go ahead unless a party supporting it was present, Davis asked?</p> <p>Could the SNP argue that since it was the only party advocating Scottish independence it therefore should be included?</p> <p>Vassall-Adams said this challenge was exceptional because of the context of Brexit. The prime minister had been an \u201call-out supporter of leaving the EU\u201d, he said, while Labour had not declared whether it would support remain or leave in another referendum. There would be no balance of views.</p> <p>\u201cCurrent polling suggests that most voters would now support remain,\u201d Vassall-Adams said. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats and others supporting remain have been shut out of this case.\u201d</p> <p>Having a second programme on Tuesday evening one hour later \u2013 after I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! \u2013 involving one-on-one interviews of other party leaders would not redress the political balance, he added.</p> <p>Philip Coppel QC, for the SNP, said that lodging a complaint to Ofcom after the debate would be a useless remedy. \u201cThe harm to the SNP or Liberal Democrats will be irreversible. It will be cold comfort that some time after the general election, [the parties] receive a document upholding a complaint,\u201d he said.<br><br>\u201cWithout the presence of anyone from the SNP, it will feed into a perception of unfairness. A stricter regime [of adherence to Ofcom\u2019s code requiring impartiality] needs to be applied during election periods. [ITV\u2019s decision to have only Johnson and Corbyn] is outright defiance of the code. It\u2019s a deliberate decisions that contravenes the code.\u201d<br><br></p> <p>Opening ITV\u2019s defence , Kieron Beale QC said that it had \u201cgiven due weight to questions of impartiality\u201d. If the court were to find that it had somehow breached the Ofcom code, he added, then ITV would \u201cwithdraw\u201d the programmes from the schedule on Tuesday evening.<br></p> <p>Outside the court, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is the right of people both in Scotland and the rest of the UK to be fully informed about what\u2019s taking place [in this election]. People are going to be sending out their postal votes [soon].\u201d</p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",

A number of opinion polls have consistently recorded Brexit as the most significant question. Voters are now more likely to identify as leave or remain than as supporters of one of the two main political parties.\u201d The party could make a complaint to the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom afterwards, Vassall-Adams said, but \u201cby that stage the damage would be done\u201d. He added: \u201cTV debates are an important national event in the course of a general election campaign. This [programme] will reach every home in the country and attract millions of viewers.\u201d There was a record audience of 10 million in 2010, for the election debates that involved David Cameron, Ed Milliband, and Nick Clegg, he said. \u201cTV debates are highly influential with voters. They provide a unique opportunity for viewers to see the party leaders live during a debate.\u201d Broadcasters are subject to Ofcom\u2019s code, which includes a duty to preserve due impartiality and to give due weight to an appropriately wide range of significant views. \u201cThere\u2019s no more important time to preserve impartiality than at the time of an election,\u201d Vassall-Adams said. ITV\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate would fail to achieve due impartiality, he added. \u201cMr Corbyn is a lifelong Eurosceptic \u2026 There will be no one in the debate who represents remain. The voice of remain has been excluded. \u201cThe [party\u2019s] position is that the obvious way to remedy this problem would be to include Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. They are the third party nationally in the polls and the greatest electoral supporters of remain.\u201d The high court should not dictate to ITV who should be included in the debate, he added. It was a matter for ITV to decide by respecting its broadcasting duties. Television companies were used to rapid turnarounds in news programmes and could easily adapt the debate in time for Tuesday evening\u2019s broadcast, he noted. The court has agreed to hear similar representations from the SNP. The party\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, was in court to take part in the case. The SNP, it is understood, is requesting an order for Tuesday\u2019s ITV debate, in its current format, to be halted. But one of the presiding judges said there were significant implications for such a challenge. Could it be argued that any election debate involving two parties, for example, supporting abolition of the Trident nuclear deterrent should not go ahead unless a party supporting it was present, Davis asked? Could the SNP argue that since it was the only party advocating Scottish independence it therefore should be included? Vassall-Adams said this challenge was exceptional because of the context of Brexit. The prime minister had been an \u201call-out supporter of leaving the EU\u201d, he said, while Labour had not declared whether it would support remain or leave in another referendum. There would be no balance of views. \u201cCurrent polling suggests that most voters would now support remain,\u201d Vassall-Adams said. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats and others supporting remain have been shut out of this case.\u201d Having a second programme on Tuesday evening one hour later \u2013 after I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! \u2013 involving one-on-one interviews of other party leaders would not redress the political balance, he added. Philip Coppel QC, for the SNP, said that lodging a complaint to Ofcom after the debate would be a useless remedy. \u201cThe harm to the SNP or Liberal Democrats will be irreversible. It will be cold comfort that some time after the general election, [the parties] receive a document upholding a complaint,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout the presence of anyone from the SNP, it will feed into a perception of unfairness. A stricter regime [of adherence to Ofcom\u2019s code requiring impartiality] needs to be applied during election periods. [ITV\u2019s decision to have only Johnson and Corbyn] is outright defiance of the code. It\u2019s a deliberate decisions that contravenes the code.\u201d Opening ITV\u2019s defence , Kieron Beale QC said that it had \u201cgiven due weight to questions of impartiality\u201d. If the court were to find that it had somehow breached the Ofcom code, he added, then ITV would \u201cwithdraw\u201d the programmes from the schedule on Tuesday evening. Outside the court, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is the right of people both in Scotland and the rest of the UK to be fully informed about what\u2019s taking place [in this election]. People are going to be sending out their postal votes [soon].\u201d The hearing continues.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d The phrase certainly has a powerful ring to it. More than that, it fulfils two obvious electoral purposes. It avoids political discussion of what \u201cdoing Brexit\u201d might actually involve. And, more practically, it provides a phrase that can be memorised and repeated ad nauseum on rainy doorsteps and in online advertisements. After three years of Brexit debate, as the UK has tried and failed to leave the European Union, why wouldn\u2019t it strike a chord?</p> <p>What, then, is the problem? The simple answer is that it\u2019s profoundly misleading. Let\u2019s assume \u2013 and it\u2019s quite an assumption \u2013 that things go smoothly for the government. Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/oct/31/boris-johnson-general-election-gamble\" title=\"\">electoral gamble</a> pays off. He comes back on 13 December at the head of a majority government. At that point, he may still struggle to \u201cbang Brexit through\u201d by Christmas because parliament resumes sitting only on 17 December, and then there is the small matter of swearing in 650 MPs, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/queens-speech\" title=\"\">Queen\u2019s speech</a> and subsequent debate. However, with a majority, he should be able to pass his withdrawal agreement bill in order that the UK finally leaves the European Union on 31 January.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Never before has a state negotiated a (less than) free trade deal distancing itself from a major trading partner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far, so simple. Yet Brexit will at this point be far from \u201cdone\u201d. Exit will represent the end of stage one, the point at which the United Kingdom ceases to be a member state of the European Union. It then goes into an 11-month holding pattern known as transition, which expires on 31 December 2020.</p> <p>And now for some semantics. This government and its predecessor have insisted on using the phrase \u201cimplementation period\u201d to describe transition and that is the wording which appears in the bill. The reference to implementation is, to say the least, profoundly misleading. Why? Because we have absolutely nothing to implement. Instead, this period will be used for trying to sort out the future relationship between the UK and the EU.</p> <p>Researchers at the Institute for Government have provided a good guide as to how long these negotiations typically take (about four years). To summarise, when you look at recent free-trade agreements signed by the European Union, it becomes clear that an 11-month transition period is simply too short to allow for negotiation.</p> <p>It is true that the time it takes to negotiate a deal will hinge on what kind of deal the parties want. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has accepted that a \u201cbasic free-trade deal\u201d could possibly be negotiated by the end of next year. Yet this raises numerous questions. For one thing, a basic deal on tariffs would risk falling foul of EU member states worried about the danger of Britain having tariff-free access to the EU market but able to cut standards, including workers\u2019 rights. For another, the government has repeatedly claimed it is seeking a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d trade deal. One can only wonder what kind of class it has in mind.</p> <p>And the UK has a major interest in a much broader trade deal, covering services and internal security matters, such as access to EU databases, which have proved essential for combatting international crime. All of this points to the UK wanting a much more substantial and wider-ranging trade deal than the basic model. And this will take time \u2013 maybe years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cbd8e66caa217e77079f8fa60fa73ef71ba4132\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cbd8e66caa217e77079f8fa60fa73ef71ba4132/0_262_4848_2909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lorries queue up at the port of Dover\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A basic deal on tariffs would risk falling foul of EU member states worried about the danger of Britain having tariff-free access to the EU market but able to cut standards.\u2019 Lorries queue up at the port of Dover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This brings us back to the reality that 11 months of transition will simply not be enough. Which means asking for an extension. The withdrawal agreement allows for this: it provides that the joint committee of UK and EU representatives \u201cmay, before 1 July 2020, adopt a single decision extending the transition period for up to one or two years\u201d.</p> <p>Johnson has said that he will not ask for an extension to the transition period, and so many fear a new cliff edge or no-deal Brexit on 1 January 2021, as the UK leaves the transition period without a (comprehensive) trade deal. The prime minister laughs this off. The UK, he argues, is in a unique situation: it starts from a position of alignment with EU rules.</p> <p>But this is a red herring. Never before has a state negotiated a (less than) free-trade deal distancing itself from a major trading partner. And the EU will wish to scrutinise very carefully what dealignment actually means in practice. Clause by clause, chapter by chapter, the negotiations will be painstaking and time consuming. The divorce will be achieved, but the new relationship will be in limbo.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/tories-rightwing-press\">The Tories can\u2019t win without the press. This isn\u2019t how democracy works | Gary Younge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And let\u2019s think about that new deal. Unlike during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\" title=\"\">article 50</a> period, each of the EU\u2019s member states will be intimately involved, and, assuming the deal sought is an ambitious one, it is conceivable each will enjoy a veto. Expect, then, each national capital to come up with its own list of desiderata that it wants included in any future deal.

In a normal trade negotiation, there are \u201cwins\u201d with which to offset concessions. Not so here.

      "bodyText": "\u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d The phrase certainly has a powerful ring to it. More than that, it fulfils two obvious electoral purposes. It avoids political discussion of what \u201cdoing Brexit\u201d might actually involve. And, more practically, it provides a phrase that can be memorised and repeated ad nauseum on rainy doorsteps and in online advertisements. After three years of Brexit debate, as the UK has tried and failed to leave the European Union, why wouldn\u2019t it strike a chord? What, then, is the problem? The simple answer is that it\u2019s profoundly misleading. Let\u2019s assume \u2013 and it\u2019s quite an assumption \u2013 that things go smoothly for the government. Boris Johnson\u2019s electoral gamble pays off. He comes back on 13 December at the head of a majority government. At that point, he may still struggle to \u201cbang Brexit through\u201d by Christmas because parliament resumes sitting only on 17 December, and then there is the small matter of swearing in 650 MPs, and a Queen\u2019s speech and subsequent debate. However, with a majority, he should be able to pass his withdrawal agreement bill in order that the UK finally leaves the European Union on 31 January. So far, so simple. Yet Brexit will at this point be far from \u201cdone\u201d. Exit will represent the end of stage one, the point at which the United Kingdom ceases to be a member state of the European Union. It then goes into an 11-month holding pattern known as transition, which expires on 31 December 2020. And now for some semantics. This government and its predecessor have insisted on using the phrase \u201cimplementation period\u201d to describe transition and that is the wording which appears in the bill. The reference to implementation is, to say the least, profoundly misleading. Why? Because we have absolutely nothing to implement. Instead, this period will be used for trying to sort out the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Researchers at the Institute for Government have provided a good guide as to how long these negotiations typically take (about four years). To summarise, when you look at recent free-trade agreements signed by the European Union, it becomes clear that an 11-month transition period is simply too short to allow for negotiation. It is true that the time it takes to negotiate a deal will hinge on what kind of deal the parties want. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has accepted that a \u201cbasic free-trade deal\u201d could possibly be negotiated by the end of next year. Yet this raises numerous questions. For one thing, a basic deal on tariffs would risk falling foul of EU member states worried about the danger of Britain having tariff-free access to the EU market but able to cut standards, including workers\u2019 rights. For another, the government has repeatedly claimed it is seeking a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d trade deal. One can only wonder what kind of class it has in mind. And the UK has a major interest in a much broader trade deal, covering services and internal security matters, such as access to EU databases, which have proved essential for combatting international crime. All of this points to the UK wanting a much more substantial and wider-ranging trade deal than the basic model. And this will take time \u2013 maybe years. This brings us back to the reality that 11 months of transition will simply not be enough. Which means asking for an extension. The withdrawal agreement allows for this: it provides that the joint committee of UK and EU representatives \u201cmay, before 1 July 2020, adopt a single decision extending the transition period for up to one or two years\u201d. Johnson has said that he will not ask for an extension to the transition period, and so many fear a new cliff edge or no-deal Brexit on 1 January 2021, as the UK leaves the transition period without a (comprehensive) trade deal. The prime minister laughs this off. The UK, he argues, is in a unique situation: it starts from a position of alignment with EU rules. But this is a red herring. Never before has a state negotiated a (less than) free-trade deal distancing itself from a major trading partner. And the EU will wish to scrutinise very carefully what dealignment actually means in practice. Clause by clause, chapter by chapter, the negotiations will be painstaking and time consuming. The divorce will be achieved, but the new relationship will be in limbo. And let\u2019s think about that new deal. Unlike during the article 50 period, each of the EU\u2019s member states will be intimately involved, and, assuming the deal sought is an ambitious one, it is conceivable each will enjoy a veto. Expect, then, each national capital to come up with its own list of desiderata that it wants included in any future deal. And add to the fact that, because this is a deal intended to make trade harder rather than easier, we will be dealing solely with losses. In a normal trade negotiation, there are \u201cwins\u201d with which to offset concessions. Not so here. So ratification might be expected to be particularly tough. So the choice is relatively clear. Either a lengthy, and potentially rancourous, process that will belie the idea of \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d. Or a short, sharp negotiation ending with a short, thin agreement that raises the prospect of years of adjustment as the UK economy adapts to a far looser relationship with its largest and nearest trading partner. No one should think it\u2019s going to be all over anytime soon. \u2022 Anand Menon is director of the UK in a Changing Europe and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London.

The financial crash of 2007-8 seemed to mark the beginning of the most recent crisis of capitalism; 2016 brought news of a crisis of democracy, and the political and constitutional crisis created by Brexit marks its second act.

Liberal centrism has \u201cleft people behind\u201d, and in its support for free markets and globalisation, created new forms of exclusion.

It\u2019s capacious and it has adapted throughout history. From John Locke to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/john-maynard-keynes-a-great-economist-but-poor-currency-trader\" title=\"\">John Maynard Keynes</a>, liberals have prioritised the values of liberty and equality (though they\u2019ve disagreed about how much the latter matters to the former and what those values mean in everyday politics). They have supported the rule of law, rights and representation, as well as private property, markets and, for the most part, capitalism against socialism. During the cold war, liberals often defended the status quo, seeing a slide into totalitarianism behind every scheme for political change. There is a long liberal tradition of attacking the left to defend the centre. In the 1980s, a faction of Labour MPs left the party to found the SDP. In the 90s, as New Labour disciplined the party\u2019s left wing, liberalism took the form of the Third Way. Today, many liberal centrists paint Jeremy Corbyn as an extremist on a par with Boris Johnson, and draw false equivalence between left and right.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>At the end of the 1990s, there was one thing that many liberals shared: an optimism about the direction of history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet in many countries, Britain included, liberals also helped to build the welfare state and have used the machinery of central government to enact progressive reforms and benefit the poor \u2013 defending the NHS, civil and human rights, social equality, migration. Often, they aimed not to liberate workers but compromise with them, in order to minimise the risks individuals face. Social liberals have sometimes opposed economic liberals: the concern to limit inequality has trumped the defence of laissez-faire and capital markets.

Many are on the back foot, insisting that any move away from their ideas marks a step backwards into a far nastier history. Such defensiveness is not novel: liberalism has often been a negative sort of politics \u2013 a politics of second best that protects against worse scenarios. Liberals have been the first to prophesy new end times \u2013 the demise of democracy and the Pax Americana \u2013 and see in Brexit and Trump a slippery slope to war and fascism. Where conservatives look to restore a lost past, liberals defend the gradual reform of an established order and respond aggressively to any threat to it, whether real or imagined.</p> <p>All this worry about values and norms makes it possible to miss the fact that liberalism as an ideology still dominates how we see the world. It does not just occupy a place between left and right; it cuts across both.</p> <p>The liberal worldview frames politics as something that happens mostly in Westminster, and about which most voters care little, so it downplays the politics of everyday life in the home and workplace. On this view, the political realm is inhabited by powerful individuals whose decisions make a difference, and who operate in institutions that are neutral. Values conflict, but compromise is the aim \u2013 except where liberal values are deemed to be threatened; it can sometimes seem that liberals believe in the possibility of consensus, but only if the other side accept the basic facts that liberals hold as true. This can mean touting virtues in principle but refusing them in practice: the Liberal Democrats demanding compromise and cooperation while they reject a Corbyn-led coalition is a case in point.</p> <p>For liberal remainers, Brexit is either a giant misunderstanding or a mistake: it has been brought about by voters\u2019 lack of knowledge, or by party misjudgments and the rightwing media; it has been prolonged by Rasputin-like advisers (whether Dominic Cummings or Seumas Milne). Undoubtedly, centrist thinkers, with their focus on institutions and those who control them, can provide answers to important questions: how the common law relates to the constitution; how EU regulations and the referendum dilute parliamentary sovereignty. At a time when we are meant to have had enough of experts, it is ironic that expert knowledge is in extremely high demand in public institutions \u2013 in the civil service, parliament, the courts, and the press. But it\u2019s easy to mistake symptoms for causes. Though Brexit will surely have disastrous consequences \u2013 hurtling us towards a neoliberal, deregulated and depressed Britain with an empowered right on the rise \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean the liberal diagnosis tells the full story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2678baaaf1ddabb830b6c3e6f11b286db714c9ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2678baaaf1ddabb830b6c3e6f11b286db714c9ef/0_138_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) staff vote to go on strike in a dispute over pay, October 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) staff vote to go on strike in a dispute over pay, October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hampered by the need to defend the EU as a site of cosmopolitanism in the name of stopping Brexit, many remainers have framed any opposition as a threat to a political order that has no need for change. The rightward drift of the Lib Dems as they look to rebuild their vote by becoming the party of remain illustrates this bias to the status quo. For all its references to history (particularly to the totalitarian threats of the 1930s), the current liberal vision is often quite ahistorical: we don\u2019t hear much about Britain before the referendum. Even the most radical version of liberal centrism has only a partial diagnosis: it points to rising inequality and a growing generational and educational gap. Liberals may focus on defending norms, but norms themselves are only how particular political settlements are made legitimate. They don\u2019t tell us much about the limits of the settlement itself.</p> <p>The view of Brexit and Trump as a crisis of institutions, norms or civility, and the focus on the narcissism or hubris of political personalities, is too limited. The alternative is not merely to accept the narratives of the right \u2013 that Brexit is about a defence of sovereignty or kicking it to liberal elites. Both of these inhabit the conventional terms of debate. By slipping into a kneejerk defence of the status quo, we risk not understanding where the threats come from and how they can be fought. By focusing on individuals, we ignore how classes are changing. By looking to reason and forgetting ideology, we miss the pleasures of resentment and commitment, and how new political forces have developed to capitalise on those pleasures \u2013 in particular how the Conservative party has reinvigorated itself by building new class alliances and using a heady mix of Thatcherite, nationalist and colonial tropes (a strategy that is haphazard but may well prove successful).</p> <p>If we define politics too narrowly and dwell on historical parallels, we miss our own history and the social and economic changes that have paved the way to where we are now \u2013 a situation where the institutions and infrastructure of British public life are dysfunctional, where productivity, investment and wages are low, where the public sector has been hollowed out and the steady job all but disappeared. If we worry only about the breakdown of parliamentary checks-and-balances, we miss that this gives the lie to the liberal dream that certain institutions are neutral and beyond politics. When we see the rise of the right in terms of a crisis of civility, we fail to ask what resentments the veneer of civility masks, as well as who it benefits and harms. When we focus on constitutional crisis, we risk forgetting how Brexit manifests deeper disruptions and social instability \u2013 and that the coming election is also about our prospects for fixing these.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We risk forgetting how Brexit manifests deeper disruptions and social instability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These alternative diagnoses have major implications. The end of the liberal dream of neutrality opens up a view of the world where politics is found in new places \u2013 the courts, the market, the workplace, the home \u2013 and where political analysts take seriously arguments that have long been made by those outside mainstream politics, who have been marginalised by class, race, gender, geography, immigration status and age. This may be unsettling, but it can point us away from the old divisions of parliament versus the people, so easily deployed by the right and point to new battle lines: not between norms and their violation, or Brexit and its reversal, but to what we want for the future of the UK.</p> <p>Crucially, these diagnoses can also show us where the deeper political crisis lies. The lasting damage to Britain may not be caused only by the constitutional chaos, but by the long-term collapse, defunding and decay of our public institutions \u2013 the NHS, legal aid, our underfunded schools. Paradoxically, it was the stability of such institutions that made liberal centrism make sense as a way of thinking about politics. With public institutions dysfunctional and liberal democracy hollowed out, liberalism no longer looks like an ideology that can explain the world: its basis falls away. Liberal political thinking is stuck. It can no longer give a convincing account of politics, except to describe what\u2019s happening as an assault on itself. What would help liberalism make sense again is the rebuilding of those public institutions. It is an irony for liberals that this is precisely what the Labour party today is proposing.</p> <p>What is needed is a longer and wider view than the liberal vision of politics allows \u2013 one that enables us to see how social, economic and ideological changes intersect with and shape personality and procedure. This is why elements in the press have started to listen to the left once again, discussing \u201cresetting\u201d capitalism in the context of inequality and climate crisis, and engaging with talk of interests, class and ideology that has for so long been labelled as irrelevant. Now liberals also have to choose: to stay where they are and try to squeeze new developments into old paradigms, or to recognise these limits. Instead of a revival of liberalism, we might need a reckoning with it.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Katrina Forrester\u2019s In the Shadow of Justice: Postwar Liberalism and the Remaking of Political Philosophy is published by Princeton.</em></p>",

Hampered by the need to defend the EU as a site of cosmopolitanism in the name of stopping Brexit, many remainers have framed any opposition as a threat to a political order that has no need for change. The rightward drift of the Lib Dems as they look to rebuild their vote by becoming the party of remain illustrates this bias to the status quo. For all its references to history (particularly to the totalitarian threats of the 1930s), the current liberal vision is often quite ahistorical: we don\u2019t hear much about Britain before the referendum. Even the most radical version of liberal centrism has only a partial diagnosis: it points to rising inequality and a growing generational and educational gap. Liberals may focus on defending norms, but norms themselves are only how particular political settlements are made legitimate. They don\u2019t tell us much about the limits of the settlement itself. The view of Brexit and Trump as a crisis of institutions, norms or civility, and the focus on the narcissism or hubris of political personalities, is too limited. The alternative is not merely to accept the narratives of the right \u2013 that Brexit is about a defence of sovereignty or kicking it to liberal elites. Both of these inhabit the conventional terms of debate. By slipping into a kneejerk defence of the status quo, we risk not understanding where the threats come from and how they can be fought. By focusing on individuals, we ignore how classes are changing. By looking to reason and forgetting ideology, we miss the pleasures of resentment and commitment, and how new political forces have developed to capitalise on those pleasures \u2013 in particular how the Conservative party has reinvigorated itself by building new class alliances and using a heady mix of Thatcherite, nationalist and colonial tropes (a strategy that is haphazard but may well prove successful). If we define politics too narrowly and dwell on historical parallels, we miss our own history and the social and economic changes that have paved the way to where we are now \u2013 a situation where the institutions and infrastructure of British public life are dysfunctional, where productivity, investment and wages are low, where the public sector has been hollowed out and the steady job all but disappeared. If we worry only about the breakdown of parliamentary checks-and-balances, we miss that this gives the lie to the liberal dream that certain institutions are neutral and beyond politics. When we see the rise of the right in terms of a crisis of civility, we fail to ask what resentments the veneer of civility masks, as well as who it benefits and harms. When we focus on constitutional crisis, we risk forgetting how Brexit manifests deeper disruptions and social instability \u2013 and that the coming election is also about our prospects for fixing these. These alternative diagnoses have major implications. The end of the liberal dream of neutrality opens up a view of the world where politics is found in new places \u2013 the courts, the market, the workplace, the home \u2013 and where political analysts take seriously arguments that have long been made by those outside mainstream politics, who have been marginalised by class, race, gender, geography, immigration status and age. This may be unsettling, but it can point us away from the old divisions of parliament versus the people, so easily deployed by the right and point to new battle lines: not between norms and their violation, or Brexit and its reversal, but to what we want for the future of the UK. Crucially, these diagnoses can also show us where the deeper political crisis lies. The lasting damage to Britain may not be caused only by the constitutional chaos, but by the long-term collapse, defunding and decay of our public institutions \u2013 the NHS, legal aid, our underfunded schools. Paradoxically, it was the stability of such institutions that made liberal centrism make sense as a way of thinking about politics. With public institutions dysfunctional and liberal democracy hollowed out, liberalism no longer looks like an ideology that can explain the world: its basis falls away. Liberal political thinking is stuck. It can no longer give a convincing account of politics, except to describe what\u2019s happening as an assault on itself. What would help liberalism make sense again is the rebuilding of those public institutions. It is an irony for liberals that this is precisely what the Labour party today is proposing. What is needed is a longer and wider view than the liberal vision of politics allows \u2013 one that enables us to see how social, economic and ideological changes intersect with and shape personality and procedure. This is why elements in the press have started to listen to the left once again, discussing \u201cresetting\u201d capitalism in the context of inequality and climate crisis, and engaging with talk of interests, class and ideology that has for so long been labelled as irrelevant. Now liberals also have to choose: to stay where they are and try to squeeze new developments into old paradigms, or to recognise these limits. Instead of a revival of liberalism, we might need a reckoning with it. \u2022 Katrina Forrester\u2019s In the Shadow of Justice: Postwar Liberalism and the Remaking of Political Philosophy is published by Princeton.",

Patrick Harvie, the party\u2019s co-convenor, said green voters should prioritise radical action on climate, giving that equal or greater weight than Brexit or Scottish independence, by politely \u201crattling the cages\u201d of their local candidates. \u201cWe cannot afford for this to be an election where climate is seen somewhere way down the list of priorities,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe need to demand climate action.
