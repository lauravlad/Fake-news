      "body": "<p>We know that giant multinationals are engaged in industrial-scale tax avoidance. We know from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/paradise-papers\" title=\"\">Paradise</a> papers how some individuals will use every offshore trick to dodge taxes. We know that billionaires flock to Monaco to hide from any responsibility to their fellow citizens back home. But let\u2019s not deceive ourselves about who is paying which taxes and who isn\u2019t.</p> <p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs this week published an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/income-and-tax-by-gender-region-and-country-2010-to-2011?utm_source=a1d72b70-8859-48ad-8084-3acb8862925d&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=immediate\" title=\"\">analysis of the income tax paid</a> in the UK by salary band, region and gender. In total we paid \u00a3174bn income tax in 2016-17, the latest year for which figures are available. But of that, \u00a352.5bn \u2013 nearly a third of all tax raised \u2013 was paid by the 381,000 taxpayers who earn more than \u00a3150,000 a year. The tax paid by those 381,000 individuals (overwhelmingly male) was more than all the income tax paid by the first 20 million taxpayers.</p> <p>In London, the picture is even more stark. The city has 4.2 million income tax payers, but just 87,000 individuals earning over \u00a3200,000 a year paid nearly half the \u00a343.8bn income tax raised in the capital. It\u2019s uncomfortable to say it, but if we lose all those absurdly paid investment bankers to Brexit, the hit to the public purse will be painful, as they are clearly paying vast amounts to the Treasury.</p> <p>Those London bankers, lawyers and their ilk paid more income tax in 2016-17 than the entire sum raised from every income tax payer in Scotland and Wales combined.</p> <p>None of this is a plea on behalf of the rich. Scotland\u2019s income tax rates are fairer and more progressive than England\u2019s. Neither is there any case for a cut in the 45% rate paid by those earning over \u00a3150,000 \u2013 the figures suggest a chancellor would be mad to do this, given how much the 45% band earns for the Treasury.</p> <p>So how does all this tie up with the pervasive view that the rich are getting away with it, best encapsulated by New York billionaire Leona Helmsley, overheard saying: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/21/usnews\" title=\"\">Only the little people pay taxes</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The answer lies in the fact that while as a country we tax the incomes of PAYE employees relatively heavily, we leave the enormous wealth of the truly rich, much of it accumulated through property gains, largely untouched.</p> <p>The great triumph of the rich is that they have persuaded the average person to vote against taxes on wealth, such as inheritance tax, and taxes on property \u2013 such as a land valuation tax or even a properly progressive council tax. A \u00a317m mansion in Mayfair comes with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/03/council-tax-unfair-westminster\" title=\"\">a ludicrously low maximum council tax</a> bill of \u00a31,376. The phenomenal increases in its value are likely to be free from capital gains tax. Trust laws enable it to be passed through generations largely unfettered by the taxman.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the only real wealth tax in the western world, France\u2019s <em>imp\u00f4t de solidarit\u00e9 sur la fortune</em><em> </em>levied on fortunes greater than \u00a31m and introduced by the French socialists in 1981, was abolished in 2017 by President Macron. It\u2019s partly why he\u2019s earned the moniker \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d.</p> <p>Thomas Piketty, the French economist, painstakingly detailed how western societies have reverted to Victorian levels of inequality, with inheritance of wealth the main path to affluence, and he noted how the bigger the fortune is, the faster it grows. He also highlighted how wealth was far more heavily taxed in the years after the second world war \u2013 years when inequality narrowed dramatically, only to reverse when those taxes were cut.</p> <p>The solution? The sort of progressive tax on private wealth that Macron has abandoned in France, although the chances of that happening in the UK are virtually zero. Lifting the cap on council tax may be a more of a vote winner, while a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/02/scrap-council-tax-redistribute-wealth-fix-housing-market\" title=\"\">land value tax</a> \u2013 at the very least stopping the gains from planning permission going to developers rather than the public \u2013 could also be popular. In the same year that those bottom 20 million taxpayers paid \u00a350bn in income tax, the net wealth of the UK rose by <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/bulletins/nationalbalancesheet/2018\" title=\"\">nearly half a trillion pounds</a>, yet almost none of that gain was taxed. As the chancellor lines up the spring statement, the debate should not be about income tax or personal allowances, but how we reorientate the tax system to where the money really lies.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We know that giant multinationals are engaged in industrial-scale tax avoidance. We know from the Panama and Paradise papers how some individuals will use every offshore trick to dodge taxes. We know that billionaires flock to Monaco to hide from any responsibility to their fellow citizens back home. But let\u2019s not deceive ourselves about who is paying which taxes and who isn\u2019t. HM Revenue &amp; Customs this week published an analysis of the income tax paid in the UK by salary band, region and gender. In total we paid \u00a3174bn income tax in 2016-17, the latest year for which figures are available. But of that, \u00a352.5bn \u2013 nearly a third of all tax raised \u2013 was paid by the 381,000 taxpayers who earn more than \u00a3150,000 a year. The tax paid by those 381,000 individuals (overwhelmingly male) was more than all the income tax paid by the first 20 million taxpayers. In London, the picture is even more stark. The city has 4.2 million income tax payers, but just 87,000 individuals earning over \u00a3200,000 a year paid nearly half the \u00a343.8bn income tax raised in the capital. It\u2019s uncomfortable to say it, but if we lose all those absurdly paid investment bankers to Brexit, the hit to the public purse will be painful, as they are clearly paying vast amounts to the Treasury. Those London bankers, lawyers and their ilk paid more income tax in 2016-17 than the entire sum raised from every income tax payer in Scotland and Wales combined. None of this is a plea on behalf of the rich. Scotland\u2019s income tax rates are fairer and more progressive than England\u2019s. Neither is there any case for a cut in the 45% rate paid by those earning over \u00a3150,000 \u2013 the figures suggest a chancellor would be mad to do this, given how much the 45% band earns for the Treasury. So how does all this tie up with the pervasive view that the rich are getting away with it, best encapsulated by New York billionaire Leona Helmsley, overheard saying: \u201cOnly the little people pay taxes\u201d. The answer lies in the fact that while as a country we tax the incomes of PAYE employees relatively heavily, we leave the enormous wealth of the truly rich, much of it accumulated through property gains, largely untouched. The great triumph of the rich is that they have persuaded the average person to vote against taxes on wealth, such as inheritance tax, and taxes on property \u2013 such as a land valuation tax or even a properly progressive council tax. A \u00a317m mansion in Mayfair comes with a ludicrously low maximum council tax bill of \u00a31,376. The phenomenal increases in its value are likely to be free from capital gains tax. Trust laws enable it to be passed through generations largely unfettered by the taxman. Meanwhile, the only real wealth tax in the western world, France\u2019s imp\u00f4t de solidarit\u00e9 sur la fortune levied on fortunes greater than \u00a31m and introduced by the French socialists in 1981, was abolished in 2017 by President Macron. It\u2019s partly why he\u2019s earned the moniker \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d. Thomas Piketty, the French economist, painstakingly detailed how western societies have reverted to Victorian levels of inequality, with inheritance of wealth the main path to affluence, and he noted how the bigger the fortune is, the faster it grows. He also highlighted how wealth was far more heavily taxed in the years after the second world war \u2013 years when inequality narrowed dramatically, only to reverse when those taxes were cut. The solution? The sort of progressive tax on private wealth that Macron has abandoned in France, although the chances of that happening in the UK are virtually zero. Lifting the cap on council tax may be a more of a vote winner, while a land value tax \u2013 at the very least stopping the gains from planning permission going to developers rather than the public \u2013 could also be popular. In the same year that those bottom 20 million taxpayers paid \u00a350bn in income tax, the net wealth of the UK rose by nearly half a trillion pounds, yet almost none of that gain was taxed. As the chancellor lines up the spring statement, the debate should not be about income tax or personal allowances, but how we reorientate the tax system to where the money really lies.",

The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, may do a good Rumpolian turn as May\u2019s party conference warm-up act. But as a negotiator he has left an impression <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/07/british-and-eu-brexit-teams-at-cross-purposes-as-clock-ticks-on\" title=\"\">more of blustering buffoon than Brexit breakthrough legal eagle</a>.</p> <p>So where does this leave the MPs when they are asked to take part in the second meaningful vote on her deal on Tuesday?

      "bodyText": "Here we go again. Another big weekend of political speculation ahead of another big vote in parliament. Cue the TV talking heads endlessly telling us \u201cthis really is crunch time \u2026 again\u201d. Amid the noise and the millions of words said and written about Brexit, and the many interviews with ministers constantly telling us \u201cthe prime minister has been very clear about this\u201d, in truth very little is clear at all. But this much is as clear as can be: Theresa May lost the first \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on her withdrawal agreement and the accompanying political declaration by an enormous margin of defeat; and the changes she said she would fight for in further negotiations in Brussels have not been forthcoming. This time, for once, she would be right in saying \u201cnothing has changed\u201d. She won\u2019t, of course. The prime minister will hope that people and MPs are not across the detail of her deal, that with a bit of repackaging she can pretend that there has been an advance in her direction, that support can move the same way. To talk to those on the other side of the negotiation tables around Europe is to understand not only that nothing has changed, but they have not been terribly clear about the changes that were being demanded. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, may do a good Rumpolian turn as May\u2019s party conference warm-up act. But as a negotiator he has left an impression more of blustering buffoon than Brexit breakthrough legal eagle. So where does this leave the MPs when they are asked to take part in the second meaningful vote on her deal on Tuesday? This much is clear about that \u2013 those who voted against her on the first occasion are going to have to swallow an awful lot of words if they are to change their minds and join her in the lobbies. The debate ahead of that vote was quite a spectacle. I don\u2019t think I can ever recall so many government MPs making interventions in opposition to a government plan. The Irish backstop was the main reason for the opposition to her deal. But there were plenty more. And those reasons have not changed either: we know the promises made for Brexit will be broken; we know real facts about the real costs of leaving the EU; we know the deal guarantees no clarity about the future, just a crisis that goes on and on. The only thing that has changed in the debate about the deal is the date, confirming that running down the clock \u2013 and hoping MPs will be so spooked by the dangers of no deal that they support hers \u2013 is all that\u2019s left of her strategy. But MPs know that if they defeat her deal \u2013 and if they remain true to their analysis of the detail, they must \u2013 then they can vote against no deal the following day; and that if that vote is carried, they can vote for an extension of the article 50 negotiations by Thursday. That the extension was raised by the prime minister was itself a victory for those MPs and ministers who have been clear in their determination to ensure that we do not leave without a deal. Just as she once said adamantly that there would be no snap election, she had been clear that we would definitely be leaving the EU on 29 March and there would be no need for such an extension. It looks like that bold claim will be proved to be wrong, and the decision taken out of her hands. She has told MPs many, many times that the only choice facing the country is her deal or no deal. Not least because her authority has been so weakened by the process, and theirs strengthened, that they don\u2019t believe her.

The cotton shortage already meant that many mill hands faced destitution and starvation; to add to this by shunning the cotton that was there for the spinning seemed almost perverse. But despite the instruction of the mill owners (and of the Manchester Guardian, it should be said), the mill hands refused to drop their embargo against cotton from the slave-owning states. Abraham Lincoln described it as an act of \u201csublime Christian heroism, which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country\u201d.</p> <p>To see today\u2019s Brexit-voting industrial worker in a similar light is admittedly difficult, though not impossible. Many say they are prepared to be poorer in return for reduced immigration and restored sovereignty. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just leave \u2026 that\u2019s what we voted for,\u201d is the constant question from sizeable sections of the BBC\u2019s Question Time audience, sometimes in cities such as Derby where the remnants of Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry \u2013 in Derby\u2019s case <a href=\"https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/business/rolls-royce-confirms-transfer-work-2319550\" title=\"\">Rolls-Royce</a>, Bombardier, Alstom and Toyota \u2013 remind us of how the country once was.</p> <p>The mood of heedless, though not yet actual, sacrifice may not rank with Lincoln\u2019s \u201csublime Christian heroism\u201d but it probably consoles one of our leading Christian politicians, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who thinks it doesn\u2019t matter too much if it takes the British economy half a century to recover from exiting the EU. \u201cYour Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution Will Bring Us Victory\u201d, as the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7869458.stm\" title=\"\">wartime posters</a> used to say, with an unintended implication of us-and-them that anticipated Rees-Mogg in his country seat in Somerset telling his constituents in his wise and lordly way, as I have heard him do: \u201cYou don\u2019t make the poor rich by making the rich poor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f17a5e5a65888894e8d9191aaa45c1814c1cc106\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f17a5e5a65888894e8d9191aaa45c1814c1cc106/0_0_2217_1330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Crystal Ocean, one of the last ships to be launched from the Kvaerner Govan shipyard in Glasgow, in April 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Crystal Ocean, one of the last ships to be launched from the Kvaerner Govan shipyard in Glasgow, in April 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Curtis/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are nearing the end of a long process of betrayal. \u201cNever get a job where you get your hands dirty,\u201d our fathers said \u2013 or sometimes, \u201cNever get a job where you have to take off your jacket.\u201d What they meant was, \u201cDon\u2019t do as I\u2019ve done, don\u2019t go to work in overalls and clock on at 7.30am and clock off again at 4.45pm. Don\u2019t stand at a lathe all day, don\u2019t come home to tea to fall asleep in your chair at 7.30pm.\u201d Why? Because there were easier jobs; because the skilled workers of British industry attracted little admiration or interest; and because at some point during the postwar decades they sensed the game was up. So many factories were clapped out. My own father, working in a linen mill in the early 1950s, noted that the mill\u2019s newest engine dated from 1912 and its steam hammer from 1851. By 1980, its weaving sheds had been demolished and its grand Victorian offices turned into flats.</p> <p>Popular opinion held the obstinacy of the trade unions and the capricious behaviour of their members to blame. There was some truth in it. When a group of retired Clyde shipyard workers were interviewed in 1997 \u2013 30 years after the launch of the Clyde\u2019s last great liner, the QE2 \u2013 a former shop steward remembered how pig-headed they had been in the face of new working practices abroad: \u201cWe held on right to the end. No flexibility. We allowed very little. We held up progress. We were the same as Luddites.\u201d</p> <p>But the mood of us-and-them prevailed here, too. Ships had been launched in the Clyde since the early 19th century, but only at the QE2\u2019s launch in 1967 was a representative of the workers who had built the ship invited to the launch platform \u2013 an invitation so revolutionary that the shop stewards\u2019 committee needed to debate the pros and cons of accepting it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/08/celebrate-international-womens-day-why-not-join-union\">Feminism without socialism will never cure our unequal society | Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In any case, such gestures towards the cooperative spirit came too late. British industrial capitalism was in terminal decline. The closure of shipyards and textile mills could be explained in terms of their obsolescence, but now 20th-century names went too: GEC, Courtauld, Ferranti, Rootes, ICI, British Leyland. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/05/bmw-mini-cowley-no-deal-brexit-toyota\" title=\"\">Motor vehicle manufacturing</a> was saved and revived by foreign investment and management \u2013 no volume carmaker is now British-owned \u2013 and tax revenues from North Sea oil and the City of London propped up state spending on welfare.

Not least, we remember how busy the streets became at clocking-off time when people went home from work. Is it too much to speak of betrayal when this kind of town (industrial, with a Woolworths and a gothic town hall) and this class of person (industrious, locally patriotic, manually skilled) have more or less died of neglect? Has any other European country ignored or expunged them to the same extent?</p> <p>The EU didn\u2019t cause any of this.

To see today\u2019s Brexit-voting industrial worker in a similar light is admittedly difficult, though not impossible. Many say they are prepared to be poorer in return for reduced immigration and restored sovereignty. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just leave \u2026 that\u2019s what we voted for,\u201d is the constant question from sizeable sections of the BBC\u2019s Question Time audience, sometimes in cities such as Derby where the remnants of Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry \u2013 in Derby\u2019s case Rolls-Royce, Bombardier, Alstom and Toyota \u2013 remind us of how the country once was. The mood of heedless, though not yet actual, sacrifice may not rank with Lincoln\u2019s \u201csublime Christian heroism\u201d but it probably consoles one of our leading Christian politicians, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who thinks it doesn\u2019t matter too much if it takes the British economy half a century to recover from exiting the EU. \u201cYour Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution Will Bring Us Victory\u201d, as the wartime posters used to say, with an unintended implication of us-and-them that anticipated Rees-Mogg in his country seat in Somerset telling his constituents in his wise and lordly way, as I have heard him do: \u201cYou don\u2019t make the poor rich by making the rich poor.\u201d We are nearing the end of a long process of betrayal. \u201cNever get a job where you get your hands dirty,\u201d our fathers said \u2013 or sometimes, \u201cNever get a job where you have to take off your jacket.\u201d What they meant was, \u201cDon\u2019t do as I\u2019ve done, don\u2019t go to work in overalls and clock on at 7.30am and clock off again at 4.45pm. Don\u2019t stand at a lathe all day, don\u2019t come home to tea to fall asleep in your chair at 7.30pm.\u201d Why? Because there were easier jobs; because the skilled workers of British industry attracted little admiration or interest; and because at some point during the postwar decades they sensed the game was up. So many factories were clapped out. My own father, working in a linen mill in the early 1950s, noted that the mill\u2019s newest engine dated from 1912 and its steam hammer from 1851. By 1980, its weaving sheds had been demolished and its grand Victorian offices turned into flats. Popular opinion held the obstinacy of the trade unions and the capricious behaviour of their members to blame. There was some truth in it. When a group of retired Clyde shipyard workers were interviewed in 1997 \u2013 30 years after the launch of the Clyde\u2019s last great liner, the QE2 \u2013 a former shop steward remembered how pig-headed they had been in the face of new working practices abroad: \u201cWe held on right to the end. No flexibility. We allowed very little. We held up progress. We were the same as Luddites.\u201d But the mood of us-and-them prevailed here, too. Ships had been launched in the Clyde since the early 19th century, but only at the QE2\u2019s launch in 1967 was a representative of the workers who had built the ship invited to the launch platform \u2013 an invitation so revolutionary that the shop stewards\u2019 committee needed to debate the pros and cons of accepting it. In any case, such gestures towards the cooperative spirit came too late. British industrial capitalism was in terminal decline. The closure of shipyards and textile mills could be explained in terms of their obsolescence, but now 20th-century names went too: GEC, Courtauld, Ferranti, Rootes, ICI, British Leyland. Motor vehicle manufacturing was saved and revived by foreign investment and management \u2013 no volume carmaker is now British-owned \u2013 and tax revenues from North Sea oil and the City of London propped up state spending on welfare. But the results of deindustrialisation have been profound, and are unlikely to be changed by Theresa May\u2019s scheme to spend \u00a31.6bn over the next seven years on the most depressed and Europhobic towns in the Midlands and the north. Some places seem to have no point to them. We remember their public libraries, cinemas and shops, their pubs, dance halls, Methodist chapels and Workers\u2019 Educational Association evening classes. Not least, we remember how busy the streets became at clocking-off time when people went home from work. Is it too much to speak of betrayal when this kind of town (industrial, with a Woolworths and a gothic town hall) and this class of person (industrious, locally patriotic, manually skilled) have more or less died of neglect? Has any other European country ignored or expunged them to the same extent? The EU didn\u2019t cause any of this. But the absence of trade unionists from the anti-Brexit cause owes a lot to the feeling of working-class alienation that began to grow then: that politicians are all the same, that nothing can be done, and that you might as well not bother. \u2022 Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist",
