The idea that Labour can be restored as one big, happy family that will produce social justice once Brexit is \u201cgot over with\u201d is a hopeless delusion. Ms De Piero admits that the problems of people in run-down constituencies such as hers \u201cwere not created by being in the EU and won\u2019t be solved by leaving it\u201d, and she can hardly be unaware that most economists consider that places like Ashfield will be the most adversely impacted by the economic downturn that leaving will produce. She rightly says that Labour has a moral duty to represent the interests of working-class people but does not explain how this justifies tacitly endorsing the self-harm that Brexit represents for all except the wealthy rightwingers who have led the project.</p> <p>It may be true that Labour cannot win outright without winning in constituencies such as Ashfield, but even less can Labour win by alienating the vast majority of its members and supporters.

If a future Tory government offered the country a referendum on capital punishment \u2013 not too far-fetched when looking at some of the members of the ERG \u2013 and the country, along with her own constituency, voted narrowly in favour, would she want a Labour party to back the majority vote?<br><strong>Irene Waddell</strong><br><em>Harrogate, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Lisa Nandy\u2019s concerns exemplify Labour\u2019s difficulties in adopting the necessary new direction signalled by the European election results (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/20/brexit-britain-labour-remain-european-elections-leave-voters\" title=\"\">We abandon loyalists at our peril, warns Nandy</a>, 29 May). However, even in Wigan, the figures suggest the increase in the combined Brexit party/Ukip vote derived much more from Tory than Labour defectors, the bulk of whom are likely to have supported remain parties and might well return to Labour with a change of policy.</p> <p>In addition to clear analysis of the likely electoral consequences in each constituency of such a change, a method is required to resolve the competing pressures within the party. Formal consultation or a special conference would take considerable time to organise, but an indicative online membership ballot, of the type proposed by Jeremy Corbyn to democratise policymaking, but never implemented, could be relatively quick. A Brexit ballot could re-energise the party and in the event, for example, of substantial backing for Labour\u2019s pre-referendum policy of \u201cremain and reform\u201d, could be a real game changer, which the leadership would ignore at its peril.<br><strong>Dr Anthony Isaacs</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I thought Martha Gill (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/28/farage-tories-brexiteer-gove-johnson-showdown\" title=\"\">Journal</a>, 28 May) summed up the situation around Brexit remarkably accurately: the Tories are landed with the harsh reality of delivering an extremely complex, possibly impossible, task rooted in an ideal which is \u201cpurist, anti-institution and scornful of compromise\u201d.</p> <p>What she and other commentators neglect to examine is the degree to which those calling for another referendum, or the annulment of article 50, are also purist and scornful of compromise.

Levels of vitamin D deficiency are high in the UK, and this is likely to impact on the nation\u2019s long-term bone health, with an increase in childhood rickets and adult bone disease. Vitamin D cannot be easily obtained from diet, so sunlight and supplements are the main options to address deficiencies.

      "bodyText": "A Labour peer claimed almost \u00a350,000 in attendance and travel expenses covering every single day the House of Lords was sitting last year, despite never speaking or asking any written questions, a Guardian investigation reveals. The former trade union general secretary David Brookman was among dozens of other lords and baronesses who never took part in a single debate, while almost a third of the 800 peers barely participated in parliamentary business over a 12-month period despite costing almost \u00a33.2m in allowances. The details have emerged from a new analysis of public data that will raise fresh questions about the size and effectiveness of the Lords, and the funds that can be claimed by those who fail to regularly contribute. The findings show: Eighty-eight peers \u2013 about one in nine - never spoke, held a government post or participated in a committee at all. Forty-six peers did not register a single vote, including on Brexit, sit on a committee or hold a post. One peer claimed \u00a325,000 without voting, while another claimed \u00a341,000 but only voted once. More than 270 peers claimed more than \u00a340,000 in allowances, with two claiming more than \u00a370,000. The former Lords speaker Frances D\u2019Souza, a long-term advocate of reform, said the findings corroborated \u201cwhat everyone suspects is going on\u201d, and that a minority of peers risked discrediting the hard work of their colleagues. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a need to reduce numbers,\u201d Lady D\u2019Souza said, adding that the research \u201cclearly shows there are people who are attending the House of Lords who are not contributing, and therefore they are simply redundant\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s analysis covers the attendance, participation and allowances claims of 785 lords serving for a full year between 2017 and 2018.

But attendance data alone can be misleading because some peers rarely or never participate in parliamentary business despite attending frequently.

      "bodyText": "The gallery of the Lords chamber offers a bird\u2019s-eye view over the red benches and their occupants, and an insight into the anachronisms of the UK\u2019s second chamber. There is no John Bercow to bring order or to select a member\u2019s turn to speak during oral questions. Instead, peers who wish to participate in a debate must stand and shout: \u201cMy Lords! My Lords!\u201d until they are acknowledged by their contemporaries. Members are unelected, gaining their seats either by virtue of prime ministerial nomination or by having inherited their seat through lineage, although numbers in the latter category have shrunk considerably in recent years due to reforms, and the practice could soon be abolished altogether. The principal role of the House of Lords is to conduct line-by-line examinations of proposed legislation, to prevent errors from creeping into law, or ministers granting themselves sweeping powers unnoticed. But as Brexit leads the UK deeper into political crisis, all the normal business of parliament has dried up, leaving the Lords largely bereft of legislation to examine. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos, really,\u201d said the former Lord speaker Frances D\u2019Souza. \u201cEverything\u2019s on hold because of the B-thing, and nobody knows what to do. The businesspeople don\u2019t know how to put business forward, and whether they should start or stop, or when the state opening is going to be.\u201d Dianne Hayter, a former chair of the Labour party, points to the dozens of reports published by the Lords\u2019 EU committee as an example of the best of the upper chamber\u2019s work. Like much of what goes on there, it can be painstaking and tedious. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get it in your paper, because no one\u2019s interested,\u201d Lady Hayter said. \u201cThey looked very early on at what would happen if we left without a deal, they looked at very detailed stuff: what it meant for agriculture, what it meant for consumers, what it meant for competition policy.\u201d Sir Patrick Cormack, a Conservative MP of 40 years, appointed to the Lords by David Cameron, agreed: \u201cOur scrutiny does tend to be much more thorough than the House of Commons, where a bill is timetabled \u2026 our scrutiny does have the benefit of peers having a vast range of experience.\u201d Because peers are appointed for life and in proportion broadly reflect the composition of the Commons, the chamber tends to continually increase in size and can be unrepresentative. Currently, one in eight peers is a Liberal Democrat, far exceeding their representation in the Commons. While there is widespread recognition that some of the 92 current hereditary peers are work hard, Lady D\u2019Souza said the practice of inherited seats should end. \u201cThe principle that someone should come to this house by virtue of the fact of who they were born to is unacceptable in the 21st century,\u201d she said. When a hereditary peer retires or dies, the remainder elect a replacement from a pool of eligible aristocrats in a byelection. A private member\u2019s bill that would end the practice is currently making its way through the house. Lord Cormack, who describes hereditary byelections as \u201cludicrous\u201d, is supporting the bill. \u201cThe last time we had a Liberal Democrat [hereditary byelection], there were more candidates than voters,\u201d he said. There have previously been concerns that some peers were appointed because they made large donations to political parties. Twelve years ago, the so-called cash-for-honours scandal resulted in Tony Blair being interviewed by police after it was alleged that some Labour donors had been nominated for peerages. The chamber continues to be under tremendous pressure to reform, with Nigel Farage last week threatening to abolish it entirely. All major political parties have promised reform in successive manifestos, but the issue has never gathered momentum. D\u2019Souza suggests that ultimately the strain of the political crisis enveloping the UK could end up being the catalyst for overdue reform. \u201cWith any luck, what this might mean is that things get so bad that they have to get better.\u201d",

He also said he would do whatever was necessary to stop a no-deal Brexit, which could include working with Conservative moderates to bring the government down. \u201cFaced with the threat of no deal and a prime minister with no mandate, the only way out of the Brexit crisis ripping our country apart is now to go back to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cLet the people decide the country\u2019s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament. For Labour any outcome has to work for our whole country, not just one side of this deliberately inflamed divide.\u201d Labour\u2019s preference is still for a general election but Corbyn\u2019s tone on a second referendum shifted earlier this week to say he would back a poll on any deal. The move came after Labour fell to third place in the European elections on just 14% of the vote, losing ground to both the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. In contrast, Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, is campaigning for Labour to get fully behind a second referendum. He released the results of a survey suggesting that the vast majority of Labour members who replied wanted an all-member ballot to decide on whether to change the party\u2019s Brexit policy. \u201cThe results of my Brexit poll are clear: 84% of Labour members and supporters who took the survey want an all-member ballot to decide our party\u2019s Brexit policy. As deputy leader I\u2019ll support them to make this happen,\u201d he said. In response to Corbyn\u2019s interview, the Labour MP Wes Streeting, who is campaigning for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for Jeremy Corbyn to stop wriggling and start leading. The overwhelming majority of Labour members and Labour voters now know that giving the public the final say on Brexit is the only way to deliver a lasting and stable conclusion to this crisis. \u201cIf the simple fact that continued ambiguity on Brexit is badly damaging our party wasn\u2019t clear enough already, the disastrous results of the European elections for Labour should have rammed it home. Our vote share sunk to historic lows, it was arguably the worst ever election result for the Labour party in its modern form. And by a margin of more than four to one Labour voters were flocking to parties that give unequivocal backing for a final-say referendum rather than Nigel Farage\u2019s party.\u201d On the other side of the debate, the shadow cabinet ministers Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett have opposed a second referendum, along with Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite. McCluskey told ITV\u2019s Peston: \u201cMy message to the Labour party is don\u2019t be spooked by these Euro elections.\u201d",

His ruling that MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/18/brexit-john-bercow-rules-out-third-meaningful-vote-on-same-deal\" title=\"\">could not vote on the same thing twice</a> \u2013 but could vote on the same amendments repeatedly \u2013 meant the government\u2019s timetable for bringing the various meaningful votes had to be redrafted. Members of government believe that this meant they lost momentum at a crucial juncture.</p> \n<p>Now Bercow looks set to cause Theresa May\u2019s successor problems, too. Speaking from the US, he told the Guardian that he had no plans to stand down this summer as previously reported. \u201cI do feel that now is a time in which momentous events are taking place and there are great issues to be resolved and in those circumstances, it doesn\u2019t seem to me sensible to vacate the chair.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, Bercow used his speech that night at the Brookings Institution in Washington to say the idea \u2013 as some Brexiter candidates have mooted \u2013 that the government could force through a no-deal Brexit without parliament having a say was \u201cfor the birds\u201d. \u201cThe idea that parliament is going to \u2026 be evacuated from the centre-stage of the debate on Brexit is unimaginable. It is simply unimaginable.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"60ef0767-b2e5-478c-a358-c6e670cacee5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nf3PbdgMzIk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This throws a spanner in the works of the leadership pitches of Brexiter candidates Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson. Both have said they believe they can push through a UK exit from the EU on World Trade Organization terms without parliament\u2019s say if it was necessary. They know that parliament is opposed to no deal, so if there is a vote it won\u2019t pass. Bercow\u2019s latest intervention plays into the hands of candidates like Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock \u2013 who have warned pursuing a no deal would be stopped by parliament and would therefore lead to an early election, which could be catastrophic for the Tories.</p> \n<p>Given that the vast majority of MPs \u2013 and nearly all Labour MPs \u2013 are opposed to a hard Brexit, don\u2019t expect to see Bercow\u2019s latest move leading to him coming under any Commons pressure. The role of Speaker is meant to be an impartial one, yet the perception that Bercow is partial on Brexit is what is currently keeping him in more secure employment than most of his colleagues can dream of.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"269d39fe-c504-4c53-a175-c1f64e8437fe\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Speaker is the chief officer and the highest authority in the House of Commons.

It concluded that officials including Bercow should consider standing down.</p> \n<p>Usually this type of conclusion would be something the Labour party would go on the attack on \u2013 standing up for the junior staff who have suffered harassment in the workplace from figures in positions of authority, including comments about their appearance, inappropriate touching and bullying behaviour. Only, many Labour MPs took a different view of the report\u2019s finding in light of Bercow\u2019s perceived stance in favour of the EU. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/16/john-bercow-to-stand-down-as-commons-speaker-in-wake-of-bullying-inquiry\" title=\"\">As Margaret Beckett put it</a>, \u201cthe most difficult decision we\u2019ve made for hundreds of years trumps bad behaviour\u201d.</p> \n<p>But before the likes of Beckett celebrate Bercow\u2019s extended reign and the trouble it could cause the Brexiters, they would be wise to consider the longer implications of keeping Bercow in a role that was meant to be neutral. After all, there\u2019s a chance that this new tradition sticks. While pro-EU MPs may reap the benefits for now, they may well hum a different tune if it eventually leads to a Speaker who leans the other way.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor</p>",

However, they can all get behind some good, old-fashioned John Bercow bashing. Ministers report that the only good cabinet meetings these days are those where they can go around slagging off the House of Commons Speaker over his latest \u2013 aggravating \u2013 decision on Brexit. So Bercow\u2019s announcement that he has no plans to step down this summer \u2013 or in the foreseeable \u2013 will be generally ill received in the Tory party. When it comes to the challenges any Conservative leader faces delivering Brexit, the Speaker ranks in the top three \u2013 alongside a hung parliament and Brussels\u2019 reluctance to renegotiate. In the past few months, Bercow\u2019s decisions on Brexit \u2013 at times seemingly inconsistent \u2013 have been blamed by the government for making an uphill task of delivering Brexit even harder. His ruling that MPs could not vote on the same thing twice \u2013 but could vote on the same amendments repeatedly \u2013 meant the government\u2019s timetable for bringing the various meaningful votes had to be redrafted. Members of government believe that this meant they lost momentum at a crucial juncture. Now Bercow looks set to cause Theresa May\u2019s successor problems, too. Speaking from the US, he told the Guardian that he had no plans to stand down this summer as previously reported. \u201cI do feel that now is a time in which momentous events are taking place and there are great issues to be resolved and in those circumstances, it doesn\u2019t seem to me sensible to vacate the chair.\u201d On the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, Bercow used his speech that night at the Brookings Institution in Washington to say the idea \u2013 as some Brexiter candidates have mooted \u2013 that the government could force through a no-deal Brexit without parliament having a say was \u201cfor the birds\u201d. \u201cThe idea that parliament is going to \u2026 be evacuated from the centre-stage of the debate on Brexit is unimaginable. It is simply unimaginable.\u201d This throws a spanner in the works of the leadership pitches of Brexiter candidates Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson. Both have said they believe they can push through a UK exit from the EU on World Trade Organization terms without parliament\u2019s say if it was necessary. They know that parliament is opposed to no deal, so if there is a vote it won\u2019t pass. Bercow\u2019s latest intervention plays into the hands of candidates like Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock \u2013 who have warned pursuing a no deal would be stopped by parliament and would therefore lead to an early election, which could be catastrophic for the Tories. Given that the vast majority of MPs \u2013 and nearly all Labour MPs \u2013 are opposed to a hard Brexit, don\u2019t expect to see Bercow\u2019s latest move leading to him coming under any Commons pressure. The role of Speaker is meant to be an impartial one, yet the perception that Bercow is partial on Brexit is what is currently keeping him in more secure employment than most of his colleagues can dream of. Despite facing serious bullying allegations in the past year, Bercow remains in place. A report, led by Dame Laura Cox, found the current leadership in parliament were incapable of changing a widespread culture of bullying and harassment. It concluded that officials including Bercow should consider standing down. Usually this type of conclusion would be something the Labour party would go on the attack on \u2013 standing up for the junior staff who have suffered harassment in the workplace from figures in positions of authority, including comments about their appearance, inappropriate touching and bullying behaviour. Only, many Labour MPs took a different view of the report\u2019s finding in light of Bercow\u2019s perceived stance in favour of the EU. As Margaret Beckett put it, \u201cthe most difficult decision we\u2019ve made for hundreds of years trumps bad behaviour\u201d. But before the likes of Beckett celebrate Bercow\u2019s extended reign and the trouble it could cause the Brexiters, they would be wise to consider the longer implications of keeping Bercow in a role that was meant to be neutral. After all, there\u2019s a chance that this new tradition sticks. While pro-EU MPs may reap the benefits for now, they may well hum a different tune if it eventually leads to a Speaker who leans the other way. \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor",
