      "bodyText": "Labour is braced for a showdown over whether to back a referendum on any Brexit deal when the party\u2019s governing body meets to agree its draft European elections manifesto on Tuesday. Party sources suggested Labour was likely to agree a compromise option where it would support a referendum in order to prevent Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal or leaving without a deal, describing that wording as \u201cthe path of least resistance\u201d. However, a public drive for a stronger line has been led by the party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who has urged remain-supporting members to write to the national executive committee\u2019s members, including Jeremy Corbyn. More than 100 Labour MPs have written to NEC members to argue that Labour should use the election to campaign for a second referendum in any circumstances and more than 20 Labour MEP candidates have pledged to back a referendum and then campaign to remain in the EU. On Monday, the Labour MPs behind the parliamentary drive for a confirmatory referendum on Brexit also wrote to the NEC urging it to use the European elections to campaign for a fresh poll regardless of whether a deal has been reached with the government. The manifesto, drafted by Labour\u2019s policy chief, Andrew Fisher, is expected to be presented to NEC members on Tuesday. A source close to the NEC said they expected a compromise would be reached which would commit the party to campaign for a referendum to stop a \u201cTory Brexit\u201d and leave open the possibility of a fresh poll in other circumstances. \u201cThat would not prevent MPs attaching a referendum as a condition on any Brexit deal that comes to parliament,\u201d the party source said. Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, who have drafted an amendment to any future binding Brexit vote that would commit MPs to passing May\u2019s withdrawal deal subject to a public vote, said that option had the most popular support in the party. In their letter to the NEC on Monday the pair wrote that it was \u201can opportunity to hold the Tory government to account on its botched approach to Brexit\u201d. The letter said a confirmatory ballot was supported by 203 Labour MPs, including 110 from seats that had a majority leave vote three years ago and had been whipped by the Labour frontbench when MPs took part in indicative votes in parliament. \u201cIf a \u2018deal\u2019 is implemented without first going to the people for confirmation, then in the months and years ahead, the public will have a right to say: \u2018This isn\u2019t the Brexit I voted for,\u2019\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe public wants Brexit to be over. They are looking to the Labour party to resolve this Brexit crisis. The way to resolve this crisis is in a confirmatory ballot with the facts of the deal before the British people.\u201d Watson\u2019s efforts to persuade NEC members to back his bid for a more explicit endorsement of a referendum have been backed by several key members but also sparked a public backlash. Jon Lansman, an NEC member and the founder of the leftwing grassroots group Momentum, said the party\u2019s conference motion on Brexit had agreed that any Tory deal should be put to a public vote. However, another NEC member, Claudia Webbe, accused Watson of being divisive. \u201cSupporting Jeremy Corbyn &amp; the Labour party to achieve this to kick out the Tories should be your focus,\u201d she tweeted. A letter from MPs and MEPs calling for a public vote on any Brexit deal, organised by the Love Socialism, Hate Brexit group, reached 118 signatures on Monday night, meaning the majority of non-shadow cabinet MPs have now signed the letter, including key Corbyn allies Clive Lewis and Kate Osamor. The group\u2019s co-founder, Lloyd Russell-Moyle, the MP for Brighton Kemptown, said: \u201cOur letter shows that this isn\u2019t about any single faction in the Labour party.

Party sources said they expected GMB to be one of the strongest voices at the meeting arguing in favour of a second referendum in any circumstances. The TSSA general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said the party should \u201cact on the overwhelming wishes of its members and voters by pledging to support a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal\u201d.

Now, in my view that has been very simply because the Conservatives have spotted a gap in the market that Labour have left \u2013 pro-union, pro-reform \u2026</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked if he was referring to reform of the public services, he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes. A weakness in the SNP\u2019s position and a weakness in Labour\u2018s position. And therefore you\u2019ve literally got a situation where the leader of the Conservative party in Scotland has brought the party into what, roughly, second place in the polls.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Theresa May was wrong to say that Brexit was being blocked because MPs were opposed to it in principle. </strong>He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Part of the trouble that has happened for the public is that the public has just been told that parliament is standing in the way of Brexit. And it has suited the prime minister for a long period of time to play on this in order to bounce her deal through parliament in order to mobilise public opinion supposedly against an obstructive parliament stopping the will of the people. But what that has done, is it has said to the public, \u2018Look, Brexit is just there to be done but, you know, these members of parliament don\u2019t want to do it.\u2019 Which is absolutely the opposite of the case.</p> <p>The truth is there are different varieties of Brexit and you have to choose one. And when you choose one it then becomes apparent what your problem is. Because your problem is there is a downside to whatever option you choose.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said MPs would only back a second referendum on Brexit when they realised that was the only way to avoid responsibility for a bad decision.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My point is very simple: you won\u2019t ever get to another referendum unless it\u2019s clear to parliament that they don\u2019t want to take responsibility fully for the Brexit choice. If you force them to make that choice \u2026 I think they will say, \u2018OK, this is what I think but you have the final say\u2019.</p> <p>Because whatever choice you make\u2026 if you become like Norway it\u2019s obvious what your problem is. You\u2019re just a rule taker. If you decide you\u2019re Turkey, it\u2019s obvious what your problem is. The Turkey customs union situation would be a ridiculous thing for Britain to agree to, frankly. Or if you go to Canada, well it\u2019s obvious what your problem is \u2013 business is going to say, \u2018Ok, you can do that but it\u2019s going to be severe disruption\u2019, the financial service people will say, \u2018Well, ok, there\u2019s going to be significant job losses.\u2019 All of that. Those are your choices.</p> <p>So when members of parliament are forced to come to a choice then I think at that point they will say, \u2018Ok, this what I think but I\u2019m not going to take the full responsibility so I\u2019m going to share responsibility with the people\u2019, and that allows a referendum to be a healing process. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Brexit could increase the pressure in Northern Ireland for Irish reunification.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The republican community in Northern Ireland is always in favour of a united Ireland \u2026but the nationalist community is in favour at a theoretical level, at a conceptual level, but the degree of their agitation for it is intimately connected with their perception as to whether they can achieve nationalist aspirations and the legitimatisation of nationalist feelings within the United Kingdom.</p> <p>If Brexit acts as a destructive force on that, then it will encourage within the nationalist community, and even within parts of the more liberal unionist community, a feeling towards a border poll that just wasn\u2019t present during the years that I was in office.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said people were \u201cunderestimating\u201d how hard it would be for the UK union to survive after Brexit. </strong>Brexit would fuel separatism in Scotland and Northern Ireland, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Are there still pressures for secession? Well, in Scotland, yes, but I still think they won\u2019t succeed unless Brexit pushes us into a position where that kind of gets Scottish independence over the line \u2013 if you have hard Brexit, which is possible. And in Northern Ireland, without Brexit I would be very confident that the Union would stick together but again Brexit is an issue there. I don\u2019t think there is a strong move for independence in Wales.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/instituteforgov/status/1122878343685263360\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">[NEW] <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> places the Union of the United Kingdom at risk, with politicians \u201cunderestimating the struggle\u201d \u2013 read our interview with former Prime Minister Tony Blair on devolution, Brexit and the future of the Union <a href=\"https://t.co/K865PY5s1e\">https://t.co/K865PY5s1e</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/g5ZPXfN3pI\">pic.twitter.com/g5ZPXfN3pI</a></p>&mdash; Institute for Gov (@instituteforgov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/instituteforgov/status/1122878343685263360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 29, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-29T17:10:50.128Z\">at 6.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cc71e248f08c89bd906aa2d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-29T16:00:47.180Z\">5.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ruth Davidson says UK government should block second Scottish independence referendum</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ruth Davidson,</strong> the Scottish Tory leader, has said the next Tory prime minister should continue to oppose a second Scottish independence referendum, and refuse to authorise one.</p> <p>In her first political interview to mark her return from maternity leave, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-48093908\">Davidson told BBC Scotland </a>she would want the UK government to block a new referendum for the foreseeable future \u2013 a stance already taken by Theresa May.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll say no, and this prime minister and the next prime minister should say so too,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sturgeon reiterated her call for a second referendum before 2021 at the Scottish National party\u2019s spring conference at the weekend, when she also suggested the vote could be held late next year.</p> <p>Pointing to opinion polls showing a slight rise in the yes vote to 47% and 49% over the weekend, Sturgeon said that if support surged because of a no-deal Brexit or the arrival of unpopular new Tory prime minister, then \u201cno Westminster government can ever stand in the way of Scotland\u2019s right to choose\u201d.</p> <p>Sturgeon has floated the idea that Boris Johnson\u2019s arrival as prime minister could lead to a significant bounce in support for independence. The polls show only about a fifth of Scottish voters currently want a new referendum in the next two years.</p> <p>Davidson is a noted critic of Johnson, but she told the BBC any of May\u2019s successors should hold the line. Davidson returns from maternity leave after the birth of her son Finn this Friday, when she hosts the Scottish Tory conference in Aberdeen. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nicola Sturgeon doesn\u2019t agree with Nicola Sturgeon on this. Not only is she going back on the Edinburgh agreement that she signed [with David Cameron in 2012], where she said she would respect the result for a generation, the test she put down for any future referendum before the last election would be that the majority of Scots would want it.</p> <p>The majority of Scots don\u2019t want this, and if they need a voice to stand up to Nicola Sturgeon, I will be that voice.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davidson admitted that watching the chaotic and tortuous Brexit process takes place from home left her thinking it \u201clooks like a bit of a mess\u201d.

Duncan Smith is one of the many Brexiters who believe the backstop is unnecessary because \u201calternative arrangements\u201d could ensure the need for no hard border in Ireland after Brexit. After he made this point on the programme, Lamy told him this was \u201cpie in the sky\u201d. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With respect, I was director general of the World Trade Organisation for eight years, which has something to do with customs procedures. And this notion that exiting the internal market implies no border is pie in the sky. There is no way you can exit the internal market without a border. </p> </blockquote> <p>Duncan Smith said alternative arrangements worked perfectly well at a port like Rotterdam. They inspect less than 2% of imports, and not at the border, he said. He said he had witnessed this himself, and he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality is technology now means the idea of barriers and borders is long gone. </p> </blockquote> <p>But Lamy, again, told him he was wrong. This is how the conversation continued.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong><em>PL:</em></strong> I\u2019m sorry, this is a total confusion .... between the internal market and the customs union. The customs union is about tariffs, goods. The internal market is about regulation. If you want to diverge ... you have to accept that there will be a border because we, the EU, have to control things which abide by different regulatory requirements.</p> <p><strong><em>IDS: </em></strong>Of course, but you would work on the principle of two things. First is equivalence ...</p> <p><strong><em>PL: </em></strong>Equivalence is not a magic wand.</p> <p><strong><em>IDS: </em></strong>No, it\u2019s not, but take what New Zealand does with the EU. New Zealand is not a member of the EU. It is not a member of the single market. Its food stuffs are not inspected here because, why? They trust and agree that in New Zealand the inspections that bring their standards right are at the same level or better than that of the EU. And they agree that that is done at the point of departure. They are not done at the border. So the idea of this being a border point is completely incorrect.</p> <p><strong><em>PL:</em></strong> No, no, no, it is not completely incorrect, I\u2019m sorry. I agree, if you want trade to flow as nicely as possible, many customs procedures have to be moved upstream. But you still need a border to check that this is the case. </p> <p><strong><em>IDS: </em></strong>The border is not the point.</p> <p><strong><em>PL:</em></strong> Of course it is.</p> <p><strong><em>IDS: </em></strong>The border is a notional process that is about equivalence and agreement, not specific border checks.</p> <p><strong><em>PL: </em></strong>Equivalence is not a magic wand. You only accept equivalence if you trust, and if your collective preferences are harmonised. I agree, for instance, on beer, there is nothing that really says how you produce beer in the European Union. There is beer in Belgium and in Bavaria and in Scotland, and if beer is good for Scotland, it is good for Bavaria. Now, that is okay. It is not going to be okay about general food, or about chlorinated poultry. I\u2019m sorry about that. We will not accept GMO food. If - I don\u2019t know whether or not - if you want to accept chlorinated poultry or GMO food, there will be a border, and costs at the border.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lamy\u2019s hand gestures were even more expressive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1122837292211527680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Former WTO director general Pascal Lamy does not look impressed with Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith talking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/politicslive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#politicslive</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bhZ5P8BI7h\">https://t.co/bhZ5P8BI7h</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CugnvDuWwo\">pic.twitter.com/CugnvDuWwo</a></p>&mdash; BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1122837292211527680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 29, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7482928f440cb19a093979e41e692b8059e74ee9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7482928f440cb19a093979e41e692b8059e74ee9/86_0_1113_668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Duncan Smith (left) and Pascal Lamy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain Duncan Smith (left) and Pascal Lamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-29T14:31:39.207Z\">at 3.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cc6e2388f08d5e277b56d58\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-29T11:44:26.994Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Kezia Dugdale to quit as MSP to take job running John Smith Centre for Public Service</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yesterday my colleague<strong> Severin Carrell </strong>reported that<strong> Kezia Dugdale</strong>, the former Scottish Labour leader, was about to announce that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/28/kezia-dugdale-set-to-leave-politics-over-labour-brexit-stance\"> she will resign from the Scottish parliament to take a job outside politics.</a></p> <p>Dugdale has now released a statement confirming this.

It was not hugely informative, but this was probably the best line.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Downing Street effectively confirmed that the next Queen\u2019s speech has been postponed. </strong>The last Queen\u2019s speech, setting out the government\u2019s legislative agenda, was in June 2017, with the session of parliament due to last two-years, because of Brexit, instead of the usual one year. That meant a new Queen\u2019s speech had been due this summer. But at the lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman refused to say when the next one would be. And he confirmed that the government wanted to get the EU withdrawal agreement bill, \u201cpart of the current Queen\u2019s speech cycle\u201d, through parliament first. But he could not even say when that bill would be introduced.</li> </ul> <p>The question about the Queen\u2019s speech was prompted by this story from <strong>Francis Elliott </strong><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/may-to-delay-queens-speech-byclogging-up-commons-with-bills-bvs6fgclp\">in today\u2019s Times (paywall). </a>It starts:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Theresa May is scrambling to find legislation to keep MPs busy over the summer so that she can delay a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-is-may-delaying-the-queens-speech-and-what-does-it-mean-scg5m0q75\">potentially fatal Queen\u2019s Speech</a> until the autumn.</p> <p>The parliamentary session is already on course to be the longest in postwar history but the prime minister lacks the authority to start a new term.</p> <p>Passing a Queen\u2019s speech is a minimum constitutional requirement of a viable government.

Brexit came up, of course, but on other topics (Shamima Begum and government secrecy) Rees-Mogg revealed his inner Guardian reader.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rees-Mogg criticised Sajid Javid, the home secretary\u2019s decision to strip Shamima Begum of her British citizenship.</strong> And he said it was right that Begum, who left the UK as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State in Syria, should be receiving legal aid. He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have been very concerned about the removal of her citizenship. I think she is a British responsibility. And I believe that she is correctly given legal aid, that we have a principle of innocence until proved guilty in this country and I think that taking away a passport by purely administrative act, with no judicial oversight, is not just.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rees-Mogg told the caller who asked about this issue that on this he was at odds with the views of most of his colleagues. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You are assuming that I have the views that most Eurosceptics and most Conservatives do have. But this is one of the views I don\u2019t have in common with a lot of people I agree with on other things. </p> <p>I believe that a British citizenship ought to be protected, and that means that you have the full protection of the law. And if you have committed an offence, you can be charged. But you are our responsibility, not Bangladesh\u2019s responsibility.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/15/jeremy-corbyn-defends-shamima-begum-right-to-legal-aid\"><strong>Jeremy Corbyn </strong>has also said that it is right for Begum to get legal aid,</a> but generally Conservative MPs have found it much harder to defend this decision. For example, <strong>Jeremy Hunt,</strong> the foreign secretary, said that although Begum was entitled to legal aid,<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/15/authorities-knew-shamima-begum-groomed-didnt-tell-family-ex/\"> this was something that made him personally \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Rees-Mogg defended the leak of the national security council decision about the government planning to let Huawei play a role in building parts of the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure and he criticised the government\u2019s response to what happened. </strong>He told the programme:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When politicians talk about criminal inquiries, it usually means they have done something wrong and they want to cover it up. The whole story here is not about a leak. It is about whether or not we are getting into bed with a Chinese company, Huawei, against the advice of the US and the Australians who have decided not to. This is a fundamental issue of national security. It is really, really important at that level. Whether somebody mentioned it in passing and leaked it is trivial in comparison.</p> <p>This is not, in terms of the leak, about national security. It is about national security in terms of the decision.</p> <p>And what worries me is that the cabinet secretary [Sir Mark Sedwill], who is getting very excited about the leak, is focusing on the wrong issue.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the leak was in the national interest. </strong>When it was put to him that people should not leak from the national security council, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You can\u2019t say that everything in a meeting is of the same level of security. Some things are, and some things aren\u2019t. Some things are made public. We didn\u2019t used to know who the head of MI5 was, or MI6. It all used to be kept very quiet. Now the government wields them out when it is convenient .... They use the secret services as part of the propaganda machine when convenient. And when it\u2019s something they don\u2019t like, suddenly it\u2019s national security and people can have two years in prison.</p> <p>Knowing that we are doing this with Huawei is really important, potentially an issue of deep national security. And, actually the fact that we know that is a good thing, and the journalist who reported it deserves an award for journalistic endeavour.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said sometimes leaking secrets could be justified.</strong> Asked if it was acceptable to leak secrets, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it\u2019s obviously okay to leak some secrets. That must be true. Think of all the secrets given to Winston Churchill in the 1930s, in relation to re-armament in Germany and the speed of aircraft production in Germany, which were incredibly useful in answering the appeasers, and of course which the government then was very against. Because the government doesn\u2019t like secrets that are embarrassing to it being revealed.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Rees-Mogg criticised <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/seize-ministers-phones-and-email-records-in-huawei-leak-inquiry-says-former-cabinet-secretary-a4127276.html\">reports that cabinet ministers will be asked to surrender their phones as part of the inquiry.</a></strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t approve of cabinet minsters being told to hand over their telephones. I think in this country we have a principle that you are innocent until proved guilty. And that making widespread investigation, without evidence on specific figures, seems to me to be wrong. And cabinet ministers deserve similar protections to everyone else.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if he would hand over his phone for an inquiry like this if he were a cabinet minister, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would instinctively refuse. I don\u2019t think the cabinet secretary has the right. He does not have police powers. And I don\u2019t think our senior political figures should be treated in this way. They are privy counsellors. They have take oaths of loyalty to the Queen ... The police can investigate. The police have different powers. But the cabinet secretary is not a constable.

We haven\u2019t had any proper leadership, it\u2019s been indecisive and weak, and we\u2019ve been led by the nose by the European Union. That\u2019s not what these elections are about. And it would be very sad if very good councillors lost because of Brexit-related muddle.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he said he was not convinced that this was realistic.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a slightly pious hope because we know that people in elections vote more on national than on local issues.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He dismissed suggestions that a massive defeat for the Tories in the election could force Theresa May out of office. </strong>When this was put to him, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, the rules of the Conservative party are that she is in place and there cannot be a vote against her until December, and the prime minister is very capable of staying in post.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He defended the decision of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee last week not to change the rules to allow an early no confidence vote in May</strong>.

This has not happened.</p> <p>They are also very unhappy with the tactics and antics of Westminster politicians, for example, taking no deal off the table, indicative votes and really I think it\u2019s fair to say the sort of anti-democratic way in which the House of Commons has behaved against the referendum mandate.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in a column <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/04/28/major-parties-across-europe-dying-unless-deliver-brexit-tories/\">in the Daily Telegraph (paywall)</a> this morning, <strong>John Redwood</strong>, another Brexiter, says the failure to deliver Brexit will harm his party.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many voters feel let down by both main parties, who promised to take us out of the EU but who have conspired to keep us in for longer.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, has said Theresa May is wrong to claim that Brexit is being blocked because MPs are opposed to it. (See 5.29pm.) A senior union official has said that Jeremy Corbyn will face a fierce backlash if Labour\u2019s national executive committee does not propose a referendum on any Brexit deal agreed before the next general election, ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reports. A US official has said the UK and any other western countries that adopt Huawei technology for 5G mobile phone networks risk affecting intelligence cooperation with the United States. Momentum, the youth climate strikers and Extinction Rebellion are to unite in protest outside parliament on Wednesday as Labour calls on the Conservatives to declare an environmental emergency in a parliamentary vote. A senior Conservative party official has been accused of racism after writing that an Italian-born constituency chairman was untrustworthy because \u201chis political culture is more in keeping with Sicily than Southsea\u201d. More than 2,500 prison staff have been subject to disciplinary action in the last five years, including for relationships with inmates, assaulting prisoners and racism, the Guardian can reveal, as the government prepares to launch a unit to tackle corruption in jails. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, have given an interesting interview to the Institute for Government on devolution and Brexit which has just been published. Here are the main points. Blair said Labour was responsible for the revival of the Conservatives in Scotland because they left a gap in the market. He said: The most interesting development in Scotland has been the decline of the Labour party and the resurgence of the Conservative party. Now, in my view that has been very simply because the Conservatives have spotted a gap in the market that Labour have left \u2013 pro-union, pro-reform \u2026 When asked if he was referring to reform of the public services, he went on: Yes. A weakness in the SNP\u2019s position and a weakness in Labour\u2018s position. And therefore you\u2019ve literally got a situation where the leader of the Conservative party in Scotland has brought the party into what, roughly, second place in the polls. He said Theresa May was wrong to say that Brexit was being blocked because MPs were opposed to it in principle. He explained: Part of the trouble that has happened for the public is that the public has just been told that parliament is standing in the way of Brexit. And it has suited the prime minister for a long period of time to play on this in order to bounce her deal through parliament in order to mobilise public opinion supposedly against an obstructive parliament stopping the will of the people. But what that has done, is it has said to the public, \u2018Look, Brexit is just there to be done but, you know, these members of parliament don\u2019t want to do it.\u2019 Which is absolutely the opposite of the case. The truth is there are different varieties of Brexit and you have to choose one. And when you choose one it then becomes apparent what your problem is. Because your problem is there is a downside to whatever option you choose. He said MPs would only back a second referendum on Brexit when they realised that was the only way to avoid responsibility for a bad decision. He said: My point is very simple: you won\u2019t ever get to another referendum unless it\u2019s clear to parliament that they don\u2019t want to take responsibility fully for the Brexit choice. If you force them to make that choice \u2026 I think they will say, \u2018OK, this is what I think but you have the final say\u2019. Because whatever choice you make\u2026 if you become like Norway it\u2019s obvious what your problem is. You\u2019re just a rule taker. If you decide you\u2019re Turkey, it\u2019s obvious what your problem is. The Turkey customs union situation would be a ridiculous thing for Britain to agree to, frankly. Or if you go to Canada, well it\u2019s obvious what your problem is \u2013 business is going to say, \u2018Ok, you can do that but it\u2019s going to be severe disruption\u2019, the financial service people will say, \u2018Well, ok, there\u2019s going to be significant job losses.\u2019 All of that. Those are your choices. So when members of parliament are forced to come to a choice then I think at that point they will say, \u2018Ok, this what I think but I\u2019m not going to take the full responsibility so I\u2019m going to share responsibility with the people\u2019, and that allows a referendum to be a healing process. He said Brexit could increase the pressure in Northern Ireland for Irish reunification. He said: The republican community in Northern Ireland is always in favour of a united Ireland \u2026but the nationalist community is in favour at a theoretical level, at a conceptual level, but the degree of their agitation for it is intimately connected with their perception as to whether they can achieve nationalist aspirations and the legitimatisation of nationalist feelings within the United Kingdom. If Brexit acts as a destructive force on that, then it will encourage within the nationalist community, and even within parts of the more liberal unionist community, a feeling towards a border poll that just wasn\u2019t present during the years that I was in office. He said people were \u201cunderestimating\u201d how hard it would be for the UK union to survive after Brexit. Brexit would fuel separatism in Scotland and Northern Ireland, he said: Are there still pressures for secession? Well, in Scotland, yes, but I still think they won\u2019t succeed unless Brexit pushes us into a position where that kind of gets Scottish independence over the line \u2013 if you have hard Brexit, which is possible. And in Northern Ireland, without Brexit I would be very confident that the Union would stick together but again Brexit is an issue there. I don\u2019t think there is a strong move for independence in Wales. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, has said the next Tory prime minister should continue to oppose a second Scottish independence referendum, and refuse to authorise one. In her first political interview to mark her return from maternity leave, Davidson told BBC Scotland she would want the UK government to block a new referendum for the foreseeable future \u2013 a stance already taken by Theresa May. \u201cI\u2019ll say no, and this prime minister and the next prime minister should say so too,\u201d she said. Sturgeon reiterated her call for a second referendum before 2021 at the Scottish National party\u2019s spring conference at the weekend, when she also suggested the vote could be held late next year. Pointing to opinion polls showing a slight rise in the yes vote to 47% and 49% over the weekend, Sturgeon said that if support surged because of a no-deal Brexit or the arrival of unpopular new Tory prime minister, then \u201cno Westminster government can ever stand in the way of Scotland\u2019s right to choose\u201d. Sturgeon has floated the idea that Boris Johnson\u2019s arrival as prime minister could lead to a significant bounce in support for independence. The polls show only about a fifth of Scottish voters currently want a new referendum in the next two years. Davidson is a noted critic of Johnson, but she told the BBC any of May\u2019s successors should hold the line. Davidson returns from maternity leave after the birth of her son Finn this Friday, when she hosts the Scottish Tory conference in Aberdeen. She said: Nicola Sturgeon doesn\u2019t agree with Nicola Sturgeon on this. Not only is she going back on the Edinburgh agreement that she signed [with David Cameron in 2012], where she said she would respect the result for a generation, the test she put down for any future referendum before the last election would be that the majority of Scots would want it. The majority of Scots don\u2019t want this, and if they need a voice to stand up to Nicola Sturgeon, I will be that voice. Davidson admitted that watching the chaotic and tortuous Brexit process takes place from home left her thinking it \u201clooks like a bit of a mess\u201d. Given that, all sides needed to compromise more and secure a cross-party deal, she said. My message to colleagues both in my party and others is now is the time, instead of sticking in your trenches and hoping everyone moves to you, is to take that first step forward and start that compromise that clearly needs to happen. If the country is going to come together, it does require politicians to come together first. At the weekend BuzzFeed reported that the government is planning to charge EU students the same tuition fees as those paid by non-EU international students from 2021-22, rather than the lower fees paid by UK students as now. BuzzFeed said, although the plans had not been finalised, the intention was for EU students to pay the higher fees whether or not there was a Brexit deal. In the Commons Chris Skidmore, an education minister, has been answering an urgent question on this. In his initial statement he did not deny the story, although he insisted that no final decision had been taken. He told MPs: Discussions at cabinet level are ongoing and should remain confidential. I will make no comment on this apparent leak, which is deeply regrettable. But, as the session went on, Skidmore implied that EU students would lose their special status. He said: The economic importance of our HE [higher education] sector is reflected in the need to attract EU students, but also students from across the globe. And this is at the crux of the matter here. We want to ensure that we going forward, as a country and as a nation, are attractive internationally .... When it comes to our negotiations - I\u2019ve spoken to around 15 European higher education ministers - we need to make sure that we commit to them that Britain remains an attractive place to come and work and study for all nations across the world. Guy Verfhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, has written to Theresa May expressing deep concerns about the plans. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. Here is Julian Smith, the government chief whip, arriving at the Cabinet earlier this afternoon for the latest round of Brexit talks with Labour. He is part of the government delegation, along with David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Gavin Barwell, the PM\u2019s chief of staff. And here is the Labour team arriving. Extinction Rebellion (XR) says it is holding a meeting later today with Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, followed by a meeting tomorrow morning with Michael Gove, the environment secretary. Ministers from other departments will also attend. The group is also due to hold separate talks with John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, at some point tomorrow. Ahead of the Gove meeting, which XR says it will film for release to the public, Sam Knights, a member of its political strategy team, said: The legacy of our political leaders will stand or fall by what they do now. Either they take steps to give our children the future they deserve or they do nothing. They must respond to the climate and ecological emergency with the clarity and urgency our children demand. In order to protect life on earth, the UK government must begin to tell the truth. The British people need to know the reality of what we face. It is time to declare a climate and ecological emergency and to commit to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. The current political system is not capable of implementing such fundamental changes to the way we live. That is why we need the creation of a national citizens\u2019 assembly on climate and ecological justice. Downing Street has effectively confirmed that the ongoing Brexit deadlock has led to the next Queen\u2019s speech being postponed. A new Queen\u2019s speech, introducing a new session of parliament, had been expected early this summer, but the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told reporters this morning that the government wanted to get the EU withdrawal agreement bill, \u201cpart of the current Queen\u2019s speech cycle\u201d, through parliament first. He said: What we are focused on is the withdrawal agreement bill [WAB], because that is the legislation which is necessary in order to ratify our withdrawal from the EU. That is part of the current Queen\u2019s speech cycle and we need to finish that work. The spokesman also confirmed that a team from the government, led by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, will meet a Labour team this afternoon for the latest round of talks in the attempt to reach a cross-party compromise on Brexit. This is the main forum where the talks have been taking place. The spokesman said that the discussions so far have been serious and that it was possible that the working groups, which have been looking at issues like workers\u2019 rights and the environment, could meet again later this week. But he also said that there were no plans for Theresa May to meet Jeremy Corbyn, and he refused to say how long the government would wait before concluding that the two sides will not be able to reach agreement. The Labour MPs behind the parliamentary drive for a confirmatory referendum on Brexit have written to their party\u2019s governing body urging it to use the European elections to campaign for a fresh poll regardless of whether a deal has been reached with the government. Victims of rape and serious sexual assault who refuse to give police access to their mobile phone contents could allow suspects to avoid charges, two top officials have said. Asked if the government backed the plans to ask victims to surrender their phones, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists: We want victims to have the confidence to come forward and report crimes knowing that they will get the support they need and that everything will be done to bring offenders to justice. Clearly, this is a complex area and, while disclosure is an important component of the criminal justice system, to ensure a fair trial, the police have acknowledged that the use of personal data in criminal investigations is a source of anxiety and that they understand the need to balance a respect for privacy with the need to pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry. The police and the CPS will work with victims and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office to ensure that the right approach is being taken. Each police force will also conduct its own impact assessment of the forms as they are rolled out. Pascal Lamy, the former head of the World Trade Organisation, has dismissed Brexiter claims about how alternative customs arrangements could avoid the need for a hard border in Ireland after Brexit as \u201cpie in the sky\u201d. (See 1.34pm.) The leading Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has defended the leak of the national security council decision about the government planning to let Huawei play a role in building parts of the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure, saying it was in the national interest. (See 11.01am.) Social care provision should be modelled on the state pension, with taxpayers funding a flat-rate \u201cuniversal care entitlement\u201d, which patients could supplement from their own funds, according to former Conservative cabinet minister Damian Green. On the BBC\u2019s Politics Live earlier this afternoon Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter and former party leader, had a debate about post-Brexit border controls with Pascal Lamy, the former head of the World Trade Organisation. Duncan Smith is one of the many Brexiters who believe the backstop is unnecessary because \u201calternative arrangements\u201d could ensure the need for no hard border in Ireland after Brexit. After he made this point on the programme, Lamy told him this was \u201cpie in the sky\u201d. He said: With respect, I was director general of the World Trade Organisation for eight years, which has something to do with customs procedures. And this notion that exiting the internal market implies no border is pie in the sky. There is no way you can exit the internal market without a border. Duncan Smith said alternative arrangements worked perfectly well at a port like Rotterdam. They inspect less than 2% of imports, and not at the border, he said. He said he had witnessed this himself, and he went on: The reality is technology now means the idea of barriers and borders is long gone. But Lamy, again, told him he was wrong. This is how the conversation continued. PL: I\u2019m sorry, this is a total confusion .... between the internal market and the customs union. The customs union is about tariffs, goods. The internal market is about regulation. If you want to diverge ... you have to accept that there will be a border because we, the EU, have to control things which abide by different regulatory requirements. IDS: Of course, but you would work on the principle of two things. First is equivalence ... PL: Equivalence is not a magic wand. IDS: No, it\u2019s not, but take what New Zealand does with the EU. New Zealand is not a member of the EU. It is not a member of the single market. Its food stuffs are not inspected here because, why? They trust and agree that in New Zealand the inspections that bring their standards right are at the same level or better than that of the EU. And they agree that that is done at the point of departure. They are not done at the border. So the idea of this being a border point is completely incorrect. PL: No, no, no, it is not completely incorrect, I\u2019m sorry. I agree, if you want trade to flow as nicely as possible, many customs procedures have to be moved upstream. But you still need a border to check that this is the case. IDS: The border is not the point. PL: Of course it is. IDS: The border is a notional process that is about equivalence and agreement, not specific border checks. PL: Equivalence is not a magic wand. You only accept equivalence if you trust, and if your collective preferences are harmonised. I agree, for instance, on beer, there is nothing that really says how you produce beer in the European Union. There is beer in Belgium and in Bavaria and in Scotland, and if beer is good for Scotland, it is good for Bavaria. Now, that is okay. It is not going to be okay about general food, or about chlorinated poultry. I\u2019m sorry about that. We will not accept GMO food. If - I don\u2019t know whether or not - if you want to accept chlorinated poultry or GMO food, there will be a border, and costs at the border. Lamy\u2019s hand gestures were even more expressive. Yesterday my colleague Severin Carrell reported that Kezia Dugdale, the former Scottish Labour leader, was about to announce that she will resign from the Scottish parliament to take a job outside politics. Dugdale has now released a statement confirming this. And she has announced that she is leaving Holyrood to become director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service at Glasgow University. Explaining her move Dugdale said: I have devoted my working life to public service, and this is an incredibly exciting new opportunity for me to lead the work of the John Smith Centre. Throughout my career I have taken on tough and challenging tasks, and my next task is to rebuild faith in our politics. Disruptive events and the rise of populism has led to increasingly polarised and emotional politics where rational, evidence-based thinking has lost its standing.\u201cFaith in public service, politics and the political process has to be restored and that progress must be sustainable. John Smith said \u2018the opportunity to serve our country - that is all we ask\u2019. It will be an honour to build on his legacy and inspire his values of public service in a new generation. More on tomorrow\u2019s meeting of Labour\u2019s national executive committee. This is from Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum, the pro-Corbyn Labour organisation, and a member of the party\u2019s national executive committee. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. It was not hugely informative, but this was probably the best line. Downing Street effectively confirmed that the next Queen\u2019s speech has been postponed. The last Queen\u2019s speech, setting out the government\u2019s legislative agenda, was in June 2017, with the session of parliament due to last two-years, because of Brexit, instead of the usual one year. That meant a new Queen\u2019s speech had been due this summer. But at the lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman refused to say when the next one would be. And he confirmed that the government wanted to get the EU withdrawal agreement bill, \u201cpart of the current Queen\u2019s speech cycle\u201d, through parliament first. But he could not even say when that bill would be introduced. The question about the Queen\u2019s speech was prompted by this story from Francis Elliott in today\u2019s Times (paywall). It starts: Theresa May is scrambling to find legislation to keep MPs busy over the summer so that she can delay a potentially fatal Queen\u2019s Speech until the autumn. The parliamentary session is already on course to be the longest in postwar history but the prime minister lacks the authority to start a new term. Passing a Queen\u2019s speech is a minimum constitutional requirement of a viable government. Cabinet sources admit that the bill that implements Brexit is the last significant piece of legislation in the locker. Mrs May dare not introduce it, however, as she fears that it will be rejected by MPs, forcing her to end the session. Instead, Downing Street has drawn up a list of relatively benign legislation to justify extending the session beyond the original two-year deadline due in June. It includes bills to change the tax treatment of sporting testimonials and increase the maximum sentences for cases of animal cruelty. Others under consideration in No 10 include measures to address domestic abuse and increase tenants\u2019 rights. My colleague Rowena Mason wrote something similar earlier this month. The Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg hosted his LBC phone-in earlier. Brexit came up, of course, but on other topics (Shamima Begum and government secrecy) Rees-Mogg revealed his inner Guardian reader. Here are the main points. Rees-Mogg criticised Sajid Javid, the home secretary\u2019s decision to strip Shamima Begum of her British citizenship. And he said it was right that Begum, who left the UK as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State in Syria, should be receiving legal aid. He explained: I have been very concerned about the removal of her citizenship. I think she is a British responsibility. And I believe that she is correctly given legal aid, that we have a principle of innocence until proved guilty in this country and I think that taking away a passport by purely administrative act, with no judicial oversight, is not just. Rees-Mogg told the caller who asked about this issue that on this he was at odds with the views of most of his colleagues. He said: You are assuming that I have the views that most Eurosceptics and most Conservatives do have. But this is one of the views I don\u2019t have in common with a lot of people I agree with on other things. I believe that a British citizenship ought to be protected, and that means that you have the full protection of the law. And if you have committed an offence, you can be charged. But you are our responsibility, not Bangladesh\u2019s responsibility. Jeremy Corbyn has also said that it is right for Begum to get legal aid, but generally Conservative MPs have found it much harder to defend this decision. For example, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said that although Begum was entitled to legal aid, this was something that made him personally \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d. Rees-Mogg defended the leak of the national security council decision about the government planning to let Huawei play a role in building parts of the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure and he criticised the government\u2019s response to what happened. He told the programme: When politicians talk about criminal inquiries, it usually means they have done something wrong and they want to cover it up. The whole story here is not about a leak. It is about whether or not we are getting into bed with a Chinese company, Huawei, against the advice of the US and the Australians who have decided not to. This is a fundamental issue of national security. It is really, really important at that level. Whether somebody mentioned it in passing and leaked it is trivial in comparison. This is not, in terms of the leak, about national security. It is about national security in terms of the decision. And what worries me is that the cabinet secretary [Sir Mark Sedwill], who is getting very excited about the leak, is focusing on the wrong issue. He said the leak was in the national interest. When it was put to him that people should not leak from the national security council, he said: You can\u2019t say that everything in a meeting is of the same level of security. Some things are, and some things aren\u2019t. Some things are made public. We didn\u2019t used to know who the head of MI5 was, or MI6. It all used to be kept very quiet. Now the government wields them out when it is convenient .... They use the secret services as part of the propaganda machine when convenient. And when it\u2019s something they don\u2019t like, suddenly it\u2019s national security and people can have two years in prison. Knowing that we are doing this with Huawei is really important, potentially an issue of deep national security. And, actually the fact that we know that is a good thing, and the journalist who reported it deserves an award for journalistic endeavour. He said sometimes leaking secrets could be justified. Asked if it was acceptable to leak secrets, he said: Well, it\u2019s obviously okay to leak some secrets. That must be true. Think of all the secrets given to Winston Churchill in the 1930s, in relation to re-armament in Germany and the speed of aircraft production in Germany, which were incredibly useful in answering the appeasers, and of course which the government then was very against. Because the government doesn\u2019t like secrets that are embarrassing to it being revealed. Rees-Mogg criticised reports that cabinet ministers will be asked to surrender their phones as part of the inquiry. He said: And I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t approve of cabinet minsters being told to hand over their telephones. I think in this country we have a principle that you are innocent until proved guilty. And that making widespread investigation, without evidence on specific figures, seems to me to be wrong. And cabinet ministers deserve similar protections to everyone else. Asked if he would hand over his phone for an inquiry like this if he were a cabinet minister, he said: I would instinctively refuse. I don\u2019t think the cabinet secretary has the right. He does not have police powers. And I don\u2019t think our senior political figures should be treated in this way. They are privy counsellors. They have take oaths of loyalty to the Queen ... The police can investigate. The police have different powers. But the cabinet secretary is not a constable. He does not have that warrant. Rees-Mogg said that Robert Hayward\u2019s claims that the Tories could lose 800 seats in the local elections (see 9.34am) were \u201crealistic\u201d. Talking about his own experience out campaigning for the locals, he said: I got the feeling that quite a number of people are staying with us, but quite a number of people are probably going to stay at home. He said he agreed with Boris Johnson in urging people not to use the local elections to vote on Brexit. (See 9.34am.) He said: People, I hope, will think as they go to the polling stations that this is about their council tax, it is about their bin collection, it is about their road maintenance. It\u2019s not about Brexit. I completely understand why people are fed up with the Tories over Brexit. We haven\u2019t had any proper leadership, it\u2019s been indecisive and weak, and we\u2019ve been led by the nose by the European Union. That\u2019s not what these elections are about. And it would be very sad if very good councillors lost because of Brexit-related muddle. But he said he was not convinced that this was realistic. It is a slightly pious hope because we know that people in elections vote more on national than on local issues. He dismissed suggestions that a massive defeat for the Tories in the election could force Theresa May out of office. When this was put to him, he replied: Well, the rules of the Conservative party are that she is in place and there cannot be a vote against her until December, and the prime minister is very capable of staying in post. He defended the decision of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee last week not to change the rules to allow an early no confidence vote in May. He said: I was sympathetic to the decision not to change the rules. We are British, after all, and changing the rules half way through never looks particularly fair. That does not exclude the prime minister deciding of her own accord that the time is up. I\u2019m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. Back to the local elections, and Jeremy Corbyn has been tweeting about them too. Like Boris Johnson (see 9.34am), he is urging people to vote on local issues, not on Brexit. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot and the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar on what might happen when Labour\u2019s national executive committee meets tomorrow to decide what to say about a referendum in the party\u2019s manifesto for the European elections. Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary and a leading candidate to replace Theresa May, has used his column in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) this morning to offer a counter view. He says that he has been out campaigning for the local elections and that he has heard how angry people are about Brexit. But he thinks people will, and should, vote on local issues, he says. I have rung bells, patted dogs, admired wisteria, wolfed samosas \u2013 and in return I have been given some pretty frank opinions about the state of politics. I have come to a tentative conclusion. This may be too optimistic, and I may be proved wrong \u2013 but I am starting to think that people can make a crucial distinction at this election on May 2. Whatever they may think about what is going on at Westminster \u2013 and our current dismal failure to leave the EU \u2013 they can see that there is no point in taking out their frustrations on effective and hard-working Tory councillors. Johnson\u2019s view is not shared by other Conservatives. Here is the Sunday Express headline from yesterday. That may look like hyperbole and expectation management, but, as my colleague Heather Stewart reports, the psephologist and Tory peer Robert Hayward is saying the Conservatives could lose 800 seats at the local elections on Thursday. Hayward is respected as an expert in this field, and he has no interest in making predictions that turn out to look foolish. Unfortunately the Telegraph article does not make it clear whether Johnson\u2019s claim that the Tories will do better that expected in the local elections represents his serious, considered view or whether this is another example of Johnson being \u201cclearly comically polemical\u201d in a way that \u201ccould not be reasonably read as a serious, empirical, in-depth analysis of hard factual matters\u201d - to quote the Telegraph\u2019s own description of his journalism, in a statement to the Independent Press Standards Organisation in response to a complaint (upheld) about Johnson making a false claim about Brexit polling in a column earlier this year. It is 29 April. A month ago today was the day when the UK was supposed to leave the EU. A month on, not only is the UK still a fully signed-up member, but the government is no closer than it was to finding a Brexit outcome that has any chance of passing parliament. This ought to be a cause of outright panic at Westminster but in recent days the Brexit conversation has gone reasonably quiet and, reportedly, that is partly because Conservatives have been told to pipe down on this subject in the run-up to the local elections on Thursday. According to Glen Owen and Harry Cole in the Mail on Sunday yesterday: Downing Street aides are also urging all ministers and MPs to avoid the airwaves to \u2018bang on about Brexit\u2019 in the next four days \u2013 or face being blamed for worsening an expected local elections drubbing on Thursday. A No 10 source said: \u2018Word has gone out to shut up for a few days. There is a direct correlation between us arguing on television and people getting fed up, so we are hoping to avoid that on the eve of the polls.\u2019 But not every Tory has got the memo. On the BBC\u2019s Westminster Hour last night, Priti Patel, the Brexiter former international development secretary, said the party would do badly at the locals because of the failure to deliver Brexit. She explained: I think without a doubt that frustration is there. I have heard it myself. I\u2019ve experienced it both with my council candidates and when I\u2019ve been on the doorstep \u2026 The mood is dark. The public are frustrated. They are fed up I think more widely with politics and the way in which Brexit has been handled and in particular the fact that, as many people say to me in my constituency, they expected us to leave effectively on the 29th of March. This has not happened. They are also very unhappy with the tactics and antics of Westminster politicians, for example, taking no deal off the table, indicative votes and really I think it\u2019s fair to say the sort of anti-democratic way in which the House of Commons has behaved against the referendum mandate. And in a column in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) this morning, John Redwood, another Brexiter, says the failure to deliver Brexit will harm his party. Many voters feel let down by both main parties, who promised to take us out of the EU but who have conspired to keep us in for longer. The polling for the European elections shows Labour and the Conservatives on a combined 37 per cent or so, under half their level of support of less than two years ago. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP and chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories who want a harder Brexit, holds his LBC phone-in. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. Afternoon: Talks resume between Labour and the government in the search for a Brexit compromise. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here.

If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

      "body": "<p>As pressure builds on Labour\u2019s NEC to endorse a confirmatory referendum in its European election manifesto (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/28/local-elections-2019-where-are-the-key-battlegrounds\" title=\"\">Explainer: What\u2019s happening on Thursday</a>, 29 April) too little thought is being given to what the referendum question should be. Yet this issue is crucial to achieving a settled outcome on which national reconciliation and reform can be built. The desire of each side of the Brexit argument to achieve its preferred outcome has led to the current impasse and obscured the importance of achieving the right process. The issue of Brexit can only be laid to rest by a process which can command the acceptance of a significant proportion of UK citizens \u2013 otherwise we are doomed to rerun it again and again.</p> <p>Four principles should underpin this process \u2013 it must involve the people, because only a people\u2019s vote can supplant the 2016 referendum result; it must allow most people to feel that their preferred option has been properly considered; it must lead to an outcome that can be enacted forthwith, avoiding further painful wrangling; and it must be decisive. A people\u2019s vote with the only three immediately implementable options on the ballot paper \u2013 remain in the EU, May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and leave with no deal \u2013 conducted using preferential voting (1,2,3) and with a threshold of 60% on the first count meets these requirements.</p> <p>This is what Labour, and all those who want to see the UK move on from Brexit, should not only campaign on but enact through legislation as soon as possible.<br><strong>Dr Gregory Connor</strong><br><em>Chesterfield, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 If there are two chief reasons why Labour members supported a new leadership four years ago, it was surely that, firstly, power was often seen to be being pursued at the expense of principle and, secondly, that the views of its members were no longer being listened to, in spite of much vaunted consultation processes. The prospect of Labour going into the European elections with a manifesto that fudges or denies the promise of a confirmatory referendum (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/28/labour-hints-at-backing-brexit-deal-without-promise-of-referendum\" title=\"\">Labour hints at backing Brexit deal without a new vote promise</a>, 29 April) against the wishes of the majority of its membership, in order to placate its leave-voting heartlands (where Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party will no doubt inflict damage anyway) risks a mass party exodus on a scale not seen since the invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>Better to stick to its principles, retain the support of a younger pro-European generation, and use a general election to expose the policy deficiencies of the single-issue Brexit party to the electorate.<br><strong>Paul Dolan</strong><br><em>Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 In recent weeks I have been attempting, through personal contact and local networking sites, to get as many EU citizens as possible to register to vote here in the European elections. As they are sometimes unclear about how to vote to register their remain or second referendum sympathies, I have had to point out that the Greens, Lib Dems and Change UK are the only unequivocally remain parties on offer. As a Labour party member, I have added, more in hope than expectation, that Labour too could yet come out clearly for a confirmatory vote in their manifesto.</p> <p>But if Labour fails to include a firm commitment which respects the wishes of the vast majority of its members then I shall advise local EU citizens to take their votes elsewhere as I, and millions of others, will be doing. Though advocating a vote for other parties lays me open to expulsion from the party this is an eventuality which, after three years of frustration at Labour\u2019s utter lack of direction on the domestic issue of the age, would conveniently save me the trouble of resigning.<br><strong>Mike Hine</strong><br><em>Kingston upon Thames</em></p> <p>\u2022 England is in a mess (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/28/england-mess-scotland-splitting-away\" title=\"\">Scotland\u2019s case for splitting away is easier to make than ever</a>, 29 April) and as a Labour party member residing in Wales, let me be clear to the leadership; I am a European socialist foremost and, as Plaid Cymru calls for a referendum on EU membership, let me be clear to the NEC and Jeremy Corbyn. Labour has to offer the people and above all our young people a clear mandate on a second referendum; if not, for many in Wales our European identity will lie in Welsh independence within Europe. Corbyn needs to find some clarity that the Labour party has to preserve the British state if it wishes for government, for it is Celtic fringe MPs that are crucial to his bid for power.<br><strong>Peter Hack</strong><br><em>Presteigne, Powys</em></p> <p>\u2022 There are two simple messages for Labour leavers in the deprived north: your trials and tribulations are not the fault of the EU but of the disastrous austerity policies of the Tory government. And second: if we leave the EU, your economic blight will be made worse, not better. If only Mr Corbyn could be persuaded to proclaim these truths, loud and clear, the Labour party need have no hesitation in endorsing a second referendum.<br><strong>Michael Franklin</strong><br><em>Barnet, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 As Labour members and trade unionists, we urge our party to embrace the European elections as an opportunity to promote socialist politics in Britain and across Europe. This should include an explicit commitment to a public vote on any Brexit deal, with an option to remain. We want policies for a radical transformation of Britain and Europe. This could include: an end to austerity, and restoration and levelling up of services across Europe; an international green new deal to allow an emergency, socially just climate transition plan; defence of free movement combined with a European migration policy that welcomes migrants;

      "bodyText": "As pressure builds on Labour\u2019s NEC to endorse a confirmatory referendum in its European election manifesto (Explainer: What\u2019s happening on Thursday, 29 April) too little thought is being given to what the referendum question should be. Yet this issue is crucial to achieving a settled outcome on which national reconciliation and reform can be built. The desire of each side of the Brexit argument to achieve its preferred outcome has led to the current impasse and obscured the importance of achieving the right process. The issue of Brexit can only be laid to rest by a process which can command the acceptance of a significant proportion of UK citizens \u2013 otherwise we are doomed to rerun it again and again. Four principles should underpin this process \u2013 it must involve the people, because only a people\u2019s vote can supplant the 2016 referendum result; it must allow most people to feel that their preferred option has been properly considered; it must lead to an outcome that can be enacted forthwith, avoiding further painful wrangling; and it must be decisive. A people\u2019s vote with the only three immediately implementable options on the ballot paper \u2013 remain in the EU, May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and leave with no deal \u2013 conducted using preferential voting (1,2,3) and with a threshold of 60% on the first count meets these requirements. This is what Labour, and all those who want to see the UK move on from Brexit, should not only campaign on but enact through legislation as soon as possible. Dr Gregory Connor Chesterfield, Derbyshire \u2022 If there are two chief reasons why Labour members supported a new leadership four years ago, it was surely that, firstly, power was often seen to be being pursued at the expense of principle and, secondly, that the views of its members were no longer being listened to, in spite of much vaunted consultation processes. The prospect of Labour going into the European elections with a manifesto that fudges or denies the promise of a confirmatory referendum (Labour hints at backing Brexit deal without a new vote promise, 29 April) against the wishes of the majority of its membership, in order to placate its leave-voting heartlands (where Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party will no doubt inflict damage anyway) risks a mass party exodus on a scale not seen since the invasion of Iraq. Better to stick to its principles, retain the support of a younger pro-European generation, and use a general election to expose the policy deficiencies of the single-issue Brexit party to the electorate. Paul Dolan Cheshire \u2022 In recent weeks I have been attempting, through personal contact and local networking sites, to get as many EU citizens as possible to register to vote here in the European elections. As they are sometimes unclear about how to vote to register their remain or second referendum sympathies, I have had to point out that the Greens, Lib Dems and Change UK are the only unequivocally remain parties on offer. As a Labour party member, I have added, more in hope than expectation, that Labour too could yet come out clearly for a confirmatory vote in their manifesto. But if Labour fails to include a firm commitment which respects the wishes of the vast majority of its members then I shall advise local EU citizens to take their votes elsewhere as I, and millions of others, will be doing. Though advocating a vote for other parties lays me open to expulsion from the party this is an eventuality which, after three years of frustration at Labour\u2019s utter lack of direction on the domestic issue of the age, would conveniently save me the trouble of resigning. Mike Hine Kingston upon Thames \u2022 England is in a mess (Scotland\u2019s case for splitting away is easier to make than ever, 29 April) and as a Labour party member residing in Wales, let me be clear to the leadership; I am a European socialist foremost and, as Plaid Cymru calls for a referendum on EU membership, let me be clear to the NEC and Jeremy Corbyn. Labour has to offer the people and above all our young people a clear mandate on a second referendum; if not, for many in Wales our European identity will lie in Welsh independence within Europe. Corbyn needs to find some clarity that the Labour party has to preserve the British state if it wishes for government, for it is Celtic fringe MPs that are crucial to his bid for power. Peter Hack Presteigne, Powys \u2022 There are two simple messages for Labour leavers in the deprived north: your trials and tribulations are not the fault of the EU but of the disastrous austerity policies of the Tory government. And second: if we leave the EU, your economic blight will be made worse, not better. If only Mr Corbyn could be persuaded to proclaim these truths, loud and clear, the Labour party need have no hesitation in endorsing a second referendum. Michael Franklin Barnet, London \u2022 As Labour members and trade unionists, we urge our party to embrace the European elections as an opportunity to promote socialist politics in Britain and across Europe. This should include an explicit commitment to a public vote on any Brexit deal, with an option to remain. We want policies for a radical transformation of Britain and Europe. This could include: an end to austerity, and restoration and levelling up of services across Europe; an international green new deal to allow an emergency, socially just climate transition plan; defence of free movement combined with a European migration policy that welcomes migrants; and a radical strengthening of workers\u2019 and trade union rights; and a coordinated crackdown on tax avoidance and evasion; a major expansion of public ownership, including of the banks and finance; an overhaul of trade and other policies to promote workers\u2019 rights, sustainability and redistribution; a ban on nuclear weapons; and further democratisation of EU institutions, including a strengthened European parliament. We want MEPs who will use their voices, from the platform of the European parliament and outside, to popularise socialist policies and support and help organise workers\u2019, migrants\u2019 and other social struggles \u2013 locally, nationally and internationally. Our Labour party, with its half a million members, can make a huge difference in these elections, challenging both the far right and a discredited neoliberal establishment.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy is trapped in \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d by Brexit and the next decade could be the weakest for growth since the second world war, a former senior Bank of England policymaker has warned. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the central bank\u2019s interest rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said: \u201cThe UK economy will be limping on for a while, until Brexit negotiations are fully resolved. I can see the UK being in this limbo-land for quite a while \u2013 certainly until the late 2020s.\u201d The warning comes as the Guardian\u2019s Brexit dashboard reveals robust growth at the start of the year, fuelled by a dramatic rise in stockpiling before the original Brexit date of 29 March, now postponed until the end of October. Sending sterling tumbling on the foreign exchanges over the past month, observers now fear that Brexit has been transformed from its previous status as a time-limited process into a structural feature of the UK economy, with the prospect of complex and protracted negotiations dragging on growth for years to come. To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian is monitoring eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in three cases the outcome was worse than expected. In three cases, the result was better than forecast, while one met the expectations of City economists. The latest snapshot reveals a mixed picture for the economy amid the hiatus in talks over leaving the EU, after the negotiations reached fever pitch earlier in April as a full-scale national emergency. Business activity has kicked into reverse amid a lack of new work for firms to replace completed projects, as companies put decisions on hold owing to the lack of clarity over Brexit. Manufacturers have, however, been bolstered by stockpiling to the most intense levels on record for any G7 economy, perversely fuelling higher GDP growth despite the malaise. The UK posted record monthly goods trade deficits in both January and February as business rushed to buy raw materials, components and merchandise from overseas before the previous 29 March deadline in the Brexit talks. Economists fear the stampede to protect against a disruptive no-deal scenario could lead to sluggish economic growth in future as firms run-down their supplies. The EY Item Club forecasting group downgraded its growth projections for the UK to 1.3% for 2019 and 1.5% for 2020 for this reason, warning that the strong start to 2019 was likely to be a \u201cfalse dawn\u201d for Britain. The economy grew by 1.4% in 2018. Against this backdrop, and after Theresa May delayed the Brexit process earlier in the month, the Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold when it releases the decision of the MPC and its quarterly inflation report on Thursday. The Guardian\u2019s Brexit dashboard also reveals some bright spots for the economy from the latest economic news over the past month. Consumers appear to have ignored the political turmoil and kept on spending on the high street, despite fears that sales would fall as Brexit neared. Households were also handed a reprieve from inflation unexpectedly holding steady at 1.9% in March, while wage growth has risen to the strongest levels in a decade, enabling them to start rebuilding their finances. Unemployment remained at the lowest level since the mid-1970s, in a sign that Brexit has not deterred employers from hiring staff. However, economists believe that firms have put off spending on technology and hired workers to meet demand instead. The latest figures for productivity \u2013 a measure of economic output per hour of work, which is key for driving up living standards over the long term \u2013 showed that Britain\u2019s efficiency gains slowed in 2018. Last year, business investment, which is key for driving future productivity gains, fell for four quarters in a row for the first time since the financial crisis. Economists fear that protracted delays in the Brexit process could further dampen investment, with a knock-on effect for growth in future. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, another former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC, said: \u201cThe short-term picture has not been bad but Brexit is still having a chilling effect on the economy.\u201d",
