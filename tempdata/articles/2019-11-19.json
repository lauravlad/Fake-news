Throughout the debate, Johnson continually tried to bring the focus back to Brexit, on which Corbyn repeatedly declined to say how he would campaign in a second EU referendum, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> leader attacked the prime minister over the NHS and public services.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn has used the debate to argue that the institution of the monarchy needs improvement.</strong> The topic came up during a round of quickfire questions, to which short answers were required, and Corbyn was asked if the monarchy was fit for purpose. He replied: \u201cNeeds a bit of improvement.\u201d Replying to the same question, Johnson replied: \u201cThe institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach.\u201d The audience cheered Corbyn\u2019s reply, but Johnson\u2019s left them silent. Both men were then asked specifically about Prince Andrew, but in their answers they both focused primarily on the importance of addressing the needs of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims, rather than criticising the prince directly.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A snap poll for YouGov suggests that, by a margin of 51% to 49%, viewers thought Johnson won the debate</strong>.

Johnson may have been focused and effective, but for much of the debate he sounded like a stuck record, constantly returning to a not-entirely-plausible sounding refrain about getting Brexit done, while Corbyn had a wider and uplifting agenda, focusing on health, work and ending austerity. Regardless of the YouGov verdict, one suspects that Labour won\u2019t be disappointed with Corbyn\u2019s performance. The Conservatives are entitled to be relieved, but certainly not overjoyed.</p> \n  <p>What was surprising was how little Johnson had to say on domestic policy. As well as frequently over-running his time, he ended up being reprimanded several times in the second half of the programme (which was not meant to be about Brexit) for returning to his EU withdrawal talking points \u2013 the ones that he usefully telegraphed in advance. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd445868f083aa6d57872ea#block-5dd445868f083aa6d57872ea\">7.44pm.)</a></p> \n  <p>The debate was better-natured than many people might have expected (Julie Etchingham\u2019s decision to get them to shake hands on a good behaviour pledge seemed unnecessary on the night, as well as being of pointless long-term value, and ended up looking like a gimmick). And although this meant the audience never got to see the meaner side of Johnson, it also meant Corbyn got an easier ride than he might have expected. A constant Tory attack line against him is that he is a terrorist sympathiser who sided with Russia over the Salisbury poisonings. There was not a word about that tonight (apart from Brexit, foreign affairs barely featured) and viewers whose only knowledge of Corbyn comes from negative newspaper copy may have been pleasantly surprised. As argued earlier (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd451518f083aa6d578734d#block-5dd451518f083aa6d578734d\">8.36pm)</a>, the most uplifting moment of the debate (there wasn\u2019t a wide choice) was probably his riff about how he would be a leader who listens.</p> \n  <p>There was not a single exchange that defined the whole debate. Corbyn\u2019s \u201cwe have had nine years of chaotic coalition\u201d was a good reply to Johnson\u2019s claim about the threat posed by a Labour/SNP alliance, and Johnson was uncomfortable when being challenged about his record on not keeping his promises. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd44fd98f080fd59fb13729#block-5dd44fd98f080fd59fb13729\">8.28pm.)</a> He could have been pushed much harder on this, given that in the last election he fought, for the Tory leadership, his entire campaign was built around a promise he failed to keep (achieving Brexit by 31 October).</p> \n  <p>But although Corbyn had a broader and more positive message, Johnson did have a clear one \u2013 about Labour delaying Brexit \u2013 and if he kept coming back to this point endlessly, he was doing so for a reason. It might not have been impressive debating, but it was very good message discipline, it was consistent with the whole thrust of the Conservative campaign so far, and it did the trick tonight.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal will leave the economy \u00a370bn smaller after a decade and would weaken the public finances.</p> \n  <p>Further information here: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/sajid-javid-five-year-labour-spend-plan-near-12tn\">Is Sajid Javid right about the cost of Labour's spending plan?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-19T21:41:07.746Z\">at 9.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd456788f083aa6d5787374\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-19T20:55:59.798Z\">8.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>They are now on final statements.</p> \n  <p>Corbyn urges people to register to vote, and to vote for change.</p> \n  <p>Johnson says we need to get Brexit done.

The UK only has 11 months to negotiate a trade deal with the EU, starting on 1 February, because the current deadline is 31 December. However, many expect the transition period during which negotiations will take place to be extended by one or two years. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-19T20:39:03.193Z\">at 8.39pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd44cc18f083aa6d5787327\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-19T20:16:23.539Z\">8.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Johnson says Labour's claim about US trade deal threatening NHS is an 'invention'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Will you stick to your pledge to get the trade deal done by the end of next year?</em></p> \n  <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Johnson.

Although debates have been a feature of British elections since 2010, this is the first one featuring just the prime minister and the leader of the opposition.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/the-itv-election-debate-your-complete-guide-to-johnson-v-corbyn\">The ITV election debate: your complete guide to Johnson v Corbyn</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And here are five important things to remember before watching the debate tonight.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Election debates normally don\u2019t involve much debating. </strong>We call them debates, but in reality they are mostly exercises in soundbite regurgitation, rather than exercises involving rigorous engagement with argument. <strong>David Cameron</strong> explains this well in his autobiography, For the Record, where he writes this about preparing for the 2010 debates.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Bill Knapp and Anita Dunn, the US experts I had hired to help me prepare for the coming ordeal, were brutally frank about the reality I was about to encounter: to my disappointment, they told me that these wouldn\u2019t really be debates at all. You don\u2019t want to engage with your opponents\u2019s argument, you just want to put your own point across. You should focus your efforts on delivering your pre-prepared soundbite down the camera lens. Avoid too much spontaneity in taking apart opponents\u2019 arguments; it\u2019s far too risky. Just get your \u2018zinger - a one-liner destined for the headlines on the news programmes after the show - ready beforehand, and deploy it as soon as you can.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>2) Almost certainly, there won\u2019t be any so-called \u201cknockout blow\u201d.</strong> See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd3f4758f083aa6d5786f54#block-5dd3f4758f083aa6d5786f54\">2.33pm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd41d918f083aa6d578712d#block-5dd41d918f083aa6d578712d\">4.55pm.</a></p> \n  <p><strong>3) And even if there is something approaching a defining moment, the pundits might miss it.</strong> Sometimes a candidate says something in a debate that subsequently gets cited as having a decisive impact on voters - even if that is mostly because it\u2019s an answer that reinforces a negative perception that was already well entrenched. There was a good example in 2015 when Ed Miliband was asked if he thought Labour spent too much when it was last in power, and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IldMnsymDo0\"> he said no. </a>In subsequent analyses of the election, this was seen as an appalling error because it confirmed that Miliband could not be trusted on the economy. But on the night this was not apparent to many pundits, partly because Miliband had made this argument many times before (so, to the commentariat, he was not saying anything new), and party because what he said was true (at least to the extent that Labour\u2019s spending policies did not cause the financial crash, or even have much bearing on how well the UK was equipped to cope with it).</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Any assessment about who \u201cwon\u201d should be treated with some caution.</strong> Sometimes a debate takes place and there is a clear consensus amongst the public, if there is a poll, and amongst commentators as to who won. The best example in British politics is the first leaders\u2019 debate in 2010, which was clearly won by Nick Clegg. But more often the result is less clear-cut, with people\u2019s views as to who did best mostly overlapping with who they supported most in the first place. Boris Johnson easily outperforms Jeremy Corbyn in opinion polls at the moment, and so it is not surprising that a YouGov poll found that more people expect Johnson to perform well tonight than expect Corbyn to perform well tonight.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1196764209733865473\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Who do Britons think is going to perform best in tonight's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ITVdebate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ITVdebate</a>?<br><br>Boris Johnson - 37%<br>Jeremy Corbyn - 23%<br>Don't know - 39%<br><br>YouGov will be releasing a snap poll immediately following the debate to see who people think won, so stay tuned!<a href=\"https://t.co/Y63L92mAe6\">https://t.co/Y63L92mAe6</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oZpVskC3TH\">pic.twitter.com/oZpVskC3TH</a></p>\u2014 YouGov (@YouGov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1196764209733865473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But the betting companies, which make their forecasts based on where people are placing bets, expect Corbyn to win. YouGov is going to publish a snap poll tonight soon after the debate ends, asking people who performed best, and William Hill, Paddy Power and Coral have all sent out press releases today saying they have Corbyn the narrow favourite to win (ie, in the YouGov poll).</p> \n  <p>How to you explain the discrepancy between the public\u2019s expectations and punters\u2019 expectations? Quite easily. People who place bets on an election tend to follow politics closely, and they may well have noticed that Corbyn is a better debater than people realise. See the New Statesman\u2019s <strong>Stephen Bush</strong> on this at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/19/general-election-2019-nhs-labour-conservatives-tories-corbyn-johnson-swinson-sturgeon-tv-debate-brexit?page=with:block-5dd41a1b8f083aa6d578710b#block-5dd41a1b8f083aa6d578710b\">4.37pm.</a> Also, because Corbyn is going into this widely perceived as the underdog, it will be easier for him to outperform expectations.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) Even if you do win a debate, it won\u2019t necessarily win you an election. </strong>That\u2019s because elections are decided by multiple factors, and even if a TV debate makes an impact, it is never going to be wholly decisive. Clegg knows this as well as anyone. His debate triumph in 2010 resulted in the Lib Dems soaring in the polls for a few days, and a brief obsession with \u201cCleggmania\u201d (remember that?), but by the end of the election he was more or less back where he started, and his party ended up losing seats.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd42ac38f083aa6d57871e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-19T17:52:54.218Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There are two new polls around this afternoon.</p> \n  <p><strong>YouGov</strong> has the Conservatives 12 points ahead of Labour.

Instead there should be a \u201cperiod of reflection\u201d, McCluskey said. </p> \n  <p>Asked if Corbyn would have to resign if he lost, McCluskey said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, obviously I\u2019m not expecting Jeremy to lose. Jeremy would have to make a decision, along with other sections of the party. We would have to look at things \u2013 that\u2019s why I say a period of reflection. Back in 2015, Ed Miliband resigned the following day. I think that was wrong of him to do that. You always need a period of reflection. </p> \n   <p>The one thing I know about Jeremy Corbyn is that his election four years ago has changed British politics forever, and therefore we need to consider what this all means. We need to consider the election result. If it was a defeat \u2013 a defeat that I\u2019m not expecting \u2013 then we\u2019d have to look at the scale of that, and where it happened. That requires some calm deliberation. </p> \n   <p>So whilst I don\u2019t expect it, I certainly feel that there would have to be a proper debate and discussion.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But McCluskey also insisted that what was on offer in Labour\u2019s manifesto (out on Thursday) was so inspiring that the party deserved to win a massive landslide. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Committing to build a million homes over a decade. Tackling homelessness. Lifting the student debt off our young people\u2019s shoulders. All of these things Labour is promising. The deal that they\u2019re going to put to people is unbelievable. Free prescriptions.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over which of them is best placed to safeguard the NHS if they win the general election, with the Labour leader accusing the prime minister of being ready to sell it off to US corporations. As my colleagues Heather Stewart, Rowena Mason and Peter Walker report, in a testy live debate on ITV, during which the prime minister repeatedly returned to the claim that he would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, both men lavished praise on the NHS, but Corbyn said Johnson would put it up for sale. Throughout the debate, Johnson continually tried to bring the focus back to Brexit, on which Corbyn repeatedly declined to say how he would campaign in a second EU referendum, while the Labour leader attacked the prime minister over the NHS and public services. Corbyn has used the debate to argue that the institution of the monarchy needs improvement. The topic came up during a round of quickfire questions, to which short answers were required, and Corbyn was asked if the monarchy was fit for purpose. He replied: \u201cNeeds a bit of improvement.\u201d Replying to the same question, Johnson replied: \u201cThe institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach.\u201d The audience cheered Corbyn\u2019s reply, but Johnson\u2019s left them silent. Both men were then asked specifically about Prince Andrew, but in their answers they both focused primarily on the importance of addressing the needs of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims, rather than criticising the prince directly. A snap poll for YouGov suggests that, by a margin of 51% to 49%, viewers thought Johnson won the debate. (See 9.10am.) But the same poll found that more people thought Corbyn did better than Johnson \u2013 a different measure \u2013 and, as ITV\u2019s Robert Peston points out, Corbyn did better on this question with Tory supporters than Johnson did with Labour supporters. The Conservatives have been accused of misleading the public after they rebranded their official Twitter account as \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d during the televised leaders\u2019 debate and used it to publish anti-Labour posts. The Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake described this as a tactic worthy of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. He said: This is straight out of Donald Trump or Putin\u2019s playbook. Not content with excluding the voice of remain from this debate, the Tories are now resorting to deliberately misleading the public. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here are some of the newspaper front pages from tomorrow. And this is what Nigel Farage,the Brexit party leader, said about the ITV debate. Well, there is no doubt that Jeremy Corbyn is a better debater than Boris Johnson. But on the key issue of the day, Brexit, nine times Jeremy Corbyn would not say as prime minister that a second referendum that he\u2019d call, whether he\u2019d vote leave or remain. That is a failure of leadership. Here is Sian Berry, the Green party co-leader, on the ITV debate. She said: I actually can\u2019t believe that climate chaos was relegated to the quickfire round in that debate. That neither of those two men who want to run the country brought it up as part of their main points. This is the most important issue that we face, alongside Brexit, and yet it wasn\u2019t part of the debate. And here is a Guardian panel with verdicts on the debate from Owen Jones, Jonathan Freedland, Katy Balls and Sonia Sodha. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s take on who won. And here is her verdict. Corbyn: The Labour leader gave a solid performance with no big slip-ups, but no breakthrough moment that caught Johnson on the hop. He also did not attack Johnson personally on scandals such as his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri, or having been sacked for lying. Johnson: The Tory spinners will most likely be pleased with his performance, given they sent him out with the primary objective of not creating much news. He was also able to repeatedly press home his key attack lines on Brexit. But they may be worried about his inability to be convincing on matters of trust. Here is my colleague John Crace\u2019s sketch about the debate. And this is how it ends. Yet despite all this, the debate had revealed something. That voters hold both leaders in open contempt and are in despair that one of them will end up as prime minister. Given the chance to show off their best selves, Johnson and Corbyn had merely proved they didn\u2019t have one. The country was even more screwed than anyone had previously imagined. Matthew Smith from YouGov has got a full write-up of its poll findings here. Curiously, although more people thought Boris Johnson won, according to the survey, more people also thought Corbyn did well. That may sound irrational (and often people are irrational), but doing well in a debate is not necessarily the same as winning. And here is Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minster and the SNP leader, on the debate. The clear takeaway for Scotland from this debate is that neither of these men should be able to determine Scotland\u2019s future. Jeremy Corbyn can\u2019t decide if he is leave or remain and Boris Johnson is determined to take Scotland out of the EU against our will. Only a vote for the SNP in this election can help Scotland escape from Brexit \u2013 and secure our right to choose a better future as an independent country. Here is Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, on the debate. People watching at home deserve so much better than what was on offer tonight. Both people on that stage want Brexit and there was no one on that stage arguing to remain in the European Union. Staying in the EU is better for our economy, better for our environment, and better for our NHS. A brighter future is possible, but it is not on offer from either of the two old, tired parties. And here are the more detailed figures from the YouGov poll. YouGov surveyed 1,646 people who watched the debate. Boris Johnson won on Brexit, being prime ministerial, being likeable and government spending. Jeremy Corbyn won on being in touch with ordinary people, on the NHS, on being trustworthy and on other issues. Issues on which Johnson won Who do you think came across as more likeable? 54% Boris Johnson, 37% Jeremy Corbyn, 10% Don\u2019t know Who do you think came across as more prime ministerial? 54% Boris Johnson, 29% Jeremy Corbyn, 17% Don\u2019t know Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on Brexit? 63% Boris Johnson, 27% Jeremy Corbyn, 10% Don\u2019t know Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on government spending? 50% Boris Johnson, 35% Jeremy Corbyn, 15% Don\u2019t know Issues on which Corbyn won Who do you think came across as more trustworthy? 40% Boris Johnson, 45% Jeremy Corbyn, 15% Don\u2019t know Who do you think came across as more in touch with ordinary people? 25% Boris Johnson, 59% Jeremy Corbyn, 16% Don\u2019t know Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on NHS? 38% Boris Johnson, 54% Jeremy Corbyn, 8% Don\u2019t know Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on other issues [ie, not Brexit, NHS or spending]? 39% Boris Johnson, 46% Jeremy Corbyn, 15% Don\u2019t know YouGov has sent out a more detailed news release about its poll. (See 9.10pm.) It points out that the 51% to 49% result is \u201cso close as to be within the margin of error\u201d. And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the debate. In summary, it\u2019s very mixed. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman From the BBC\u2019s Alex Forsyth From the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne From Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton From the Manchester Evening News\u2019 Jennifer Williams From the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire From Good Morning Britain\u2019s Piers Morgan From the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From the Observer\u2019s Sonia Sodha Claim: Johnson said Corbyn would \u201cwhack\u201d corporation tax up to the \u201chighest in Europe\u201d. Reality: Corbyn said he would return corporation tax to the levels of 2010 when it was 28%, which would make it one of the highest, but not the highest in the EU. France\u2019s corporation tax is 31% for companies with an annual turnover below \u20ac250m, and 33.33% for companies with an annual turnover of \u20ac250m and above. Combined corporation tax in Germany is between 30% and 33%. A win\u2019s a win, and the YouGov poll probably does give us a reasonably good idea as to what people who were watching the debate this evening felt about it, but it does not necessarily tell the whole story, and 51% to 49% is not much of a margin over someone whom the Tories regularly denounce as being unfit to lead the country. Johnson may have been focused and effective, but for much of the debate he sounded like a stuck record, constantly returning to a not-entirely-plausible sounding refrain about getting Brexit done, while Corbyn had a wider and uplifting agenda, focusing on health, work and ending austerity. Regardless of the YouGov verdict, one suspects that Labour won\u2019t be disappointed with Corbyn\u2019s performance. The Conservatives are entitled to be relieved, but certainly not overjoyed. What was surprising was how little Johnson had to say on domestic policy. As well as frequently over-running his time, he ended up being reprimanded several times in the second half of the programme (which was not meant to be about Brexit) for returning to his EU withdrawal talking points \u2013 the ones that he usefully telegraphed in advance. (See 7.44pm.) The debate was better-natured than many people might have expected (Julie Etchingham\u2019s decision to get them to shake hands on a good behaviour pledge seemed unnecessary on the night, as well as being of pointless long-term value, and ended up looking like a gimmick). And although this meant the audience never got to see the meaner side of Johnson, it also meant Corbyn got an easier ride than he might have expected. A constant Tory attack line against him is that he is a terrorist sympathiser who sided with Russia over the Salisbury poisonings. There was not a word about that tonight (apart from Brexit, foreign affairs barely featured) and viewers whose only knowledge of Corbyn comes from negative newspaper copy may have been pleasantly surprised. As argued earlier (see 8.36pm), the most uplifting moment of the debate (there wasn\u2019t a wide choice) was probably his riff about how he would be a leader who listens. There was not a single exchange that defined the whole debate. Corbyn\u2019s \u201cwe have had nine years of chaotic coalition\u201d was a good reply to Johnson\u2019s claim about the threat posed by a Labour/SNP alliance, and Johnson was uncomfortable when being challenged about his record on not keeping his promises. (See 8.28pm.) He could have been pushed much harder on this, given that in the last election he fought, for the Tory leadership, his entire campaign was built around a promise he failed to keep (achieving Brexit by 31 October). But although Corbyn had a broader and more positive message, Johnson did have a clear one \u2013 about Labour delaying Brexit \u2013 and if he kept coming back to this point endlessly, he was doing so for a reason. It might not have been impressive debating, but it was very good message discipline, it was consistent with the whole thrust of the Conservative campaign so far, and it did the trick tonight. Three weeks on Thursday, it may well work again too. \u201cLeaving politics aside\u201d during the ITV leaders\u2019 debate, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn told the British public what they would get each other for Christmas: Here is the result of the YouGov snap poll. Claim: Boris Johnson said the rate at which Labour would borrow would \u201cpush up interest rates for every household in the country\u201d. Reality: The Conservatives have argued that Labour will spend an additional \u00a31.2tn over five years. However, it did not base its claims on Labour\u2019s manifesto and used estimates that have been disputed as incorrect. The government\u2019s borrowing costs \u2013 interest rates \u2013 are at historical lows and economists do not expect a dramatic rise soon. Both Labour and the Tories plan to raise public spending back to 1970s levels, according to the Resolution Foundation. The outcome of Brexit will also have an impact on interest rates and the government\u2019s budget deficit \u2013 the annual shortfall between income from taxes and government spending. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal will leave the economy \u00a370bn smaller after a decade and would weaken the public finances. Further information here: They are now on final statements. Corbyn urges people to register to vote, and to vote for change. Johnson says we need to get Brexit done. He says if Corbyn cannot answer whether or not he would vote for Brexit, or whether he would do a deal with the SNP, he is not fit to govern. He says he will get Brexit done, and allow parliament to move on to other things. Q: What present would you give each other for Christmas? Corbyn says he would give Johnson a copy of A Christmas Carol. Johnson says he would give Corbyn a copy of his Brexit deal. When Etchingham insists on a non-political gift, he says a pot of damson jam. Q: Which foreign leader do you admire most? The EU27, because they did me a fantastic deal, says Johnson. Corbyn says it is the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, because he is trying to bring people together. Q: Is climate change the biggest crisis facing the UK? Johnson says it is the biggest crisis facing the world. That is why we must get Brexit done. Corbyn says this is the biggest problem for the world. Q: Is the monarchy fit for purpose? It needs a bit of improvement, says Corbyn. Johnson says it is beyond reproach. Q: Is Prince Andrew fit for purpose? Corbyn says we should think about the victims of Jeffrey Epstein first. Johnson agrees. Etchingam points out that all of this depends on what sort of Brexit deal is achieved. She seems to be making the point that comparing domestic spending plans without taking into account what sort of Brexit we will have is a mistake, because that will affect tax revenues. Claim: Boris Johnson claims the Conservatives are \u201cbuilding 40 new hospitals\u201d. Reality: The Conservatives earmarked \u00a33bn earlier this autumn, saying they would build 40 new hospitals. However, it emerged the majority of the funds will go to just six NHS trusts, which each have a major hospital badly in need of rebuilding and have had plans waiting for approval. A further 21 NHS Trusts will get \u00a3100m seed funding between them for building works on 34 hospitals they need for 2025-30. Further details from our colleagues reporting on this in September: Etchingham asks if Johnson has found a magic money tree, and if Corbyn has found more than one of them. Johnson says Corbyn has found a forest of them. Corbyn says the levels of poverty caused by austerity must change. Corbyn says: We are a society of billionaires, and the very poor - neither of which are right. Q: You say there is plenty to spend. But I\u2019m worried you will throw it away on silly election giveaways. What can you say to reassure me? Corbyn says we have had a decade of austerity. He says he wants a \u00a310 an hour living wage. He thinks this election will be a turning point in terms of handling the economy. Johnson says the question was about handling the public finances. He has shelved a corporation tax cut, saving \u00a36bn for public services. He says if we fail to get Brexit done, we will have more deadlock and division. Q: Is austerity over? Corbyn says: We will end austerity. I\u2019m absolutely clear about that. Johnson says he wants a dynamic economy. Corbyn has said he wants to overthrow capitalism. That would be disastrous, he says. Q: Will you rule out privatisation for the NHS? Corbyn says the internal market must go. And social care problems are not being addressed. Q: Will there be a social care policy in the Tory manifesto? Yes, says Johnson. He says no one should have to sell their home to pay for social care. Johnson says nothing could be more ruinous to the NHS than a \u201ccrackpot\u201d four-day working week. Corbyn says Labour\u2019s plan is for shorter working hours across the economy, paid for by productivity increases. This prompts some laughter. Corbyn says shorter working hours are good for people\u2019s health. He says the Johnson claim about there being 40 new hospitals has turned out to be false. Johnson says the government is working on six new hospitals now, but has plans for 40. He says the biggest threat to the NHS is not getting Brexit done. They\u2019re back. And the rest of the questions are on domestic issues. Q: How will you ensure the NHS meets its demands? And should there be any more privatisation? Corbyn says the NHS is under great pressure. Yesterday a friend of his died from secondary breast cancer. She had gone to the hospital earlier, but the nurses had been under pressure. She recorded a video of her experience. This must be the video. Corbyn seems to be getting the upper hand. His worst moment came when the audience laughed as he claimed his Brexit position was clear, and Johnson was pushing him relentlessly on this, but this did not seem quite as bad as Johnson\u2019s unconvincing claims to be someone who keeps his promises. Corbyn has also been strikingly more positive, and his riff about being a leader who listens was about the most uplifting thing in the debate so far (a low bar). Claim: Boris Johnson claims voting in a Labour government would mean two referendums next year, one on the EU and one on Scottish independence. Reality: Labour\u2019s policy is to renegotiate a Brexit deal with the EU and then put it to UK voters in a second referendum within six months. Corbyn did not say which way Labour would campaign. Should Labour fail to win a majority next month, it could need the support of minority parties to form a government, including the Scottish National party. Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants an independence referendum before 2021. However, Corbyn has said he would not allow a vote in the \u201cearly years\u201d of a Labour government. He also says no deals have been struck with the SNP. Q: [To Johnson] You promised 40 times that we would be out of the EU on 31 October. One of your staff once said you had betrayed everyone who worked with you. And, Mr Corbyn, can you take responsibility for antisemitism in your party? Corbyn says antisemitism is a scourge. He has taken steps to deal with it. He understands the desperate history of antisemitism. Johnson says he was \u201copen mouthed\u201d listening to Corbyn. Etchingham asks him to address the points she put to him. Johnson tries to talk about Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. Etchingham tries again, and says the nastiness seems to be getting out of control. Q: Will you promise to improve the nature of debate if you become PM? Corbyn says the recent quality of debate in parliament was horrible. He called for a meeting for it to be improved. Etchtingham asks them both to make this a pledge. They do shake hands. And now we have the ad break. Claim: Jeremy Corbyn says Boris Johnson told the DUP annual conference last year that there would be no border down the Irish Sea and now \u201cwell, there is\u201d. Johnson says \u201cthe contrary\u201d is the case. Reality: Corbyn is correct. Johnson has struck a deal that will keep an invisible border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This, however, will involve some additional paperwork between Northern Ireland and Great Britain on food and agrifood, which the DUP accepted as the price of a deal. But other goods will also be checked. Exactly which ones and the level of checks cannot be decided until the Brexit deal is done and a joint EU-UK committee can work out the details. Etchingham asks about integrity and strength of character. Corbyn says it is about bringing people together. Whether you live in the north or the south, your problems are the same. Johnson says: Look at what I said I would do as a politician, and look at what I have delivered. This a remarkable claim in the light of his failure to meet his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to deliver Brexit by 31 October. Q: Does the truth matter in this election? Johnson replies: I think it does. The audience laugh. Etchingham says they are now turning to trust and leadership. Q: How can we trust you? The questioner gets a round of applause. Q: The debate has become toxic, with an appalling level of lies. How can we trust you to bring this country together? Addressing the questioner by his name, Johnson says that is an important question. The problem was that parliament repeatedly blocked Brexit, he says. He says the way to restore trust is to get Brexit done. Corbyn says trust has to be earned. As an elected representative, you have to listen to people. He has spent a lot of time listening to people, from chief executives to the homeless. Everyone you meet knows something you don\u2019t know. His style is to listen to people, and to bring people together. Johnson says most of Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet have spoken against Corbyn\u2019s deal. Corbyn says Johnson told the DUP conference he would not allow a border down the Irish Sea. But his deal does involve this. Johnson disputes this. Corbyn says, if the SNP want to vote down a Labour government, that is up to them. Johnson says Corbyn has not ruled out a second referendum. He says there would be a \u201cchaotic coalition\u201d between Labour and the SNP. Corbyn says we\u2019ve had nine years of \u201cchaotic coalition\u201d already. That gets a round of applause. Q: Is the union more important than Brexit? Corbyn says he wants to reply to Johnson\u2019s deal. No deals have been done, and no deals will be done. He says he will bring this issue to a close through a referendum. Johnson says the union is the most important thing. Johnson says preserving the union is more important than Brexit. This would not normally be newsworthy, but polls show that for many Tory Brexiters, Brexit is more important than the union. Q: Is the union worth sacrificing for Brexit? Corbyn says he hopes the union does not break up. But Johnson\u2019s deal gives Northern Ireland a different status. There are issues there, he says. This deal is damaging to this country. Johnson claims his deal would keep the whole of the UK together. To get into No 10, Labour will do a deal \u2013 probably have already done a deal \u2013 with the SNP, he claims. And he says the price will be a second Scottish independence referendum. Claim: Jeremy Corbyn claims it will take \u201cat least seven years\u201d to negotiate a UK-US trade deal. Reality: The EU took seven years to negotiate and ratify a deal with Canada, not the US. On average it takes 48 months to do a trade deal. It is highly unlikely that a US deal will be struck until the UK has a new deal with the EU in place. The UK only has 11 months to negotiate a trade deal with the EU, starting on 1 February, because the current deadline is 31 December. However, many expect the transition period during which negotiations will take place to be extended by one or two years. Q: Will you stick to your pledge to get the trade deal done by the end of next year? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Johnson. People said he would not be able to get a deal, but he did. Etchingham asks if he will mint a new coin for December 2020. That gets a round of applause (but not an answer). Johnson again asks if Corbyn will campaign for his own deal. Corbyn says his policy is clear. After the referendum, the process will be at an end. He says Johnson\u2019s government has had secret meetings with the US about opening up the health service to the US. He shows the document about these talks released in the US. Most of it is redacted. Johnson claims this is an \u201cinvention\u201d. The NHS is not for sale. He says this only comes up because Corbyn is ignoring the question as to what side he will campaign on. Corbyn says he has made the position clear. Some in the audience laugh. Johnson says he wants a mandate to govern. But Corbyn wants to strike a new deal, he says. He asks if Corbyn wants to do a deal, and he asks if he will campaign for his own deal. Corbyn says he wants to bring people together. Corbyn repeats the point about a trade deal with the US taking seven years. And he claims Johnson has already indicated this deal would put the NHS at risk. Etchingham says Corbyn ducked the question about whether he would campaign for remain or leave. The Tories have changed the name of their Twitter account - making it highly misleading. UPDATE: Later in the evening they changed the name back, from factcheckUK to CCHQ Press. Our story about the row the change generated is here. Etchingham says the questions come from viewers. Q: Both of you say Brexit will be resolved in the next few months. But there have been so many broken promises. Can you assure me we won\u2019t be talking about Brexit forever. Johnson says he has a deal ready to go, and the UK will come out on 31 January. The UK will come out together. There is a sharp distinction between this, and the \u201cdither and delay\u201d offered by Corbyn. That\u2019s the second time Johnson has used that phrase. Corbyn says he would negotiate a new deal, and have a referendum, with a credible leave option. He says it is \u201cnonsense\u201d to suggest that Johnson would sort out Brexit by January. He says it would take Johnson seven years to negotiate a trade deal with the US. And the US trade deal would be incompatible with a trade deal with the EU. Boris Johnson says there is only one reason to have an election; to remove the block in parliament, get Brexit done, and to then unleash this country\u2019s potential. Under Corbyn there would be dither and delay, and two referendums. Together, let\u2019s take this country forward, he says. Jeremy Corbyn goes first with the opening statement. The election gives a real choice, he says, about the future. Labour is offering real hope. The Tory government is failing. He says he will get Brexit sorted by giving people the final say, and he will implement what they decide. Too many policies are failing. Labour will govern for the many not the few. The programme starts with Julia Etchingham introducing the debate, with Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn standing alongside her. It\u2019s about to start - the first debate of the election, and the first ever British election debate featuring just the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. It is on ITV, and Julia Etchingham is presenting. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg During the debate Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will get the chance to ask each other questions. We know what some of Johnson\u2019s questions will be because helpfully he included them in an open letter addressed to Corbyn last night. For the record, here they are. 1. You are proposing a second referendum on EU membership. In that referendum, would you recommend the UK should remain or leave? 2. Your previous manifesto promised to end freedom of movement, but following your conference it is now Labour party policy to \u201cmaintain and extend\u201d free movement. Would you end, maintain or extend free movement, and would immigration be higher or lower under Corbyn\u2019s Labour? 3. Asked on Sunday if you were prepared to continue to pay into the EU budget on an ongoing basis, you replied \u201cclearly if you want access to a market there are costs involved\u201d. How much would you be willing to pay into the EU budget in return for \u201caccess to markets\u201d? 4. All 635 Conservative candidates standing at this election have pledged to me that, if elected, they will vote in parliament to pass my Brexit deal. Can you guarantee that every Labour candidate supports your Brexit policy? We won\u2019t have a live stream of the debate at the top of the blog tonight, as we do for many political events. ITV won\u2019t allow us one. They have this old-fashioned notion that people should be watching on their channel. But we will get clips of the key moments later. And here\u2019s the latest Tory Twitter offering. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is among those spinning for the PM. From Labour From the Financial Times\u2019 John Burn-Murdoch Boris Johnson has just arrived at the ITV studios in Salford. From the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson Here is the Jeremy Corbyn version of the \u201clet\u2019s do this\u201d tweet. We saw Boris Johnson\u2019s version earlier. (See 4.50pm.) From ITV\u2019s Liam Calland This is from Jeremy Corbyn. Tez Ilyas is a comedian. From Bloomberg\u2019s Kitty Donaldson My colleagues Peter Walker and Jim Waterson have produced a very good guide to tonight\u2019s ITV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. Although debates have been a feature of British elections since 2010, this is the first one featuring just the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. And here are five important things to remember before watching the debate tonight. 1) Election debates normally don\u2019t involve much debating. We call them debates, but in reality they are mostly exercises in soundbite regurgitation, rather than exercises involving rigorous engagement with argument. David Cameron explains this well in his autobiography, For the Record, where he writes this about preparing for the 2010 debates. Bill Knapp and Anita Dunn, the US experts I had hired to help me prepare for the coming ordeal, were brutally frank about the reality I was about to encounter: to my disappointment, they told me that these wouldn\u2019t really be debates at all. You don\u2019t want to engage with your opponents\u2019s argument, you just want to put your own point across. You should focus your efforts on delivering your pre-prepared soundbite down the camera lens. Avoid too much spontaneity in taking apart opponents\u2019 arguments; it\u2019s far too risky. Just get your \u2018zinger - a one-liner destined for the headlines on the news programmes after the show - ready beforehand, and deploy it as soon as you can. 2) Almost certainly, there won\u2019t be any so-called \u201cknockout blow\u201d. See 2.33pm and 4.55pm. 3) And even if there is something approaching a defining moment, the pundits might miss it. Sometimes a candidate says something in a debate that subsequently gets cited as having a decisive impact on voters - even if that is mostly because it\u2019s an answer that reinforces a negative perception that was already well entrenched. There was a good example in 2015 when Ed Miliband was asked if he thought Labour spent too much when it was last in power, and he said no. In subsequent analyses of the election, this was seen as an appalling error because it confirmed that Miliband could not be trusted on the economy. But on the night this was not apparent to many pundits, partly because Miliband had made this argument many times before (so, to the commentariat, he was not saying anything new), and party because what he said was true (at least to the extent that Labour\u2019s spending policies did not cause the financial crash, or even have much bearing on how well the UK was equipped to cope with it). 4) Any assessment about who \u201cwon\u201d should be treated with some caution. Sometimes a debate takes place and there is a clear consensus amongst the public, if there is a poll, and amongst commentators as to who won. The best example in British politics is the first leaders\u2019 debate in 2010, which was clearly won by Nick Clegg. But more often the result is less clear-cut, with people\u2019s views as to who did best mostly overlapping with who they supported most in the first place. Boris Johnson easily outperforms Jeremy Corbyn in opinion polls at the moment, and so it is not surprising that a YouGov poll found that more people expect Johnson to perform well tonight than expect Corbyn to perform well tonight. But the betting companies, which make their forecasts based on where people are placing bets, expect Corbyn to win. YouGov is going to publish a snap poll tonight soon after the debate ends, asking people who performed best, and William Hill, Paddy Power and Coral have all sent out press releases today saying they have Corbyn the narrow favourite to win (ie, in the YouGov poll). How to you explain the discrepancy between the public\u2019s expectations and punters\u2019 expectations? Quite easily. People who place bets on an election tend to follow politics closely, and they may well have noticed that Corbyn is a better debater than people realise. See the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush on this at 4.37pm. Also, because Corbyn is going into this widely perceived as the underdog, it will be easier for him to outperform expectations. 5) Even if you do win a debate, it won\u2019t necessarily win you an election. That\u2019s because elections are decided by multiple factors, and even if a TV debate makes an impact, it is never going to be wholly decisive. Clegg knows this as well as anyone. His debate triumph in 2010 resulted in the Lib Dems soaring in the polls for a few days, and a brief obsession with \u201cCleggmania\u201d (remember that?), but by the end of the election he was more or less back where he started, and his party ended up losing seats. There are two new polls around this afternoon. YouGov has the Conservatives 12 points ahead of Labour. This is from the Times\u2019s Matt Chorley. And a Kantar poll has the Tories 18 points ahead. This is from Reuters. Usual reminder: polls aren\u2019t always an accurate guide to the election result. Boris Johnson has gone for some Rocky Balboa-type posturing ahead of tonight\u2019s ITV debate. (See 2.33pm and 4.50pm.) As you would expect, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s warm-up routine is rather different. And here is another useful Twitter thread on the likely impact of the debate tonight, from the academic Prof Tim Bale. It starts here. Labour\u2019s Dawn Butler has posted a video on Twitter from the \u201cspin room\u201d for the ITV debate tonight. And, while we\u2019re on the subject of debates, this is from Nick Anstead, an academic specialising in political communication, commenting on my point about \u201cknockout blows\u201d earlier. (See 2.33pm.) And here is Anstead\u2019s take on what impact debates have. Boris Johnson has posted this on Twitter ahead of tonight\u2019s debate. It\u2019s interesting mainly because it\u2019s a bit - well, Donald Trump. According to the Financial Times\u2019s Sebastian Payne, Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is expected to stand in for Boris Johnson in the seven-party debate on the BBC on Friday week. The New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush posted a very good thread on Twitter yesterday about why, in his view, Boris Johnson was mad to agree to two one-on-one debates with Jeremy Corbyn. Do read it. It starts here. Nigel Farage has said his Brexit party might do pacts with the Tories on a local basis in the general election. After his plea to Boris Johnson to form an official \u201cleave alliance\u201d was rebuffed he said that campaigners might choose to organise themselves on the ground informally instead. He said it was a situation that would be out of his control but the Brexit party or Tories might essentially run paper candidates in key Labour marginals. Speaking in Peterborough after an election rally, he said: This is an election in which there are remain deals being done and Brexit deals being done at local level. It\u2019s not particularly surprising. I\u2019m aware of some areas in which we may be trying very hard and they [the Conservatives] may or may not be trying very hard, and in the neighbouring seat it might be the other way round. I\u2019m aware of it. But I can\u2019t manage it. The Brexit party is standing 274 candidates at the election after deciding to withdraw 317 candidates from Tory-held seats so as not to split the vote after Johnson said he backed a Canada-style free trade deal after Britain left the EU. Farage\u2019s party believes it has a strong chance in 150 Labour seats \u2013 areas the Tories traditionally cannot win over. The Brexit party MEP for London, Lance Forman, has already urged candidates to form local pacts. He posted this on Twitter last week. A Labour source has been in touch to say that journalists might have been reading too much earlier into what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, seemed to be saying about ruling out a windfall tax on oil companies. (See 11.42am and 1.16pm.) When McDonnell said no, he was saying no to a request to explain how a windfall tax might work, the source claims. \u201cHe has not discussed what will or won\u2019t be in the manifesto.\u201d In an interview with the New Statesman Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s most influential ally in the union movement, has suggested that, if the Tories win the election, Corbyn should not resign immediately as Labour leader. Instead there should be a \u201cperiod of reflection\u201d, McCluskey said. Asked if Corbyn would have to resign if he lost, McCluskey said: Well, obviously I\u2019m not expecting Jeremy to lose. Jeremy would have to make a decision, along with other sections of the party. We would have to look at things \u2013 that\u2019s why I say a period of reflection. Back in 2015, Ed Miliband resigned the following day. I think that was wrong of him to do that. You always need a period of reflection. The one thing I know about Jeremy Corbyn is that his election four years ago has changed British politics forever, and therefore we need to consider what this all means. We need to consider the election result. If it was a defeat \u2013 a defeat that I\u2019m not expecting \u2013 then we\u2019d have to look at the scale of that, and where it happened. That requires some calm deliberation. So whilst I don\u2019t expect it, I certainly feel that there would have to be a proper debate and discussion. But McCluskey also insisted that what was on offer in Labour\u2019s manifesto (out on Thursday) was so inspiring that the party deserved to win a massive landslide. He explained: Committing to build a million homes over a decade. Tackling homelessness. Lifting the student debt off our young people\u2019s shoulders. All of these things Labour is promising. The deal that they\u2019re going to put to people is unbelievable. Free prescriptions. Free parking in hospitals, I mean, that might sound small beer, but do you know what? I know, and you\u2019ll know, and everyone reading your thing will know hundreds, thousands of people who\u2019ll be infuriated that they get fleeced every time they go and visit their loved ones who are sick. All of these things add up to an unbelievable offer that Labour is going to be making, one that will transform our society. When you look at Labour\u2019s programme \u2013 oh my god. You would think that we would end up with a massive landslide, because it speaks to so many people. McCluskey\u2019s comment about how the manifesto will contain plans to spare young people from the burden of student debt may be a hint that, as well as abolishing tuition fees, Labour may promise to cut or write off the debts built up since tuition fees were raised to the level of \u00a39,000 a year. Corbyn floated this idea during the 2017 general election campaign, but without making a firm commitment. This morning, in his interview on the Today programme, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, also hinted that the party might cut debts for students who have already graduated. As PoliticsHome reports, he said: In terms of the system, the debt that has been piled up already, I\u2019ve been trying to say to the government they\u2019ve got a problem here that we\u2019ve all got to accept. The system is not working. Large amounts of that debt is not being paid off and the government is having to write it off. There is I think an approach that has to be taken that looks at existing debt and we will look at some of these issues in the coming weeks. The SNP has said the Conservative opposition to holding a second independence referendum is \u201ccrumbling\u201d after the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, appeared to contradict Boris Johnson\u2019s vow to block another vote regardless of whether the nationalists win at Holyrood in 2021. Jack told BBC Radio Scotland: The democratic mandate for a section 30 order is a matter for 2021. We\u2019ll see whether or not the Scottish National party get a majority then. When Johnson visited Elgin two weeks ago, he insisted he would not grant the powers necessary to hold a legal referendum, regardless of whether the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats in the general election or a pro-independence majority in Holyrood. It remains to be seen whether this is a genuine contradiction, mis-speak, overinterpretation, or attempt at the unhappy triangulation over indyref2 policy that has so vexed Labour of late. Election debate reporting is often blighted by references to the prospect of a \u201cknockout punch\u201d. Apart from being a terrible cliche, the phrase is not particularly pertinent because such moments almost never happen in election debates, and so it is unhelpful to pretend that they do. You probably have to go back to Ronald Reagan to find a moment when a single line was so effective and memorable it decided a debate. But Boris Johnson\u2019s media team are not averse to hackneyed metaphors, and they had him doing a photo opportunity in a gym earlier showing him preparing for said knockout blow. Johnson said he was \u201cexcited\u201d rather than nervous about the debate tonight. Meanwhile, as Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby points out, Jeremy Corbyn has been preparing for the debate with a trip to the barbers. The Greens launched their election manifesto this morning. My colleague Peter Walker has written it up here. And in Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionist party has launched \u2013 well, not quite a manifesto, but a 12-point plan for Northern Ireland (pdf). Speaking at the launch, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, firmly ruled out supporting a Jeremy Corbyn government in a hung parliament. She said: We are very clear that we will not be supporting a Jeremy-Corbyn-led Labour party in a government because we believe Jeremy Corbyn would not only be hugely detrimental to the United Kingdom in terms of the break-up of the United Kingdom, and we have heard the whole discussion around the Scottish independence referendum, and we would be very fearful for the economy of the United Kingdom and we would be very fearful for the defence of our United Kingdom on a global scale. So there are many, many reasons why we couldn\u2019t in all conscience support a Jeremy-Corbyn-led administration. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, also claimed today that Britain in some respects resembles a failed South American state. He said: There are elements to our system which resemble a failed state in South America. Hundreds of Brexit party candidates last week were bombarded with messages telling them they shouldn\u2019t stand, some of them quite threatening, and at the same time others offered inducements. I think our democracy is deep in crisis, I think our confidence in the whole system has never been lower and I think now that Brexit is just the beginning of a real radical transformation of our political system. The feeling that they are the masters and we are the servants is the wrong way around and needs to be reversed. Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Haroon Siddique. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has been commenting on Prince Andrew. He\u2019s a lot less censorious than Chuka Umunna. (See 7.25am.) Talking about the prince, Farage said: For him it\u2019s bad. He\u2019s eighth in line to the throne so it\u2019s not a direct threat to the monarchy. The Queen just becomes this ever more exalted figure and the public are starting to look at those who come after her with a degree of scepticism, but it\u2019s not uncommon. That has happened throughout history. The shadow chancellor has been setting out how Labour would ensure companies worked for the greater good. John McDonnell stressed that Labour is pro-business but it would beef up the regulatory system to prevent failures such as those of Thomas Cook and Carillion, and introduce measures to ensure company directors are not just driven by profit but take into account impacts on employees, the environment and the wider good. He said companies not moving towards de-carbonisation would be de-listed. But he said Labour would not impose a windfall tax on oil companies. UPDATE: Or maybe not. This afternoon Labour said journalists were reading too much into what McDonnell said about not imposing a windfall tax. (See 3.51pm). Boris Johnson will aim to tackle knife crime by reducing the time it takes to charge and prosecute offenders, the Evening Standard reports. It also says a new form of court order, called a serious violence reduction order, will be introduced to allow police to search habitual knife carriers in the street without requiring suspicion. Also on law and order, the shadow justice secretary, Robert Buckland, pledged the Tories would introduce a whole life term for adults who commit the premeditated murder of a child. The Green party launched its election manifesto with the central plank being a pledge to implement a zero-carbon economy by 2030. The party\u2019s co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, said it was moving faster on the climate crisis than Labour and the other parties, and was also firmly a remain party, unlike Labour. The Tory candidate in Aberdeen North has been suspended after being found to have made \u201cunacceptable\u201d comments about the Holocaust, Muslims and homosexuals. Ryan Houghton denied holding antisemitic, racist or homophobic views, saying the eight-year old posts on a martial arts forum had been taken out of context. The Lib Dems\u2019 Chuka Umunna has described Prince Andrew as a complete disgrace. McDonnell urged the Duke of York to cooperate with the authorities, but Buckland would not be drawn on the prince\u2019s conduct, saying the focus should be on the victims. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has mocked Boris Johnson for refusing to debate her or to facilitate a second independence referendum. She tweeted: \u201cIs this the \u2018die in a ditch\u2019 definition of \u2018never\u2019?\u201d Scotland\u2019s Catholic voters will be advised to elect MPs \u201cwho reflect as closely as possible their beliefs\u201d, in a pastoral letter from bishops which will be read out at all 500 Catholic churches this weekend. In the letter, the bishops will also warn that \u201ca creeping intolerance towards religious belief\u201d has become \u201ca part of life\u201d. The letter urges voters to seek candidates\u2019 views on a variety of issues, including abortion, assisted dying and heterosexual marriage, as well as poverty and nuclear weapons. It\u2019s quite hard to think of many Westminster candidates who will tick all of the bishops\u2019 boxes, but perhaps readers can pitch in with a few suggestions. Kezia Dugdale, the former leader of the Scottish Labour party, has provided some insights into how politicians prepare for debates \u2013 and score points \u2013 ahead of tonight\u2019s head-to-head between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. Louis Stedman-Bryce, Scotland\u2019s only Brexit party MEP, has announced that he is leaving the party because \u201cI find myself in a situation where my personal values are now in direct conflict with the party\u201d. In a video posted on Twitter, Stedman-Bryce explains that he feels the party has \u201crepeatedly failed to deliver\u201d its promises on Brexit, and adds: The Brexit party\u2019s recent decision to select a Scottish candidate who has openly posted homophobic views across social media is not only a betrayal of LGBT community but of everyone who believes such divisive and hateful views have no place in society. Last night, the Brexit party withdrew support from its Glenrothes candidate, an evangelical pastor called Victor Robert Farrell, who Stedman-Bryce is referring to. He said he would continue to represent those in Scotland who had voted for him, as an independent MEP. The Evening Standard has an exclusive on measures to tackle knife crime that will be included in the Tory manifesto. It says the measures will include: Three-times-faster charging and prosecution times of knife offenders to act as a better deterrent. Anyone caught with a knife will be arrested, charged within 24 hours and in court within a week. A new form of court order called a serious violence reduction order allowing police to search habitual knife carriers in the street without requiring suspicion. It could be used against acid and guns, as well as blades. The Conservatives have been keen to appear tough on crime in this election. Earlier today they announced their plan for whole-life terms for people found guilty of the premeditated murder of a child. During conference season they talked about stopping the release of the most serious violent and sexual offenders at the halfway point of their sentence, while the home secretary, Priti Patel, told criminals: \u201cWe are coming for you.\u201d Boris Johnson has also talked tough on crime, vowing to put more police on the streets, increase use of stop and search, and incarcerate more offenders with longer sentences. During a phone-in on Friday, Johnson claimed an increase in stop-and-search operations when he was London mayor between 2008 and 2016 had allowed 11,000 knives to be taken off the streets. However, this was a total that included weapons seized through means other than stop and search. Meanwhile Johnson has been doing a photoshoot at a boxing gym (don\u2019t know whether this is obligatory in this election \u2013 Jo Swinson has already done her own). For what it\u2019s worth, his technique could do with some \u2013 make that a lot of \u2013 refinement. Nigel Farage gives a speech in Peterborough. You can watch it below. First questions to the shadow chancellor are from the press. Q The Greens are pledging \u00a3100bn a year for 10 years to achieve zero carbon by 2030. That is also a Labour aspiration (the 2030 target). Is the Green estimate of the cost correct? A Labour will have a green transformation fund of \u00a3250bn over 10 years plus another \u00a3250bn through a National Investment Bank. We will also harness the resources of the finance industry. In some ways the figures we are working with are similar to the Greens but we will harness the finance industry with the state sector. Q How will the new regulatory system work? A We are consulting but it will include a business commission, containing a companies commission, finance commission and enforcement commission. Q Is it true you are planning a windfall tax on oil companies? A No (!) Q Is there any kind of new tax on oil companies envisaged? A Wait for the manifesto but don\u2019t hold your breath. Q Will more executives end up in jail for corporate failures under Labour\u2019s new laws? A I would expect executives and others to acknowledge that time has moved on so I don\u2019t think more will go to prison. Q How important is the leaders\u2019 debate? A Jeremy will be highlighting the problems the country faces. It will enable people to see the real Jeremy Corbyn, not just the media portrayal. Q It has been reported Labour is holding an inquiry into its colonial past. Do you think Britain is guilty of crimes and should reparations be paid? A Bristol and Liverpool benefited enormously financially from slavery. It\u2019s valuable we know our history proper, not just the kings and queens. UPDATE: This afternoon Labour says McDonnell\u2019s comments about the windfall tax have been misunderstood. See 3.51pm. Labour will implement a \u201cmuch-needed\u201d overhaul of the regulatory system. The public is poorly represented on the boards of these regulators. He mentions Carillion plus \u201cscandals\u201d at Tesco and HBOS. McDonnell says regulators are failing in many instances and the media is filling the gap. Labour will overhaul company law to bring about \u201creal change\u201d in the corporate sector. It will improve long-term economic performance, tackle the climate crisis and reduce inequality. The shadow chancellor emphasises that he applauds good business practice. He concludes and will now take questions. The shadow chancellor now talks about the \u201cobscene\u201d fact that billionaires are buying access and tax breaks from the Conservatives. McDonnell says Jeremy Corbyn is on the side of the people. Labour will introduce a 20-1 pay ratio between the highest- and lowest-paid employees in the public sector as well as companies bidding for public sector contracts. It will be a statutory duty that no one in companies is paid less than the national living wage. Companies will have to set out their policies for tackling the gender and ethnic pay gaps. Under Labour the big four auditing companies will be prevented from \u201cacting as a cartel\u201d. They will not be allowed to offer other services to prevent conflicts of interest, says McDonnell. Large firms should change auditing company at least every five years. We\u2019ll regulate to ensure that auditing firms provide socially useful information. If you refresh the page you can watch McDonnell\u2019s speech live. McDonnell says the existential threat of climate change is Labour\u2019s principal priority if it enters office. Companies not taking adequate steps towards decarbonisation should be de-listed from the London stock exchange, he says. John McDonnell says a new business model is needed with partnership at its heart. Labour will rewrite the Companies Act so directors have an obligation to take into account long-term interests of shareholders, employees, the wider public and the environment. Labour will also consult on incentives to hold shares longer term, says McDonnell. He talks about inclusive ownership, giving employees collective ownership eventually of 10% of the company. He says Bernie Sanders has advocated 20% in the US. The shadow chancellor has just begun his speech on the economy, saying the unfettered pursuit of profit has been allowed to override all other factors. The relentless pursuit of shareholder profit has been to the detriment of workers and the environment, says John McDonnell. He gives Carillion and Thomas Cook, which both went into liquidation, as examples of failures caused by corporate greed. The Conservative candidate in Ashfield in Nottinghamshire (Labour majority of 441 at the last election) has suggested the way to deal with problem tenants is to house them in tents, wake them up at 6am and then get them to pick vegetables followed by a cold shower, BuzzFeed reports. This is an interesting observation from Sky News\u2019s economics editor about the Green party\u2019s manifesto. Says something about the degree to which the other parties \u2013 including the Tories, eager to proclaim the end of austerity \u2013 are competing on public spending. It feels like every time a Green politician is questioned during this election campaign they are asked about how they can get the message across that they are the party to be trusted to tackle the climate crisis, given movement by the other parties \u2013 particularly Labour \u2013 on the issue. The party\u2019s co-leader Jonathan Bartley addressed the issue of differentiation with Labour this morning, not just on the climate emergency, but also Brexit. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Our proposals today are very much about remaining in the EU, another point of differentiation with Labour, but also transforming the country, getting to that net zero target by 2030. Looking at every sector of the economy, spelling out how we need to decarbonise and what kind of investment is going to be needed, being honest about that investment. He added: When there\u2019s a war, when we\u2019re facing an existential threat, we don\u2019t hold back. We know that we have to tackle it. Frankly, if the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now. Bartley said the party wanted to introduce a frequent flyer levy and was against airport expansion. You can read more about the Greens\u2019 manifesto, which is launched today, below. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has just taken a dig at Boris Johnson for refusing to debate her or facilitate a second independence referendum. Boris Johnson is interviewed in a number of Scottish papers this morning \u201csnubbing\u201d the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, by refusing to debate. He told the Daily Record: Although she can be very influential on our politics, she has no seat in the House of Commons nor can she be prime minister. The candidate to be prime minister who Nicola Sturgeon would support is Jeremy Corbyn. That is why he is the appropriate person to debate. The interview took place yesterday just as the SNP and Lib Dems\u2019 unsuccessful court action to participate in the ITV leaders\u2019 debate was concluded, a decision the SNP has described as a \u201cdemocratic disgrace\u201d. Sturgeon threw down the gauntlet to Johnson to debate her during last month\u2019s independence rally in Glasgow\u2019s George Square, but I also remember her telling reporters after Johnson\u2019s first visit to Scotland as prime minister, back in July, that she had suggested a TV debate on independence to him then, and he had sounded so interested that his aides had blanched at the prospect. The PM has obviously changed his mind since then \u2026 Sarah Wollaston, who switched from the Tories to the Lib Dems via Change UK, and who is a GP, has raised questions about the government\u2019s attempt to tackle the staffing crisis by agreeing a deal to pay doctors\u2019 pensions bills this year, a move which could cost hundreds of millions of pounds (see 9am update). This takes the biscuit for the most unusual politics story of the day so far \u2026 although it does make a serious point about fake news. Doctors\u2019 groups have begun responding to the emergency scheme ministers and NHS chiefs have come up with to stop what critics call the \u201cNHS pensions tax trap\u201d deterring hospital consultants and GPs in England from working extra shifts this winter. The British Medical Association, which represents about 70% of the UK\u2019s doctors, has given the proposal a cautious welcome. Under it, doctors who work enough hours this year (2019-20) to then receive a hefty bill linked to the rising value of their pension will have that bill in effect paid for by the NHS. The unprecedented move could cost the NHS between tens and hundreds of millions of pounds. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the BMA\u2019s ruling council, said: These proposals under discussion could, if properly implemented, provide the respite needed to enable significant numbers of doctors to increase the work they are doing, giving vital patient care at a time of unprecedented demand. However, we don\u2019t yet have important details about how such a scheme will work; details that are crucial to the BMA and to the tens of thousands of doctors that we represent in order to provide the necessary reassurance that doctors can take on additional work without this resulting in any financial penalty. We look forward to having those details in the very near future, and call on the next government to urgently scrap the annual allowance in defined benefit schemes such as the NHS, a solution proposed by their own advisory body, the Office for Tax Simplification. However, EveryDoctor, which campaigns to improve medics\u2019 working conditions in the NHS, dismissed the plan as a \u201cshort-term fix\u201d that would not solve the problem of an estimated 40% of doctors reducing their workloads in order to avoid being hit by a bill for up to \u00a3100,000. A spokesperson said: The pressures on the NHS are no longer isolated to the winter months. We are in a constant, spiralling recruitment crisis and the NHS is 10,000 doctors short. Vast swathes of UK doctors have been forced out of work by the 2016 punitive tax rules. A short-term fix to cover the winter period will not solve this problem. The government instead needs to create a long-term, sustainable solution which safeguards the NHS and its hard-working staff. The Green party is formally launching its manifesto this morning. The centrepiece will be a pledge to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2030. In an election broadcast later today, the party\u2019s sole MP, Caroline Lucas, will tell voters that the 12 December election offers \u201cthe greatest \u2013 perhaps the last \u2013 opportunity to change course\u201d for the UK. You can read more about the Green party\u2019s manifesto below. Q Do you need to get rid of billionaires to help others? A John McDonnell says people are understandably upset that the wealthiest are getting tax breaks. \u00a3100bn has been given away in tax cuts, it\u2019s gone to corporations, cuts to capital gains tax, inheritance tax and the highest rate of income tax. Q The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the headline figure \u2013 \u00a3100bn \u2013 about tax cuts for the wealthiest is wrong as some have benefited people who are not so well off. A McDonnell insists the figure is not wrong. Q The Phones 4u billionaire, John Caudwell, says he can\u2019t tolerate \u201cspiteful envy\u201d. A McDonnell says tell Caldwell to come see him and he\u2019ll explain Labour\u2019s policies to encourage entrepreneurship. It\u2019s a misunderstanding by Caldwell, the shadow chancellor suggests. Q Is student debt going to be addressed? A It has to be addressed by whoever is in government. He declines to say whether or not it will be cancelled. Q Are your policies on cracking down on foxhunting etc a \u201ctownie\u2019s policy\u201d? A It\u2019s making sure the hunting ban is adhered to. That concludes the interview. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is on the Today programme now. Q Is it correct to say no one should be a billionaire? A We need to attack the gross levels of inequality through a fair taxation system. Q How flat should society be? A Most of us will think on the one hand you\u2019ve got 150 billionaires and on the other hand people queueing at food banks and that\u2019s not fair. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, appeared to rule out giving MPs a free vote on overturning the foxhunting ban if the Conservatives win a majority at the general election. The controversial offer made by the former prime minister Theresa May in the 2017 Tory manifesto was dropped swiftly after her poor performance at the election. Buckland told Sky News he thought it was unlikely Boris Johnson would revive the controversial issue. Foxhunting was banned through legislation introduced by the Blair government in 2004. Buckland said: I don\u2019t see a return to that at all. I think the agenda has moved on. We are now talking in our own policies about strong animal welfare measures. We are cracking down on issues like live transport. We are dealing with trophy hunting, the keeping of primates as pets. He added that he believes Johnson has an \u201cauthenticity\u201d on environmental issues that is an \u201cimportant hallmark\u201d of his leadership. The Lib Dem justice spokesman, Dr Phillip Lee, is also doing the media rounds this morning. He told the Today programme the staffing crisis in the NHS will get worse if Brexit goes ahead (quotes from PA Media). We can see that there is a clear staffing crisis in the NHS and this is being exacerbated by the prospect of Brexit. In my own professional experience I meet many doctors over the years who are trained in the EU and indeed nursing staff and I think if we proceed with Brexit, the staffing crisis will get worse. So by investing extra money, by remaining within the EU, Liberal Democrats will protect the NHS. The Lib Dems say they would boost the NHS by raising income tax by a penny if they gained power. Asked about the prospect of the Lib Dems winning, Lee added: The fact that we\u2019re on 20 MPs and to get to 326 is quite a target, yes. We will get to the other side of the election and if the Conservatives haven\u2019t got a majority then discussions will take place, but we will take each issue as it comes and vote accordingly and we will not be putting Jeremy Corbyn into No 10 \u2026 We do have a choice not to put either of the two prime ministers into No 10, which is why we think that there should be more of an offer put to the public in terms of who should be prime minister. Another interesting front page from Scotland: You can read the story here. The shadow justice secretary, Robert Buckland, was asked about Prince Andrew on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said it was not appropriate for him to comment. By contrast, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told Sky News: I think he [the Duke of York] should cooperate with all the authorities and make sure justice is served. The Lib Dems\u2019 Chuka Umunna went even further on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. Good morning. This is Haroon Siddique taking over the blog until about 1pm-ish GMT when Andrew Sparrow will be in. If you want to catch my attention the best way is by tweeting me @Haroon_Siddique. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are doing the rounds for the Conservatives and Labour respectively this morning. Buckland will be talking, among other things, about the Tory pledge of a whole life term for adults who commit the premeditated murder of a child McDonnell will be talking about the super-rich and the tax breaks they have enjoyed under the Tories. Just back to the election debate tonight for a moment, and although Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson lost their bid to be included in ITV\u2019s programme tonight, there will be other debates later in the campaign. Swinson is due to take part in a three-way debate with Johnson and Corbyn hosted by Sky on 28 November. The following day, the BBC will host a seven-way debate in Cardiff between leaders or senior figures from the seven major political parties. And the BBC will then host a \u201cprime ministerial debate\u201d on 6 December from Southampton between Corbyn and Johnson. Away from the main parties: Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, will today call for immigration powers to be devolved from Westminster to to Scotland. The Green party will launch its election manifesto today, stressing its status as the only major party committed to zero carbon emissions by 2030. Here\u2019s one more front page that I didn\u2019t link to earlier \u2013 The Scotsman. It quotes Boris Johnson: \u201cI will never go on a TV debate with Sturgeon\u201d. And here\u2019s a taste of what Guardian comment writers are saying: Suzanne Moore has written why voting in this election feels like \u201cclinging to the wreckage of a system we should dismantle. All the issues that really matter require cooperation, not silly, point-scoring conflict.\u201d You can read John Crace\u2019s take on Boris Johnson\u2019s bumbling speech at the CBI in which he shelved planned corporation tax cuts (\u201cthe less effort he was seen to make, the more the public seemed to like him\u201d). Polly Toynbee has written about the poverty crisis and why the PM doesn\u2019t care. Two other stories in brief that you can get stuck in to to start your election day: Momentum is scaling up for a \u201conce in a generation chance\u201d to change the country with a sophisticated online and doorstep campaign that borrows ideas from the US and an innovative use of WhatsApp. Labour will pledge to close loopholes used to hunt foxes, hares and deer as it launches its animal welfare manifesto. The Tories will make a push on law and order today as they pledge that adults (over 21) who commit the premeditated murder of a child (under 16) will be given tougher sentences of life without parole. The current rules require the murder to be of multiple children or to be sexually or sadistically motivated. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, said it was his aim to stop the parents of murdered children seeing the \u201csickening\u201d spectacle of their killers walking free. Labour\u2019s focus today will be on skewering Boris Johnson on what it describes as the Tories\u2019 \u00a3100bn tax giveaway to billionaires. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will tell a campaign event in central London that Labour intends to \u201crewrite the rules of our economy\u201d. He outline party analysis that claims to show 48 of the country\u2019s 151 billionaires have donated to the Tories since 2005 while the government is on course to hand out \u00a3100bn in tax breaks and other giveaways by 2023-24. \u201cSomeone on the national minimum wage would have to work 69,000 years to get paid \u00a31bn and a newly qualified nurse would have to wait 50,000 years. No one needs or deserves to have that much money. It is obscene,\u201d he will say, telling his audience that Boris Johnson is on the side of \u201cthe billionaires, the bankers and big business\u201d. You can read the full story about McDonnell\u2019s speech here. Let\u2019s take a look at today\u2019s papers, and the Guardian splashes on the NHS staffing crisis. The FT carries a big picture of the violent crackdown in Hong Kong, but keeps its lead for Johnson shelving the corporation tax cut during a speech to the CBI yesterday (you can read John Crace\u2019s take on the PM\u2019s lacklustre performance here). The Telegraph echoes the FT, carrying a big picture from Hong Kong and a headline on the PM\u2019s speech to the CBI: \u201cJohnson accused of appeasing socialists in corporation tax U-turn\u201d. (It also headlines the continuing fallout for Prince Andrew on its front page). The i leads on the TV debate tonight between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, with the headline \u201cElection ignites\u201d. The tabloids carry varying takes on Prince Andrew. The Sun reports backers \u201cpull the plug on Prince\u201d as \u201cNet closes in on Andy\u201d. The Mirror splashes on Prince Andrew\u2019s accuser, Virginia Giuffre, filming an interview with the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme. The Express reports the Queen still backs her son. Finally, the Mail has \u201cAndrew out in the cold\u201d. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of all things politics today, as we count down to the first leaders\u2019 election debate tonight (well, two leaders anyway \u2013 more on that later). I\u2019ll be looking after the blog for the first hour or so of the day before handing over to colleagues. Feel free to get in touch: alison.rourke@theguardian.com. First up and NHS bosses have made a dramatic intervention into the campaign, with nine out of 10 saying the staffing crisis is endangering patients. Almost 60% believe this winter will be the toughest yet for the service. It may scare the horses in the Tory campaign where there is concern that the growing crisis in the health service risks derailing the party\u2019s Brexit-dominated campaign. That\u2019s unlikely to be helped today by the Lib Dem policy pledge add an extra \u00a335bn for health and social care over the next five years, by adding a penny to the basic rate of income tax. It puts the Tories in third place, pledging to spend \u00a3140.3bn on the NHS up to 2023-24, with the Lib Dems on \u00a3142.2bn and Labour in front on \u00a3143.5bn. No doubt this will get a fair amount of attention at tonight\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate on ITV at 8pm. You will only be seeing Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, after Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson lost their court bid to appear. You can read Peter Walker\u2019s guide to what to expect in the debate here, including the key subjects (Brexit, the economy, the NHS and personal character) and the curly questions for the PM (Jennifer Arcuri, how many children does he have) and Corbyn (antisemitism). You can also start to get ready for your own election bingo. Walker says a drink isn\u2019t mandatory for every repetition the the phrases, but it could be helpful. Here\u2019s his list, feel free to let us know if you have any additions: Get Brexit done. Dither and delay. Coalition of chaos. Propped up by billionaires. Many, not the few. Forty new hospitals. British Broadband. Now on to the rest of the day.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over which of them is best placed to safeguard the NHS if they win the general election, with the Labour leader accusing the prime minister of being ready to sell it off to US corporations. In a testy live debate on ITV, during which the prime minister repeatedly returned to the claim that he would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, both men lavished praise on the NHS, but Corbyn said Johnson would put it up for sale. Throughout the debate, Johnson continually tried to bring the focus back to Brexit, on which Corbyn repeatedly declined to say how he would campaign in a second EU referendum, while the Labour leader attacked the prime minister over the NHS and public services. At one point, the audience openly laughed at Johnson when he agreed that the truth mattered in the election. The Conservatives came under fire during the debate when it rebranded its CCHQ Twitter account as \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d and used it to pump out a series of pro-Tory messages. As both parties tried to seize the initiative over the NHS, Corbyn at one point brandished a document he claimed showed that US negotiators hoped to secure full access to Britain\u2019s health sector as part of a bilateral trade deal after Brexit. \u201cFull market access for US products to our National Health Service. You\u2019re going to sell our National Health Service to the United States and big pharma,\u201d he accused Johnson. Johnson replied: \u201cThis is an absolute invention. It is completely untrue. Under no circumstances whatever will this government, or any Conservative government, put the NHS on the table in any trade negotiation. Our NHS will never be for sale. \u201cWe will continue to fund the NHS massively, as we are. We can only do so because we have a strong and dynamic economy.\u201d And he sought to suggest that Labour\u2019s radical reforms to the economy would wreck the public finances. \u201cWhat could be more ruinous for the NHS than a crackpot plan for a four-day week,\u201d he said, referring to the aim of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, to reduce working hours across the economy over the next decade. Corbyn also picked up Johnson for repeating the heavily disputed claim that the government was \u201cbuilding 40 new hospitals\u201d. The Labour leader said the Tory plans affected only six existing hospitals. Johnson rejected this, but added: \u201cYes, it is true, we are starting with six, but the seed funding has gone in for 40 new hospitals.\u201d Johnson repeatedly returned to Brexit throughout the hour-long debate, stressing that all 635 of his party\u2019s candidates supported his withdrawal agreement and promising to leave the EU by the end of January. Corbyn challenged Johnson\u2019s timetable, arguing that it would take much longer to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get it done in a few months, and you know that perfectly well,\u201d he said. In return, the prime minister repeatedly asked Corbyn to answer the question of whether he would support a Brexit deal. Labour\u2019s policy is to negotiate a new deal with the EU27 within three months of taking office and put it to the public in a referendum within six months, along with the option to remain in the EU. Corbyn firmly declined to say which side he would take in that referendum, instead insisting he wanted to bring the country together and would abide by whatever decision voters made. At one point, as he insisted his position was clear, mocking laughter rippled through the audience. And Johnson said in his closing statement that if the Labour leader could not answer the question of which side he would campaign on, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit to lead our country\u201d. But Johnson provoked laughter from the audience himself when he was asked by the debate\u2019s host, Julie Etchingham:\u201d \u201cDoes the truth matter in this election?\u201d and he replied: \u201cYes, I think it does.\u201d Afterwards, senior Tory and Labour figures did battle in the spin room over who won the debate, claiming the audience was laughing loudest at their political opponents. The cabinet minister Michael Gove repeatedly mocked Corbyn\u2019s plans for a four-day working week and claimed the Labour leader would soon be out of a job. \u201cIt is the case that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position on the four-day week inspired laughter and his position on Brexit inspired laughter,\u201d he said. Barry Gardiner, a shadow cabinet minister, emphasised the audience scorn for Johnson\u2019s truthfulness, saying: \u201cPeople looked at the prime minister and thought: how can we believe a word he said? How can we believe the manifesto when it comes out? He promised we would come out on 31 October and he would die in a ditch if we didn\u2019t. It\u2019s just lie after lie after lie.\u201d During what was styled as a \u201cquickfire round\u201d of questions from viewers, the duo were first asked if the monarchy was \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. Corbyn responded: \u201cIt needs a bit of improvement,\u201d bringing some cheers from the audience. Johnson said: \u201cThe institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach.\u201d Asked the same question about Prince Andrew, in the wake of his BBC interview about his links to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Corbyn said: \u201cBefore we discuss Prince Andrew, I think we should discuss the victims that were there because of what Epstein was doing. I think there are very, very serious questions that must be answered, and nobody should be above the law, but the primary position ought to be the proper treatment of those people who were victims of this most appalling behaviour by Jeffrey Epstein and many others.\u201d Johnson said, more briefly: \u201cI think all our sympathies should be, obviously, with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and the law must certainly take its course.\u201d With election day just over three weeks away, and the Conservatives maintaining a double-digit lead in most national polls, Corbyn hoped the debate would help him to close the gap. In his closing statement, he urged the public to register to vote and said: \u201cI ask that you vote for hope, and vote for Labour, on 12 December.\u201d Asked by an audience member what non-political Christmas present they would leave under the tree for each other, Jeremy Corbyn said he would give the prime minister a copy of Charles Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol. Johnson initially said he would give the Labour leader a copy of his Brexit deal but, urged to set politics aside, he suggested a pot of damson jam.",

The deceitful Tory mantra about \u201cget Brexit done\u201d \u2013 a con that has received all too little scrutiny \u2013 was slapped down: it would mean at least seven years to negotiate a US trade deal, retorted Jeremy Corbyn. Remember when Theresa May\u2019s \u201cstrong and stable\u201d provoked audience groans? The same fate befell Johnson\u2019s signature slogan. In a genuine moment of TV drama, Corbyn produced a redacted document on secret trade talks between British civil servants and the Trump administration threatening the NHS.</p> \n<p>But his trickiest moment centred on what Tory pollsters have identified as his weakness: which side would he campaign on during the referendum? Though strong on the need to unify remainers and leavers, he needs a clearer answer: that politicians have mucked Brexit up and so the people must sort it.</p> \n<p>Johnson suffered audience ridicule when he was challenged over personal integrity, but Corbyn\u2019s strongest lines came on the Tory damage inflicted on the NHS \u2013 emotionally referring to the case of a dead cancer patient \u2013 and the suffering inflicted by austerity. Although there was no knockout blow, Corbyn hit Johnson with plenty of zingers, though he could have done more to challenge Johnson on rampant Tory Islamophobia and Johnson\u2019s broken sacred 31 October Brexit deadline. But with Corbyn the election underdog, a post-debate YouGov poll suggesting a draw is a win for the Labour leader \u2013 and should buoy his supporters.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> \n<h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland\" title=\"\">Jonathan Freedland</a>: </strong>Johnson looked more assertive</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"117c52c7d315726d79637a9160e44d9c0ace45d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/117c52c7d315726d79637a9160e44d9c0ace45d0/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Jonathan Freedland\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>ITV billed its debate in the manner of a boxing bout \u2013 Johnson v Corbyn \u2013 but neither landed the knockout blow the teams in their corners longed for. And yet, if the collective view eventually declares this contest a draw, that will not dismay the prime minister\u2019s team too much: given the Tory lead in the national polls, an outcome that maintains the status quo will suit them fine. It was Labour that needed to shake things up, with a Corbyn performance so spellbinding it forced voters to take a second look, shaking up the campaign. Though the Labour leader had some good moments, he did not deliver that.</p> \n<p>Johnson had the clearer plan: to haul the conversation back to Brexit no matter what the topic. Whether it was the NHS or antisemitism in Labour, the prime minister wanted to keep punching the bruise of Corbyn\u2019s noncommittal stance on Europe, his refusal to say whether he would campaign to leave or remain in the second referendum Labour would hold if elected. He did it again and again, eliciting groans from the audience. He won\u2019t mind if there was a groundhog day quality to his answers: he had one message to ram home and he did it.</p> \n<p>Corbyn\u2019s preferred terrain was the NHS, and he made the case well, making an emotional plea on behalf of a friend who died just the day before from breast cancer. His answers on Prince Andrew \u2013 putting Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims first \u2013 and the institution of monarchy were better too.</p> \n<p>But he showed a curious lack of fight. Johnson repeatedly exposed weak flanks that a more combative opponent would have pounded relentlessly, but Corbyn held back. A question on integrity should have been the cue for an attack on Johnson\u2019s personal record of lies and deception, but Corbyn stayed mute.</p> \n<p>US political operatives say presidential debates \u2013 which this was in all but name \u2013 are gladiatorial affairs, whose impact on the viewer is almost as great with the sound off as with the sound on.

      "bodyText": "Owen Jones: No knockout blow, but plenty of zingers for Corbyn Brexit was supposed to be Boris Johnson\u2019s strongest suit, and yet even here he had moments where he came unstuck. The deceitful Tory mantra about \u201cget Brexit done\u201d \u2013 a con that has received all too little scrutiny \u2013 was slapped down: it would mean at least seven years to negotiate a US trade deal, retorted Jeremy Corbyn. Remember when Theresa May\u2019s \u201cstrong and stable\u201d provoked audience groans? The same fate befell Johnson\u2019s signature slogan. In a genuine moment of TV drama, Corbyn produced a redacted document on secret trade talks between British civil servants and the Trump administration threatening the NHS. But his trickiest moment centred on what Tory pollsters have identified as his weakness: which side would he campaign on during the referendum? Though strong on the need to unify remainers and leavers, he needs a clearer answer: that politicians have mucked Brexit up and so the people must sort it. Johnson suffered audience ridicule when he was challenged over personal integrity, but Corbyn\u2019s strongest lines came on the Tory damage inflicted on the NHS \u2013 emotionally referring to the case of a dead cancer patient \u2013 and the suffering inflicted by austerity. Although there was no knockout blow, Corbyn hit Johnson with plenty of zingers, though he could have done more to challenge Johnson on rampant Tory Islamophobia and Johnson\u2019s broken sacred 31 October Brexit deadline. But with Corbyn the election underdog, a post-debate YouGov poll suggesting a draw is a win for the Labour leader \u2013 and should buoy his supporters. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland: Johnson looked more assertive ITV billed its debate in the manner of a boxing bout \u2013 Johnson v Corbyn \u2013 but neither landed the knockout blow the teams in their corners longed for. And yet, if the collective view eventually declares this contest a draw, that will not dismay the prime minister\u2019s team too much: given the Tory lead in the national polls, an outcome that maintains the status quo will suit them fine. It was Labour that needed to shake things up, with a Corbyn performance so spellbinding it forced voters to take a second look, shaking up the campaign. Though the Labour leader had some good moments, he did not deliver that. Johnson had the clearer plan: to haul the conversation back to Brexit no matter what the topic. Whether it was the NHS or antisemitism in Labour, the prime minister wanted to keep punching the bruise of Corbyn\u2019s noncommittal stance on Europe, his refusal to say whether he would campaign to leave or remain in the second referendum Labour would hold if elected. He did it again and again, eliciting groans from the audience. He won\u2019t mind if there was a groundhog day quality to his answers: he had one message to ram home and he did it. Corbyn\u2019s preferred terrain was the NHS, and he made the case well, making an emotional plea on behalf of a friend who died just the day before from breast cancer. His answers on Prince Andrew \u2013 putting Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s victims first \u2013 and the institution of monarchy were better too. But he showed a curious lack of fight. Johnson repeatedly exposed weak flanks that a more combative opponent would have pounded relentlessly, but Corbyn held back. A question on integrity should have been the cue for an attack on Johnson\u2019s personal record of lies and deception, but Corbyn stayed mute. US political operatives say presidential debates \u2013 which this was in all but name \u2013 are gladiatorial affairs, whose impact on the viewer is almost as great with the sound off as with the sound on. They are, on some unstated level, about demonstrating intangible qualities of strength and vigour, and by that measure Johnson probably came off a little better. He was more assertive, more focused, while Corbyn \u2013 his spectacles vaguely askew \u2013 was often hesitant and halting. That\u2019s a cruel way to judge such things, but politics is nothing if not cruel. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist Katy Balls: The most revealing part was the audience laughter The view in Conservative campaign headquarters is that the key to a successful election campaign is message discipline.

Given the chance to show off their best selves, Johnson and Corbyn had merely proved they didn\u2019t have one. The country was even more screwed than anyone had previously imagined.

His track record haunts him, and he continues to try to brazen it out \u2013 but everyone knows about the border down the Irish sea, wasting our money on garden bridges in the sky, building 40 hospitals, etc. desnol \u2018I doubt whether it will make the slightest difference\u2019 Anyone genuinely impartial could not fail to see Johnson\u2019s constant deflection, bluster and insults, by comparison Corbyn\u2019s performance was far, far better, but I doubt whether it will make the slightest difference. rosybeeme \u2018Corbyn doesn\u2019t do himself any favours\u2019 Corbyn doesn\u2019t do himself any favours. Own your stance, say you want to agree a deal, give the public a referendum and remain neutral as you want to be the PM of everyone, not a subsection of the population. Dodging the question makes you look like you have something to hide. rmw239 \u2018This is so depressing\u2019 This is so depressing. Two Brexiters, one overt and one covert, debating the colour of Brexit unicorns. Corbyn comes across as shifty and can\u2019t bring himself to say that EU membership is in the UK\u2019s national interest. nonanon1 \u2018I\u2019m somewhat concerned that more people may be distracted by Corbyn\u2019s glasses appearing to be cockeyed\u2019 Corbyn gives a good first answer on Brexit (seven years to negotiate the US trade deal) but I\u2019m somewhat concerned that more people may be distracted by his glasses appearing to be cockeyed. Corbyn\u2019s second Brexit answer points out that Johnson first voted against May\u2019s deal (twice), but he fails to point out the part where Johnson\u2019s revision includes a border down the Irish Sea. He also dodges the question Johnson obsesses about as to whether Corbyn will campaign on either side of the people\u2019s vote, for no reason I can see. Corbyn has already said he wouldn\u2019t campaign either way, that he\u2019d let the deal speak for itself. Indeed, even when Johnson asks him face-to-face, he pivots back to the NHS. Which is all well and good, but Corbyn HAS a simple response \u2026 why doesn\u2019t he use it?? Jessica Roth",

The public have increasingly turned to factchecking websites, such as the independent Full Fact, the BBC\u2019s Reality Check, Channel 4 News\u2019 FactCheck and the Guardian\u2019s Factcheck, to verify claims made by politicians. During Tuesday night\u2019s debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, the Conservative party renamed their main media account as \u201cfactcheckUK\u201d, changed its logo to hide its political origins, and used it to push pro-Conservative material to the public. Although the Twitter handle remained a s @CCHQPress, all other branding was changed to resemble an independent factchecking outlet, meaning it may not have been immediately apparent to an individual who saw the account\u2019s tweets in their feed that it was a product of Conservative party HQ. On clicking through, they would have seen a disclaimer that factcheckUK was \u201cfact checking Labour from CCHQ\u201d, \u201d the acronym for Conservative campaign headquarters.

The idea was first proposed by the rightwing Centre for Social Justice thinktank and supported by the former Conservative leader and ex-work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Johnson also set a target for anyone caught unlawfully with a knife to be immediately arrested, charged within 24 hours and in court within a week \u2013 three times faster than the current average. He said violence reduction units, staffed by the police, social services and other agencies, would be boosted by \u00a335m.

May scaled back stop and search over concerns about police overusing the powers and causing frustration in minority communities about being disproportionately targeted. Combined figures for England and Wales showed black people were 40 times more likely to be stopped than white people, up from 14 times in 2017, in the year to March 2018. However, she partially reversed that in March this year, allowing police officers in seven forces to authorise searches of suspects if they feared violent crime \u201cmay\u201d, not \u201cwill\u201d, occur. An official report in October showed people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were likely to be targeted under relaxed stop-and-search rules, despite not having committed crimes. The equality impact assessment also suggested \u201cchanges in the level of stop and search have, at best, only minimal effects on violent crime\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Claim Child murderers will spend the remainder of their days in prison and not be released from life sentences if the Conservatives are returned to power. Background The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said the Tories would change the law to ensure an adult convicted of the premeditated murder of a child is sentenced to a \u201cwhole life\u201d order, meaning they will never be eligible for parole. It is part of the party\u2019s attempt to be seen to be \u201ctough on crime\u201d \u2013 one of the most important issues for both Tory and Labour voters after Brexit and health, according to the psephologist John Curtice. There are 63 murderers being held in jail in England and Wales until their death, including Rosemary West, Levi Bellfield and Thomas Mair, who killed the Labour MP Jo Cox shortly before the EU referendum, according to the ministry of justice. Under the 2003 Criminal Justice Act, judges can already hand down whole life tariffs as the starting point of their sentencing for child murderers but only if it involves \u201cabduction of the child or sexual or sadistic motivation\u201d. The Tories say this is too restrictive and there should be no exceptions. One person whose sentence would have been affected by the Tory proposal is Ian Huntley, who murdered Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both aged 10, in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in 2002. He was sentenced one day after the 2003 act came into force but the judge ruled that he did not meet the \u201cwhole life\u201d criteria. Huntley was instead given a minimum life sentence with no eligibility for parole until 2042. Under the Tory plans, people such as Huntley would leave prison only after they died. Reality Child murder is rare. According to the latest Office for National Statistics figures, there were 67 victims of homicide under the age of 16 in the year ending March 2018.

      "body": "<p>The Greens have launched what they describe as a radical and transformative manifesto with a warning that this could be the last general election where voters can choose MPs with a realistic chance of stopping runaway climate change.</p> \n<p>Unveiling the manifesto, based on 10 proposed bills on issues including the climate emergency and an economic vision based on equality, the Green co-leaders, Si\u00e2n Berry and Jonathan Bartley, said their party was the only one taking the issue seriously.</p> \n<p>Speaking at a wildlife centre in south-west London, Bartley castigated Labour and other parties for failing to match their commitment for net zero carbon emissions by 2030, at the centre of the manifesto plan for a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s conference passed a motion making this commitment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/18/labour-persuaded-to-soften-pledge-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2030\">but it is believed</a> the party\u2019s manifesto will water this down.</p> \n<p>The green new deal would \u201cdecarbonise every sector of the economy by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain\u201d, Bartley said: \u201cOur very planet is ringing the alarm. Hitting snooze for another 15 years simply isn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p> \n<p>He continued: \u201cThe Conservatives say net zero by 2050. Not good enough. The Lib Dems say net zero by 2045. Not good enough.</p> \n<p>\u201cLabour members said net zero by 2030, but the party appears to be rowing the boat back. Not good enough. While the other parties are catching up, we\u2019re racing ahead into the distance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Berry told the launch that it was \u201cthe last election where we can take the first step down the right path, and that is what we must do\u201d.</p> \n<p>Speaking afterwards, she stressed: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get our carbon emissions down by 2030, there\u2019s a 50/50 chance of tipping into runaway climate change, which doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I was a young person worried about climate change people would say to me: \u2018You\u2019re the future, your generation can sort this out.\u2019 I can\u2019t say that to the young generation, because there isn\u2019t time for someone who is 15 now to get into power and do the things that are needed.

      "bodyText": "The Greens have launched what they describe as a radical and transformative manifesto with a warning that this could be the last general election where voters can choose MPs with a realistic chance of stopping runaway climate change. Unveiling the manifesto, based on 10 proposed bills on issues including the climate emergency and an economic vision based on equality, the Green co-leaders, Si\u00e2n Berry and Jonathan Bartley, said their party was the only one taking the issue seriously. Speaking at a wildlife centre in south-west London, Bartley castigated Labour and other parties for failing to match their commitment for net zero carbon emissions by 2030, at the centre of the manifesto plan for a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d. Labour\u2019s conference passed a motion making this commitment, but it is believed the party\u2019s manifesto will water this down. The green new deal would \u201cdecarbonise every sector of the economy by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain\u201d, Bartley said: \u201cOur very planet is ringing the alarm. Hitting snooze for another 15 years simply isn\u2019t an option.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe Conservatives say net zero by 2050. Not good enough. The Lib Dems say net zero by 2045. Not good enough. \u201cLabour members said net zero by 2030, but the party appears to be rowing the boat back. Not good enough. While the other parties are catching up, we\u2019re racing ahead into the distance.\u201d Berry told the launch that it was \u201cthe last election where we can take the first step down the right path, and that is what we must do\u201d. Speaking afterwards, she stressed: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get our carbon emissions down by 2030, there\u2019s a 50/50 chance of tipping into runaway climate change, which doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. \u201cWhen I was a young person worried about climate change people would say to me: \u2018You\u2019re the future, your generation can sort this out.\u2019 I can\u2019t say that to the young generation, because there isn\u2019t time for someone who is 15 now to get into power and do the things that are needed. It\u2019s actually up to this generation of politicians. \u201cSpecifically, it\u2019s those people elected in this election. The next set of MPs might be left with an impossible task.\u201d The green new deal would seek to deliver on the 2030 target by reshaping the economy around industries such sustainable energy. The other nine promised bills cover: A second EU referendum. At least \u00a36bn extra a year for the NHS. Scrapping university fees. A \u201csustainable economy bill\u201d to ensure the economy functions within environmental limits. A \u201cfuture generations bill\u201d, requiring decisions to consider the needs of the future. Creating a universal basic income. Building 100,000 zero-carbon social rented homes a year. Improving tenants\u2019 rights and lowering rents. Introducing proportional representation voting and an elected upper house of parliament. The Greens hope their distinct offering will cut through, amid signs the party could, as in the 2017 election, become marginalised during a tough Labour-Conservative battle. After good local election results, and an almost 12% vote share in May\u2019s European elections, the party is now polling at about 3%. Berry warned there was a danger of the Greens being squeezed but said the electoral system and wider political culture was to blame. \u201cIn general elections there\u2019s always a squeeze, a focus on the two big parties. But our system is broken,\u201d she said. Berry highlighted the first TV election debate on Tuesday, in which only Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will take part, with Berry and other leaders given a brief chance to contribute in a later programme. \u201cThe idea you\u2019re going to have two people whose views on Brexit are not that far apart, you\u2019re not going to have anyone there really holding them to account on their promises on the climate emergency, is ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real symptom of how bad our democracy is in general.\u201d The party, which has formed an anti-Brexit electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, has set its sights on eight new target constituencies, including Bristol West, Bury St Edmunds, Dulwich and West Norwood, Exeter, Forest of Dean and Isle of Wight.",

The \u201cBack Boris\u201d messaging could be counted against constituency spending limits if it were not excluded.</p> <p>Labour has spent almost five times as much, nearly \u00a315,000, pushing two adverts. The first, accounting for \u00a310,000 of spending in the opening week of the campaign, was a simple message with the slogan: \u201cTime for real change: Vote Labour.\u201d More recently, in a campaign ending on Tuesday, Labour has more explicitly campaigned on Brexit, offering a riposte to the Tory strategy, claiming: \u201cOnly Labour will give people the final say on Brexit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f693f2380d8c993db43b7c18095bbda5fca4862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f693f2380d8c993db43b7c18095bbda5fca4862/0_7_2515_1509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conservative campaigns on Facebook and Snapchat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conservative campaigns on Facebook and Snapchat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design/Guardian Design / Facebook / Snapchat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both parties have received extraordinarily good value for money on their advertising.

      "bodyText": "Labour is vastly outspending the Conservatives on Snapchat, as the two parties compete to present their message to millions of young voters through the social network. Spending just \u00a33,000 on the platform, the Tory party has been pushing its \u201cget Brexit done\u201d message to the app\u2019s audience, who are overwhelmingly under 30. The advertising, which focuses heavily on Boris Johnson, is targeted at all users over 18 \u2013 but is hidden from viewers in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as from Johnson\u2019s own constituents in Uxbridge. The \u201cBack Boris\u201d messaging could be counted against constituency spending limits if it were not excluded. Labour has spent almost five times as much, nearly \u00a315,000, pushing two adverts. The first, accounting for \u00a310,000 of spending in the opening week of the campaign, was a simple message with the slogan: \u201cTime for real change: Vote Labour.\u201d More recently, in a campaign ending on Tuesday, Labour has more explicitly campaigned on Brexit, offering a riposte to the Tory strategy, claiming: \u201cOnly Labour will give people the final say on Brexit.\u201d Both parties have received extraordinarily good value for money on their advertising. Labour\u2019s spend has bought almost 13m video views, while the Conservatives have had more than 2m. That means the parties spent around \u00a31.20 for 1,000 views of their video adverts. On Facebook, by comparison, Labour spent at least \u00a316 for 1,000 views of one of its recent adverts. Both party leaders also have profiles on the social network. Jeremy Corbyn has been active since 2016, when his Snapchat account \u2013 the first of a UK party leader \u2013 made headlines. This time round, however, the campaigning on Snapchat is more subdued: the stories format is more popular on Instagram, where Corbyn\u2019s team continues to post, while Boris Johnson\u2019s account hasn\u2019t posted since the Conservative party conference. No other major UK party has a significant presence on Snapchat. The second highest political ad spend on the platform isn\u2019t a party at all, but the non-partisan campaign group Vote For Your Future, which has spent more than \u00a310,000 on 16 adverts encouraging young people to vote. It will be the first UK election since Snapchat started publishing all political adverts posted to its platform, but the social network has already been accused of providing bad data to researchers. In the first version of its political advertising library, the social network accidentally claimed that the Conservatives were only advertising in Uxbridge \u2013 rather than excluding all their adverts from Uxbridge, as is actually the case. The campaign group Who Targets Me reported the spend as evidence that the Conservatives were worried about losing Johnson\u2019s seat, and the claim was picked up by other media groups. Following inquiries from the Guardian, Snapchat acknowledged a bug in how it had prepared the information, and updated a fixed version of the sheet. The bug had apparently been unnoticed since mid-September, when Snapchat launched the feature in a blaze of publicity. Who Targets Me was critical of the company\u2019s error. \u201cWith political parties spending more and more on online ads, and election outcomes increasingly influenced by digital tactics, it\u2019s critical that accurate, timely information on who is spending what is made publicly available,\u201d said Sam Jeffers, the group\u2019s co-founder, when the Guardian flagged the mistake. \u201cAs a small organisation working to increase ad transparency during elections, we expect big companies, with large resources, to play their part.

      "body": "<p>Tuesday evening sees the first TV debate of the 2019 election \u2013 and the first chance for the potential prime ministers to lay a glove on each other. Here\u2019s your complete guide to the format, the pitfalls, and the prizes.</p> <p><strong>What is the format of the debate?</strong></p> <p>Head to head between Johnson and Corbyn \u2013 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/18/lib-dems-and-snp-lose-high-court-bid-over-tv-election-debate\">the failure of a last-minute legal challenge</a> by the Lib Dems and the SNP as they sought to force their way into the mix. The programme starts at 8pm on ITV1.</p> <p><strong>Who is the host?</strong></p> <p>Julie Etchingham, who has become ITV\u2019s go-to host for high-profile political debates, hosting the equivalent events in the 2015 and 2017 general election. She won praise for her deft handling of this summer\u2019s Conservative party leadership head-to-head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, successfully managing to make the future prime minister stop talking by glaring silently at him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b2928212581d78d1e52eb850aedc283377dc5f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b2928212581d78d1e52eb850aedc283377dc5f7/0_44_5152_3092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Etchingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julie Etchingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Frost/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How will it work?</strong></p> <p>The hour-long debate will be conducted in front of a live studio audience of about 200 people. The two leaders will stand behind podiums, Corbyn on the left side of the screen and Johnson on the right. They will each have one minute each for their opening statements and 45 seconds for their closing statements, with Corbyn speaking first in both cases after lots were drawn. In the interim between those statements they will be asked questions posed by ITV viewers from various political backgrounds and across society, submitted after the broadcaster appealed for people to get in touch.</p> <p><strong>What will the key subjects be?</strong></p> <p><strong>Brexit</strong>: The inescapable political subject of the moment. Expect sound and fury, but pretty much no new information, with Johnson again pledging to pass his deal before Christmas and Corbyn in response explaining Labour\u2019s somewhat more complex renegotiate-and-put-to-the-people solution.</p> <p><strong>The economy</strong>: A perennial subject for election clashes, but this time with a difference. While recent elections have centred on austerity, and rolling back the state, both Corbyn and Johnson have significant investment promises to tout. Yes, the scale of the pledges are very different, and both will stress this, but they are competing on the same economic playing field.</p> <p><strong>The NHS</strong>: With a winter hospital crisis looming, it will be on voters\u2019 minds. Expect Johnson to claim he has provided funding for 40 new hospitals and Corbyn to respond \u2013 accurately \u2013 that the confirmed cash is for just six so far. This was traditionally a Labour strong point, but Johnson will hope his pledges of new spending will resonate with voters.</p> <p><strong>Character</strong>: This is a function of both the increasingly presidential style of UK politics \u2013 exemplified by the debates \u2013 and the fact that both leaders are not hugely popular with the public, in their own, differing ways.</p> <p><strong>What will each leader see as their home turf?</strong></p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: The PM will be keen to repeatedly press home his key message on Brexit \u2013 vote in a Conservative government and the UK will definitely leave by the new deadline of the end of January. Last night, he wrote to Corbyn signalling four key areas he wanted to press him on: whether he would vote to remain or leave, whether Labour wants to end free movement, whether he would be prepared to pay the EU for market access and whether he could guarantee every Labour candidate supports the leader\u2019s Brexit policy.</p> <p><strong>Corbyn</strong>: Public services and austerity. The Labour leader knows that voters can see with their own eyes the way the libraries, schools, youth services and the NHS have changed under 10 years of tight spending, and might be sceptical about Conservative claims that they are the people to change this. He is also likely to highlight his new policy on free broadband for all and commitments to nationalising utilities and the railways, which polling and focus groups suggest go down well with voters.</p> <p><strong>Which questions will they dread?</strong></p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: For the PM, it could become very uncomfortable if he is pressed on either of two personal issues: his relationship with the US tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, and how many children he has fathered. The answer will be straightforward \u2013 no comment \u2013 but on both he is vulnerable. In particular, voters might find it eye-opening that their prime minister refuses to be pinned down on even a basic element of his family biography.</p> <p><strong>Corbyn</strong>: Labour\u2019s record on tackling antisemitism seems certain to be raised, but it is a hugely difficult area. Corbyn can, as he does when it is raised, insist he opposes all forms of racism and is doing all he can to root out antisemitism among members. But when your party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">faces a formal investigation</a> from the equalities watchdog, and groups of celebrities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/concerns-about-antisemitism-mean-we-cannot-vote-labour\">write to newspapers</a> urging people to not vote Labour because of it, this is very perilous ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/errongordon/status/1196456593342238721\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The stage is set (almost) for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ITVdebate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ITVdebate</a> tomorrow at 8pm <a href=\"https://t.co/PcL6go4U0e\">pic.twitter.com/PcL6go4U0e</a></p>&mdash; Erron Gordon (@errongordon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/errongordon/status/1196456593342238721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>How have they prepared?</strong></p> <p>Preparing a candidate for a major TV debate is about 80% hard work, with the remainder a mixture of good luck and plain guesswork. Ahead of the debates, the former Labour spinner Theo Bertram <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theobertram/status/1196479637817298946\">tweeted his reminiscences</a> of grooming Gordon Brown for the 2010 version, calling it \u201cPMQs on steroids\u201d, with the team trying to anticipate every potential avenue.</p> <p>Neither side has commented publicly on their preparation. Johnson is reportedly working with Brett O\u2019Donnell, a US Republican strategist who helped him before the 2016 Brexit referendum, with Michael Gove taking the place of Corbyn in mock debates.</p> <p>Corbyn is reported to have eschewed any outside help, and is preparing with the same core team of leader\u2019s office advisers he uses for prime minister\u2019s questions.</p> <p><strong>Who will declare victory?</strong></p> <p>Aides from all parties \u2013 including those not taking part \u2013 are likely to be in the backstage \u201cspin room\u201d to give reaction and try to convince journalists that their candidate won. But increasingly the real post-debate analysis is played out on social media. Candidates will be desperate to avoid giving an answer that their opponents can clip into a negative viral video, which could reach a larger audience than the original broadcast \u2013 and seeking to crowbar in their own preferred 15-second zingers for the same purpose.</p> <p><strong>Best outcome</strong></p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: A bore-fest. Genuinely. The PM\u2019s advisers are aware that as the incumbent and the leader in the polls, he has much more to lose.

      "bodyText": "Tuesday evening sees the first TV debate of the 2019 election \u2013 and the first chance for the potential prime ministers to lay a glove on each other. Here\u2019s your complete guide to the format, the pitfalls, and the prizes. What is the format of the debate? Head to head between Johnson and Corbyn \u2013 after the failure of a last-minute legal challenge by the Lib Dems and the SNP as they sought to force their way into the mix. The programme starts at 8pm on ITV1. Who is the host? Julie Etchingham, who has become ITV\u2019s go-to host for high-profile political debates, hosting the equivalent events in the 2015 and 2017 general election. She won praise for her deft handling of this summer\u2019s Conservative party leadership head-to-head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, successfully managing to make the future prime minister stop talking by glaring silently at him. How will it work? The hour-long debate will be conducted in front of a live studio audience of about 200 people. The two leaders will stand behind podiums, Corbyn on the left side of the screen and Johnson on the right. They will each have one minute each for their opening statements and 45 seconds for their closing statements, with Corbyn speaking first in both cases after lots were drawn. In the interim between those statements they will be asked questions posed by ITV viewers from various political backgrounds and across society, submitted after the broadcaster appealed for people to get in touch. What will the key subjects be? Brexit: The inescapable political subject of the moment. Expect sound and fury, but pretty much no new information, with Johnson again pledging to pass his deal before Christmas and Corbyn in response explaining Labour\u2019s somewhat more complex renegotiate-and-put-to-the-people solution. The economy: A perennial subject for election clashes, but this time with a difference. While recent elections have centred on austerity, and rolling back the state, both Corbyn and Johnson have significant investment promises to tout. Yes, the scale of the pledges are very different, and both will stress this, but they are competing on the same economic playing field. The NHS: With a winter hospital crisis looming, it will be on voters\u2019 minds. Expect Johnson to claim he has provided funding for 40 new hospitals and Corbyn to respond \u2013 accurately \u2013 that the confirmed cash is for just six so far. This was traditionally a Labour strong point, but Johnson will hope his pledges of new spending will resonate with voters. Character: This is a function of both the increasingly presidential style of UK politics \u2013 exemplified by the debates \u2013 and the fact that both leaders are not hugely popular with the public, in their own, differing ways. What will each leader see as their home turf? Johnson: The PM will be keen to repeatedly press home his key message on Brexit \u2013 vote in a Conservative government and the UK will definitely leave by the new deadline of the end of January. Last night, he wrote to Corbyn signalling four key areas he wanted to press him on: whether he would vote to remain or leave, whether Labour wants to end free movement, whether he would be prepared to pay the EU for market access and whether he could guarantee every Labour candidate supports the leader\u2019s Brexit policy. Corbyn: Public services and austerity. The Labour leader knows that voters can see with their own eyes the way the libraries, schools, youth services and the NHS have changed under 10 years of tight spending, and might be sceptical about Conservative claims that they are the people to change this. He is also likely to highlight his new policy on free broadband for all and commitments to nationalising utilities and the railways, which polling and focus groups suggest go down well with voters. Which questions will they dread? Johnson: For the PM, it could become very uncomfortable if he is pressed on either of two personal issues: his relationship with the US tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, and how many children he has fathered. The answer will be straightforward \u2013 no comment \u2013 but on both he is vulnerable. In particular, voters might find it eye-opening that their prime minister refuses to be pinned down on even a basic element of his family biography. Corbyn: Labour\u2019s record on tackling antisemitism seems certain to be raised, but it is a hugely difficult area. Corbyn can, as he does when it is raised, insist he opposes all forms of racism and is doing all he can to root out antisemitism among members. But when your party faces a formal investigation from the equalities watchdog, and groups of celebrities write to newspapers urging people to not vote Labour because of it, this is very perilous ground. How have they prepared? Preparing a candidate for a major TV debate is about 80% hard work, with the remainder a mixture of good luck and plain guesswork. Ahead of the debates, the former Labour spinner Theo Bertram tweeted his reminiscences of grooming Gordon Brown for the 2010 version, calling it \u201cPMQs on steroids\u201d, with the team trying to anticipate every potential avenue. Neither side has commented publicly on their preparation. Johnson is reportedly working with Brett O\u2019Donnell, a US Republican strategist who helped him before the 2016 Brexit referendum, with Michael Gove taking the place of Corbyn in mock debates. Corbyn is reported to have eschewed any outside help, and is preparing with the same core team of leader\u2019s office advisers he uses for prime minister\u2019s questions. Who will declare victory? Aides from all parties \u2013 including those not taking part \u2013 are likely to be in the backstage \u201cspin room\u201d to give reaction and try to convince journalists that their candidate won. But increasingly the real post-debate analysis is played out on social media. Candidates will be desperate to avoid giving an answer that their opponents can clip into a negative viral video, which could reach a larger audience than the original broadcast \u2013 and seeking to crowbar in their own preferred 15-second zingers for the same purpose. Best outcome Johnson: A bore-fest. Genuinely. The PM\u2019s advisers are aware that as the incumbent and the leader in the polls, he has much more to lose. While some enormous perceived own-goal for Corbyn would, of course, thrill the Conservatives, the main aim is to escape without any damage and stress key messages on Brexit and an end to austerity. Corbyn: The Labour leader would love the questions to skirt briefly over Brexit and be dominated by voters furious at run-down public services and crumbling schools and hospitals. In an ideal world, Johnson would come across as deeply out of touch, or glib, and unable to defend his character. Worst outcome Johnson: Repeated questions about his personality, tangled personal life or his decidedly unimpressive record as foreign secretary. The Conservatives have, to an extent, shielded the PM from intense scrutiny so far in the election, but this will now end. Corbyn: The Labour leader is arguably struggling to spark Labour\u2019s campaign in quite the way he did in 2017, and a notably flat or edgy performance, especially one plagued by questions over antisemitism and infighting in Labour could spell trouble. Labour are not currently picking up the extra support they need, and this is a key opportunity to change this. Most likely outcome A score draw. The narrative of British election debates is arguably over-reliant on the 2010 examples, where Nick Clegg helped the Lib Dems rise in the polls. However, since then they have generally been underwhelming, featuring highly drilled candidates repeating the same catchphrases to general indifference from the watching public. This time could be different, but the odds are against. Catchphrase bingo A drink is not mandatory on each repetition, but could be helpful. Get Brexit done. Dither and delay. Coalition of chaos. Propped up by billionaires. Many, not the few. Forty new hospitals. British Broadband.",

The findings came days after the latest official figures showed that hospitals\u2019 performance against key waiting times for A&amp;E care, cancer treatment and planned operations had fallen to its worst ever level. However, many service chiefs told the confederation that delays will get even longer when the cold weather creates extra demand for care. \u201cThere is real concern among NHS leaders as winter approaches and this year looks particularly challenging,\u201d said Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the confederation, which represents most NHS bodies, including hospital trusts, in England. \u201cHealth leaders are deeply concerned about its ability to cope with demand, despite frontline staff treating more patients than ever. \u201cThere is the very real prospect of gaps in clinical shifts and patients not receiving the quality of care they need because NHS trusts do not have the staff they need.\u201d \u201cDespite doing everything within their power, 90% of health leaders we surveyed said that understaffing was putting patients at risk. \u201cWe have 100,000 clinical vacancies [in England] and the prospect of ever-rising demand unless we face up to the scale of the challenge,\u201d added Dickson. Last week\u2019s figures showed that one in four people who attend a hospital-based A&amp;E are waiting more than four hours to be dealt with, record numbers are having to wait on a trolley while they are found a bed and seven of the eight clinically vital cancer treatment targets are being missed. Dickson added that, even if the next government provided more money to tackle widespread staff shortages, it would take time to reduce the high vacancy rates that are common in many hospitals. The NHS is short of about 43,000 nurses and almost 10,000 doctors as well as paramedics and other health professionals. He warned political parties not to raise voters\u2019 expectations unreasonably in the run-up to polling on 12 December about how quickly the NHS can get back on track. \u201cMore investment is needed but even with that this is a system that will take time to turn around and the electorate must not be fed with overpromises over the coming weeks,\u201d he said. The King\u2019s Fund voiced concern at the results of the research. \u201cAmidst the political rhetoric of the general election campaign, these findings underline the stark reality facing patients across the country who are struggling to access NHS services,\u201d said Sally Warren, the thinktank\u2019s director of policy. \u201cWorkforce shortages are already having a direct impact on the quality of people\u2019s care, with national patient surveys repeatedly highlighting difficulties for patients accessing NHS services and performance against key waiting time targets at their worst in over a decade. \u201cThese NHS leaders are correct \u2013 without urgent action patient safety will be at risk.\u201d The confederation\u2019s survey of 131 hospital bosses also found that: 76% say staff shortages are the NHS\u2019s most pressing problem. 83% say the dispute over senior doctors\u2019 pensions is making understaffing even worse. 69% say doctors deciding to work fewer hours is damaging patient care. 98% say the deepening crisis in social care is leading to more older people needing hospital care.",
