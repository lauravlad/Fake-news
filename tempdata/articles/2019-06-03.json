The far right \u2013 directly emboldened and legitimised by Trump \u2013 is on the ascendancy from Brazil to Hungary, Spain to Sweden. In our country, the hard-right Brexit party is on the rise: Ann Widdecombe, one of their leading lights, this weekend suggested that \u201cscience may produce an answer\u201d to being gay, underlining how this political force threatens to reopen debates about the rights of minorities which were supposedly settled long ago. The anti-Muslim bigotry so vulgarly displayed by Trump is on the rise across the western world: in our own country, the Tories are infested with Islamophobia, and much of our media promote and incite it. Trump\u2019s administration has led a full-frontal assault on trans people, from banning trans soldiers from serving, to attempting to define trans people out of existence. But let\u2019s not pretend that anti-trans bigotry isn\u2019t rampant in the British media: it has even been indulged even in supposedly liberal media. A possible war with Iran beckons: in a fateful echo of the calamitous invasion of Iraq, the risk of British involvement is clearly high. The British government has stood along the US presidency in backing and arming the Saudi dictatorship to the teeth as it rains bombs on Yemen, plunging the country into the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth. A climate emergency \u2013 worsened by Trump pulling the US, the biggest polluter in human history, out of the Paris agreement \u2013 threatens us all, but that doesn\u2019t mean Britain should not be taking far more radical action. There are direct and immediate dangers, of course. The US ambassador made it clear that a trade deal would put our NHS on the block, to be chopped up and fed to hungry, circling US multinationals. Under our own Trump \u2013 and the president has anointed his mini-me, Boris Johnson, as May\u2019s successor \u2013 a no deal threatens to reduce Britain to a vassal of the US, with workers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rights and environmental protections tossed on a bonfire. These protests won\u2019t simply be about Trump and the perverse reality TV show he\u2019s treated the world to ever since he fatefully declared for the presidency. The protests will be about Trumpism: about confronting a resurgent global far right, defending the rights of women and minorities, fighting the climate emergency, opposing the threat of war, and standing against an attempt to gut the NHS and trash hard-won rights and freedoms. Trump will have left our shores by Wednesday: sadly, our own Trumpism will remain and, in the coming months, we must continue to fight it. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",
