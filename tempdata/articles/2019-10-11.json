      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a quick summary of what happened this afternoon. Boris Johnson has signalled to the EU that he would make a major U-turn on his plans for the Irish border to successfully secure a 48-hour window of intensive negotiations over a potential Brexit deal. EU diplomats gave the green light to a weekend of talks after being told by the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that Johnson seemed to better understand the importance of not having a customs border on the island of Ireland. Boris Johnson declined to say whether Northern Ireland would definitely leave the EU\u2019s customs union when asked. \u201cI think it would be wrong of me to give a running commentary on the negotiations,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the greatest possible respect I think, look at everything I\u2019ve said previously. I think you can draw your own conclusions from that. But let our negotiators get on.\u201d The DUP has said it will only support a Brexit deal that is in Northern Ireland\u2019s \u201clong-term economic and constitutional interests\u201d. Leader Arlene Foster said the party would exercise its \u201cconsiderable influence\u201d in Parliament to stand up for the region. She said her party was clear the UK must leave the EU as \u201cone nation\u201d and that no barriers to trade could be erected within the UK. She also stressed the importance of Northern Ireland giving democratic consent to any arrangement that might align the region with specific sectors of the single market. Jeremy Corbyn would be likely to step down as Labour leader if the party loses the next election, John McDonnell has said. In an interview with Tony Blair\u2019s former spokesman, Alastair Campbell, in GQ, the shadow chancellor also said that in such an event he would also probably quit his role. McDonnell also raised the possibility of Labour potentially supporting a second Brexit referendum before a general election, an idea popular with some Labour MPs but so far resisted by Corbyn and his team. The DUP have issued an interestingly positive seeming statement \u2013 The pound had its biggest two-day rally against the dollar since the Brexit vote as hopes rose that a deal could be struck before the deadline later this month, my colleagues Richard Partington and Graeme Wearden report. Sterling climbed to the highest level in three months against the US currency, briefly hitting $1.27, amid mounting optimism in the City, after the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said talks could progress to the next phase. The pound has risen four cents against the dollar since Thursday, when Boris Johnson and the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, agreed there was a \u201cpathway to a possible Brexit deal\u201d. That is the sharpest two-day rise in the pound since the EU referendum more than three years ago. You can read the full story here \u2013 The government has announced it has signed contracts with ferry operators Brittany Ferries, DFDS, P&amp;O and Stena Line to provide freight capacity in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The deals will be worth up to \u00a386.6m if the UK leaves the bloc without an agreement. An early termination fee of \u00a311.5m will be paid to the firms if a Brexit deal is agreed. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: The UK is getting ready to leave the EU on October 31 and, like any sensible government, we are preparing for all outcomes. Our decisive action means freight operators will be ready and waiting to transport vital medicines into the country from the moment we leave. In May, then-transport secretary Chris Grayling was forced to cancel ferry contracts signed to ensure critical imports could reach the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit, when the date of Brexit was pushed back from 29 March to 31 October. The contracts worth \u00a389m with Brittany Ferries and DFDS were designed to secure ferry space for vital goods across the Channel. The cancellation resulted in a termination payout of \u00a343.8m to the firms, along with costs taking the final bill over \u00a350m. The prime minister visited a school in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire today \u2013 Dominic Grieve\u2019s constituency \u2013 which ITV\u2019s Paul Brand says has prompted speculation that he could be planning to stand there in the next election. Johnson only has a majority of 5,000 in his Uxbridge seat. The Sunday Times reported last week that the Liberal Democrats would stand aside in Beaconsfield to help Grieve, the former Conservative attorney general, now an independent, to retain his seat. Boris Johnson visited St Mary and All Saints C of E Primary School, where he admitted to the Bucks Free Press that some schools had fallen behind as a result of under funding. The BBC is reporting that the aerospace, automotive, chemicals, food and drink and pharmaceutical sectors have written to the prime minister to express concern that Boris Johnson\u2019s negotiators have dropped commitments to maintain regulatory alignment. They are concerned that the UK might no longer participate in specific EU regulatory institutions after any Brexit deal. In a pooled television clip following a visit to a school on Friday, Boris Johnson declined to say whether Northern Ireland would definitely leave the EU\u2019s customs union when asked. \u201cI think it would be wrong of me to give a running commentary on the negotiations,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the greatest possible respect I think, look at everything I\u2019ve said previously. I think you can draw your own conclusions from that. But let our negotiators get on.\u201d Johnson said: \u201cI can certainly tell you that under no circumstances will we see anything that damages the ability of the whole of the United Kingdom to take full advantage of Brexit, and I think that\u2019s what people would expect, and that\u2019s what I think we can achieve.\u201d He added: \u201cWhere Leo Varadkar and I got to yesterday was a joint feeling that there is a way forward, and we can see a pathway to a deal. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a done deal. So there\u2019s work to be done.\u201d Lots of chatter over what will happen now to the backstop, although no details were revealed officially today. This is from Reuters, who have spoken to sources within the European commission: A diplomat and an EU official said Barnier had told member states that Britain had changed its position to now accept that the proposed replacement to the so-called \u201cbackstop\u201d cannot erect a customs border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland. \u201cOn customs, they admitted that the solution cannot result in the creation of a border in Ireland,\u201d the diplomat said, adding that this admission was the reason Barnier gave national envoys in Brussels to justify going into intensified talks with Britain over the weekend. Separately, two senior EU diplomats told Reuters the possible solution could include two elements: keeping Northern Ireland inside the UK\u2019s customs regime and, at the same time, ensuring that customs and regulatory checks were carried out together. Under an earlier British proposal, the regulatory border would run in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. The sources said they understood that customs checks could be carried out there as well under the plan now under discussions. That marked a change from the latest EU-UK discussions when London proposed dispersed customs checks across the whole island of Ireland, which the bloc rejected as unworkable and not offering enough protection to its single market. The Federation of Small Businesses has described the agreement to intensify Brexit negotiations as a circuit breaker which offers light at the end of the tunnel. The FSB national chairman, Mike Cherry, said: After months lost in the Brexit uncertainty that has hit many of our small businesses, there finally appears to be a glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel. Positive technical talks appear to have been the circuit breaker needed to kick-start negotiations and provide a credible pathway towards a deal that avoids a no-deal Brexit on 31 October that many small businesses are simply unable to prepare for. For these small firms, averting this outcome is the only sensible way forward. It truly is crunch time now and the small business message is clear \u2013 we need intensity and determination from both the UK government and EU, in the time that is left, to get a last-minute deal done. These small businesses cannot afford to see this progress squandered and a return to the prospect of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October which would cause real harm to many small businesses. RT\u00c9\u2019s Europe editor has said the UK appears to be moving back towards the original aims of the Northern Ireland backstop. Attention will also now turn to the absence of a devolved government in Northern Ireland. And here is some more tunnel intrigue. EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has secured the agreement of the EU27 to open intensive \u201ctunnel\u201d negotiations on Boris Johnson\u2019s latest proposals in major boost for UK government. Earlier, he compared Brexit negotiations with climbing a mountain after both the UK and the EU released statements recognising that the talks were constructive. Jeremy Corbyn would be likely to step down as Labour leader if the party loses the next election, John McDonnell has said, also raising the possibility of Labour potentially supporting a second Brexit referendum before a general election. Pro-remain MPs are planning a crunch vote on a second referendum during the \u201csuper Saturday\u201d sitting of parliament, as Jeremy Corbyn comes under pressure to back another Brexit vote before an election. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior aide, is facing conflict of interest accusations over a consultancy role he undertook for a government-endorsed healthcare startup that is in position to receive a share of a new \u00a3250m flagship public fund. Boris Johnson\u2019s mother withdrew her name from a public letter expressing concerns about the poor provision of Parkinson\u2019s treatment on the NHS following an intervention from Downing Street. This is from Reuters, and suggests Macron was not fully abreast of the developments when he made these remarks: French President Emmanuel Macron hinted on Friday that the \u201cnext few hours\u201d could be crucial regarding the possibility of a breakthrough on a Brexit deal. Asked by a Reuters reporter if there was a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d regarding a Brexit agreement, Macron replied: \u201cLet us wait for the next few hours.\u201d Major investment banks said on Friday they had become more optimistic on the prospects for a Brexit deal following an upbeat meeting between Boris Johnson and [his] Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar. Macron is also due to meet German leader Angela Merkel on Sunday. The next two days will be make or break, tweets Daniel Boffey. Europarl UK has posted this informational video. Meanwhile, the tunnel debate rages on. The prime minister has said his thoughts are with those injured in a knife attack in Manchester which has seen five people taken to hospital with stab injuries. Anti-terror police are investigating. One shop worker said: A man was running around with a knife lunging at multiple people, one of which came into my store visibly shaken with a small graze. Soon after, security staff told all retail staff to close their doors and move the public to the back of the stores. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott tweeted: \u201cShocked and saddened to hear about the events that have taken place at the Arndale Centre in Manchester. I will remain closely informed and updated on the situation.\u201d Our thoughts are also with those who have been injured, and wishing them a swift recovery. My colleagues Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart report that pro-remain MPs are planning a crunch vote on a second referendum during the \u201csuper Saturday\u201d sitting of parliament next week, as Jeremy Corbyn comes under intense pressure from senior allies to back another Brexit vote before an election. The latest YouGov poll shows both the two largest parties slightly gaining ground. And now to ask, what will happen in the tunnel? Will it even be called a tunnel? This is from PA Media, confirming some of Campbell\u2019s tweets from earlier. John McDonnell has said he and Jeremy Corbyn would have to resign if Labour loses the next election. Asked by former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell whether it was \u201cpossible for him to stay on\u201d if Labour failed to win next time round, the shadow chancellor said: \u201cI can\u2019t see so.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t see... I think it is the same for my own personal position, I can\u2019t see so,\u201d he told Campbell for an interview in GQ magazine. \u201cWhat we\u2019d do is as the tradition, which is have an election for a new leader.\u201d McDonnell said he thought Mr Corbyn\u2019s successor should be a woman. \u201cI\u2019m still of the view now that whoever comes after Jeremy has got to be a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have a woman leader. If you look at the new youngsters that have come through, they are fantastic.\u201d This will be the first time Boris Johnson\u2019s negotiators will enter the tunnel, and it was not smooth going for his predecessors. However, it allowed for an agreement to be reached. It was an unseasonably warm and sunny October day when the idea of the \u2018tunnel\u2019, the secretive negotiating phase from which Wednesday\u2019s deal has emerged, was first raised with EU ambassadors in Brussels. The UK government had been keen to open \u201ctunnel\u201d negotiations with the commission on the detail of a deal, and this will be seen as a sign that progress is being made with the EU. These intensive talks are now set to be held in the days befire the summit on 17 and 18 October. The tunnel is Brussels jargon for discussions held among a small group of negotiators in complete secrecy, with no press briefings or documents published, meaning that the offers and counter-offers are not disclosed \u2013 unless they are leaked. Even ambassadors of the EU27 would not be kept informed of the progress, as they are regularly with Brexit negotiations, and the results would be presented as a joint proposal. The Irish Times has reported that when a journalist asked a European commission official where the tunnel was, they replied: \u201cThe tunnel is not a place, but a state of mind.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Katya Adler tweets that EU diplomats fear Boris Johnson could pull out of negotiations even after securing a concession. Here are some further thoughts and insights from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates. Although we haven\u2019t seen the full quotes, Alastair Campbell has suggested that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told him that he and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would step down if they lost the next general election. The next leader must also be a woman, McDonnell said in an as yet unpublished GQ interview, according to Campbell. McDonnell also confirmed to Tony Blair\u2019s former spin doctor that there must be a second referendum, as well as a general election. Corbyn said in his speech yesterday that an election must come before any further referendum. Campbell also tweets that McDonnell claimed parliamentary democracy and the rule of law is under threat. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has also welcomed a \u201cconstructive meeting\u201d in Brussels. A government spokesman said: \u201cSteve Barclay had a constructive meeting with Michel Barnier this morning. Michel Barnier will brief ambassadors from the EU27 this afternoon.\u201d Vintage Barnier here. The commission spokesperson declines to go into detail about the meeting. But we do have confirmation the breakfast lasted 140 minutes. After leaving the meeting, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator said: We had a constructive meeting with Steve Barclay and the British team and now I\u2019m going to debrief the 27 ambassadors and the Brexit steering group of the parliament. I\u2019ve already said that Brexit is like climbing a mountain: we need vigilance, determination and patience. A spokeswoman for the European commission has said the Barnier-Barclay meeting was constructive. \u201cWhat I can say from our side is that Michel Barnier had a constructive meeting this morning with Steve Barclay,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva. \u201cAnd now he will debrief the EU27 ambassadors... and also inform the Brexit steering group accordingly.\u201d She added: \u201cWe are working towards a deal .. If there is a will, there is a way.\u201d Speaking in Dublin, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has said he is still positive that a breakthrough can be found after his meeting with Boris Johnson yesterday. \u201cI think at this stage probably the less said the better,\u201d he said. The focus today very much switches to Brussels where Secretary [Stephen] Barclay is going to meet with Michel Barnier and I\u2019d anticipate that will lead to some more detailed proposals being made, and the possible talks to enter the proverbial tunnel, but that\u2019s kind of where things stand today. Here\u2019s the full story from Daniel Boffey in Brussels. Those Barnier/Barclay talks have come to an end. Barnier is expected to brief EU27 ambassadors on the discussions at around 11.30am UK time. Interesting spot by Roy Greenslade on the different way the Irish and English versions of the Sun regard the prospects of a deal: Here\u2019s the full written text of Tusk\u2019s statement on Brexit: Let me conclude with Brexit. Prime Minister Johnson promised the EU to come forward with a solution that would work for all. A solution that would not only satisfy the hardcore Brexiteers, but also solve our well known and legitimate objectives: to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to ensure the integrity of the Single Market. Unfortunately, we are still in a situation in which the UK has not come forward with a workable, realistic proposal. A week ago I told PM Johnson that if there was no such proposal by today, I would announce publicly that there are no more chances \u2013 because of objective reasons - for a deal during the incoming European Council. However, yesterday when the Irish Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister met they both saw - for the first time - a pathway to a deal. I have received promising signals from the Taoiseach that a deal is still possible. Technical talks are taking place in Brussels as we speak. Of course, there is no guarantee of success and the time is practically up. But even the slightest chance must be used. A no deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU. The head of the European council, Donald Tusk, has urged the Brexit negotiators not to waste the \u201cslightest chance\u201d of a deal. Speaking in Nicosia after meeting the Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades, Tusk said: A week ago I told Prime Minister Johnson that if there was no such proposal by today I would announce publicly that there are no more chances, because of objective reasons, for a deal during the upcoming European council. However yesterday when the Irish taoiseach and the UK prime minister met, they both saw for the first time a pathway to a deal. I have received promising signals from the taoiseach that deal a still possible. Technical talks are taking place in Brussels as we speak. Of course, there\u2019s no guarantee of success and the time is practically up. But even the slightest chance must be used. Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, said he is hopeful talks between Barnier and Barclay will yield a positive outcome. Speaking to Ireland\u2019s Newstalk, Donohoe said: What happened yesterday was a positive discussion but the real detail discussion will begin now and that will be in Brussels. Hopefully the meeting and the process today will be positive. Barnier, Barclay and Tim Barrow, the UK ambassador to the EU, all looked fairly jolly before their talks at the European commission HQ in Brussels. The pro-Brexit Tory MP Nigel Evans has said members of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Conservative MPs could vote for concessions on Northern Ireland if the Democratic Unionist party was in favour. \u201cI think it is very difficult to get it through without the DUP, but we have seen a shift from the DUP already,\u201d he said, according to PA Media. \u201cAnd if the DUP are in favour of it, it\u2019d be very difficult for the ERG to go against.\u201d Evans said the ERG had not been briefed on the exchanges between Johnson and Varadkar. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at the detail - none of us know. \u201cI believe it is three-dimensional poker and we\u2019re playing very high risk stakes here. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I think there\u2019s a realisation by the European Union that Boris Johnson, completely different to Theresa May, is prepared to leave the European Union on October 31, unlike the March 29 deadline, which was movable.\u201d ITV\u2019s Joe Pike has been told that the Labour defector, Angela Smith, now a Liberal Democrat MP, plans to stand against Graham Brady, the acting chair of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs. She faces a tough battle: in 2017 Brady secured a majority of more than 6,000 votes over Labour, with the Lib Dems a distant third. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, sees an opening in all the speculation about compromises. And Leave.EU, the pro-Brexit group that Farage founded, reckons Johnson has \u201cblinked\u201d. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, says the cabinet has been briefed on what was agreed between Johnson and Varadkar. But he has been giving nothing away in a round of broadcast interviews. \u201cI had a very nice briefing this morning which was very much appreciated,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Asked what the reason was for optimism following the meeting, he said: \u201cIt does not benefit anyone to have a running commentary on live negotiations.\u201d Welcome to a Friday edition of Politics live after an unexpectedly positive Brexit meeting between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar. Positive but also very private \u2013 it is unclear even whether the UK cabinet has been briefed on the detail of what was discussed. The two leaders agreed a delphic joint statement after their meeting at a wedding hotel in Wirral. Andrew Sparrow, who is taking a well-earned break from liveblogging duty, has a helpful guide on what the joint statement could mean. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has just started talks in Brussels with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to see if they can build on whatever was agreed by Johnson and Varadkar. The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, has hinted that Johnson compromised on a proposal to give the suspended Stormont assembly a say every four years on Northern Ireland staying in the the European single market for goods but leave the customs union. Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland, he said: \u201cWhat I\u2019m committing to is that we are not going to have one party having a veto over any element of this situation.\u201d Downing Street pointed out that so few people had been briefed about what was proposed that any comments about what could be involved is just speculation.",

Politicians were rated from 0% to 100% based on 16 key parliamentary votes that would affect the UK\u2019s carbon emissions. The votes were chosen by the Guardian and DeSmog UK with additional consultations with Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and other sources. A detailed breakdown of the methodology can be found here. The Guardian also compiled publicly available information about donations, salaries, gifts and other interests registered by MPs that are linked to the fossil fuel industries. The analysis has already provoked strong reactions from some MPs, while others \u2013 even those with modest scores \u2013 recognised it was an important exercise that would stimulate debate between voters and the people who represent them. The sole criteria in assessing MPs\u2019 scores was whether their votes were likely to increase or reduce emissions. So, votes for fracking and Heathrow expansion were considered negative because those bills encouraged more carbon-intensive gas production and airline travel. But votes for onshore wind and subsidies for renewable energy were deemed positive because those bills would have accelerated the shift to a low-carbon economy. For this analysis, a vote for nuclear power was judged positive in purely climate terms, even though there are many other serious environmental and economic concerns about this form of energy. Motions passed without a recorded vote could not be included in the scores. In addition, the Guardian looked at information taken from the parliamentary register of MPs\u2019 interests that showed donations, salaries or benefits from fossil fuel companies, aviation firms or individuals and organisations that deny the need for urgent climate action. The results are not intended as the final word on whether an MP is for or against climate action, and there are limitations to the methodology used. For example, it is difficult to quantify the work politicians do in committees, mobilising colleagues, spending time on climate issues or speaking out in the House of Commons. Individual MPs\u2019 votes are also heavily influenced by the party whip. Yet academics and campaigners said they hoped the analysis would spur a debate about why parliament is not doing more to cut the UK\u2019s emissions. \u201cEvery MP will look at this list and say: \u2018Why am I there?\u2019 They will have to justify their position,\u201d said Rebecca Willis, a research associate at Lancaster University who has studied parliamentary attitudes on global warming. The analysis also comes at a critical moment, before a likely general election that could leave the winning party in power until 2025 \u2013 halfway through the decade in which scientists warn that humankind must make a decisive shift away from fossil fuels and other sources of carbon emissions. The current government already claims to be on the right path and political parties across the spectrum express support for radical action. Yet the the Guardian\u2019s analysis shows Tory MPs have frequently voted down short-term practical measures to reduce emissions, for example through home heating efficiency or renewable energy subsidies, while lending their support to fracking and airport expansion. The Conservatives have the worst record of any party, with an average score of 17%. Despite Labour\u2019s relatively high score of 86%, the party\u2019s record was more mixed when it was in power in 2008-10. A year after pushing through the landmark Climate Change Act, Gordon Brown\u2019s government voted against the 10:10 climate campaign and blocked a bill that would have made airport expansion more difficult. The Conservatives, who were then in opposition, supported both measures because their leader David Cameron wanted to create an image of a greener party.

Some relatively green Conservative MPs, such as Peter Bottomley (23%), Sarah Newton (15%), Peter Aldous (23%) and James Heappey (0%), have low scores because they were only eligible for a handful of votes, and in those they stuck to the party line. Other more climate sceptical MPs \u2013 most notably Owen Paterson (42%) \u2013 scored relatively highly because he has been in the house long enough to have been part of Cameron\u2019s green Tory rebranding. Similarly, some Labour MPs have higher scores because they have only voted in opposition, while the stalwart environmental campaigners Kerry McCarthy (86%) and Mary Creagh (78%) fell short of a perfect mark because they stuck to the party line over the 10:10 campaign and airport expansion. Ed Milliband scored 78% although, as author of the 2008 Climate Change Act, he has arguably achieved as much as any MP in promoting emissions cuts. MPs who have a strong record on the environment said privately they were glad parliamentarians were being held to account on their climate voting records, though this could never be a perfect measure.",

      "bodyText": "Conservative MPs are almost five times as likely to vote against climate action as legislators from other parties, a Guardian analysis of 16 indicative parliamentary divisions over the past decade has revealed. The Tories also registered many more donations, shares, salaries, gifts and tickets to sporting events from fossil fuel companies, petrostates, aviation companies and climate sceptics, according to declarations made in the parliamentary record of MPs\u2019 interests between 2008 and 2019. The Guardian, in collaboration with the investigative environmental journalism group DeSmog UK, rated MPs from 0% to 100% based on 16 parliamentary votes since 2008. The selection sought to cover a range of measures that would affect the UK\u2019s carbon emissions, with an emphasis on votes where MPs were willing to break ranks and put the climate before their party. The analysis shows that although most politicians publicly express support for ambitious long-term climate targets, when it comes to short-term measures to reduce the UK\u2019s carbon footprint, those in power are less likely to make this a priority. The scores are not intended to be a definitive evaluation of an MP\u2019s green credentials \u2013 both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrat parties complained they had been hard done by. But experts said the scores were an important tool for voters to make a choice through a climate prism with a potential general election looming. Boris Johnson was among several dozen MPs, mostly Conservatives, who recorded the worst possible score of zero. Although the prime minister has at various times said it was important to cut emissions, records show he voted five times against bills or amendments that could have had a positive climate impact. He was also among 10 ministers who received donations or gifts from oil companies, airports, petrostates, climate sceptics or thinktanks identified as spreading information against climate action. The average voting score of Johnson\u2019s cabinet was 17%, compared with the Labour shadow cabinet score of 90%. The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, scored 92%. Labour MPs were far less likely than Conservatives to receive gifts or money related to fossil fuel interests. This is partly because they are in opposition and tend to rely more on donations from trade unions. One of the MPs most consistently opposed to measures to tackle climate change was Sammy Wilson, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) politician who notoriously organised a \u201cClimate Fools\u2019 Day\u201d parliamentary event in 2010 that gathered sceptic MPs. The MP who received legitimate donations from the widest range of denialist and fossil fuel sources was the former international trade secretary Liam Fox. For the emissions-related votes, Conservative MPs averaged 17%, while non-Conservatives scored 80% on average. This breaks down as Labour 86%, Liberal Democrats 51%, Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru 100%, Change UK 59% and the DUP 62%. Sinn F\u00e9in had no score because its MPs boycott parliament. The average MP\u2019s score was 50%. Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, scored 50%, largely because Lib Dem MPs were often whipped to vote alongside the Conservatives during the 2010-15 coalition government.

But while it is quite possible that they will eventually take control of the Conservative party, they are not running it at the moment.</p> <p>Dominic Cummings is no free-market zealot, and he is targeting Blue Labour voters: economic interventionists but social conservatives \u2013 people who loathe City bankers and want more money spent on the NHS, but are hardliners on law and order, believe in the nation state and are strongly attached to their own communities.</p> <p>David Cameron appealed to socially progressive neoliberals; Johnson, as was obvious to anyone watching last week\u2019s Conservative conference in Manchester, has turned this strategy on its head. On the Monday afternoon the chancellor, Sajid Javid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/30/conservatives-pledge-raise-national-living-wage-by-2024\" title=\"\">announced plans</a> for a higher minimum wage. The next morning, the home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/priti-patel-unveils-county-lines-crackdown\" title=\"\">Priti Patel</a>, was telling criminals she was coming to get them.</p> <p>Speaking at a fringe meeting, the former Tory minister David Willetts said: \u201cThe strategy is to shift the party\u2019s electoral base away from remain-voting areas \u2013 such as Winchester and Guildford \u2013 to Brexit-voting Labour areas in the Midlands and the north. What these potential Tory voters want is the welfare state, higher public spending and the unfreezing of working-age benefits.\u201d</p> <p>And that is what Johnson and Cummings are offering them. The biggest annual increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/sajid-javid-promises-decade-renewal-sets-out-post-brexit-spending\" title=\"\">public spending</a> for more than 15 years involves more money for the NHS, schools and the police. Tax cuts are being planned, even though this will mean breaking the government\u2019s own budget-deficit rules.</p> <p>This has caused some confusion among the government\u2019s political opponents. For years the left has said austerity wouldn\u2019t work, and that a more activist fiscal policy would lead to stronger growth and \u2013 eventually \u2013 a lower deficit. It is something of a back-handed compliment to Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell that the Conservatives are now copying their ideas. There is, though, little point in branding Johnson\u2019s economic policy rightwing when it clearly isn\u2019t.</p> <p>Needless to say, Johnson\u2019s approach has plenty of flaws. The ditching of austerity comes after nine years of cuts. Much damage has been caused, especially in those parts of \u201cforgotten Britain\u201d where low-income jobs are rife.</p> <p>With cynicism about politics running high, voters may join the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/no-deal-brexit-would-push-national-debt-to-levels-last-seen-in-60s\" title=\"\">experts</a> at the Institute for Fiscal Studies in wondering how long the spending splurge will last. History suggests it will be until the first budget after the general election, because governments like to get the tough measures out of the way early in a parliament\u2019s life.</p> <p>The Tories also poll badly with younger voters, in large part because they have feather-bedded owner-occupiers and pensioners at the expense of renters and people of working age. Javid\u2019s pledge to lower the age for the adult minimum wage from 25 to 21 is an acknowledgement of this weakness.</p> <p>But Labour needs to take the threat posed by Johnson seriously. For a start, the Conservatives are focusing on voters in the <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/02/04/labours-path-to-vicotry-is-through-leave-voting-conservative-marginals/\" title=\"\">seats</a> where the election will be won and lost. Of Labour\u2019s 45 target seats in England and Wales, all but 10 voted leave in the 2016 referendum. Similarly, 16 of the 25 most vulnerable seats Labour is defending voted leave, with four in England and five in Scotland voting remain.</p> <p>An often heard argument is that loathing of the Conservatives will mean the Labour heartlands stay loyal. But many of the seats up for grabs have wafer-thin majorities. For Johnson to win, he doesn\u2019t need Labour voters to defect en masse; he simply needs a thousand or so in each constituency to stay at home.</p> <p>Corbyn did much better than expected in 2017, in part because his anti-austerity message resonated and in part because he managed to get the debate off Brexit. By doing so, he was able to disguise the fragility of the coalition between Labour\u2019s blue- and white-collar constituencies.</p> <p>That\u2019s not going to be so easy to pull off this time. The coming election will be dominated by Brexit, and Labour \u2013 despite Corbyn\u2019s efforts \u2013 will fight it as a more overtly remain party. Labour is now two parties: a middle-class party dominated by people who see politics through the prism of identity and a working-class party dominated by people who see politics through the prism of class.</p> <p>Johnson thinks he can exploit the fact that Labour\u2019s two wings no longer speak the same language by promising to deliver Brexit, bang up more criminals, build more hospitals and abolish poverty pay.

      "bodyText": "The 2017 general election was a disaster for Theresa May. She lost the Conservative party\u2019s overall majority, lost what leverage she had in the Brexit negotiations, and lost the argument to a Labour party campaigning with a simple message: for the many, not the few. But the dark cloud of Tory gloom had a silver lining: the party gained half a dozen seats in areas that had hitherto been seen as Labour fiefdoms. Stoke-on-Trent, Mansfield, Derbyshire North East and Walsall North were never supposed to go Conservative, but in 2017 they did. Building on those modest successes is now central to Boris Johnson\u2019s election strategy, and anybody who thinks the prime minister will go to the country on a platform of deregulation and devil-take-the-hindmost free-market capitalism really hasn\u2019t been paying attention for the past three months. To be sure, there are Tories who would like nothing better than to take an axe to the state and make London the wild west for footloose global capital. But while it is quite possible that they will eventually take control of the Conservative party, they are not running it at the moment. Dominic Cummings is no free-market zealot, and he is targeting Blue Labour voters: economic interventionists but social conservatives \u2013 people who loathe City bankers and want more money spent on the NHS, but are hardliners on law and order, believe in the nation state and are strongly attached to their own communities. David Cameron appealed to socially progressive neoliberals; Johnson, as was obvious to anyone watching last week\u2019s Conservative conference in Manchester, has turned this strategy on its head. On the Monday afternoon the chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced plans for a higher minimum wage. The next morning, the home secretary, Priti Patel, was telling criminals she was coming to get them. Speaking at a fringe meeting, the former Tory minister David Willetts said: \u201cThe strategy is to shift the party\u2019s electoral base away from remain-voting areas \u2013 such as Winchester and Guildford \u2013 to Brexit-voting Labour areas in the Midlands and the north. What these potential Tory voters want is the welfare state, higher public spending and the unfreezing of working-age benefits.\u201d And that is what Johnson and Cummings are offering them. The biggest annual increase in public spending for more than 15 years involves more money for the NHS, schools and the police. Tax cuts are being planned, even though this will mean breaking the government\u2019s own budget-deficit rules. This has caused some confusion among the government\u2019s political opponents. For years the left has said austerity wouldn\u2019t work, and that a more activist fiscal policy would lead to stronger growth and \u2013 eventually \u2013 a lower deficit. It is something of a back-handed compliment to Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell that the Conservatives are now copying their ideas. There is, though, little point in branding Johnson\u2019s economic policy rightwing when it clearly isn\u2019t. Needless to say, Johnson\u2019s approach has plenty of flaws. The ditching of austerity comes after nine years of cuts. Much damage has been caused, especially in those parts of \u201cforgotten Britain\u201d where low-income jobs are rife. With cynicism about politics running high, voters may join the experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies in wondering how long the spending splurge will last. History suggests it will be until the first budget after the general election, because governments like to get the tough measures out of the way early in a parliament\u2019s life. The Tories also poll badly with younger voters, in large part because they have feather-bedded owner-occupiers and pensioners at the expense of renters and people of working age. Javid\u2019s pledge to lower the age for the adult minimum wage from 25 to 21 is an acknowledgement of this weakness. But Labour needs to take the threat posed by Johnson seriously. For a start, the Conservatives are focusing on voters in the seats where the election will be won and lost. Of Labour\u2019s 45 target seats in England and Wales, all but 10 voted leave in the 2016 referendum. Similarly, 16 of the 25 most vulnerable seats Labour is defending voted leave, with four in England and five in Scotland voting remain. An often heard argument is that loathing of the Conservatives will mean the Labour heartlands stay loyal. But many of the seats up for grabs have wafer-thin majorities. For Johnson to win, he doesn\u2019t need Labour voters to defect en masse; he simply needs a thousand or so in each constituency to stay at home. Corbyn did much better than expected in 2017, in part because his anti-austerity message resonated and in part because he managed to get the debate off Brexit. By doing so, he was able to disguise the fragility of the coalition between Labour\u2019s blue- and white-collar constituencies. That\u2019s not going to be so easy to pull off this time. The coming election will be dominated by Brexit, and Labour \u2013 despite Corbyn\u2019s efforts \u2013 will fight it as a more overtly remain party. Labour is now two parties: a middle-class party dominated by people who see politics through the prism of identity and a working-class party dominated by people who see politics through the prism of class. Johnson thinks he can exploit the fact that Labour\u2019s two wings no longer speak the same language by promising to deliver Brexit, bang up more criminals, build more hospitals and abolish poverty pay. Will it work? The idea of the Conservatives \u2013 bankrolled by hedge funds, and viscerally anti-union \u2013 as the party of the working class should be beyond parody. It has to be said, though, that many Labour MPs \u2013 especially those in the north \u2013 don\u2019t exactly seem to be relishing the prospect of an election. \u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor",
