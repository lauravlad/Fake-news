Here we have got very strong evidence that a high-fibre diet, which for the majority of people is at least high-ish in carbohydrates, has an enormous protective effect \u2013 a wide range of diseases including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/diabetes\">diabetes</a>, cardiovascular disease and cancer benefit from a high-carbohydrate diet.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he said it would not end the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/15/us-researchers-seek-to-end-carbs-v-fat-diet-wars\">diet wars</a>\u201d, because there were so many vested interests involved. \u201cIt\u2019s twofold. There is the commercial vested interest, which there is an enormous amount of from chefs and celebrity chefs and so on. And there is also the professional vested interest.\u201d This included some doctors and scientists, he said.</p> \n<p>The review found that we should be eating at least 25g to 29g of fibre a day, with indications that over 30g is even better.

      "bodyText": "Eating more fibre, found in wholegrain cereals, pasta and bread as well as nuts and pulses, will cut people\u2019s chances of heart disease and early death, according to a landmark review commissioned by the World Health Organization. The authors of the review, which will inform forthcoming WHO guidelines, say their findings are good news \u2013 but incompatible with fashionable low-carb diets. The research is led by Prof Jim Mann\u2019s team at the University of Otago in New Zealand, who also carried out the major review that informed WHO guidance on curbing sugar in the diet, leading to sugar taxes around the world. Sugar is a \u201cbad\u201d carbohydrate, but fibre is found in \u201cgood\u201d carbohydrates such as wholegrain bread and oat-based muesli. However, the overwhelming backlash against sugar has led to popular diets that reject carbohydrates, including the fibrous sort that can, say the scientists, save lives. Mann told the Guardian that the research \u201cdoes contribute to the debate considerably. Here we have got very strong evidence that a high-fibre diet, which for the majority of people is at least high-ish in carbohydrates, has an enormous protective effect \u2013 a wide range of diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer benefit from a high-carbohydrate diet.\u201d But he said it would not end the \u201cdiet wars\u201d, because there were so many vested interests involved. \u201cIt\u2019s twofold. There is the commercial vested interest, which there is an enormous amount of from chefs and celebrity chefs and so on. And there is also the professional vested interest.\u201d This included some doctors and scientists, he said. The review found that we should be eating at least 25g to 29g of fibre a day, with indications that over 30g is even better. Most people in the world manage less than 20g. Among those who ate the most fibre, the analysis found a 15-30% reduction in deaths from all causes, as well as those related to the heart, compared with those eating the least fibre. Coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer were reduced by 16-24%. The results mean 13 fewer deaths and six fewer cases of coronary heart disease for every 1,000 people who eat high-fibre foods compared with those who do not. Minimally processed fibrous foods can also help people lose weight. \u201cThe randomised controlled trials involving an increase in the intake of whole grains showed reduction in body weight and cholesterol,\u201d says the paper published in the Lancet medical journal. \u201cFibre-rich whole foods that require chewing and retain much of their structure in the gut increase satiety and help weight control and can favourably influence lipid and glucose levels,\u201d said Mann. It was very difficult to have high levels of fibre on a low-carbohydrate diet unless you took fibre supplements, said Mann. And \u201cthere isn\u2019t the huge body of evidence that we\u2019re talking about\u201d for supplements being beneficial, he said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s pretty well impossible\u201d to get enough fibre from fruit and vegetables alone. John Cummings, emeritus professor of experimental gastroenterology at the University of Dundee, one of the authors, said the study was of huge importance and the conclusions should not be thought of as \u201cjust a fad\u201d. \u201cThis is the end of 50 years of researching dietary fibre. It is a defining moment,\u201d he said. The research brings together population epidemiological studies and feeding studies and, he said, \u201cwe now know that fibre does things in the body which give us a credible explanation for how this works\u201d. \u201cWe need to get this written in stone and part of people\u2019s lives.\u201d The review found only limited evidence that diets with a low glycaemic index and low glycaemic load protected people against stroke and type 2 diabetes. Glycaemic load is a measure of how much a food will raise blood glucose levels after eating it. Low GI foods may also contain added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium, say the scientists, which makes the link less clear. The researchers investigated 185 observational studies containing data that related to 135m person years, as well as 58 clinical trials involving 4,635 adults. For every 8g increase in dietary fibre eaten per day, total deaths and incidences of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer decreased by 5-27%. Protection against stroke and breast cancer also increased. In a comment piece in the Lancet, Prof Gary Frost from Imperial College London said the analysis \u201cprovides compelling evidence that dietary fibre and whole grain are major determinants of numerous health outcomes and should form part of public health policy\u201d. But only 9% of the UK population eat the large amounts of fibre outlined in the paper, he said, and \u201cpublic health bodies face considerable challenges altering intake at the population level\u201d. Other scientists backed the findings and said the public should eat more fibre. \u201cIt is a concern that the fibre consumption in the UK is on average, currently much less than [30g a day]. It is also worrying that otherwise healthy consumers who try to follow popular diets low in carbohydrate will find it very difficult to achieve a healthy level of fibre intake,\u201d said Dr Ian Johnson, emeritus fellow at the Quadram Institute Bioscience.

It can hardly pretend shock when someone finally cuts the ribbon, as if this was the first manufactured racial panic to get out of control. Like many things that make the news, the only truly exceptional element from the St Kilda rally was the footage. Otherwise, it was almost routine. George Christensen appeared at a Reclaim Australia rally, and guested on the kind of alt-right podcast which advertises itself with imagery of gas chamber ovens. The Canadian \u201cidentitarian\u201d Lauren Southern got a red carpet treatment from the Murdoch media, but her chosen security detail was drawn from Cottrell\u2019s neo-Nazis gang as well. Pauline Hanson invited Southern to a rain-checked dinner at Parliament House, then followed up with a motion endorsing an alt-right slogan, which nearly passed the Senate on Coalition votes. I wrote last year about Quadrant magazine\u2019s approving noises for the Holocaust denier Tomislav Suni\u0107, and any time you think these people have reached rock bottom, they drill for the molten core: Dr Suni\u0107 was lately a special guest of the NSW Parliament, and addressed members of the Young Liberals at a soiree afterwards. At what point does guilt by association just become \u2026 association? This isn\u2019t some series of repeat lapsed judgements. It is a real ideological affiliation, the end-stage of the racist disease course that has afflicted Australian conservatism for decades. This is why Scott Morrison can attack the gestures on display on the weekend, but he can\u2019t attack the sentiments: because they\u2019re shared by people on his front bench. \u201cI have repeatedly asked of the crime-plagued Sudanese in particular: who let them in?\u201d asked Andrew Bolt, and that\u2019s the loudest voice on the Australian right. It\u2019s true that not every local conservative is like this. But the exceptions are marginal, or powerless, or paralysed, or can\u2019t seem to wrest the megaphone away from the bigoted. The left-wing caricature of the right-wing is that their ideas are just a series of shoddy disguises for sexism, racism and homophobia, that conservatism is the natural home of \u201chomophobic, anti-women, climate-change deniers\u201d, to quote the federal minister for women, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer. Who can say, here, that this is wrong, when so many are determined to prove it? Where else, in the English-speaking world, is still having controversies over Sambo drawings in the 21st century? If recent years are anything to go by, the difference between the right and the far-right in Australia isn\u2019t some ideological gulf. Too often, it\u2019s what people are willing to say after they\u2019ve had two beers. Richard Cooke is The Monthly\u2019s contributing editor and US correspondent. This piece was amended on 11 January, 2019 to clarify the circumstances of the LibertyFest conference. Amanda Stoker and James Paterson said they did not know Cottrell was in attendance and would not take part in an event organised by him or which involved him.",

Cormann booked a defence jet on 22 June last year to fly between Perth and Canberra to lobby for support for the now abandoned company tax plan. Cormann booked the special purpose flight after no commercial planes fitted the schedule, which included media duties in Canberra, a visit to Adelaide and then back to Perth in between parliamentary sittings, at a cost of $37,000, the ABC reported. Commercial flights for Cormann\u2019s travel between his home state of Western Australia and Canberra for parliamentary sittings usually cost no more than $3,000. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson for Christopher Pyne, whose portfolio includes responsibility for defence aircraft, told the ABC consideration for a minister\u2019s duties and the availability of commercial travel was taken into account before approval was given. Speaking to ABC TV on Friday morning, Tehan said there was no issue. \u201cThe Australian taxpayer can look at that and say it was within the rules, within the guidelines, and also he was there on business,\u201d the education minister said. Under the rules governing use of special purpose aircraft, the travel \u201cmust be for the dominant purpose of the minister\u2019s parliamentary business\u201d and \u201cmust ensure that expenses incurred provide value for money, taking into account the need to conduct the minister\u2019s parliamentary business\u201d. Cormann made the trip when the government was attempting to woo South Australian Centre Alliance senators Stirling Griff and Rex Patrick and independent senator Tim Storer to its side for the company tax plan. The government had attempted to reduce the company tax rate from 30% to 25%, but was forced to abandon the proposal after failing to gain the support of enough of the crossbench. Cormann, under the Malcolm Turnbull-led government, was the main driver of the proposal, and as leader of government business in the Senate, was tasked with negotiating with the crossbench. The plan was abandoned when Scott Morrison took over as leader, after it proved unpopular during the Longman byelection. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said she wasn\u2019t sure the spending \u201cwould pass the pub test\u201d. \u201c$40,000 sounds like a lot of money for a meeting that he was obviously very desperate to do but didn\u2019t result in very much,\u201d she told ABC Radio National on Friday.",

      "bodyText": "A no-deal Brexit would have profound economic consequences with GDP shrinking by up to 8%, putting thousands of jobs at risk, the Confederation of British Industry is to warn. The business body is urging MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s deal, describing it as a \u201csolution\u201d businesses can work with as it delivers a transition period and avoids a \u201chugely damaging cliff edge\u201d. It says if parliament does not agree, it must immediately outline its plan to avert no deal and secure British jobs. With just four days to go before the prime minister\u2019s last-ditch attempt to get parliamentary approval for her deal, the CBI is piling on the pressure to avert a no-deal outcome, which it believes would be a disaster for Britain. In a keynote speech on Friday, its director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, will call on MPs to \u201csafeguard the security and prosperity of our country\u201d and put jobs and the economy ahead of politics when they vote on Tuesday. Her plea comes a day after the car industry revealed it was already in the grip of a Brexit chill. The Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) chief executive, Ralf Speth, said the company\u2019s \u201cliquidity\u201d would be at stake in a no-deal scenario, and Honda announced it would put production on hold for six days in April because of Brexit to assess the impact of delays on the Dover-Calais freight route on its production lines. If the impact is negative, production could be paused for longer, experts believe. At a meeting of business leaders in Bristol, Fairbairn will say: \u201cNext week, they [MPs] face a test. If they meet it with yet more brinkmanship, the whole country could face a no-deal, disorderly Brexit. The economic consequences would be profound, widespread and lasting. GDP would decline by up to 8%, meaning less money for our public services and those who rely on them. \u201cBusinesses would face new costs and tariffs. Our ports would be disrupted, separating firms from the parts they need to supply their customers.\u201d With the future of the country at stake, she said it was no time for political brinkmanship. \u201cIt\u2019s too big a gamble to simply hope that parliament will blink at the brink,\u201d she will say. The consequences of the Brexit impasse are rippling beyond domestic borders. Small to medium-sized businesses say they are struggling to cope with the prospect of a cliff edge, farmers warn they could be hit by a six-month export ban to the EU and on Thursday the Japanese prime minister, on a visit to the UK, said it was \u201cthe wish of the whole world\u201d that the UK not crash out of the EU. The CBI represents most of Britain\u2019s biggest businesses and has been warning of the potentially devastating consequences of uncertainty over the future of Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU since the referendum in 2016. In December it told MPs that \u201cdespairing businesses\u201d were already triggering no-deal contingency plans with hundreds of millions of pounds of investment being relocated out of the UK. On Thursday Speth said the deal was \u201cnot perfect\u201d but that it was important to avert disaster. He said JLR, which has announced 4,500 redundancies worldwide, most from Britain, could not stockpile the 25m components it uses on its UK production lines every day. \u201cIf I miss one part, I cannot produce one car and that means [for] a stoppage of about one day I miss about \u00a380m to \u00a3100m,\u201d he told the BBC. Asked if it could result in JLR closing, he said: \u201cCan you imagine if you have losses of \u00a380m to \u00a3100m a day, how long the liquidity of the company will last?\u201d The CBI fears that MPs intending to vote against May\u2019s deal do not grasp the consequences of failing to agree a Brexit plan. Speaking at the Bristol Old Vic, before an audience of senior figures from the region\u2019s leading firms, Fairbairn will say no deal would also damage the city\u2019s burgeoning services sector. The CBI\u2019s warning about a drop in Britain\u2019s output is based on International Monetary Fund figures and chimes with analysis from the Bank of England in November, when its governor, Mark Carney, said GDP could shrink by up to 8% in 2019 while house prices could fall by a third. In the worst-case scenario, unemployment would rise to 7.5% and interest rates could reach 4% \u2013 good for savers but disastrous for borrowers whose mortgage payments could double. Fairbairn will also criticise MPs and other public figures who have blamed the nation\u2019s problems on migrants. She will say the idea that \u201cbusinesses turn to foreign labour because they are too lazy to invest in workers here\u201d is a \u201cmyth that has been gaining currency\u201d. \u201cI hear politicians say it who should know better \u2013 and pull them up on it every time \u2013 because it couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\u201d She will urge the government to rethink its post-Brexit immigration policy, which discriminates against the lower skilled and low-income workers who may \u201charvest our food, build our homes, care for us in our hospitals and [in] our old age\u201d. Fairbairn will also ask businesses to \u201cspeak up\u201d and tell the nation about the \u201cscale of overseas workers\u2019 contribution\u201d and not let lies take hold. \u201cIt is up to us,\u201d she will tell business leaders in the audience, \u201cto explain.\u201d",

Cohen said in a statement: \u201cI look forward to having the privilege of being afforded a platform with which to give a full and credible account of the events which have transpired.\u201d The New Yorker, who is to begin a three-year prison sentence in March, is a pivotal figure in investigations by the special counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, and by federal prosecutors in New York into campaign finance violations related to hush-money payments to two women who say they had sex with Trump. Elijah Cummings, the committee\u2019s chair, said the panel would avoid interfering with Mueller\u2019s investigation. \u201cWe have no interest in inappropriately interfering with any ongoing criminal investigations, and to that end, we are in the process of consulting with Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s office,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. Cohen\u2019s 2017 congressional testimony before the Senate and House intelligence committees led to a guilty plea in November 2018 for lying under oath about Trump\u2019s business dealings in Russia. In the plea, Cohen said: \u201cI made these misstatements to be consistent with Individual 1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual 1.\u201d Individual 1 was a reference to Trump. Cohen also pleaded guilty in August 2018 to several counts of fraud and campaign finance violations. When asked about Cohen\u2019s testimony on Thursday, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d Trump has previously attacked Cohen as \u201ca rat\u201d and \u201ca liar\u201d on Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s lawyer has confirmed authorities in Las Vegas have issued a warrant to collect DNA from the football star in the wake of allegations he raped a woman in the city in 2009. \u201cMr Ronaldo has always maintained, as he does today, that what occurred in Las Vegas in 2009 was consensual in nature, so it is not surprising that DNA would be present, nor that the police would make this very standard request as part of their investigation,\u201d Ronaldo\u2019s lawyer, Peter S Christiansen, said in a statement to the BBC. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department later confirmed to the Guardian that it had submitted a request for a DNA sample to authorities in Italy, where Ronaldo plays for Juventus. Ronaldo is the subject of a criminal investigation by Las Vegas police and a separate civil action after the allegations by Kathryn Mayorga, who came forward with her story last year. She claims the Portugal star initially used \u201cfixers\u201d to stop her pursuing criminal charges, including paying her $375,000 to keep quiet. In the past, Ronaldo\u2019s lawyer has not denied his client reached an agreement with Mayorga, who says she came forward with her story in the wake of the #MeToo movement. \u201cThis agreement is by no means a confession of guilt,\u201d Christiansen said in October 2018. Mayorga\u2019s lawyers, Leslie Mark Stovall and Larissa Drohobyczer, said on Thursday they had previously been unaware of the DNA warrant. Ronaldo has denied Mayorga\u2019s allegations. \u201cI firmly deny the accusations being issued against me,\u201d he said in October 2018. \u201cRape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense. My clear conscious [sic] will thereby allow me to await with tranquillity the results of any and all investigations.\u201d The 33-year-old Ronaldo is one of the most famous athletes in the world. He is a five-time winner of the Ballon d\u2019Or, an annual award for the best footballer in the world. He is also a national hero in Portugal, and led his country to the European Championship title in 2016.",

The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work. With a huge influx due to the economic impact of the coronavirus, in September 2020 there were 5.6 million people claiming UC.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How long has it been around?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/19/universal-credit-failings-pac-accuses-dwp\">management failures</a>, expensive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/05/universal-credit-iain-duncan-smith\">IT blunders and design faults</a>&nbsp;mean it is now seven years behind schedule, and full rollout will not be complete until 2024. The government admitted that the delay was caused in part by claimants being too scared to sign up to the new benefit.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the biggest problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The original design set out a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2016/jun/09/debt-and-food-banks-the-legacy-of-universal-credits-long-hello\">minimum 42-day wait for a first payment</a>&nbsp;to claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/universal-credit-flaws-pushing-claimants-towards-debt-and-eviction-warning?platform=hootsuite\">rent arrears and eviction</a>s, hunger (food banks in UC areas report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/25/food-banks-report-record-demand-amid-universal-credit-chaos\">notable increases in referrals</a>), use of expensive credit and mental distress.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Ministers have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Are there other problems?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plenty.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/03/universal-credit-cost-cutting-treasury-benefit-reform-resolution\">Multibillion-pound cuts to work allowances</a>&nbsp;imposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than \u00a31,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. <br></p>\n    <p>Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It's also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. <br></p>\n    <p>And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/universal-credit-savaged-by-public-spending-watchdog-nao\">critical study</a> found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rudd was to argue that it would be unfair to penalise parents who made financial decisions before the wider limit came into force, and it will still apply to children born later.</p> \n<p>Thewliss said that while she was pleased the government \u201chas finally agreed that the two-child policy is unjustifiable\u201d, she warned against the dual approach.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe risk with what the UK government [is] now proposing is that two classes of family emerge,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose born after the 6 April 2017 will still be subject to the pernicious rape clause, and forced to fight for exemptions to feed their kids.

The government had been due to hold a vote on the so-called migration of universal credit \u2013 shifting existing benefits claimants onto the new system. But Rudd has announced that instead there will be a test of this process involving 10,000 people. \u201cThis will begin, as planned, from July 2019 and the next six months will be a period of careful preparation,\u201d she was to say in the speech. \u201cThe lessons from the pilot will inform our next steps, but there will be no overall delay. Universal credit migration will be completed, as planned, by 2023. However I will consider carefully the results of the pilot, and its implications for scaling-up migration.\u201d",

Here\u2019s where things stand: Michael Cohen will testify before Congress in February less than a month before he begins his jail sentence Donald Trump edged closer towards declaring a national emergency as he visited the southern border Liz Cheney, the number three Republican in the House, denounced her colleague Steve King for asking when the phrase \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d became offensive Trump announced that he would not go to Davos due to the ongoing partial government shutdown Sign up for our US briefing and we\u2019ll email you a summary of the top stories and must-reads every weekday morning. Former congressional candidate Richard Ojeda, who is mounting a presidential campaign, announced Thursday that he would resign from his seat in the West Virginia state senate to pursue a White House bid. The House just approved the Agriculture appropriations bill with 10 Republicans voting to fund that segment of the government. It\u2019s two more than voted to fund financial services yesterday but two fewer than the number who voted to fund transportation and housing a few minutes ago. Here is the full list of the Republicans who voted to fund some government agencies without a border wall just now. 12 Republicans crossed party lines to support an appropriations bill to fund the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. This is an increase of four from yesterday when 8 Republicans voted for an appropriations bill. Trump is now at the Rio Grande and one member of the media there with him is being treated very differently. Michael Cohen has also issued a statement about his testimony: \u201cIn furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers, I have accepted the invitation by Chairman Elijah Cummings to appear publicly on February 7th before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I look forward to having the privilege of being afforded a platform with which to give a full and credible account of the events which have transpired.\u201d Elijah Cummings, the chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, has issued a brief statement about Cohen\u2019s appearance. \u201cI thank Michael Cohen for agreeing to testify before the Oversight Committee voluntarily. I want to make clear that we have no interest in inappropriately interfering with any ongoing criminal investigations, and to that end, we are in the process of consulting with Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s office. The Committee will announce additional information in the coming weeks.\u201d Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen will testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on February 7. He will be the first key figure connected to Trump to testify before Congress now that Democrats have taken control. The testimony comes only weeks before Cohen will surrender himself to federal authorities to serve a three-year prison term. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in an interview today that he is pushing for more federal funded UFO research. \u201cI personally don\u2019t know if there exists little green men other places, I kind of doubt that, but I do believe that the information we have indicates we should do a lot more study,\u201d the Nevada Democrat said. \u201cWe have hundreds and hundreds of people that have seen the same thing \u2014 something in the sky, it moves a certain way.\u201d The Associated Press reports that Kirsten Gillibrand is considering basing her presidential campaign in Troy, New York if she runs for the White House. Gillibrand grew up in the area and went to high school in Troy which is seven miles up the Hudson River from Albany. Liz Cheney, the #3 Republican in the House, has condemned Steve King for his comments. Steve King has issued a statement on the New York Times article where he said \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d King pushes back without questioning or contradicting anything in the article. A Montana Republican is proposing that the state send $8 million to the federal government to help pay for the border wall. The Associated Press reports that Scott Scales, the president of the Montana State Senate, is proposing the state spend the money as a \u201csmall token\u201d to emphasize the importance of border security. Sales said he calculated Montana\u2019s \u201cshare\u201d of the cost of the wall by dividing the state\u2019s gross domestic product by the national GDP and multiplying it by $5.7 billion. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Mike Pence insisted that Trump has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to declare a national emergency and build a wall without congressional approval. Trump just announced on Twitter that he is cancelling his trip to Davos. Earlier this morning, he declined to rule a trip out, telling reporters \u201cI intended to go and speak in front of the international community in Davos. That\u2019s still on, but if the shutdown continues \u2014 it\u2019s a little while from now \u2014 but if the shutdown continues, I won\u2019t go.\u201d Bernie Sanders has given a formal apology to \u201cthe women on my 2016 campaign who were harassed or mistreated.\u201d It comes the day after Politico reported new allegations of inappropriate behavior by a top staffer. CNN is reporting that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team met with Tony Fabrizio, one of Trump\u2019s pollsters and a former business partner of Paul Manafort last year. The report comes days after it was revealed that Manafort shared polling with Konstantin Kilimnik, an employee of his with ties to Russian intelligence. A source familiar with the special counsel\u2019s interest said Fabrizio\u2019s interview included questions about his polling work for Manafort in Ukraine rather than his internal Trump campaign polling. It is not clear what other topics were broached in the interview or whether it solely focused on Fabrizio\u2019s knowledge of Manafort\u2019s business dealings. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe just said in an interview with MSNBC that he would make a decision on a presidential bid by March. CBS is currently in negotiations to interview Trump during the Super Bowl pregame show next month. Trump did a pregame interview with Fox in 2017 but declined to do one with NBC last year. Pro Trump superPACs are already investing in opposition research against potential Democratic opponents in 2020. Buzzfeed reports that pro-Trump super PAC America First is making a significant investment in America Rising, the longtime Republican opposition research group to help shape the Democratic field. Those close to Trump say the work from America Rising will be used against Democrats in the primary to hammer candidates they think will be most challenging for Trump to beat, weakening the overall field and the eventual Democratic nominee. FBI agents are saying that the government shutdown is having an impact on their work. The Associated Press reports: The association that represents thousands of FBI agents says the partial federal government shutdown is affecting the bureau\u2019s operations. The FBI Agents Association sent a petition Thursday to the White House and congressional leaders encouraging them to fund the FBI immediately. The association\u2019s president, Tom O\u2019Connor, told reporters in a conference call that Friday will be the first day that FBI personnel will not receive a paycheck. He said the problems caused by the shutdown could make it harder to recruit and retain agents, cause delays at the FBI lab and in getting or renewing security clearances. One of Steve King\u2019s Republican colleagues has condemned his most recent remarks. In other news today, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke has a dental appointment. A former top staffer on Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign has been accused of sexual misconduct. Politico reports that Robert Becker, who ran Sanders\u2019s operation in Iowa, was accused of misconduct during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in 2016. Becker, now 50 years old, told the 20-something woman that he had always wanted to have sex with her and made a reference to riding his \u201cpole,\u201d according to the woman and three other people who witnessed what happened or were told about it shortly afterward by people who did. Later in the night, Becker approached the woman and abruptly grabbed her wrists. Then he moved his hands to her head and forcibly kissed her, putting his tongue in her mouth as he held her, the woman and other sources said. The report also details other allegations of misconduct against Becker, who is the latest former Sanders staffer to face allegations of inappropriate conduct during the campaign. Former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told Politico that Becker would not be employed by the Vermont senator in any future campaign. Tensions between Florida\u2019s former governor Rick Scott and its newly elected governor Ron DeSantis are building after DeSantis allies think Scott deliberately insulted them. Politico suggests that at the root of this are dueling White House ambitions in 2024. Others in Tallahassee saw the outline of a coming 2024 clash. The governorship of Florida is a good springboard to the White House, and each man might believe that Florida isn\u2019t big enough for the two of them \u2014 just as it wasn\u2019t for former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary. Trump\u2019s address to the nation on Tuesday drew roughly 40 million viewers as it was televised on both broadcast networks and cable news. However, the joint Democratic response from Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi drew slightly more viewers. Ratings increased 4% from the period from 9:00-9:15 EST to that from 9:15-9:30 EST. Trump just insisted that he never meant Mexico would directly pay for a border wall when he pledged Mexico would pay for it on the campaign trail. \u201cObviously I never meant Mexico would write a check.\u201d Trump also continued to express his openness to declaring a national emergency to use the military to construct a border wall without congressional approval. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019ll probably will do it, maybe definitely,\u201d he said. President Trump spoke to reporters at the White House before leaving for his trip to the border. He insisted \u201c\u201cI don\u2019t have temper tantrums\u201d and further pushed back at claims from Democrats that he slammed the table in the White House Situation Room before storming out of the meeting (or, as Trump has put it, saying \u201cbye bye.\u201d) \u201cI didn\u2019t pound the table. I didn\u2019t pound the table. That is a lie,\u201d said Trump. He also yet again insisted that \u201cMexico paying for wall indirectly, many, many times over\u201d and that without a barrier on the border, MS-13 would enter the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is giving a foreign policy speech in Cairo right now that is a direct rebuke of Obama\u2019s speech there a decade ago. Adam Kredo from the Washington Free Beacon reports: Pompeo took direct aim at Obama, standing in the same city the former president did when he advocated a fundamental shift in U.S. policy in the region, one that denies Islamic radicalism as the root of jihadi fervor. \u201cRemember: It was here, in this very city, another American stood before you,\u201d he said. \u201cHe told you that radical Islamist terrorism doesn\u2019t stem from ideology. He told you 9/11 led my country to abandon its ideals, particularly in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cHe told you that the United States and the Muslim world needed \u2018a new beginning,\u2019\u201d Pompeo continued. \u201cAnd the results of these misjudgments were dire. In falsely seeing ourselves as a force for what ails the Middle East, we were timid about asserting ourselves when the times\u2014and our partners\u2014demanded it.\u201d America, under Obama, \u201cunderestimated\u201d the scourge of radical terrorism. Steve King, the controversial Iowa Republican congressman, gave an interview with the New York Times after a serious primary challenger emerged against him yesterday. King, known for his racially charged comments, made yet another inflamatory statement. Good morning, Donald Trump is on his way to the Mexican border, the government shutdown has reached its 20th day and there\u2019s growing speculation that a national emergency may be declared in an attempt by Trump to force construction of a wall. It\u2019s Thursday in American politics.",

Marise Payne, who has been calling for al-Araibi\u2019s release since he was detained in late November, was in Bangkok for bilateral meetings and raised the cases of two refugees held by Thailand. \u201cWe are, as I\u2019ve said, very concerned about his detention, very concerned about any potential for return of Mr Araibi to Bahrain,\u201d she said. \u201cI have reiterated those concerns to both ministers.\u201d Al-Araibi was detained by Thai officials on the basis of an erroneous Interpol red notice over a vandalism conviction handed down in absentia at a Bahrain trial. \u201cMr Al-Araibi was granted permanent residency by the Australian government in recognition of his status as a refugee,\u201d Payne had noted on Wednesday. In anticipation of Payne\u2019s meeting, human rights organisations and advocates renewed pressure on the parties involved to free Al-Araibi. At a press conference and protest in Sydney, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, and high-profile football identities urged Payne to put \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Thailand. Elaine Pearson, the Australian director of Human Rights Watch, said there were key questions for the Thai government and its decisions on Al-Araibi\u2019s case, while separately agreeing to protect Saudi woman Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun. Pearson said the Thai government had an \u201cappalling record when it comes to collaborating with authoritarian regimes to return their citizens\u201d, citing the deportations of Uighurs and another Bahraini dissident who was then imprisoned, beaten and tortured. Thailand and Bahrain have close investment relationships, and the Bahrain foreign affairs minister was scheduled to visit Thailand soon, Pearson said. \u201cWe are certainly concerned about why the Thai government is prioritising the relationship with the kingdom of Bahrain over its relationship with Australia.\u201d Pearson said Al-Araibi was recognised under international law as a refugee. \u201cIf Hakeem is sent back to Bahrain it means all refugees, wherever they are in the world, will live in fear about travelling to certain countries because of the risk they could be returned to the countries they fled persecution from.\u201d Graham Thom, refugee coordinator at Amnesty International Australia, said the spotlight was not just on Thailand, but on Asean, which Thailand was set to become chair of this year. \u201cWe need the global community to stand up and condemn the situation both from Thailand and Bahrain that [allowed] this to occur,\u201d said Thom. \u201cThis is an extraordinary situation, it would be an extraordinary breach of Thailand\u2019s human rights obligations [if he were returned],\u201d he said. The world football body, Fifa, issued another press release on Thursday calling for \u201ca humane and speedy resolution of the case\u201d and his release. \u201cThis player, a Bahrain national, is currently being detained in prison in Thailand awaiting the outcome of extradition proceedings to Bahrain, where he was previously convicted of a criminal offence, the validity of which he strongly contests,\u201d it said. It followed revelations by Guardian Australia that Fifa and executives from Football Federation Australia had met with Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president and Bahraini royal, Sheikh Salman Al-Khalifa, for the first time to discuss Al-Araibi\u2019s case. Thursday\u2019s protest group also called for world football bodies, including Fifa, to live up to their own human rights codes, and for the UNHCR to do more to help Al-Araibi as they had done for Qunun. They called for Sheikh Salman to make a public statement in support of Al-Araibi. Former Socceroo captain and football analyst Craig Foster said the silence of the AFC was completely unacceptable, particularly in the context of human rights policies enacted in recent years. \u201cSheikh Salman is obligated to support Hakeem, he is obligated to do everything in his power to advocate both privately and publicly, and to use the immense leverage that football has with the Bahrain government \u2013 his own government \u2013 and the Thai government,\u201d said Foster. \u201cThe silence of the Asian Football Confederation is not just confounding, it\u2019s absolutely disgraceful under our human rights obligations within the entire football community.\u201d Fatima Yazbek, a spokeswoman for the Gulf Institute of Democracy and Human Rights, said there was personal conflict between Al-Araibi and Sheikh Salman, and Sheikh Salman was not fulfilling his obligations to protect the player. \u201cHe should do something, otherwise step down from your position and leave someone more qualified to fulfil the obligations of the position.\u201d",

Maduro, who inherited Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Bolivarian revolution after his 2013 death, has overseen a calamitous decline in his country\u2019s fortunes and was re-elected in disputed elections last May. A shower of domestic and international censure met the 56-year-old\u2019s swearing in at the supreme court in Caracas on Thursday. The United States secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, condemned Maduro\u2019s \u201cillegitimate usurpation of power\u201d and vowed to \u201cuse the full weight of US economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy\u201d. The European Union called last year\u2019s vote \u201cneither free, nor fair\u201d, and said Maduro was \u201cstarting a new mandate on the basis of non-democratic elections\u201d. Latin American governments also denounced the inauguration, with Paraguay breaking off diplomatic ties and Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, branding Maduro \u201cthe victimizer who plays victim\u201d. \u201cVenezuela is living under a dictatorship,\u201d Macri tweeted.

      "bodyText": "The Sea Shepherd environmental group has published video showing an attack by about two dozen small fishing boats on the group\u2019s vessel Farley Mowat in Mexico\u2019s Gulf of California. The fishermen in the Gulf, also known as the Sea of Cortez, oppose environmentalists trying to protect the vaquita marina, the world\u2019s smallest and most endangered porpoise. Sea Shepherd says fishermen threw lead weights, dead fish and even Tabasco sauce at the Farley Mowat and tried to douse the vessel and waters around it with gasoline in the attack on Wednesday. The video shows some of the fishing boats carried gill nets, though they are banned within the reserve designed to protect the vaquita. The vaquita is nearing extinction due to gill nets set illegally to catch totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder commands astronomical prices because it is considered a delicacy in China. Some fishermen threw a net in front of the Farley Mowat to foul the propellers of the Sea Shepherd vessel; others boarded the ship and apparently carried off some items. The Farley Mowat\u2019s crew can be seen using a hose to repel some of the smaller boats. Sea Shepherd operates in the Gulf with the knowledge and cooperation of the Mexican government to help detect illegal nets. The incident took place in an area set aside as a vaquita refuge in the Upper Gulf of California. Sea Shepherd said dozens of boats were taking part in \u201cobvious illegal poaching\u201d of totoaba. The use of gill nets is banned within the reserve due to the impact upon the vaquita, a species of porpoise endemic to the Gulf of California. Experts say as few as 15 of the marine mammals remain in the Gulf, the only place they exist, and none have ever been held in captivity. Vaquita were only discovered in 1958 but now face imminent extinction. The remoteness of the Gulf of California make it difficult to police illegal fishing, prompting the intervention of Sea Shepherd. The environmental organization, best known for its confrontations with Japanese whalers in the Southern Ocean, was founded in 1977 and has a fleet of boats it uses to observe and protest against whaling and illegal fishing. Scientists have called on Mexican environmental officials to ban possession of the nets in the whole area, as well as carry out land patrols and inspections of boats setting out to sea to enforce the ban. At present, authorities patrol the area but poachers often flee in high-powered boats and make it to shore.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has sparked hopes among senior Labour figures that she is laying the groundwork to compromise on her Brexit deal after next week\u2019s meaningful vote, following a flurry of contacts with union leaders and MPs in recent days. Conservative ministers were calling around Labour MPs on Thursday \u2013 including at least one member of the shadow cabinet \u2013 to gauge support for May\u2019s deal if she beefs up pledges on workers\u2019 rights. May spoke directly to Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary who is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, and Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary. The calls \u2013 the first time she has spoken to either of the union leaders \u2013 were one demand made by a group of Labour MPs, including Gareth Snell and Caroline Flint, who met her in Downing Street earlier this week. The MPs pushed for fresh assurances on workers\u2019 rights. One of those present said they were then given advice from officials to help them draw up an amendment to the meaningful vote motion \u2013 which the government has since said it would consider accepting. It is understood May opened her conversations with union leaders proffering the amendment as her \u201copening gambit\u201d. No 10 described the calls as \u201cconstructive\u201d. Allies of McCluskey said he would be keen to keep channels open with Downing Street; but there were raised eyebrows at the timing of the call and an assumption that the prime minister was using it to send a signal to the Labour leadership. Roache said: \u201cI represent 620,000 working people and it\u2019s about time their voices were heard. After nearly three years I\u2019m glad the prime minister finally picked up the phone. As you would expect, I was very clear about GMB\u2019s position \u2013 the deal on the table isn\u2019t good enough and non-binding assurances on workers\u2019 rights won\u2019t cut it. \u201cIf the deal genuinely did the job for GMB members, our union would support it, but it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s clear more time is required, we need to extend article 50 and ultimately give the final say on Brexit to the public.\u201d In his September conference speech, Corbyn offered to support the prime minister\u2019s deal if she toughened up workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards and offered a permanent customs union. She has flatly rejected the idea of a customs union, and did so again on Wednesday at a public meeting with a cross-party group of dozens of MPs. But Downing Street has warned Brexiters who plan to reject May\u2019s deal on Tuesday that there is probably a majority for a customs union in the House of Commons. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has said he believes parliament must decide the way forward if May\u2019s deal is rejected on Tuesday. Starmer reacted angrily on Thursday, after Downing Street suggested there would be just 90 minutes of debate on whatever Plan B May brings back after next week\u2019s vote. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told reporters at Thursday morning\u2019s lobby briefing that No 10\u2019s understanding of the Dominic Grieve amendment, which requires May to outline a plan B in three working days if she is defeated, was that only a limited debate would then be allowed. The spokesman said: \u201c[In relation to] the motion that would follow from the Grieve amendment, there would only be 90 minutes of debate on the motion, is our understanding, and only one amendment could be selected.\u201d MPs were quick to voice concern, with Yvette Cooper raising a point of order a few hours later in the Commons, asking the speaker, John Bercow, to clarify that the government could allow more time for any plan B Brexit debate if it so wished. Unusually, Julian Smith, the chief whip, intervened, to insist that no final decision had been made by the government on how to handle the plan B debate \u2013 and even claimed, despite the earlier on-the-record briefing by May\u2019s spokesman, that \u201cthe information is not correct\u201d. Starmer accused the prime minister of \u201cseeking to shut down debate\u201d and said Number 10 was \u201csimply wrong\u201d. The shadow cabinet discussed how they will approach next week\u2019s historic vote and its aftermath at their meeting this week, but no firm decisions were taken \u2013 for example, about whether to back any amendment calling for a second referendum. \u201cWe need to wait and see what May comes back with,\u201d said one shadow cabinet minister, adding that it was not inevitable a \u201ccrunch-point\u201d on a second referendum would ever come, if the prime minister is willing to compromise. The Labour party chair, Ian Lavery, made a passionate intervention at the meeting, rejecting the idea of a fresh poll, two people present said. Lavery, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon and Corbyn\u2019s close ally Jon Trickett are the strongest opponents of supporting a second vote, fearing that it would alienate Leave voters. But the overwhelming majority of Labour\u2019s members favour a referendum, putting the leadership under intense pressure to support one. Corbyn stepped up his call for his preferred solution of a general election to \u201cbreak the deadlock\u201d at Westminster, in a speech in Wakefield on Thursday, and conceded that Labour might support extending article 50, to allow it to negotiate its own Brexit deal. \u201cAny political leader who wants to bring the country together cannot wish away the votes of 17 million who wanted to leave, any more than they can ignore the concerns of the 16 million who voted to remain,\u201d he said. He said Labour\u2019s own Brexit plan, which included negotiating a customs deal and what the party has described as a \u201cstrong single market relationship\u201d, would bring both sides together and allow Labour to enact its manifesto promises. \u201cThe alternative plan that Labour has set out for a sensible Brexit deal that could win broad support is designed to enable us to fulfil those ambitions while respecting the democratic result of the referendum,\u201d Corbyn said. MPs will continue discussing the Brexit deal on Friday, with the home secretary, Sajid Javid, opening the third day of debate. There will be two more days of debate next week, culminating in the vote on Tuesday evening.",

ERG members are keen to show that they have an alternative plan to May\u2019s deal, which would be likely to involve challenging the EU to accept an amended withdrawal agreement while preparing for no deal. Another senior member said: \u201cWe will leave the EU on 29 March, there will not be any change to this without an intervention by the government. There are ways out of the current impasse which will take our party\u2019s members, and a majority of the population, with us.\u201d Conservative MPs are searching for alternative deals as it has become increasingly apparent that May\u2019s proposed deal is unlikely to win enough support. Priti Patel, the former cabinet minister, wrote on the BrexitCentral website this week that MPs need to \u201creject the current deal and prepare for [a no-deal exit on World Trade Organization terms] while seeking a renegotiated settlement\u201d. There is no majority for a hard Brexit in parliament, but its supporters are applying pressure on May to accept that the Conservative membership is firmly on the side of a WTO Brexit rather than her deal. Prominent MPs in both the remain and leave camps are convinced that May will lose when her deal is put to the vote next week. It is more likely that May will seek a second attempt to get her deal through if the majority against it is less than 100. At that point, some Brexiters believe they may be able to persuade the prime minister to accept writing a change to the Irish backstop into the withdrawal agreement. The government has lost two Brexit votes in two days. The first defeat limited the government\u2019s financial powers in the event of a no-deal departure. The second forced the prime minister to announce new plans within three days if her deal fails in the Commons. Some Conservative MPs believe that the threat of imminent defeat on Tuesday will persuade some ministers to resign to vote against the deal. One former minister told the Guardian: \u201cIt is utter chaos. The party is hanging by a thread. This deal could be voted down really heavily. Ministers might well vote no on Tuesday if that is the way the wind is blowing.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Mauricio Pochettino knows he is the most coveted manager in football right now. I can only describe his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/07/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-spending-january-transfer-window\" title=\"\">comments this week about his future</a> at Tottenham as a direct call for action to the club\u2019s board following his show of loyalty. I understood Pochettino to be saying to them: \u201cI have showed and I am showing my loyalty to you by batting away the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester United, but now if you back me financially I want to stay for the next 20 years\u201d.</p> <p>Pochettino has been at Tottenham for five years, which is rare in modern football and yet has spent a lot less money than rivals clubs who challenge for the Premier League. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has turned Liverpool into real title contenders in only three years and has had to spend a lot of money to try to bridge the gap to Manchester City. But Klopp has also moulded that team in his own image, with an exciting brand of play which we have seen in abundance this season. Pochettino has done the same but how much of building a team to win the Premier League is down to having much more spending power versus a coach\u2019s ability to change the playing style, tactical blueprint and perhaps most importantly the winning mentality of the team?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/07/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-spending-january-transfer-window\">Pochettino says Spurs will struggle to compete at top without spending</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pochettino has been a revelation at Tottenham but the big challenge for him is to try and change the mentality of the club. I\u2019ve said in other columns that Tottenham have been a nearly club for too long. Reaching eight semi-finals in as many years probably exemplifies that nearly status.</p> <p>Pochettino needs to try to mount the type of title push that Klopp and Liverpool are building while making sure they get over the line when it matters by starting to win trophies. However his call for action to \u201cchange the way we have done things in the last five years\u201d is valid given the lack of spending by the board over the past few transfer windows. Tottenham need to become a winning team not just a great team with fantastic players. There are other managers who have built a winning team in less time than Pochettino.</p> <p>For now I think Pochettino will stay \u2013 I don\u2019t think a manager comes out and says \u201cI want to stay for 20 years\u201d if he doesn\u2019t want to and I applaud his loyalty when he would be forgiven for moving to, say, Real Madrid. But he knows he is in a more powerful position if he stays and shows his loyalty because now he has the power to ask for what he wants and do it directly. He is very smart.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure how much money will be available when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/09/tottenham-new-stadium-mid-march-earliest-delay-football\" title=\"\">Tottenham finally move into the new stadium</a> but Arsenal struggled to compete for the Premier League for years when they moved to the Emirates.</p> <p>Tottenham were the first Premier League club ever not to buy anyone in the summer transfer window so to still be competing for the title is a real credit to Pochettino but I do not think Spurs can continue in this way.

      "bodyText": "Mauricio Pochettino knows he is the most coveted manager in football right now. I can only describe his comments this week about his future at Tottenham as a direct call for action to the club\u2019s board following his show of loyalty. I understood Pochettino to be saying to them: \u201cI have showed and I am showing my loyalty to you by batting away the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester United, but now if you back me financially I want to stay for the next 20 years\u201d. Pochettino has been at Tottenham for five years, which is rare in modern football and yet has spent a lot less money than rivals clubs who challenge for the Premier League. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has turned Liverpool into real title contenders in only three years and has had to spend a lot of money to try to bridge the gap to Manchester City. But Klopp has also moulded that team in his own image, with an exciting brand of play which we have seen in abundance this season. Pochettino has done the same but how much of building a team to win the Premier League is down to having much more spending power versus a coach\u2019s ability to change the playing style, tactical blueprint and perhaps most importantly the winning mentality of the team? Pochettino has been a revelation at Tottenham but the big challenge for him is to try and change the mentality of the club. I\u2019ve said in other columns that Tottenham have been a nearly club for too long. Reaching eight semi-finals in as many years probably exemplifies that nearly status. Pochettino needs to try to mount the type of title push that Klopp and Liverpool are building while making sure they get over the line when it matters by starting to win trophies. However his call for action to \u201cchange the way we have done things in the last five years\u201d is valid given the lack of spending by the board over the past few transfer windows. Tottenham need to become a winning team not just a great team with fantastic players. There are other managers who have built a winning team in less time than Pochettino. For now I think Pochettino will stay \u2013 I don\u2019t think a manager comes out and says \u201cI want to stay for 20 years\u201d if he doesn\u2019t want to and I applaud his loyalty when he would be forgiven for moving to, say, Real Madrid. But he knows he is in a more powerful position if he stays and shows his loyalty because now he has the power to ask for what he wants and do it directly. He is very smart. I\u2019m not sure how much money will be available when Tottenham finally move into the new stadium but Arsenal struggled to compete for the Premier League for years when they moved to the Emirates. Tottenham were the first Premier League club ever not to buy anyone in the summer transfer window so to still be competing for the title is a real credit to Pochettino but I do not think Spurs can continue in this way. If the forthcoming transfer window is anything like the last one, it would be unfair to expect Tottenham to challenge while Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea continue to add key players to the team. Tottenham still need two world class full-backs and maybe another centre-back to make the next step. We have seen how crucial Virgil van Dijk has been to Liverpool. It is not always about signing star forwards and midfielders. Tottenham have as strong a front line in Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura as any other team in the league. Chelsea have changed managers a lot over the years and are spending a lot less these days but they have been fortunate to retain some of their best players at the same time, such as Eden Hazard. Maurizio Sarri is one of those managers who can get the best out of players who aren\u2019t necessarily world class which he proved at Napoli. It goes back to managers having to work with what they have got versus those who just have a bottomless pit to spend like Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Pochettino has now reached the stage where he is thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve brought this team such a long way but how can we go further?\u2019 Now it\u2019s about how the board react in the summer and whether he is given the money to strengthen the team. I hope Pochettino is supported. His loyalty deserves it. I can\u2019t see Tottenham winning the Premier League this season because they have been dropping too many points against teams lower in the table but now he has made it clear that he wants to stay, next season could be a real chance for them. If Pochettino doesn\u2019t get the financial backing from the board, I\u2019m sure he will make it known and put more pressure on them. He walked away from Southampton after building a successful team, which proves if the opportunity is right he is capable of leaving. But I would be shocked if he went to Manchester United at the end of the season if he is in the perfect position now to really up it with Tottenham. I\u2019m sure United are already thinking about who will be their permanent manager after Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and if they don\u2019t know it\u2019s Pochettino now then I don\u2019t think it will happen.

He was commissioned by the state government after a fire in a building in Bankstown in 2012 revealed shocking breaches of the building code. His report found significant building defects in NSW, at higher rates than other states. He says the government has failed to implement almost all of nearly 150 recommendations, and the building boom since then has made things worse. \u201cThere are hundreds of smaller projects, mainly medium rise in the suburbs, that will have problems.\u201d An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/09/sydney-opal-tower-residents-face-six-week-wait-to-return-home\">emergency review of the Opal Tower cracks</a> is due to report today.</p> <p><strong>The New South Wales police minister, Troy Grant, has apologised for comments criticising a magistrate over the sentencing of the former Adelaide archbishop Philip Wilson,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/11/police-minister-apologises-for-criticising-judge-over-philip-wilson-sentence\">six months after his comments were met with outrage by the legal community.</a> In July, Grant criticised magistrate Robert Stone\u2019s decision to sentence Wilson to six months in custody for concealing child sexual abuse, describing it as \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cnot a deterrent\u201d. The NSW Law Society said government officials should respect the rule of law, the separation of powers and judicial process. Wilson\u2019s sentence was quashed on appeal in December.</p> <p><strong>The cotton industry has gone on the defensive over the mass fish kill in the Darling River at Menindee</strong>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/10/darling-river-fish-kill-cotton-industry-says-it-wont-be-the-whipping-boy-for-disaster\"> saying the drought was to blame </a>and claiming it has suffered too. The immediate cause of the mass fish deaths is a sudden drop in temperature that killed algal blooms in the water, depleting it of oxygen and causing fish to die. But locals and some scientists claim that over-extraction of the river\u2019s water upstream by irrigators has contributed to the deaths. Cotton Australia\u2019s general manager said the cotton industry was \u201cgrowing very tired of being \u2018the whipping boy\u2019 for all the problems that are being brought on by this crippling drought.\u201d</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"653725de8e2755571529e69be42549eb4a77451e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/653725de8e2755571529e69be42549eb4a77451e/0_39_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ocean beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huge waves pound Ocean beach in California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The world\u2019s oceans are warming more quickly than previously estimated</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/10/warming-oceans-likely-to-raise-sea-levels-30cm-by-end-of-century-study\">new research has found</a>, meaning sea levels are likely to rise about 30cm by the end of the century, on top of the rise from melting ice and glaciers.

Top stories The defects found at Opal Tower in Sydney\u2019s Olympic Park are probably \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d, says David Lambert, who led a review into New South Wales building standards in 2015. He was commissioned by the state government after a fire in a building in Bankstown in 2012 revealed shocking breaches of the building code. His report found significant building defects in NSW, at higher rates than other states. He says the government has failed to implement almost all of nearly 150 recommendations, and the building boom since then has made things worse. \u201cThere are hundreds of smaller projects, mainly medium rise in the suburbs, that will have problems.\u201d An emergency review of the Opal Tower cracks is due to report today. The New South Wales police minister, Troy Grant, has apologised for comments criticising a magistrate over the sentencing of the former Adelaide archbishop Philip Wilson, six months after his comments were met with outrage by the legal community. In July, Grant criticised magistrate Robert Stone\u2019s decision to sentence Wilson to six months in custody for concealing child sexual abuse, describing it as \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cnot a deterrent\u201d. The NSW Law Society said government officials should respect the rule of law, the separation of powers and judicial process. Wilson\u2019s sentence was quashed on appeal in December. The cotton industry has gone on the defensive over the mass fish kill in the Darling River at Menindee, saying the drought was to blame and claiming it has suffered too. The immediate cause of the mass fish deaths is a sudden drop in temperature that killed algal blooms in the water, depleting it of oxygen and causing fish to die. But locals and some scientists claim that over-extraction of the river\u2019s water upstream by irrigators has contributed to the deaths. Cotton Australia\u2019s general manager said the cotton industry was \u201cgrowing very tired of being \u2018the whipping boy\u2019 for all the problems that are being brought on by this crippling drought.\u201d World The world\u2019s oceans are warming more quickly than previously estimated, new research has found, meaning sea levels are likely to rise about 30cm by the end of the century, on top of the rise from melting ice and glaciers. Warmer oceans are also a major factor in increasing the severity of storms, hurricanes and extreme rainfall. Donald Trump has signalled he is prepared to declare a state of national emergency and have the military build a border wall with Mexico if he cannot get congressional approval. \u201cI\u2019ll probably do it, maybe definitely,\u201d, he told reporters. Trump has also announced he will not attend the world economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, tweeting \u201cmy warmest regards and apologies\u201d. Downing Street has said that if Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal is voted down, any debate over a plan B would be 90 minutes long and only one amendment would be allowed. Meanwhile Japan\u2019s prime minister has told May \u201cthe whole world\u201d wants her to avoid a no-deal Brexit. A woman and her two sons have suffocated in a windowless shed to which they were banished in the latest tragedy linked to the illegal practice of chhaupadi, whereby women in Nepal are forced to sleep in \u201cperiod huts\u201d. The UN has linked the practice to reports of diarrhoea, pneumonia and respiratory illnesses as well as sexual abuse or attacks by wildlife. Russia has accused the BBC of promoting terrorist propaganda and threatened legal action against the British public broadcaster, in a move that looks set to escalate a spiralling media dispute between London and Moscow. Opinion and analysis When the third and final season of the Family Law premieres on SBS this weekend, it will become the first Australian series about teen queer sexuality. The six episodes focus entirely on the main character, Benjamin, coming out as gay \u2013 and according to the series\u2019 writer, Benjamin Law, it\u2019s the show he wishes he\u2019d had growing up. \u201cWhen sections of media still treat teenagers like abstract, political issues, refusing to engage with them directly, those same teenagers will find their spaces and stories elsewhere,\u201d he writes. \u201cAdults should help them or get out of their way.\u201d In his latest contribution to the Life on the Breadline series, Mick Smart recalls how trying to keep a treasured pet alive is made so much harder when you\u2019re living in poverty. A week after moving into a friend\u2019s spare room, Smart\u2019s beloved dog Phoebe was hit by a car. \u201cAll too familiar financial barriers went into play that somewhat mirrored my own experiences, as our friend had to call friends, family and various pet charities to cover the cost for her admission, surgery and aftercare, scrounging and begging in order to save a life. Meanwhile I had emptied my bank account to cover food and transport.\u201d Sport No Australian has won a singles title at the Australian Open since 1978. Let\u2019s not beat around the bush, writes Jonathan Howcroft, there is only one local hope who stands a chance of breaking that drought in 2019, and her name is Ashleigh Barty. The Socceroos are chasing the first points of their Asian Cup title defence when they face Palestine in a must-win encounter tonight. Our cartoonist David Squires delivers his take on the tournament so far before our liveblog brings you a blow-by-blow account of the tonight\u2019s game, which kicks off at 10pm AEDT. Thinking time: Is hosting the Oscars the worst gig in town? The Academy Awards looks set to feature a calvacade of stars instead of a single host, which Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw thinks will be \u201ca nightmare\u201d. Bruised by the Kevin Hart debacle \u2013 in which that planned presenter was dropped for refusing to apologise afresh for past homophobic comments \u2013 wary of the likes of Ricky Gervais\u2019s acid tongue and preemptively bored by the James Francos and Anne Hathaways of Hollywood \u2013 what is the alternative for this ailing dinosaur? \u201cWhat a nightmare it sounds: an exponential increase of audience unease and megastar self-love, slowing down the show\u2019s momentum and pace. None of these big names will be allowed to develop audience rapport. Nor will the audience be allowed the reassurance of a single thread of continuity \u2013 what with all of these egos having to be rolled on and off stage during musical breaks, like 18-wheeler pantechnicons being negotiated in and out of a pub car park.\u201d Media roundup The Great Ocean Road is at risk of being washed away, the Age reports, as surging seas spark calls for the Victorian government to reroute parts of the famous coastal drive. One beach has closed in Hobart, with more likely to follow suit, as high levels of faecal contamination in the River Derwent spark health fears, the Mercury reports. And the Australian says crayfishers are fighting the WA government\u2019s attempt to seize one fifth of the prized lobster catch in the country\u2019s most lucrative fishery, which would make it the industry\u2019s single biggest licence holder. Coming up John Finnin, who was once one of Australia\u2019s top diplomats, will appear in Melbourne magistrates\u2019 court today on a string of charges related to grooming boys for sex.

In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit and the coronavirus, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers. Many businesses which deal with complex supply chains also want additional help with the new red tape and import charges imposed after Boris Johnson's Brexit deal saddled them with extra costs.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThese results show no abatement in the crisis of the high street,\u201d said David Marshall, professor of marketing and consumer behaviour at the University of Edinburgh business school<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>\u201c</strong>High street footfall is down and price incentives do not appear to have attracted customers back into stores,\u201d he said. \u201cOnline retail now accounts for one-fifth of retail sales and is likely to continue to increase as a proportion.\u201d</p> \n<p>Retailers\u2019 profits are under pressure as they have been forced to discount heavily to win over nervous shoppers, spooked by political and economic uncertainty around Brexit.

While profits are expected to rise at Waitrose, they will be down sharply at the John Lewis department stores chain, mainly because of its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d policy of matching high street rivals\u2019 discounts.</p> \n<p>Department stores had a grim 2018 with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/10/house-of-fraser-calls-in-administrators-as-rescue-talks-fail\">summer collapse of House of Fraser</a> kicking off a wave of desperate discounting. Debenhams is also facing serious problems and its share price collapsed by 90% last year. John Lewis said there had been up to 30% more promotions by rival retailers over the Christmas period than in 2017.</p> \n<p>The potential break in the annual staff bonus comes after John Lewis slashed its bonus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonuses-as-profits-dive-77-percent-weaker-pound-waitrose\">last year to just 5% of salary</a> \u2013 the lowest level of payout since the 1950s.

      "bodyText": "John Lewis is considering suspending its staff bonus for the first time in 66 years in the wake of the worst Christmas for retailers since the depths of the financial crisis. The employee-owned department store group, which also owns Waitrose, said it would \u201cneed to consider carefully \u2026 whether payment of a bonus is prudent in the light of business and economic prospects at that time\u201d. John Lewis\u2019s warning came amid a slew of downbeat trading updates from some of the best-known names in the retail sector on what had been billed as \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d. Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams reported a slump in sales over the crucial trading period and Halfords fired off a profit warning that wiped a fifth off the company\u2019s value. \u201cThese results show no abatement in the crisis of the high street,\u201d said David Marshall, professor of marketing and consumer behaviour at the University of Edinburgh business school. \u201cHigh street footfall is down and price incentives do not appear to have attracted customers back into stores,\u201d he said. \u201cOnline retail now accounts for one-fifth of retail sales and is likely to continue to increase as a proportion.\u201d Retailers\u2019 profits are under pressure as they have been forced to discount heavily to win over nervous shoppers, spooked by political and economic uncertainty around Brexit. Shoppers have reined in spending on non-essentials amid fears for jobs and savings. In December, official sales data showed online sales accounted for more than a fifth of total spending for the first time, underlining the challenge faced by bricks-and-mortar retailers in an increasingly digital age. A report published on Thursday by the British Retail Consortium showed that in non-food sales more than 31% of trade has now moved to the internet. Earlier this month the music and film retailer HMV called in administrators, blaming rising costs and falling sales. The Queen\u2019s former dressmaker Hardy Amies and the upmarket slipper brand Mahabis have also fallen into administration in recent weeks. Clothing retailers including Asos, Superdry and Bonmarch\u00e9 have issued profit warnings while Mothercare and Next admitted trading had been tough. Patrick Lewis, finance director of the John Lewis Partnership, said the group could afford to pay a modest bonus but would wait until March to decide on the payout because of the \u201cunusual economic circumstances\u201d and a \u201chigher level of volatility\u201d around Brexit. The company warned that profits would be substantially lower this year \u2013 despite a last-minute rush that eventually resulted in higher Christmas sales than last year \u2013 as a result of heavy discounting by rivals and weak consumer demand. While profits are expected to rise at Waitrose, they will be down sharply at the John Lewis department stores chain, mainly because of its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d policy of matching high street rivals\u2019 discounts. Department stores had a grim 2018 with the summer collapse of House of Fraser kicking off a wave of desperate discounting. Debenhams is also facing serious problems and its share price collapsed by 90% last year. John Lewis said there had been up to 30% more promotions by rival retailers over the Christmas period than in 2017. The potential break in the annual staff bonus comes after John Lewis slashed its bonus last year to just 5% of salary \u2013 the lowest level of payout since the 1950s. The bonus \u2013 which was first paid in 1920 and is handed to all staff, from shelf stackers to senior management \u2013 has not been suspended since the postwar economic downturn of 1953, when rationing was still in place. New high street data has shown that total sales growth dropped to zero in December for the first time since 2008 as shops were hit by Brexit worries and a dramatic fall in consumer confidence. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) figures showed that all areas of the high street were hit by a fall in sales last month except food, where there was intense competition among the major supermarket chains. M&amp;S blamed the weak economic environment for deterring shoppers, with both its food and clothing businesses suffering sales declines of more than 2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. The M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe, described its performance as steady in a difficult market: \u201cThe combination of reducing consumer confidence, mild weather, Black Friday and widespread discounting by our competitors made November a very challenging trading period.\u201d Against the tough backdrop Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest retailer, emerged as one of winners with UK like-for-like sales up 2.2% over Christmas. It was the supermarket giant\u2019s best performance in nearly a decade with its chief executive, Dave Lewis, describing it as a \u201cvery strong Christmas performance which was ahead of the market\u201d. Earlier this week Aldi said it had a record Christmas as a growing number of Britons switch some of their grocery shopping away from the traditional supermarket chains. Lewis said there had been a \u201cflight to value\u201d at Tesco, with shoppers seeking out its no-frills ranges to save money, while its upmarket finest ranges had also done well. \u201cThere is no doubt that the whole retail sector had a disappointing November, which set the tone for what can only be viewed as a poor Christmas,\u201d said Greg Lawless, a retail analyst at the City stockbroker Shore Capital.",

A draft plan to sell the Brexit deal that was leaked in November even suggested that Abe might be persuaded to tweet to support May\u2019s deal, although in person in London the Japanese prime minister went further. \u201cJapan is in total support of the draft withdrawal agreement worked out between the EU and Prime Minister May, which provides for transition to ensure legal stability for businesses that have invested into this country,\u201d Abe said.

I say we must not patronise them with cowardice, let\u2019s tell them the truth - you were old a lie.</p> <p>Immigrants have not taken your jobs, our schools and colleges failed to give you the skills, hospitals are not crumbling because of health tourists but decades of austerity that ground them down to the bone, you cannot afford a house because both parties failed to build, not because of Mohammed down the road who moved in, and wealth was hoarded in London when it should have been shared across the country. </p> <p>Blame us, blame Westminster, do not blame Brussels for our own country\u2019s mistakes and do not be angry at us for telling you the truth, be angry at the chancers who sold you a lie ...</p> <p>Just as I speak plainly to the government this time around, let me also speak to the pposition about some home truths. There is no leftwing justification for Brexit. </p> <p>Ditching workers\u2019 rights, social protections and ending environmental cooperation is not progressive. </p> <p>This is a project about neo-liberal deregulation, it\u2019s Thatcherism on steroids pushed by her modern-day disciples. </p> <p>Leaving the EU will not free us from the injustices of global capitalism, it will make us subordinate to Trump\u2019s US. </p> <p>Socialism confined to one country will not work, whether you like it or not, the world we live in is global, we can only fix the rigged system if we cooperate across border lines. </p> <p>The party of Keir Hardie has always been international.

That is not wrong, but it does not fully explain Corbyn\u2019s stance on Brexit because another point is that he is not hugely interested in the topic either. The issues that engage him are ones like poverty and human rights. All of this helps to explain why his speech on Brexit this morning was, in certain respects, something of a non-event. In relation to some questions - like when will Labour table a confidence motion, or would Labour extend article 50? - we almost ended up knowing less about Labour\u2019s position after the speech than we did before. </p> <p>But even politicians\u2019 evasions can be interesting. And, on the plus side, the speech did reflect Corbyn\u2019s determination to move beyond Brexit. There was an argument in it. <br></p> <p>Here are the main points from the speech and the Q&amp;A<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn downplayed suggestions that the party will table a no confidence motion in Theresa May\u2019s government if she loses her Brexit vote next week. </strong>Yesterday two members of the shadow cabinet said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/09/brexit-latest-news-debate-pmqs-may-corbyn-grieve-mps-launch-bid-to-ensure-they-vote-on-plan-b-within-three-days-if-mays-deal-defeated-politics-live?page=with:block-5c35c22ce4b072dc52e6b2d9#block-5c35c22ce4b072dc52e6b2d9\">he would table a no confidence motion almost immediately if May loses the vote.</a> But today, when he addressed the issue in his speech, and when he was pressed on this in his Q&amp;A, he just restated his preference for a general election, adding:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[If May does not agree to call an election], Labour will table a motion of no confidence in the government at the moment we judge it to have the best chance of success. Clearly, Labour does not have enough MPs in parliament to win a confidence vote on its own. So, members across the House should vote with us to break the deadlock. </p> </blockquote> <p>Many Tory MPs have said they would vote against May\u2019s Brexit deal, but support her government in a confidence motion. There are two scenarios where it becomes possible to imagine Labour winning; if MPs voted for the deal including the Irish backstop, leading the DUP to conclude that voting with Labour to bring down the government was the only way it can kill the backstop; or if May committed to a no-deal Brexit, leading Tory pro-Europeans to conclude that voting with Labour to bring down their own government was the only way to stop that happening. Either of these situations could arise, but probably not next week.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn insisted that the real divide in Britain is not remain v leave, but the many v the few. </strong>This was the most interesting argument in the speech, and it reflected Corbyn\u2019s ongoing desire to understand why people voted for leave in the referendum, and his interest in what can be done to reunite the country. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is, the real divide in our country is not between those who voted to remain in the EU and those who voted to leave. It is between the many \u2013 who do the work, who create the wealth and pay their taxes, and the few \u2013 who set the rules, who reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes ...</p> <p>People across the country, whether they voted leave or remain know that the system isn\u2019t working for them.</p> <p>Some see the EU as a defence against insecurity and hostility. Others see the EU as part of an establishment that plunged them into insecurity and hostility in the first place.</p> <p>But it\u2019s the failed system rigged against the many to protect the interests of the few that is the real cause of inequality and insecurity whether it\u2019s in Tottenham or Mansfield ...</p> <p>Because for both sides the EU referendum was about much more than our relationship with our biggest trading partner and its rules.</p> <p>It was about what has happened to our people over decades and how to build a better future.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the problem with this argument is that it runs counter to the wealth of academic evidence saying that identity politics is growing increasingly powerful, and the remain/leave divide (and the values split that it represents) is what matters. You can find a library of research on this topic <a href=\"http://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexitresearch/the-brexit-referendum-and-identity-politics-in-britain/\">here. </a>Depicting politics as a conflict between the many and the few implies a class analysis of voting behaviour. But class is no longer the factor that determines how people vote; age is far more important (among other things), as these two charts from<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/06/13/how-britain-voted-2017-general-election\"> a YouGov analysis of the 2017 general election </a>show.

But anyone hoping for evidence that Corbyn was warming to the idea would have been disappointed. Invited by Channel 4 News\u2019 <strong>Jon Snow </strong>to talk about policies that might appeal to young people (Snow was thinking of a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d), Corbyn sidestepped the topic and instead started talking about tuition fees. And, asked what Labour\u2019s Brexit policy would be if there were a general election, Corbyn just confirmed that the party would go into the election promising an alternative Brexit deal. He did not propose putting that deal to the public in a referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/06/labour-could-offer-second-eu-referendum-barry-gardiner-brexit\">even though a member of his shadow cabinet has recently floated this option.</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn accepted that Labour would have to extend article 50 to allow time to renegotiate Brexit if it won an early election. </strong>This is little more than a statement of what is blindingly obvious; even if May announced an election today, and Labour won, there would be no time for the renegotiation it wants before 29 March. But the party is reluctant to say this explicitly, presumably for fear of being seen as defying the outcome of the referendum.<strong> Sir Keir Starmer,</strong> the shadow Brexit secretary, went about as far down this road as anyone has when he said in the Commons yesterday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/09/brexit-latest-news-debate-pmqs-may-corbyn-grieve-mps-launch-bid-to-ensure-they-vote-on-plan-b-within-three-days-if-mays-deal-defeated-politics-live?page=with:block-5c3624eee4b0cebe76182fde#block-5c3624eee4b0cebe76182fde\">delaying article 50 \u201cmay well be inevitable\u201d.</a> Asked about this, Corbyn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Quite clearly, moving into office at a period right up against the clock, there would need to be time for that negotiation,. What Keir was doing was reflecting the practicalities of how that negotiation would be undertaken.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn spurned what appears to be a Number 10 attempt to win Labour support with a move on workers\u2019 rights.</strong> Asked about the John Mann amendment (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/10/brexit-latest-news-corbyn-speech-may-press-conference-reaches-out-to-labour-by-welcoming-workers-rights-amendment-politics-live?page=with:block-5c370627e4b072dc52e6be09#block-5c370627e4b072dc52e6be09\">9.20am</a> and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/10/brexit-latest-news-corbyn-speech-may-press-conference-reaches-out-to-labour-by-welcoming-workers-rights-amendment-politics-live?page=with:block-5c371ae0e4b02fb91ff11abd#block-5c371ae0e4b02fb91ff11abd\"> 10.52am)</a>, Corbyn replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s already been quite clearly and emphatically rejected by the TUC and leading trade unions. They say it simply doesn\u2019t guarantee the protections that we are seeking. We don\u2019t endorse or accept what has been put forward and we agree with the TUC and the other general secretaries who have already rejected that view.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was not surprising that Corbyn is not impressed by the amendment, because in practical terms it would not have much of an effect. What is really interesting is the contrast with Corbyn\u2019s conference speech. In Liverpool in September Corbyn made a point of saying in his speech that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/26/corbyn-speech-labour-conference-set-to-address-labour-conference-as-party-rejects-mps-call-for-general-strike-politics-live?page=with:block-5bab8ee2e4b0a9b970679f37#block-5bab8ee2e4b0a9b970679f37\">if May could produce a Brexit deal that matched Labour\u2019s terms, he would support it. </a>But today there was no offer to cooperate with May over Brexit. Corbyn also did not say anything about working with Tory backbenchers to produce an alternative Brexit plan. In the Commons yesterday <strong>Sir Oliver Letwin</strong>, the Conservative former cabinet minister,<a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-01-09/debates/BD4FDA5D-2936-4732-918C-5275D575722A/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Act#contribution-4770F47D-1622-4657-B0D2-9C986DF3F328\"> asked Starmer specifically</a> if Labour would be willing to cooperate with government backbenchers like himself on some sort of Norway option. There was nothing in today\u2019s speech to suggest that Corbyn is interested in taking up this offer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63f6a496db8a18391f8116b3b96504d9b82c8a33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63f6a496db8a18391f8116b3b96504d9b82c8a33/0_11_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn giving a speech on Brexit in Wakefield \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn giving a speech on Brexit in Wakefield <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-10T15:06:13.580Z\">at 3.06pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c3743ece4b0cebe761838ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-10T13:10:52.828Z\">1.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nicola Blackwood</strong>, a former Conservative MP has been appointed as a health minister and made a life peer, Downing Street has announced.

Like all the amendments to the motion, it is available on <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP190110v2.pdf\">the order paper (pdf).</a></p> <p>In many respects this amendment just restates commitments that the government has already given (which is why it is has been easy for Number 10 to welcome it). The first clause (from \u201cagrees with paragraph 79\u201d to \u201coverall economic relationship\u201d) literally just repeats the first sentence of paragraph 79 of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/759021/25_November_Political_Declaration_setting_out_the_framework_for_the_future_relationship_between_the_European_Union_and_the_United_Kingdom__.pdf\">the political declaration on the future partnership (pdf). </a>Labour point out that the political declaration is not legally binding, but the motion being voted on next week would not be legally binding either.</p> <p>The next clause (about not lowering common EU UK standards provided for in the withdrawal agreement) also just restates something already agreed by the government. The<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/759019/25_November_Agreement_on_the_withdrawal_of_the_United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland_from_the_European_Union_and_the_European_Atomic_Energy_Community.pdf\"> withdrawal agreement (pdf)</a>, which is legally binding, has \u201cnon-regression\u201d clauses on labour and social standards (p359) and on environmental protection (p355). These are intended to ensure that, after Brexit, standards in the UK are not lowered below the level that will apply at the end of the transition period (when the UK will no longer be obliged to meet EU standards).</p> <p>The only bit of the amendment with potential clout is the final clause, saying the government should invite MPs to \u201cconsider any measure approved by EU institutions after exit day which strengthens any of these protections\u201d. At this point it is important to understand the difference between non-regression, which effectively means agreeing not to go backwards in terms of standards, and dynamic alignment, which means agreeing to carry on matching EU standards if they raise theirs in the future. One of Labour\u2019s main objections to Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan for Brexit was that it promised dynamic alignment on state aid (\u201cthe UK would make an upfront commitment to maintain a common rulebook with the EU on state aid, enforced by the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority],\u201d <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/725288/The_future_relationship_between_the_United_Kingdom_and_the_European_Union.pdf\">the Chequers white paper</a> said), while it just promised non-regression on labour and environmental standards.</p> <p>The Mann amendment amounts to a nudge in the direction of dynamic alignment on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. But asking the Commons to \u201cconsider\u201d matching any tougher EU laws that come into force after Brexit is not the same as making a firm commitment to do so.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-10T10:53:12.376Z\">at 10.53am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c370fe3e4b072dc52e6be40\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-10T10:10:31.970Z\">10.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clark suggests he would resign from cabinet rather than agree to no-deal Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greg Clark,</strong> the business secretary, has been giving a series of interviews this morning, and he has also written <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/pro/time-for-uk-parliament-to-step-up-to-preserve-britain-reputation-investors-brexit-trade/\">an article for Politico Europe. </a>As well as signalling that the government will support the John Mann workers\u2019 rights amendment (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/10/brexit-latest-news-corbyn-speech-may-press-conference-reaches-out-to-labour-by-welcoming-workers-rights-amendment-politics-live?page=with:block-5c370627e4b072dc52e6be09#block-5c370627e4b072dc52e6be09\"> 9.20am)</a>, here are the other points he has been making.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Clark suggested that he would resign rather than remain in a cabinet implementing a no-deal Brexit.</strong> In his Politico article he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parliament can establish that it wants a no-deal Brexit to be ruled out.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap up this live blog now, so here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s politics news: The prime minister, Theresa May, was told by her Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, that avoiding a no-deal Brexit was \u201cthe wish of the whole world\u201d. The two leaders spoke at a press conference after a meeting this afternoon. In a boost to May, Abe said he backed her Brexit deal and urged British MPs to vote it through. May also spoke to trade union leaders in a bid to drum up support for the deal. But, unlike her encounter with Abe, she was given short shrift. Some noted pointedly that her overtures come years into the Brexit process and one said the deal \u201cisn\u2019t good enough and non-binding assurances on workers\u2019 rights won\u2019t cut it.\u201d And former senior defence figures warned May\u2019s withdrawal agreement would threaten national security in its current form. An ex-MI6 chief and a former head of the armed forces wrote to all Conservative party chairmen asking them to ensure their MPs vote against it. MPs debated Brexit in the Commons, with Labour\u2019s David Lammy saying there was \u201cno leftwing justification\u201d for it and the Conservatives\u2019 Royston Smith saying he would prefer to lose his seat than abandon the process of leaving the EU. The SNP\u2019s Mhairi Black ridiculed May\u2019s contention that it is her deal or no deal. And the DUP joined the list of those seeking to condemn May\u2019s deal, reiterating that they cannot support it as it stands. Its leader, Arlene Foster, said the backstop must go, though no-deal was not an option her party preferred. Earlier in the day, the business secretary Greg Clark called on MPs to come together to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He signalled his strong opposition to leaving without a deal but he would not threaten explicitly to resign from the government if such a strategy became policy. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, defended his controversial ruling on Grieve amendment yesterday. He had clashed with the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, who said his role was to \u201cuphold the rules that parliament has made for itself, not to arbitrarily change those rules\u201d. Bercow countered that there was \u201cnothing arbitrary\u201d in it. You can read a summary of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech on Brexit here. And, for those who\u2019d still like to read a little more, my colleague Jessica Elgot has the full story on May and Abe\u2019s meeting today: For his part, Coveney said his day involved meeting business leaders, trade unions, farmers\u2019 representatives, women\u2019s groups and other people working in the voluntary and community sector. I have to say that, in all the meetings we have had today, there is very strong support for what the prime minister is advocating for now and I wanted to try to reinforce many of those messages. Asked if he thought the DUP was \u201cout of step\u201d with public opinion in Northern Ireland, he responded: It\u2019s not for me to say that. The DUP have a very important constituency, they are the largest party in Northern Ireland. I respect that. But I\u2019ve got to listen to the other political parties too and business organisations and community organisations. I think we have a job to do to all work together here to try to navigate a way through what is a very complex and difficult negotiation. The prime minister said earlier that she wanted her deal to go through the Commons with the support of the DUP. The DUP, however, have been busy making it clear \u2013 for anyone who remained in any doubt \u2013 that they will not support it without significant changes being made. After the party held discussions with Ireland\u2019s deputy leader, Simon Coveney, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, released this statement: The withdrawal agreement is not a fair deal and we cannot support it. It should be no more acceptable to build a new east-west border than it is to build a new north-south border. The backstop is not needed. No one is going to build a hard border. We will work with the government to reach a better deal for the United Kingdom but this will require more pragmatism from the European Union. Exiting the European Union without a deal is not our favoured outcome. To reach a better deal will require a change of heart in Dublin and Brussels. I trust the Irish government will reflect on our principled objections to the withdrawal agreement and recognise that there is a better way which can work for both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. In response, a Number 10 spokeswoman has said: The claim is completely wrong. Nothing in the withdrawal agreement or our political declaration cuts across Nato, our defence or intelligence relationship with the USA or with the Five Eyes alliance. In fact, our deal delivers the broadest security agreement the EU has with any of its partners. In the letter, they also claim that the offer of a \u201cnew, deep and special relationship\u201d with the EU in defence, security and intelligence \u201ccuts across the three fundamentals of our national security policy\u201d \u2013 including Nato membership, the US relationship and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. An ex-MI6 chief and a former head of the armed forces have warned that the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal will threaten national security if it is not defeated, according to Sky News. The letter from Sir Richard Dearlove and Field Marshal Lord Guthrie reads: We are taking the unprecedented step of writing to all Conservative party chairmen to advise and to warn you that this withdrawal agreement, if not defeated, will threaten the national security of the country in fundamental ways. Please ensure that your MP does not vote for this bad agreement. The first duty of the state, above trade, is the security of its citizens. The withdrawal agreement abrogates this fundamental contract and would place control of aspects of our national security in foreign hands. Please ensure that your MP votes against this bad agreement and supports a sovereign Brexit on WTO rules, without payment of ransom, for which we now know from an heroic anonymous civil servant, the civil service is, of course, fully prepared. MPs are debating Brexit in the Commons, where the SNP\u2019s Mhairi Black has labeled Theresa May\u2019s claim that MPs must choose between her deal and a no-deal Brexit a \u201cpiece of nonsense\u201d. Since long before the ink had even dried on the text, the prime minister has been trying to create this narrative that it\u2019s a choice between her deal and no deal. But the prime minister clearly has options beyond her deal and no deal: She could ask for an extension of Article 50; she could keep us in the single market and customs union; or she could take the choice back to the people. So, to say it\u2019s her deal or no deal is a piece of nonsense. And what she\u2019s failing to say to the public is that she\u2019s deliberately manufactured things to appear that way, in a cynical attempt to save her own skin. Earlier, we mentioned the reports that the GMB\u2019s general secretary, Tim Roache, spoke to the prime minister about her Brexit deal. Since then, he\u2019s had this to say: I represent 620,000 working people and it\u2019s about time their voices were heard. After nearly three years I\u2019m glad the prime minister finally picked up the phone. As you would expect, I was very clear about GMB\u2019s position \u2013 the deal on the table isn\u2019t good enough and non-binding assurances on workers\u2019 rights won\u2019t cut it. If the deal genuinely did the job for GMB members, our union would support it. But it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s clear more time is required, we need to extend Article 50 and, ultimately, give the final say on Brexit to the public. As Abe and May meet, the Department for International Trade is trumpeting a series of deals between British and Japanese firms it says will be \u201cworth more than \u00a3200m and will help to support hundreds of jobs in the UK\u201d. It says the toy store, Hamleys, and the British motorcycle company, Norton, will each increase their presence in Japan and the Japanese drinks firm that owns Lucozade and Ribena will invest in the UK. Officials also say that British farmers will \u201cnow be able to export beef and lamb to Japan for the first time since the two meats were banned in 1996\u201d. The anti-Brexit group Best for Britain has put out this comment from the Labour MP Martin Whitfield about what Shinzo Abe had to say about a no-deal Brexit. (See 5.12pm.) Whitfield said: It is humiliating for the prime minister to be told to her face that the whole world wants to avoid a no-deal scenario, yet she still refuses to rule it out. Countries across the globe are looking at Britain in despair. Japan, like our other allies, understands the folly of a no-deal Brexit. Why doesn\u2019t Theresa May? That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. Here is the quote from Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, where he said \u201cthe whole world\u201d was hoping that Theresa May would avoid a no-deal Brexit. He said: The world is watching the UK as it exits the European Union. I would like to extend my deepest respect for the strong will and hard work by Theresa for the parliamentary approval of the withdrawal agreement. Japan and the UK have been building a very strong partnership, not only in the political arena but also the economic area. For Japan, the UK is the gateway to the European market, Japanese businesses have created 1,000 bases in the UK offering more than 150,000 jobs. It is the strong will of Japan to further develop this strong partnership with the UK, to invest more into your country and to enjoy further economic growth with the UK. That is why we truly hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, and in fact that is the whole wish of the whole world. Japan is in total support of the draft withdrawal agreement worked out between the EU and Prime Minister May which provides for transition to ensure legal stability for businesses that have invested into this country. Q: [To May] Do you think the speaker is neutral? May says this is a matter for the Commons. MPs need to know that there is consistent interpretation of the rules. She says she was \u201csurprised\u201d by John Bercow\u2019s decision yesterday. It is for him to explain it. She says Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, asked him to publish the advice he got from the clerks. Q: Is it right that the speedboat killer can still get legal aid? May says Jack Shepherd should give himself up and face justice. The MoJ is looking at the legal aid issue. Q: What do you think of the future economic relationship between the two countries? Abe says there will be negotiations to start a new economic relatonship with the UK. The two countries will continue to be the closest partners respectively in Europe and Asia. Q: What is happening to the plan for a Hitachi power plant in the UK? Abe says he did not discuss this with May. It is an important project for both countries, but the partners involved have still not decided what will happen next. May says this is a commercial decision for the company. May and Abe are now taking questions. Q: [To May] You have lost two votes in two days. And your business secretary says no deal will be a disaster. So can you rule that out? And are you still ruling out a permanent customs union? May says she has got a good deal. She wants a more ambitious trading relationship with the EU than it has with any other third country. It is an unprecedented offer. Out of the customs union, the UK could strike good trade deals with countries like Japan. Turning to the Commons, May says the only way to avoid no deal is to have a deal. She is still working with the EU on the backstop issue. Referring to her calls with union leaders, she says her deal is in the national interest. Q: [To Abe] Could Japan still use the UK as a gateway to the continent if the UK leaves with no deal? Abe says Japan has a close economic relationship with the UK. Many Japanese firms have invested in the UK. After Brexit, Japan wants to maintain this very good relationship. He hopes there will be more investment in the UK. He says the withdrawal agreement is very much to be welcomed. But the people of the UK have to take the final decision, he says. Shinzo Abe is talking now. He says the world is watching the UK as it leaves the EU. He says Japan welcomes the progress made in the withdrawal process. He praises May for her hardwork in relation to getting parliament to approve the deal. He says Japanse firms have 1,000 bases in the UK, supporting 150,000 jobs. He says he truly hopes a no-deal Brexit will be avoided. That is the wish of the whole world. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe says \u201cthe whole world\u201d wants the UK to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Theresa May is now holding a press conference with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister. May is making her opening statement, celebrating the close links between the UK and Japan. Here are are extracts from two of the more noteworthy speeches in today\u2019s Commons Brexit debate. Labour\u2019s David Lammy said there was \u201cno leftwing justification for Brexit\u201d. He told MPs: Brexit is a con, a trick, a swindle, a fraud, a deception that will hurt most of those people it promised to help, a dangerous fantasy which will make every problem it claims to solve worse ... Friends on this side of the House tell me to appease Labour voters in industrial towns - the former miners, the factory workers, those who feel they\u2019ve been left behind. I say we must not patronise them with cowardice, let\u2019s tell them the truth - you were old a lie. Immigrants have not taken your jobs, our schools and colleges failed to give you the skills, hospitals are not crumbling because of health tourists but decades of austerity that ground them down to the bone, you cannot afford a house because both parties failed to build, not because of Mohammed down the road who moved in, and wealth was hoarded in London when it should have been shared across the country. Blame us, blame Westminster, do not blame Brussels for our own country\u2019s mistakes and do not be angry at us for telling you the truth, be angry at the chancers who sold you a lie ... Just as I speak plainly to the government this time around, let me also speak to the pposition about some home truths. There is no leftwing justification for Brexit. Ditching workers\u2019 rights, social protections and ending environmental cooperation is not progressive. This is a project about neo-liberal deregulation, it\u2019s Thatcherism on steroids pushed by her modern-day disciples. Leaving the EU will not free us from the injustices of global capitalism, it will make us subordinate to Trump\u2019s US. Socialism confined to one country will not work, whether you like it or not, the world we live in is global, we can only fix the rigged system if we cooperate across border lines. The party of Keir Hardie has always been international. We must not let down our young supporters by failing to stand with them at the biggest issue of our lives. And the Conservative Royston Smith said that he would rather lose his job as an MP than cancel Brexit - but that he could not vote for Theresa May\u2019s deal. He said: I want a deal, but as it stands I don\u2019t want her deal... Take the backstop out and I will compromise again and reluctantly vote for the deal ... I would rather lose my seat, honour my commitments to my constituents and preserve what integrity is left in this place than behave as so many others are, in their own self-interest. Trudy Harrison, another Conservative MP who previously was opposed to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, has said that she will support it, ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt reports. The GMB general secretary Tim Roache took a call from Theresa May this afternoon about her Brexit deal, the BBC reports. Labour\u2019s Brexit plans are \u201cbollocks\u201d, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, told the Commons earlier. As the Press Association reports, as he opened today\u2019s Brexit debate, Gove referred to reports that shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner had referred to one of Labour\u2019s six Brexit tests in that way. Praising the Brent North MP\u2019s \u201ctruth and perfect clarity\u201d, Gove said the Commons was grateful for his casting of light on \u201cthe testicular nature\u201d of Labour\u2019s six Brexit tests. Gove went on: [Gardiner] summed them up, pithily, in a word which in Spanish translates as \u2018cojones\u2019 and in English rhymes with \u2018rollocks\u2019. I know, Mr Speaker, there are some distinguished citizens in this country who have put on their cars a poster or sticker saying \u2018bollocks to Brexit\u2019 - but we now know from Labour\u2019s own frontbench that their official Brexit position is bollocks. I have to say that the shadow international trade secretary is a jewel and an ornament to the Labour front bench. He speaks the truth with perfect clarity, and in his description of Labour\u2019s own policy can I say across the House we\u2019re grateful to him, grateful to the constant Gardiner for the way in which he has cast light on the testicular nature of Labour\u2019s position. The Lib Dem MP Sir Edward Davey raised a point of order, asking the speaker, John Bercow, if he had \u201cmade a new ruling on parliamentary language\u201d by allowing Gove to use the term. Bercow said that Gove had not been disorderly and that use of the word was \u201ca matter of taste\u201d. Labour MPs backing the workers\u2019 rights amendment that the government is welcoming (see 9.20am) have been stressing that it is only the start of a process that could make the deal more acceptable to the opposition. John Mann, who tabled the amendment, told the BBC that, although opposition MPs would be more likely to accept the deal if May accepted Labour\u2019s conditions, that was not likely to happen next Tuesday. He went on: This is the start of the process. You could reasonably say perhaps it should have been done a long time ago. But we are where we are. And there are other issues that need to be gone through, clarified. And Lisa Nandy, who has also signed the amendment, told the World at One: The amendment that we\u2019ve tabled, even though it represents progress, isn\u2019t sufficient to give me or many other Labour MPs confidence that this will lead to the sort of close relationship economically with the EU that we need to protect jobs in our constituencies. I\u2019ve been saying for five months now that I would be prepared to vote for the withdrawal agreement, but Theresa May needs to get in touch with Labour on our frontbenches and backbenches, and start having this dialogue about what we need to have the confidence to vote for it. Until now, she\u2019s only been prepared to talk to her party and particularly the right of her party. Until she starts to tilt back to the centre and have those conversations with the majority of parliament who don\u2019t support no deal and don\u2019t support a hard Brexit, she\u2019s not going to get this withdrawal agreement through. That\u2019s the importance of what happened this week. Finally there seems to be a recognition from the Conservative leadership that they are going to have to do that. Talking of George Freeman, he has tweeted a lovely picture from inside the Commons chamber. Theresa May must be desperate. According to Channel 4 News\u2019s Gary Gibbon, she has started calling trade union leaders in a bid to win more support for her Brexit deal. Until now, she has expressed precious little interest in anything they have to say. Last year Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, revealed that she had had more meetings with the German chancellor Angela Merkel than with May. Gibbon has written up the details in a blog. Here\u2019s an extract. As part of a Brexit outreach, trying to work out where opinion is amongst the wider Labour movement, the PM has called Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey and is also planning to speak to the GMB\u2019s Tim Roache. After her meeting with Labour MPs led by John Mann, Mrs May\u2019s team came away with the message that few were ready to vote for her on the basis of a pledge on workers\u2019 rights but more could be available if there was a different approach to the final Brexit deal. One who was in the conversation came away with the strong impression that could include talking about full membership of the customs union and a closer relationship with the single market. Sir Nicholas Soames, the Conservative former minister who rebelled for only the second time in his 35-year parliamentary career on Tuesday to show his opposition to a no-deal Brexit, told the World at One that the government should have reached out to Labour sooner. He said: I really do believe that our current situation of trying to deal with this in highly partisan terms is proved to be completely useless. It\u2019s simply not working and that is because the parties are split, parliament is split, the country is split. It is for parliament now to do its duty, in my view, and come to a cross-party agreement. I think if the government had been more effective in reaching out to the Labour party - which it should have been, earlier on - we would have made more progress. I do believe there are opportunities now for that to happen and I believe that such work is now going on. There is a genuine understanding that this bear-garden cannot continue and we must now work together to find a conclusion. Sensible opinion is that no-deal is not a price worth paying. I think that is a consensus around which moderate opinion of Conservatives and Labour across the House can rally round. The Conservative MP George Freeman told the Commons he would back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d. He explained: Don\u2019t accuse me please of Project Fear - this is serious Project Business that we serve. I will, with a heavy heart, on Tuesday vote for this deal because we\u2019re now in the dying stages and no deal is unconscionable. But I beg colleagues to ask their front benches in pursuit of something we can all be proud of. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reckons he is the first Tory to switch from opposing the deal to supporting it. Freeman has got form for swithering. In December 2017, in the debate that saw the government defeated on Dominic Grieve\u2019s \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d amendment (the first - there have been several) he told the Commons he would be rebelling - only to change his mind at the very last minute after a minor concession was announced. Eurotunnel has accused the government of \u201cdistortionary and anti-competitive\u201d behaviour over the award of contracts worth more than \u00a3100m to provide additional cross-Channel capacity in the case of a no-deal Brexit. As the Press Association reports, Jacques Gounon, chief executive of the train operator\u2019s parent company Getlink, wrote to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to voice \u201cserious concern\u201d about his decision to hand the work to three ferry companies. In an apparent indication that the company was considering legal action over the move, Gounon said Getlink \u201creserve all our rights to challenge such a measure both in the UK and France\u201d. According to the letter, obtained by the Financial Times, Gounon said Eurotunnel\u2019s Le Shuttle service was the \u201cmost efficient way\u201d to supply vital goods to the UK and would remain so even if new border procedures were introduced after Brexit. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: The government has invested heavily to ensure disruption at our ports is minimised in a no-deal scenario, while maximising flows through Eurotunnel and Dover continues to be our highest priority. The contracts agreed with ferry companies are entirely compliant with UK law and represent just one element of our sensible contingency work. Here is David Miliband, the Labour former foreign secretary, on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech. (See 2.05pm.) Dave Ward, the general secretary of the CWU union, has joined union colleagues (see 11.06am) in dismissing the government offer on workers\u2019 rights today (see 9.20am) as meaningless. Jeremy Corbyn is often described as a lifelong Eurosceptic. That is not wrong, but it does not fully explain Corbyn\u2019s stance on Brexit because another point is that he is not hugely interested in the topic either. The issues that engage him are ones like poverty and human rights. All of this helps to explain why his speech on Brexit this morning was, in certain respects, something of a non-event. In relation to some questions - like when will Labour table a confidence motion, or would Labour extend article 50? - we almost ended up knowing less about Labour\u2019s position after the speech than we did before. But even politicians\u2019 evasions can be interesting. And, on the plus side, the speech did reflect Corbyn\u2019s determination to move beyond Brexit. There was an argument in it. Here are the main points from the speech and the Q&amp;A Corbyn downplayed suggestions that the party will table a no confidence motion in Theresa May\u2019s government if she loses her Brexit vote next week. Yesterday two members of the shadow cabinet said he would table a no confidence motion almost immediately if May loses the vote. But today, when he addressed the issue in his speech, and when he was pressed on this in his Q&amp;A, he just restated his preference for a general election, adding: [If May does not agree to call an election], Labour will table a motion of no confidence in the government at the moment we judge it to have the best chance of success. Clearly, Labour does not have enough MPs in parliament to win a confidence vote on its own. So, members across the House should vote with us to break the deadlock. Many Tory MPs have said they would vote against May\u2019s Brexit deal, but support her government in a confidence motion. There are two scenarios where it becomes possible to imagine Labour winning; if MPs voted for the deal including the Irish backstop, leading the DUP to conclude that voting with Labour to bring down the government was the only way it can kill the backstop; or if May committed to a no-deal Brexit, leading Tory pro-Europeans to conclude that voting with Labour to bring down their own government was the only way to stop that happening. Either of these situations could arise, but probably not next week. Corbyn insisted that the real divide in Britain is not remain v leave, but the many v the few. This was the most interesting argument in the speech, and it reflected Corbyn\u2019s ongoing desire to understand why people voted for leave in the referendum, and his interest in what can be done to reunite the country. He said: The truth is, the real divide in our country is not between those who voted to remain in the EU and those who voted to leave. It is between the many \u2013 who do the work, who create the wealth and pay their taxes, and the few \u2013 who set the rules, who reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes ... People across the country, whether they voted leave or remain know that the system isn\u2019t working for them. Some see the EU as a defence against insecurity and hostility. Others see the EU as part of an establishment that plunged them into insecurity and hostility in the first place. But it\u2019s the failed system rigged against the many to protect the interests of the few that is the real cause of inequality and insecurity whether it\u2019s in Tottenham or Mansfield ... Because for both sides the EU referendum was about much more than our relationship with our biggest trading partner and its rules. It was about what has happened to our people over decades and how to build a better future. But the problem with this argument is that it runs counter to the wealth of academic evidence saying that identity politics is growing increasingly powerful, and the remain/leave divide (and the values split that it represents) is what matters. You can find a library of research on this topic here. Depicting politics as a conflict between the many and the few implies a class analysis of voting behaviour. But class is no longer the factor that determines how people vote; age is far more important (among other things), as these two charts from a YouGov analysis of the 2017 general election show. There is nothing wrong at all with Corbyn\u2019s desire to reset the terms of engagement, but he faces a very tough challenge. Corbyn suggested that he remains personally sceptical about backing a second referendum on Brexit. He did not rule out the idea, and more than once he fairly restated Labour\u2019s carefully-crafted compromise position on the subject, as agreed at the party conference. But anyone hoping for evidence that Corbyn was warming to the idea would have been disappointed. Invited by Channel 4 News\u2019 Jon Snow to talk about policies that might appeal to young people (Snow was thinking of a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d), Corbyn sidestepped the topic and instead started talking about tuition fees. And, asked what Labour\u2019s Brexit policy would be if there were a general election, Corbyn just confirmed that the party would go into the election promising an alternative Brexit deal. He did not propose putting that deal to the public in a referendum, even though a member of his shadow cabinet has recently floated this option. Corbyn accepted that Labour would have to extend article 50 to allow time to renegotiate Brexit if it won an early election. This is little more than a statement of what is blindingly obvious; even if May announced an election today, and Labour won, there would be no time for the renegotiation it wants before 29 March. But the party is reluctant to say this explicitly, presumably for fear of being seen as defying the outcome of the referendum. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, went about as far down this road as anyone has when he said in the Commons yesterday that delaying article 50 \u201cmay well be inevitable\u201d. Asked about this, Corbyn said: Quite clearly, moving into office at a period right up against the clock, there would need to be time for that negotiation,. What Keir was doing was reflecting the practicalities of how that negotiation would be undertaken. Corbyn spurned what appears to be a Number 10 attempt to win Labour support with a move on workers\u2019 rights. Asked about the John Mann amendment (see 9.20am and 10.52am), Corbyn replied: It\u2019s already been quite clearly and emphatically rejected by the TUC and leading trade unions. They say it simply doesn\u2019t guarantee the protections that we are seeking. We don\u2019t endorse or accept what has been put forward and we agree with the TUC and the other general secretaries who have already rejected that view. It was not surprising that Corbyn is not impressed by the amendment, because in practical terms it would not have much of an effect. What is really interesting is the contrast with Corbyn\u2019s conference speech. In Liverpool in September Corbyn made a point of saying in his speech that, if May could produce a Brexit deal that matched Labour\u2019s terms, he would support it. But today there was no offer to cooperate with May over Brexit. Corbyn also did not say anything about working with Tory backbenchers to produce an alternative Brexit plan. In the Commons yesterday Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister, asked Starmer specifically if Labour would be willing to cooperate with government backbenchers like himself on some sort of Norway option. There was nothing in today\u2019s speech to suggest that Corbyn is interested in taking up this offer. Nicola Blackwood, a former Conservative MP has been appointed as a health minister and made a life peer, Downing Street has announced. She will replace Lord O\u2019Shaughnessy as health minister after he resigned in December citing \u201cfamily circumstances\u201d. Blackwood was a health minister until she lost her Oxford West and Abingdon seat in the 2017 general election. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy premier, has denied meddling in UK politics, insisting he has an obligation to challenge those \u201cmisrepresenting\u201d what the Brexit deal contains. Although his comments about the importance of the Irish backstop have frequently angered Tory Brexiters, Coveney told BBC Radio Ulster that he was not interfering in British politics. He said: I am not trying to meddle, I\u2019m trying to be a candid friend. There isn\u2019t an anti-British or English bone in my body, but I believe I have an obligation in the context of the relationships between these two islands and on this island, north and south, to try to find a solution that can allow us all to live together in peace, that allows us to trade together and live normal lives as neighbours together. Some people are choosing, in my view, to misrepresent what that deal is about for the future, particularly for Northern Ireland, and I need to speak up on that - I wouldn\u2019t be fulfilling my obligations if I didn\u2019t. In the Commons earlier John Bercow, the speaker, clashed with Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, over his decision yesterday to defy precedent and allow a vote on a procedural amendment tabled by the anti-Brexit Tory Dominic Grieve. Leadsom, a Brexiter, told MPs this morning that the speaker\u2019s job was to \u201cuphold the rules that parliament has made for itself, not to arbitrarily change those rules\u201d. In response, Bercow said: There was nothing arbitrary about the conduct of the chair yesterday. This speaker is well aware of how to go about the business of chairing the proceedings of the House because he\u2019s been doing so for nine and a half years. I hope colleagues will understand when I say that I require no lessons or lectures from others about how to discharge my obligations to parliament and in support of the rights of backbench parliamentarians. I have been doing it, I\u2019m continuing to do it and I will go on doing it, no matter how much abuse I get from whatever quarter. It\u2019s water off a duck\u2019s back as far as I am concerned. Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit speech. Here is some Twitter comment on the Corbyn Brexit speech from journalists. From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From the Times\u2019 Sam Coates From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield From my colleague Jessica Elgot From the Observer\u2019s Michael Savage From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar Meanwhile, my colleague Dan Sabbagh has posted this from the Downing Street lobby briefing. Q: Many Labour members want the party to promise a second referendum if there is an election. Do you have reservations about that? Corbyn says at the Labour conference the party adopted a sequential policy, calling for a vote against May\u2019s vote, then a general election, and if that can\u2019t happen potentially a popular vote. Q: [From Channel 4 News\u2019 Jon Snow] Channel 4 News has been speaking to young people who could not vote in the referendum. Most want to remain. Have you forgotten them? Corbyn says he is very aware of how young people want free higher education, and access to training and jobs. He understands what they feel about remain. But he also understands the views of those who voted leave. His speech today was about how you can bring the country together. The government\u2019s policies will not do that. He says Labour will vote against May\u2019s deal on Tuesday. It will then, if it is successful, be calling for a general election, he says. He says he does not want to live in a country where people rely on food banks. He wants to live in a country that cares for people. And that\u2019s it. The Corbyn Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Corbyn says accepting May\u2019s deal would lock the UK into a process that would not be a good one. Q: Will you call a no confidence vote next week? Corbyn says the vote next week could be the third defeat for the government in a week. This is a government that cannot command a majority in the Commons. Labour will move a no confidence motion \u201cat a time of our choosing\u201d, when it judges there is best chance of success, he says. This chaos cannot go on, he says. The only way out is a general election. Q: Is there a split between you and Starmer on this over extending article 50? No, says Corbyn. He repeats the point about how what Starmer said about extending article 50 yesterday just reflected the practicalities. Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: If you do get a general election, what will Labour\u2019s Brexit policy be? Corbyn says the policy will be one of negotiating around a customs union, and not allowing workers\u2019 rights to fall below EU standards. That is implicit in the government\u2019s policy. Labour would want to negotiate with the EU urgently. But the party would make election policy in a democratic way. Q: Do you back the Mann amendment on workers\u2019 rights? And is there anything Theresa May could offer that would make you support her deal? Corbyn says what has been offered by the government does not go far enough on workers\u2019 rights. Labour does not accept what has been put forward. It agrees with what the TUC and other unions are saying. Q: Do you agree with Keir Starmer that extending article 50 may be inevitable. Starmer says if Labour took office, there would have to be a renegotiation. Starmer was reflecting the practicalities of this. Corbyn implies Labour would extend article 50 if it took office to allow time for a new Brexit negotiation. Corbyn is now winding up. The Conservatives are never going to tackle the burning injustices in our country or act to overcome the deep and growing inequalities. They are incapable of leading us out of a crisis they created. Britain deserves a government that can govern. The need for a government with a clear purpose and direction for the country could not be more urgent. A general election is the right answer and the best way to break the deadlock. Labour is ready to bring Leave and Remain voters together to rebuild Britain for the many not the few. Corbyn confirms Labour would continue to match EU standards on workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. Finally, why are we absolutely insistent on at least keeping pace with EU rights at work environmental standards and consumer protections? It\u2019s because with those guarantees and a radical Labour government that stands up for people against powerful vested interests, we can give workers and consumers more control over their lives. Corbyn restates his call for the UK to be in a customs union with the EU after Brexit. Why is a customs union necessary? It\u2019s because a new customs union and a radical Labour government with an active industrial strategy will allow a renaissance in our manufacturing sector, which will create good, secure jobs and help restore pride and prosperity to parts of our country that have been ignored for too long. Why do we need a strong relationship with the single market? It\u2019s because frictionless trade and a radical Labour government with a plan to invest in every region and nation of our country, will give us the chance to kick-start real growth in our economy, allowing the wealth created by this country\u2019s workforce to be shared more fairly. Corbyn renews his call for a general election if Theresa May loses the vote on her deal on Tuesday next week. (See 11.12am.) And he says, if there is no election, Labour will table a no confidence motion when it thinks it has the best chance of winning. So I say to Theresa May: if you are so confident in your deal then call that election and let the people decide. If not, Labour will table a motion of no confidence in the government at the moment we judge it to have the best chance of success. Clearly, Labour does not have enough MPs in parliament to win a confidence vote on its own. So members across the House should vote with us to break the deadlock. This paralysis cannot continue. Uncertainty is putting people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods at risk. And if a general election cannot be secured then we will keep all options on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote. But an election must be the priority. It is not only the most practical option, it is also the most democratic option. It could give the winning party a renewed mandate to negotiate a better deal for Britain and secure support for it in Parliament and across the country. Yesterday two members of the shadow cabinet said Corbyn would table a no confidence motion almost immediately if May loses the vote next week. What Corbyn has said just now puts that in doubt, because it is not obvious that Labour would have a good chance of winning if the vote were held next week. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He thanks Laura Pidcock for her introduction. And he welcomes Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, who is also here. And he said Burgon did well in his media interviews this morning - so well that the Tories have gone into overdrive attacking him, he says. The Conservatives have put out a news release saying that, in various interviews, Burgon failed on a total of 23 occasions to say what Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit would be if there were to be a general election. The Labour MP Laura Pidcock is introducing Jeremy Corbyn. She says in Wakefield people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn is about to deliver his Brexit speech in Wakefield. Here are two extracts released in advance. Corbyn will renew his call for a general election. Let there be no doubt: Theresa May\u2019s deal is a bad deal and Labour will vote against it next week in parliament. If the government cannot pass its most important legislation, then there must be a general election at the earliest opportunity. A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all. So I say to Theresa May: if you are so confident in your deal, call that election, and let the people decide. To break the deadlock an election is not only the most practical option, it is also the most democratic option. It would give the winning party a renewed mandate to negotiate a better deal for Britain and secure support for it in Parliament and across the country. For both sides, the EU referendum was about so much more than our relationship with our biggest trading partner and its rules. It was about what\u2019s happened to our people over decades and how to build a better future. The need for a government with a clear purpose and direction for the country could not be more urgent. Labour stands ready to bring leave and remain voters together to rebuild Britain for the many, not the few. He will claim that the real divide in the UK is not between remain and leave, but between the many and the few. The real divide in our country is not between those who voted to remain in the EU and those who voted to leave. It is between the many, who do the work, create the wealth and pay taxes, and the few, who set the rules, reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes. If you\u2019re living in Tottenham, you may well have voted to Remain. You\u2019ve got high bills, rising debts, you\u2019re in insecure work, you struggle to make your wages stretch, and you may be on universal credit and accessing food banks. You\u2019re up against it. If you\u2019re living in Mansfield, you are likely to have voted to Leave. You\u2019ve got high bills, rising debts, you\u2019re in insecure work, you struggle to make your wages stretch, and you may be on universal credit and accessing food banks. You\u2019re up against it. People across the country, whether they voted leave or remain, both know that the system isn\u2019t working for them. Some see the European Union as a defence against insecurity and hostility. Others see the European Union as part of an establishment that plunged them into insecurity and hostility in the first place. But it\u2019s the failed system rigged against the many to protect the interests of the few that is the real cause of inequality and insecurity, whether in Tottenham or Mansfield. And the real solution is to transform Britain to work in the interests of the vast majority, by challenging the entrenched power of a privileged elite. That is how we can help to heal the referendum\u2019s deep divisions. Union leaders have dismissed the government\u2019s announcement that it could accept the Mann amendment on workers\u2019 rights. (See 9.20am and 10.52am.) This is from Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC. This amendment makes no change to a bad deal for working people\u2019s jobs and rights. We\u2019ve been clear that what working people need is a long-term, binding guarantee that their rights will keep pace with those across Europe. The amendment doesn\u2019t deliver that. It doesn\u2019t even provide an adequate guarantee for the rights we already have. And since the political declaration isn\u2019t legally binding, there\u2019s nothing to stop a future government from ignoring it altogether. The prime minister has talked a big game on workers\u2019 rights all along, but once again the reality falls short. And this is from Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB. The government has systematically refused to engage with trade unions over workers\u2019 rights and is now trying to buy off MPs with legally unenforceable tweaks that are not worth the paper they are written on. These assurances are meaningless at best, and at worst a cynical attempt to use workers\u2019 rights as a bargaining chip for self-preservation. To be clear - this doesn\u2019t guarantee workers a single thing. Any MP who thinks this is enough to make a bad deal good needs to have a serious word with themselves. Here is the full text of the John Mann workers\u2019 rights amendment (see 9.20am) to the motion backing the government\u2019s Brexit deal. It says: At end, add \u201cagrees with paragraph 79 of the political declaration that the future relationship must ensure open and fair competition and that provisions to ensure this should cover state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change, and relevant tax matters, building on the level playing field arrangements provided for in the withdrawal agreement and commensurate with the overall economic relationship; and determines not to allow the UK leaving the EU to result in any lowering after exit day of common EU UK standards provided for in the withdrawal agreement in relation to employment, environmental protection and health and safety which will continue to protect the wellbeing of every person in this country; and determines that the government should invite the House to consider any measure approved by EU institutions after exit day which strengthens any of these protections. The amendment has also been signed by the Labour MPs Gareth Snell, Caroline Flint and Lisa Nandy. Like all the amendments to the motion, it is available on the order paper (pdf). In many respects this amendment just restates commitments that the government has already given (which is why it is has been easy for Number 10 to welcome it). The first clause (from \u201cagrees with paragraph 79\u201d to \u201coverall economic relationship\u201d) literally just repeats the first sentence of paragraph 79 of the political declaration on the future partnership (pdf). Labour point out that the political declaration is not legally binding, but the motion being voted on next week would not be legally binding either. The next clause (about not lowering common EU UK standards provided for in the withdrawal agreement) also just restates something already agreed by the government. The withdrawal agreement (pdf), which is legally binding, has \u201cnon-regression\u201d clauses on labour and social standards (p359) and on environmental protection (p355). These are intended to ensure that, after Brexit, standards in the UK are not lowered below the level that will apply at the end of the transition period (when the UK will no longer be obliged to meet EU standards). The only bit of the amendment with potential clout is the final clause, saying the government should invite MPs to \u201cconsider any measure approved by EU institutions after exit day which strengthens any of these protections\u201d. At this point it is important to understand the difference between non-regression, which effectively means agreeing not to go backwards in terms of standards, and dynamic alignment, which means agreeing to carry on matching EU standards if they raise theirs in the future. One of Labour\u2019s main objections to Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan for Brexit was that it promised dynamic alignment on state aid (\u201cthe UK would make an upfront commitment to maintain a common rulebook with the EU on state aid, enforced by the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority],\u201d the Chequers white paper said), while it just promised non-regression on labour and environmental standards. The Mann amendment amounts to a nudge in the direction of dynamic alignment on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. But asking the Commons to \u201cconsider\u201d matching any tougher EU laws that come into force after Brexit is not the same as making a firm commitment to do so. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has been giving a series of interviews this morning, and he has also written an article for Politico Europe. As well as signalling that the government will support the John Mann workers\u2019 rights amendment (see 9.20am), here are the other points he has been making. Clark suggested that he would resign rather than remain in a cabinet implementing a no-deal Brexit. In his Politico article he said: Parliament can establish that it wants a no-deal Brexit to be ruled out. Most MPs, across the House, including many in government, would not countenance leaving on March 29 with no agreement. But he would not threaten explicitly to resign in these circumstances (as his junior minister, Richard Harrington, did earlier this week). Asked on the Today programme if he would resign rather than see no deal, Clark said: I would always work and fight to make sure that the policy of the government is to have a good deal, to avoid what I think would be a disaster which would be no deal. Clark called for MPs to \u201ccome together\u201d to agree a Brexit deal. He told the Today programme: It is my strong view that we need to come together. We need to act to avoid a no-deal because I don\u2019t think there is anything remotely like a majority in parliament that will tolerate this. He indicated that he was in favour of holding a series of indicative votes in the Commons, to see which of the various options available has most support, in the event of Theresa May\u2019s deal being defeated. Other pro-European cabinet ministers have also floated this idea, but Number 10 seems to be resisting. Clark said: I have said in public and in discussions that to establish what parliament wants and what parliament supports can be a useful step. You need, it seems to me, to move from parliament being just a scrutineer but to be active participants, and that means discovering parliament\u2019s mind. In doing so I think what would very quickly be established, there is a substantial majority that absolutely does not want to see no deal. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has indicated that the government will back a Labour amendment to the motion approving the government\u2019s Brexit deal guaranteeing workers\u2019 rights. As the Daily Mirror reports, the amendment has been tabled by Labour MPs, and the government is welcoming it in the hope of getting some Labour MPs to back May\u2019s deal. Asked about it on Sky News this morning, Clark said: It seems to me, if you want to come together with an agreement, you\u2019ve got to listen to all sides. When it comes to workers\u2019 rights, Theresa May has always been very clear that she believes in our strong tradition of workers\u2019 rights ... The Labour party introduced the minimum wage, the Conservative party introduced the national living wage ... This amendment has been put down by a number of Labour MPs. It seems to be consonant with the cross-party view that has prevailed for decades now, that we should be strengthening workers\u2019 rights in this country ... We have not come to the debate yet, but [the prime minister] has said, rightly in my view, that we will look at it with sympathy. Quite what practical impact this amendment would have is a matter of debate, but John Mann, the Brexiter Labour MP who tabled it, told the Mirror it was mattered. \u201cIf we have a guarantee that works on workers\u2019 rights and conditions, that\u2019s significant,\u201d Mann said. But Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, was sceptical about the amendment when asked about it on the Today programme this morning. He said: When it comes to the crunch I don\u2019t trust the Conservatives on workers\u2019 rights. Even the noises that are being made in the press by the Conservatives don\u2019t mean any such agreement would be legally binding when it comes to protecting workers\u2019 rights. We\u2019ll hear from both May and Jeremy Corbyn on this later. May is holding a press conference, and Corbyn is giving what is billed as a major Brexit speech. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, speaks at a conference in Dublin. 10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, takes business questions in the Commons. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech on Brexit. After 11.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, opens day two of the Brexit debate. Late afternoon: Theresa May holds a press conference in Downing Street with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but mostly I will be focusing on Brexit, the Corbyn speech and the May press conference. I plan to post a summary when I finish, after 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Record numbers of patients are not getting vital cancer care on time because NHS England performance against waiting time targets has fallen to its lowest ever level, according to official figures. Hospitals are increasingly having to force patients to wait for care because they cannot keep up with the growing numbers being referred by GPs who fear they have the disease. Over 18,000 suspected cancer patients a month in England are now not getting to see a specialist or starting their treatment within prescribed timescales, NHS England\u2019s latest performance data has revealed. In November, 14,634 people did not see a specialist cancer consultant within 14 days, the supposed maximum length of time the NHS constitution says that anyone referred by their GP should have to wait. Another 2,884 people could not start their treatment inside 62 days, and a further 894 did not begin their treatment within 31 days, despite family doctors classifying both groups as urgent cases. Experts warned that the growing delays lead to mental anguish for patients, could have \u201ca serious impact\u201d on people\u2019s health and raised doubts about the NHS\u2019s plans to improve Britain\u2019s internationally poor record of diagnosing cancer early. \u201cWhen they suffer delays like these, patients are bound to ask themselves whether the wait has had an impact if they\u2019re diagnosed with cancer. It\u2019s difficult for nurses to reassure patients in this situation, which compounds the anxiety and distress patients already feel,\u201d said Patricia Marquis, a regional director at the Royal College of Nursing in England. \u201cTens of thousands of patients and their families are enduring agonising waits, all too aware that a small delay could have a serious impact,\u201d she said. More people were unable to see a specialist within 14 days during April to November 2018 than in the whole of the previous financial year. While 113,935 patients had to wait longer than 14 days in 2017-18, even more \u2013 124,133 \u2013 missed out that target between April to November 2018. That is the highest number since the target was introduced in October 2009. NHS performance against some of the cancer waiting times targets has nosedived over the past year at the same time as concerns have grown about shortages of cancer doctors and specialist cancer nurses. The number of those not seeing a specialist within 14 days has risen by 60% since last year. The NHS trust in Oxford ran so short of cancer nurses last year that it considered rationing the amount of chemotherapy patients it should receive, while one in London was forced to merge two chemotherapy units for the same reason. While hospitals should ensure that 93% of patients see a specialist within two weeks, just 91.7% were able to do so in the eight months between April and November 2018 \u2013 again, their worst performance on record. During that same period 6,256 people could not start their treatment within 31 days of doctors making a \u201cdecision to treat\u201d.

The 14-day target has been missed for the past eight months. Macmillan Cancer Support\u2019s executive director of policy and impact, Fran Woodard, said: \u201cBehind these figures are people waiting anxiously for a diagnosis and treatment, during a period when lives are already being turned upside down, despite the best efforts of NHS staff facing greater demand for their services and increased pressures.\u201d NHS leaders, whose long-term plan for the service\u2019s future this week outlined ambitious improvements to cancer diagnosis and outcomes, must draw up a fully costed plan to give cancer services the workforce they need, added Woodard. The King\u2019s Fund also highlighted that growing numbers of patients are having to wait more than six weeks \u2013 the supposed limit \u2013 to have a CT, MRI scan or X-ray to help doctors diagnose if they have cancer. Deborah Ward, a senior analyst at the thinktank, said: \u201cAlthough the NHS is treating thousands more people, it can\u2019t keep up with rapidly increasing demand. \u201cThe long-term plan set out ambitious targets to improve cancer care and these new figures highlight the scale of the challenge.

      "bodyText": "The huge stone figures of Easter Island have beguiled explorers, researchers and the wider world for centuries, but now experts say they have cracked one of the biggest mysteries: why the statues are where they are. Researchers say they have analysed the locations of the megalithic platforms, or ahu, on which many of the statues known as moai sit, as well as scrutinising sites of the island\u2019s resources, and have discovered the structures are typically found close to sources of fresh water. They say the finding backs up the idea that aspects of the construction of the platforms and statues, such as their size, could be tied to the abundance and quality of such supplies. \u201cWhat is important about it is that it demonstrates the statue locations themselves are not a weird ritual place \u2013 [the ahu and moai] represent ritual in a sense of there is symbolic meaning to them, but they are integrated into the lives of the community,\u201d said Prof Carl Lipo from Binghamton University in New York, who was co-author of the research. Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, has more than 300 megalithic platforms, each of which might have been made by a separate community. The first of these are believed to have been constructed in the 13th century, and many are found around the coast. It is thought the monuments represent ancestors and were linked to ritual activity, forming a focal point for communities, but the reason for their locations was previously a mystery. While studies have suggested the sites might have been chosen because of a link to key resources, the team says the latest research is the first attempt to scrutinise such claims. The team focused on the east of the island, where various resources have been well mapped, and looked at the distribution of 93 megalithic platforms constructed before European sailors turned up in the 18th century. After finding no link to the proximity of rock used for tools or for the monuments, they looked at whether the ahu were found near other important resources: gardens spread with stones in which crops like sweet potatoes were grown, sites linked to fishing, and sources of fresh water. Lipo said he became interested in the latter after he and his colleagues began delving into where those living on Rapa Nui got their drinking water from. The island has no permanent streams, and there is little evidence that residents relied on the island\u2019s lakes. However, fresh water passes through the ground into aquifers, seeping into caves as well as emerging around the coast. \u201cIt is sort of amazing at low tide when the water goes down, suddenly there are streams running off at different spots right at the coast that are just pure fresh water,\u201d said Lipo. \u201cWe noticed this, actually, when we were doing a survey on the island, that we would see horses drinking from the ocean.\u201d Historical records reveal islanders drank this rather brackish water, while studies suggest they also made wells to capture drinking water. The results of the new research, published in the journal Plos One, reveal proximity to freshwater sites is the best explanation for the ahu locations \u2013 and explains why they crop up inland as well as on the coast. \u201cThe exceptions to the rule about being at the coast where water comes out actually are met by the fact there is also water there \u2013 it is found through cave locations,\u201d said Lipo, adding historic wells were found to explain some ahu locations apparently without fresh water. Lipo said the results chimed with the team\u2019s experiences on the ground. \u201cEvery time we saw massive amounts of fresh water, we saw giant statues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was ridiculously predictable,\u201d he added. The results, said Lipo, made sense, as drinking water is essential for communities and it is impractical to have to walk miles for a quick swig. \u201cYou would do stuff near the fresh water,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s oceans are warming at a faster rate than previously estimated, new research has found, raising fresh concerns over the rapid progress of climate change. Warming oceans take up more space, a process known as thermal expansion, which the study says is likely to raise sea levels by about 30cm by the end of the century, on top of the rise in sea levels from melting ice and glaciers. Warmer oceans are also a major factor in increasing the severity of storms, hurricanes and extreme rainfall. Oceans store heat so effectively that it would take decades for them to cool down, even in the unlikely scenario that greenhouse gas emissions were halted urgently. The report, published on Thursday in the journal Science, found that the warming of the oceans was accelerating and was matching the predictions of climate change models, which have shown global temperature rises are likely to lead to extreme weather across the world. Zeke Hausfather, co-author of the paper and a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said: \u201cWhile 2018 will be the fourth warmest year on record on the [earth\u2019s] surface, it will most certainly be the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that.

But the role of oceans in the global climate system was overlooked for many years, in part because of a lack of data and the difficulty of studying the marine environment. Only in recent years have scientists come to realise the full importance of oceans, which have effectively absorbed much of the impact of climate change in recent decades, but are now understood to be reaching their capacity as a buffer. Separate recently published research extrapolated temperature estimates for the oceans for the past 150 years, and found substantial warming. Published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, that research found the total heat taken up by the oceans in the last century and a half was about 1,000 times the annual energy use of the world\u2019s population. A Guardian analysis of those findings suggested that the amount of energy absorbed by the oceans was equivalent to an atomic bomb per second for the past 150 years. Scientists said this was unsustainable in the long term without seeing further massive effects, including extreme weather, fiercer storms, and sea level rises. The heating could also affect sea currents around the world, with unpredictable consequences. Late last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the world would face dire effects from global warming from 2030 unless urgent and drastic measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The new Science paper analysed four studies published between 2014 and 2017, which corrected for discrepancies between different types of ocean temperature measurements and gaps in measurements. Satellite monitoring, buoys and ships are all used to gather data on the effect of climate change on the oceans. In the past decade, a network of 4,000 buoys known as Argo has provided an unprecedented data set on the temperature, salinity and acidification of oceans. By taking the four studies, with different methodologies, into consideration the authors of the new analysis were able to build a fuller picture than was previously possible, with calculations extrapolated back to the 1970s.",

I predict that within a decade they will become institutions wholly owned by the state, their academic autonomy unrecognisable.</p> \n<p>A few weeks ago, three universities were reported to be on the <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/education/university-bankruptcy-reliant-on-loans/\" title=\"\">brink of bankruptcy</a>. University debt has soared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/10/uk-growing-higher-education-debt-crisis-government\" title=\"\">by \u00a312bn</a> in the past decade. Cardiff has borrowed \u00a3300m over 40 years, with experts suggesting it would take 2,000 years to repay if its current surplus does not improve. The backing for these loans is supposedly the ballooning scale of student fees, which David Cameron almost tripled to \u00a39,000 in 2012 in England, and the removal of the cap on student numbers. Fees, rather than grants, now comprise the vast bulk of all university income for teaching undergraduates.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/dec/11/struggling-uk-universities-warn-staff-of-possible-job-cuts\">Struggling UK universities warn staff of possible job cuts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The fee rise was an open cheque. Universities slammed on the accelerator and drove fees for virtually all courses up to the \u00a39,000 cap. They made unconditional offers and hurled money at providing lifestyle value. The chief draw to students was the smart residences now towering over cities, notably across the north of England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/27/revealed-developers-cashing-in-privatisation-uk-student-housing\" title=\"\">many financed from overseas tax havens</a>. Dubiously productive masters degrees were heavily marketed, and applicants were admitted from abroad with few questions asked. More than <a href=\"https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/Research--Policy/Statistics/International-student-statistics-UK-higher-education\" title=\"\">four in 10 postgraduate students</a> in Britain are now from outside the European Union. Many universities are little more than global finishing schools.</p> \n<p>Universities have been able to borrow to finance this capital expansion against the income they get from fees. But since the government pays these fees upfront, and barely half of student loans are expected to be repaid, the guarantor is effectively the Treasury. This resulting student debt has reached <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jun/15/uk-student-loan-debt-soars-to-more-than-100bn\" title=\"\">a staggering \u00a3100bn</a>, and is <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/student-loans-report-publication/\" title=\"\">predicted to rise by 2042 to \u00a3200bn</a>, and on some estimates to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-44433569\" title=\"\">as much as \u00a31tn</a>.</p> \n<p>The government has tried desperately to treat this student debt mountain as an asset with a future income stream. But when it tried recently to sell a loans parcel in the money market, it got just <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/education/government-rapped-for-losing-600m-in-student-loan-sell-off/\" title=\"\">half their face value</a>. The Office for National Statistics changed the way student loans are treated in the government\u2019s books last month, slamming an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/17/student-loan-hole-public-finances-ons-accounts\" title=\"\">annual \u00a312bn</a> on to public expenditure and wiping out Philip Hammond\u2019s budgetary \u201cimprovement\u201d overnight.</p> \n<p>Cameron\u2019s former universities minister, Lord Willetts, must rank with Charles Ponzi among the wizards of debt. There is, of course, a difference. Ponzi made snake-oil promises to dumb investors, who took the eventual hit. The university snake oil \u2013 higher education for half the nation \u2013 was sold to dumb ministers for political glory, in the knowledge they dared not refuse. The Ponzi pyramid was built on the assumption that ever-growing numbers of students would take out \u2013 and repay \u2013 ever more loans.</p> \n<p>That pyramid is collapsing. The number of students at UK universities has <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/11-01-2018/sfr247-higher-education-student-statistics/location\" title=\"\">fallen since 2012</a>. EU research funds will likely vanish with Brexit, which could also do more damage to student numbers. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/19/may-speaks-out-about-vice-chancellors-setting-their-own-pay\" title=\"\">imminent review of university finance by Philip Augar</a> is rumoured to advise a fee cut to \u00a36,500.

Fees in the UK are among the highest in the world, and some doubt there will be a return on such a huge investment in terms of graduate earnings.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What will the review look at?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The government is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/18/cutting-tuition-fees-would-backfire-justine-greening-warns-theresa-may\">promising a wide-ranging review</a>&nbsp;of the whole of post-18 education and funding, including the divide between vocational and academic qualifications and the decline in lifelong and part-time study. Most of the interest will be in undergraduate tuition fees, which stand at a hefty \u00a39,250 a year at all but a handful of universities.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the options?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The government will not seek to match&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/21/labour-abolish-university-tuition-fees-jeremy-corbyn-eu-uk-europe\">Labour\u2019s promise to axe tuition fees</a>&nbsp;altogether, which the Conservatives regard as unaffordable and regressive. The review could recommend cutting or freezing fees. One of the most controversial options is the introduction of variable fees for different courses, depending on the cost of putting a course on, potential graduate earnings and the economic value to the country. So some universities might for example cut their fees for social science and humanities courses, which generally attract lower graduate earnings than engineering or maths.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Will that make the system fairer?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many fear it will result in the most disadvantaged students applying for cheaper courses with the poorest graduate outcomes, hindering rather than boosting social mobility. Senior Tories would prefer to see alternative measures including a cut in interest rates on student repayments,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/11/student-loan-interest-rate-rise-uk-inflation-brexit\">which currently stand at 6.1%</a>, and increased financial support for disadvantaged students. There is widespread support for the return of maintenance grants for poorer students,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/01/maintenance-grants-scrapped-for-poorest-students\">which were scrapped</a>&nbsp;in favour of loans by the Tories, making it even more expensive for those students to go to university.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How quickly are things likely to change?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not very. With the review set to run for a year, reporting in early 2019, the government has been accused of kicking the issue into the long grass.

      "bodyText": "Meanwhile, back at the ranch \u2013 or in this case the campus \u2013 the mice are running riot. Ignored by Brexit, Britain\u2019s universities are facing financial meltdown. I predict that within a decade they will become institutions wholly owned by the state, their academic autonomy unrecognisable. A few weeks ago, three universities were reported to be on the brink of bankruptcy. University debt has soared by \u00a312bn in the past decade. Cardiff has borrowed \u00a3300m over 40 years, with experts suggesting it would take 2,000 years to repay if its current surplus does not improve. The backing for these loans is supposedly the ballooning scale of student fees, which David Cameron almost tripled to \u00a39,000 in 2012 in England, and the removal of the cap on student numbers. Fees, rather than grants, now comprise the vast bulk of all university income for teaching undergraduates. The fee rise was an open cheque. Universities slammed on the accelerator and drove fees for virtually all courses up to the \u00a39,000 cap. They made unconditional offers and hurled money at providing lifestyle value. The chief draw to students was the smart residences now towering over cities, notably across the north of England, many financed from overseas tax havens. Dubiously productive masters degrees were heavily marketed, and applicants were admitted from abroad with few questions asked. More than four in 10 postgraduate students in Britain are now from outside the European Union. Many universities are little more than global finishing schools. Universities have been able to borrow to finance this capital expansion against the income they get from fees. But since the government pays these fees upfront, and barely half of student loans are expected to be repaid, the guarantor is effectively the Treasury. This resulting student debt has reached a staggering \u00a3100bn, and is predicted to rise by 2042 to \u00a3200bn, and on some estimates to as much as \u00a31tn. The government has tried desperately to treat this student debt mountain as an asset with a future income stream. But when it tried recently to sell a loans parcel in the money market, it got just half their face value. The Office for National Statistics changed the way student loans are treated in the government\u2019s books last month, slamming an annual \u00a312bn on to public expenditure and wiping out Philip Hammond\u2019s budgetary \u201cimprovement\u201d overnight. Cameron\u2019s former universities minister, Lord Willetts, must rank with Charles Ponzi among the wizards of debt. There is, of course, a difference. Ponzi made snake-oil promises to dumb investors, who took the eventual hit. The university snake oil \u2013 higher education for half the nation \u2013 was sold to dumb ministers for political glory, in the knowledge they dared not refuse. The Ponzi pyramid was built on the assumption that ever-growing numbers of students would take out \u2013 and repay \u2013 ever more loans. That pyramid is collapsing. The number of students at UK universities has fallen since 2012. EU research funds will likely vanish with Brexit, which could also do more damage to student numbers. An imminent review of university finance by Philip Augar is rumoured to advise a fee cut to \u00a36,500. This will be despite the Russell Group of the most selective universities wanting the cap on fees to be raised or abolished, so they can go on digging for state gold. Such a reduction would be an admission that Cameron\u2019s fee rise was not a money-saving, but a money-spending device. Cutting fees would save the taxpayer billions in unrepaid loans, but it would devastate universities. Dozens may go bankrupt, others would be forced to merge, and student numbers would plummet. The higher education bubble would burst. Except, we know this will not happen. Universities will plead that they are \u201ctoo good to fail\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the main events. UK retail chief Mike Ashley has tightened his grip on Debenhams, by forcing the struggling retailer\u2019s chairman to resign. The move came hours after Debenhams and Marks &amp; Spencer both reported falling sales over the crucial Christmas period, while Halfords hit shareholders with a profits warning. John Lewis added to the angst, by warning that its staff bonus might be axed for the first time since the 1950s. Britain\u2019s car industry has been hit by two blows -- Ford and Jaguar Land Rover are both cutting jobs, as they try to cope with China\u2019s slowing economy, the diesel crisis, and Brexit. Goodnight. GW The Financial Times points out that Debenhams has lost 90% of its value on Cheshire\u2019s watch: Sir Ian became chairman in April 2016, having previously been chief executive of DIY conglomerate Kingfisher. He was joined by Mr Bucher later that year. Since then, the stock has lost roughly 90 per cent of its value amid a series of profit warnings, and pre-tax profit has fallen from more than \u00a3100m to \u00a332m last year. A new strategy, termed Redesigning Debenhams, was launched in April 2017, aiming to increase digital sales, close underperforming stores and reduce reliance on price promotions. However, a downturn in consumer sentiment after the Brexit referendum and a rapid shift of shopping online left the company fighting for its future. Over in the eurozone, German chancellor Angela Merkel has paid a visit to Greece - almost 10 years after its debt crisis began. Amid high security in Athens, the visit is going smoother than Merkel\u2019s last trip, when there were mass protests, cartoonists portraying her as Hitler and demonstrators donning Nazi garb. My colleague Helena Smith explains: Hailing the progress the debt-stricken had made in the almost ten years since receiving the first of three bailouts, the German leader found it hard to suppress a smile. Tsipras, also smiling broadly, declared that the two-day official visit marked the end \u201cin a difficult cycle of relations between our two countries.\u201d Both leaders will be addressing the media later this PM before Tsipras treats Merkel to dinner in the picturesque Kastella district in Piraeus. As yet, nobody knows if it will be an austerity meal. Yet more news! Donald Trump has just pulled out of attending the World Economic Forum in Davos later this month. He had been due to give a keynote address for the second year running, but has now ditched the plan due to the ongoing government shutdown. Retail analyst Andrew Busby reckons Mike Ashley has moved a step closer to folding Debenhams into his empire, having already acquired House of Fraser last year. One odd thing about today\u2019s City bloodletting: Sports Direct doesn\u2019t own enough Debenhams shares to purge the board on its own (just 29.7%). Ashley has been forced to keep his shareholding below 30%, to avoid being forced to launch a full takeover bid for a listed company. Landmark, which also voted against chairman Cheshire and CEO Bucher, owns 7%. That\u2019s still not enough for a majority...unless other shareholders don\u2019t vote at all, which is what appears to have happened. Veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb thinks Debenham\u2019s advisors blundered badly today by not getting enough support for their top brass. Here\u2019s the voting at Debenhams\u2019 AGM: Suzy Ross, senior advisor at Accenture Retail says Debenhams woes are a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d for other retailers. \u201cThe dramatic and sustained decline in Debenhams\u2019 fortunes in the last 3 years is not simply down to wider physical retail market challenges. Department stores are one of the hardest and most complex sectors of retail \u2013 and they require deep specialist experience to be successful. In a headlong rush to create new customer experiences - such as prioritising mobile and premium store experiences - losing sight of getting the product and proposition right for loyal, valuable customers has been costly. Terry Duddy, who is replacing Cheshire as interim chairman, says he recognises that \u201cindividual shareholders\u201d (yes you, Mr Ashley) have \u201cwished to register their dissatisfaction\u201d. Duddy adds: My first task is to meet with shareholders so that I understand any concerns that they may have.\u201d Sir Ian Cheshire\u2019s forced departure from Debenhams follows an extremely poor year for the company. Debenhams issued three (!) profit warnings in 2018, as the high street chain struggled to cope with changes in the retail space. Its share price has plunged from 36p a year ago to just 4.8p today, driving its market capitalisation below \u00a360m. The company also owes around \u00a3300m, and is trying to hammer out a wide-ranging restructuring plan that will involve store closures, thousands of job losses, and a debt restructuring. The news that Debenham\u2019s suffered a 3% drop in sales over Christmas may have been the last straw for Mike Ashley, who has built up a near 30% stake in the company. More reaction to the boardroom putsch at Debenhams: Newsflash: City veteran Sir Ian Cheshire has just been dramatically ousted as chairman of Debenhams. Just hours after reporting falling sales at Christmas, the struggling retailer has revealed that a majority of shareholders voted AGAINST Cheshire\u2019s reelection at an AGM today. That\u2019s because Sports Direct, controlled by Mike Ashley, used its 29.7% shareholding to oppose Cheshire, and also Sergio Bucher, Debenham\u2019s CEO. Another major shareholder (thought to be Dubai-based Landmark) also voted against the pair. Debenhams says: Given the decision of two major shareholders who voted against his re-election to the board, Sir Ian has concluded it is no longer possible for him to remain Chairman of Debenhams plc. Cheshire has fallen on his sword, and will be replaced by director Terry Duddy. Bucher is staying on as CEO, though, despite only getting 44% of the vote (Cheshire accrued just 43%). Debenhams says: The board is mindful of its responsibilities to all shareholders and has full confidence in Sergio and in the management\u2019s plan to reshape the business. As a result, the board and Sergio have agreed that he should continue as CEO of Debenhams plc, reporting to the board. This dramatic development puts Debenhams into a fresh crisis. Before Christmas, Ashley revealed he was pushing the company to accept a \u00a340m loan, warning it might not keep operating otherwise. More car news. Japanese carmaker Honda will halt UK production for six days in April due to Brexit logistics and border disruption, according to Sky News. Honda typically holds just one hour\u2019s worth of parts at its factory in Swindon, so new friction at the UK border would be a big problem. Last year, it told MPs last year that every 15 minutes of customs delays would cost some manufacturers up to \u00a3850,000 a year. Andy Street, West Midlands mayor, is hopeful that JLR will remain committed to the UK, despite its heavy job cut plans. He also fears deeper job cut, if a Brexit deal isn\u2019t agreed in time. JLR\u2019s Ralf Speth is being quizzed about Brexit. Speth says he doesn\u2019t know what will happen in March, but there will be \u201chuge implications\u201d if a hard Brexit occurs. He also concedes that Brexit is a factor behind today\u2019s announcement, pointing out that UK car sales have fallen 7% in the last year. China and diesel are bigger issues, though, Asked if JLR is hoarding parts in preparation for Brexit disruption, Speth says it is stockpiling, but enough for a few days not several weeks. Jaguar Land Rover boss Ralf Speth is holding a conference call with journalists now. On it, he says: JLR is committed to growing its UK business; the company is, and will remain, a British company It faces three serious challenges: the slowdown in China, the fall in diesel sales, and Brexit (as explained earlier). The restructuring, and 4,500 job cuts, announced today will create a leaner organisation, reducing costs and allowing faster decision making. On the job cuts, Speth says JLR is already consulting with unions about voluntary redundancy, and early retirement packages. There\u2019s retail gloom on both sides of the Atlantic today. US retail group Macy has sent shockwaves through Wall Street today by reporting weak sales over the Christmas holiday period, forcing it to cut its 2018 earnings outlook. This has sent Macy\u2019s shares plunging by 18%, with other retails also suffering as traders worry that US consumers are cutting back. Dame Caroline Spelman (MP for Meriden) and Jack Dromey (MP for Birmingham Erdington), who both have many Jaguar Land Rover workers in their constituencies, have issued a statement on the JLR job cuts. \u201cIt is, of course, bad news that Jaguar Land Rover is being forced to make further job cuts. Since Tata took over the company in 2008, it has gone from strength to strength, creating thousands of jobs in Meriden, Erdington and across many other areas of the UK, transforming the lives of tens of thousands of local people However, recent years have been difficult. Falling sales in China due to global trade wars as well as changing consumer attitudes to diesel vehicles have been damaging. These difficulties have been compounded by the continuing uncertainty over Brexit. Unfortunately, as we get ever closer to March 29, it becomes clearer that if we crashed out of the EU without a deal, announcements like today\u2019s would become widespread and would be devastating for British manufacturing.\u201d Unions are urging the government to provide more assistance for the car industry. Unite national officer Des Quinn says workers at JLR have endured \u201ca great deal of uncertainty over recent months,\u201d adding: \u201cWith record levels of new investment and models set to come on stream in its UK factories we look for Jaguar Land Rover to continue to be a global success and the jewel in Britain\u2019s manufacturing crown. \u201cBritain\u2019s car workers have been caught in the crosshairs of the Government\u2019s botched handling of Brexit, mounting economic uncertainty and ministers\u2019 demonisation of diesel, which along with the threat of a no-deal Brexit, is damaging consumer confidence. JLR\u2019s sweeping job cuts follow a double-whammy of problems, with Brexit uncertainty adding an extra garnish. The carmaker has been badly hit by the diesel crisis, which began in 2015 when German manufacturer Volkswagen was caught cheating on its emissions tests. That scandal has dented demand for diesel (UK sales fell 30% last year. That\u2019s a huge blow to JLR, as 90% of its vehicles ran on the fuel. Critics say it was relatively slow to embrace electric cars - a move that is now looking critical, with some cities considering banning diesel, and even petrol, cars in the years ahead. JLR is also vulnerable to the slowdown in China. Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has hurt the Chinese economy - yesterday we learned that car sales in China fell in 2018, for the first time in at least two decades. Economists fear a \u2018hard landing\u2019 in China that could crush consumer demand, and send ripples through the global economy. Plus there\u2019s uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. UK car sales also fell last year, for the second year running. Today\u2019s disappointing Christmas trading figures from John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer have highlighted that shoppers are being cautious. Plus the car industry is very dependant on \u2018just-in-time\u2019 supply chains, which would be hurt by trade friction at the UK border. Here\u2019s the details of JLR\u2019s new investment in electric car technology, announced alongside its job cuts plan. Later this year, next-generation Electric Drive Units (EDU) will be produced at the company\u2019s Engine Manufacturing Centre in Wolverhampton. These EDUs will be powered by batteries assembled at a new Jaguar Land Rover Battery Assembly Centre located at Hams Hall, North Warwickshire, reinforcing the company\u2019s commitment to the West Midlands and the UK. \u201cThe Battery Assembly Centre will be one of the largest of its kind in the UK, using new production techniques and technologies to manufacture battery packs for future Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles. JLK is planning to begin a voluntary redundancy programme in the UK, to remove layers of management. It says: \u201cThis strategic review will create a leaner, more resilient organisation with a flatter management structure.\u201d CEO Ralf Speth has also promised that JLR will deliver \u201ca future range of British-built electric vehicles\u201d. Many of JLR\u2019s UK job cuts will affect management roles, including at its sites in Coventry and Gaydon, Warwickshire. BREAKING: Jaguar Land Rover have confirmed that they, like Ford, are cutting jobs...and the axe will fall heavily on the UK. JLR plans to cut around 4,500 roles around the globe, as part of a major cost-cutting programme designed to save \u00a32.5bn. JLR says it is responding to \u201cmultiple\u201d geopolitical and regulatory disruptions (eg China\u2019s slowing economy), and to the technology changes facing the sector (such as the move to electric and self-driving cars). Chief executive Ralf Speth says: \u201cWe are taking decisive action to help deliver long-term growth in the face of multiple geopolitical and regulatory disruptions as well as technology challenges facing the automotive industry.\u201d JLR, which employs about 40,000 people in Britain, has also announced a new battery assembly centre at Hams Hall near Birmingham, and will begin producing electric drive units at its Wolverhampton engine plant. The looming job cuts at Jaguar Land Rover have been raised over at parliament. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman has told reporters that JLR sees the UK as \u201chome\u201d, and is committed to the country, saying: \u201cJLR have been very clear that they regard the UK as home and are investing in the future to develop the next generation of vehicles. We will continue to work closely with the company to support their long-term plans. That doesn\u2019t rule out some layoffs, though.... Ford has also warned that the European market is tough - persistently so - meaning sweeping changes are needed. The FT\u2019s Peter Campbell has the details: Ford is holding a conference call with journalists now. On it, European chief Steven Armstrong has warned that further job cuts might be needed if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. Economist Andrew Sentance says the job cuts at Ford and JLR are part of a broader trend towards automation: In other blow to Europe\u2019s auto sector, Jaguar Land Rover is set to announce heavy job losses too. A source familiar with the plans has told us the redundancies were likely to affect \u201cwhite-collar\u201d workers the most, with the majority of UK job reductions achieved via voluntary redundancies. Here are more details of Ford\u2019s cost-cutting plans -- including likely job losses in the UK: Production at the Ford Aquitaine Industries plant in Bordeaux, France, which manufactures small automatic transmissions, will end in August 2019. Formal discussions have begun between Ford and its Works Council to end production of the C-MAX and Grand C-MAX at the Saarlouis Body and Assembly Plant in Germany as the compact MPV segment shrinks in Europe. Ford is undertaking a strategic review of Ford Sollers, its joint venture in Russia. Several significant restructuring options for Ford Sollers are being considered by Ford and its partner, Sollers PJSC. A decision is expected in the second quarter. Ford plans to consolidate its UK headquarters and Ford Credit Europe\u2019s headquarters at the Ford Dunton Technical Center in South East Essex to improve business fitness and create a customer-centric technical hub. The action is subject to union consultation and local approvals. It\u2019s official.... There\u2019s a serious danger that Ford could close some of its European car factories. Steven Armstrong, Ford\u2019s head of Europe, has told Bloomberg: \u201cWe are looking to make a step-change in the performance of the business. \u201cThere\u2019ll be significant impact across the region. We will be looking at all options.\u201d Breaking news: carmaker Ford is slashing thousands of jobs across Europe. The carmaker has just announced the job cuts, as part of a new strategic plan that will see it quit unprofitable markets and ditch loss-making vehicle lines. Steven Armstrong, Group Vice President,Europe, Middle East and Africa, says. \u201cWe are taking decisive action to transform the Ford business in Europe,\u201d Under the plan, Ford plans to combine the headquarters of Ford U.K. and Ford Credit to a site in Dunton, Essex. It is also intending to exit the multivan segment, stop manufacturing automatic transmissions in Bordeaux in August, and review its operations in Russia. Ford expects to lose \u201cthousands of staff\u201d under the plan, and will aim for voluntary redundancies where possible. It currently employing some 54,000 workers across Europe, mainly in Germany, the U.K. and Spain. There are some encouraging signs in John Lewis\u2019s statement, despite the damage to profits this year. Its department stores (John Lewis &amp; Partners) grew like-for-like sales by 1% over the Christmas period, with fashion sales up 6.8%, beauty products up 11.2%, and own-brand womenswear up 14.7%. However, the \u201cintensively competitive pricing environment\u201d meant profit margins were squeezed. John Lewis\u2019s \u2018never knowingly undersold\u2019 pledge means it has to match rivals\u2019 price cuts.... The group also hopes to grow Waitrose &amp; Partners\u2019 profits for the full year, after its vegetarian food ranges and domestic wine proved popular with shoppers. Here\u2019s some Waitrose highlights from the festive period: Increased own brand and exclusive festive products, launching over 500 new and improved Waitrose &amp; Partners lines. These included the new Honeycomb Bubble Dessert. A total of 25 new vegan and vegetarian products, such as Jackfruit Tacos were launched in the lead up to Christmas - helping drive a 94.3% increase in sales of vegetarian meals. English and Welsh wine continued its strong performance with sales growth of 21.4%. Free From products and dairy alternatives saw a rapid rise in sales - up 12.2% and 40.9% respective The statement is online here. Debenhams has insisted it will deliver profits in line with expectations, despite a worse than expected fall in sales over Christmas (see 8am). How? By delivering \u00a330m more in cost savings. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The struggling department store said it now expected to make total annual savings of \u00a380m with new measures including a hiring freeze at head office and the earlier than expected closure of its Lodge Farm distribution centre in Northamptonshire. Sales at established UK stores dived 6.2% in the 18 weeks to 5 January when overseas sales fell by 3.5% but online sales rose by 4.6%. The group fall of 5.7% was much worse than the 2% to 3% expected by analysts. Debenhams said it had begun \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with lenders about refinancing but had put on hold attempts to sell assets including its Danish Magasin du Nord chain as it did not think the \u201cvalue of the assets were being recognised.\u201d It said it was in talks with all stakeholders, including major shareholder Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct about its future but would not confirm if it was discussing taking up Ashley\u2019s offer of a loan. Debenhams said it had spoken to landlords about plans to close up to 50 stores and did not rule out the possibility of instigating a company voluntary arrangement which would allow it to agree a mass closure of stores under an insolvency procedure. More early reaction to this morning\u2019s blizzard of retail news: Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, says John Lewis\u2019s results are disappointing. \u201cDespite modest growth in like-for-like sales - 1.4% - the retailer has said that it is expecting to report a fall in profits \u2013 clear evidence that depressed footfall and falling consumer confidence has led to some cut-throat discounting and promotional activity. \u201cAt a time when many other retailers have been forced to downgrade their full-year profits, John Lewis had seemed immune to the problems facing the High Street. If monthly trading performances resume the erratic pattern seen during the last few months of 2018, things could change rapidly, and staff bonuses could be hit. Here\u2019s our full story on John Lewis: Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s shares have fallen by over 1% in early trading, after it reported that food, clothing and homeware sales fell in the last quarter. Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics, says M&amp;S has done worse than expected, as it struggles to cope with the seismic changes in the retail sector. It\u2019s increasingly evident that Christmas is becoming an online event and these figures reaffirm the polarisation of shopping habits with online propping up the poor performance of their store sales. This accelerating trend has benefitted the retailers that have the scale, capacity and seamless online operations to cope with the peak in demand over Christmas and M&amp;S is struggling to keep up. \u201cPut simply, the retailer is burdened with too many stores, unsuitable space and the spiralling operating costs associated with this outdated business model. As a higher proportion of sales move online, the cost of fulfilling these orders are rising too. Set against the backdrop of fragile consumer confidence, it\u2019s a difficult place to be. Tesco shares are leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 1.9% at 216p. Analysts are cheering its financial results (which includes a 2.2% jump in Tesco\u2019s UK sales over Christmas.). Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says Tesco\u2019s recent acquisition of wholesale group Booker is paying off. \u201cTesco has defied the retail gloom and delivered a pick of the bunch performance. The supermarket behemoth has staged a strong recovery over several years, having previously admitted that it had taken its eye off the ball in its core UK market. There is a fair amount of light between then and now, with like-for-like sales both in terms of the third quarter but also the Christmas period showing continuing growth. The Booker acquisition is fast becoming a strategic triumph, with quarterly like-for-like sales having grown 11% and almost 7% in the festive run-up. Tesco are standing out as the only retail winner this morning, while M&amp;S, John Lewis, Debenhams and Halfords have all struggled. OOF! Shares in Halfords have plunged by a quarter at the start of trading, to their lowest level in over six years. Halfords shares shed 78p to 216p, the lowest since August 2012, following its grim profits warning. Card Factory is also suffering, with shares down 10% in early trading. Even Christmas card sellers found last month tough. The Card Factory has reported that like-for-like sales are down 0.1% this year. Karen Hubbard, Card Factory\u2019s chief executive officer, blamed the move towards online shopping and away from the high street. \u201cThe Christmas trading period was challenging due to lower high street footfall. However, Card Factory performed robustly in this competitive trading period. On Debenhams\u2019 weak trading, Michael Mulligan, partner and insolvency specialist at law firm, Shakespeare Martineau, says: \u201cDebenhams\u2019 trading figures further confirm the desperate state of the UK\u2019s retail sector, which has suffered its worst Christmas for a decade. Whilst it\u2019s a positive that the retailer had a stronger Christmas period, one good month unfortunately doesn\u2019t make up for sub-par financial performance in the other eleven. Debenhams suffered the biggest losses in its trading history last year and doing a little better over Christmas will not allay stakeholders\u2019 concerns. The festive sales are too little too late. \u201cThe business has fallen foul of its decidedly mid-market position, unable to compete with the successful online retailers, high-end luxury stores or with the discounter end of the market, many of which are managing to keep their heads above water. Failing to report any financials since last autumn won\u2019t have done the business any favours and is only likely to have fuelled speculation that this bad news was on the way. Debenhams has also suffered a turbulent Christmas. UK sales have tumbled by 6.2% over the last 18 weeks, and by 3.6% over the crucial festive period. Debenhams blames thrifty shoppers, saying: The UK trading environment has continued to be volatile, as expected, with clear evidence that our customers have been seeking out promotions. Debenhams, which is deep in debt, adds that it has held \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with its lenders. More gloom! Halfords has hit the City with a stonking profits warning. Halfords, which sells car parts and bicycles, has reported that like-for-like sales fell by 1.7% in the last 14 weeks. CEO Graham Stapleton says trading was tough. \u201cThis has been a challenging third quarter for the business, driven by exceptionally mild weather and ongoing weak consumer confidence. Together, these factors have led us to reduce our profit expectations. Halfords has slashed its profit forecasts this year to \u00a358-\u00a362m -- City experts were expecting around \u00a370m, I believe. Halfords also warned that it doesn\u2019t expect to do any better in 2019-20, due to weak consumer confidence. Tesco is bucking the gloom. It says it enjoyed a strong Christmas, with UK sales up 2.6% over the Christmas period. CEO Dave Lewis says Tesco is \u2018bang on track\u2019 with its plans this year. The last time John Lewis suspended its staff bonus was in 1953! They also suspended it during the second world war and in the 1920s, so it would be very significant if they ditch it this year. Crumbs! John Lewis is considering axing its staff bonus this year, after seeing its profits slide. The John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, has just warned that full year total Partnership profits will be \u201csubstantially lower this year\u201d. It blames slower sales growth, and tumbling profit margins as it cut prices. Gross sales at the John Lewis Partnership did rise in the last seven weeks, by 1.4% year-on-year, including a 0.3% rise at Waitrose. But that wasn\u2019t enough to boost profits, given the \u201crelatively weak consumer demand.\u201d In a serious blow to its workforce of partners, chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield has warned they may not get a bonus this year - for the first time in many decades. Mayfield says: The actions taken in recent years to prepare for the current pressures in retail mean that the Partnership has the financial strength and flexibility to pay a modest bonus this year, without impacting our ambitious investment programme. However, the Board will need to consider carefully in March, following the usual process, whether payment of a bonus is prudent in the light of business and economic prospects at that time.\u2019 Last year every John Lewis partner got a bonus worth 5% of their pay; a decade ago it was worth an extra 20%! Ouch! Marks &amp; Spencer has reported another quarter of falling food and clothing sales. Total like-for-like sales at M&amp;S shrank by 2.2% in the last 13 weeks of 2018. That\u2019s worse than the 1.6% expected by City economists. Food sales - so often a success for M&amp;S - shrank by 2.1% while clothing and homeware was down by 2.4%. Steve Rowe, chief executive, is blaming \u201cwell-publicised difficult market conditions\u201d, but insists that M&amp;S\u2019s transformation programme remains on track. Rowe added: The combination of reducing consumer confidence, mild weather, Black Friday, and widespread discounting by our competitors made November a very challenging trading period. However, overall our 13-week performance was steady with some early encouraging signs. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a massive day for retail news, as Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis, Tesco, Debenhams and Halfords all report how they fared over crucial Christmas trading period. And it will have been tough. Britain\u2019s retailers suffered their worst Christmas trading since the depths of the global financial crisis, as anxious customers held onto their money. The British Retail Consortium has reported that sales were flat in December, the worst performance in December since 2008. \u201cSqueezed consumers chose not to splash out this Christmas with retail sales growth stalling for the first time in 28 months,\u201d said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive. This forced retailers to slash prices in an attempt to lure customers over the threshold, taking a big chunk out of profits. But even that wasn\u2019t enough to get people splashing out....",

      "body": "<p>Eva Huffaker hoped for an apology. What she got was another Sieg Heil.</p> <p>When the 15-year-old Jewish student at Baraboo high school first saw the now notorious prom night photograph of her fellow students with their arms raised stiffly in a Nazi salute, she picked out the faces she recognised.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really believe it when I first saw it. It took a while to sink in that I knew some of the people in the photo and what they were doing and how offensive and hateful that gesture is. It was very shocking and terrifying,\u201d said Huffaker.</p> <p>The picture\u2019s sweep of social media drew a torrent of denunciations and abuse from around the country against the young men, their teachers and Baraboo officials, including death threats. But the rural Wisconsin city is grappling with a more complex response that has opened a divide over how to see the actions of the teenagers in the photo \u2013 a question framed by some as being with or against the students.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d418d5dae769da50b0412dc69ec92829b497a09c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d418d5dae769da50b0412dc69ec92829b497a09c/0_0_1024_663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A school district in Wisconsin said the First Amendment prevented it from punishing students in this picture, in which many are making what appears to be a Nazi salute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A school district in Wisconsin said the first amendment prevented it from punishing students in this picture, in which many are making what appears to be a Nazi salute.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Gust</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amid a series of community meetings, some in Baraboo are pressing for a collective apology from the boys even if it is accompanied by an acceptance that their salutes were more a prank than an endorsement of fascism. Others regard them as victims subject to a form of lynching with their futures tarnished by accusations of sympathy for white supremacy.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine being a 17-year-old and having the world looking upon you as the personification of evil,\u201d said Keri Olson, one of the organisers of a series of meetings in Baraboo to consider what to make of the photographs and how to react. \u201cThis is a community of 12,000 that all of a sudden has been cast in this light around the world. How do you prepare for that? How do you respond to that? It\u2019s been a state of crisis here.\u201d</p> <p>The divide is reflected at the high school itself. Some of the 60 students in the picture have apologised directly to Huffaker. A couple came to her house to say sorry to her family too. But Huffaker said they are the minority and that within the school, the teenagers in the photo are more often seen as the victims of the backlash.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of students have been saying, \u2018It\u2019s just a joke, they didn\u2019t mean it. This is being taken out of proportion and everyone just needs to calm down and just let it go.\u2019 Which is really upsetting to me because people think that it\u2019s OK just because they didn\u2019t mean it. There are students who realise that it wasn\u2019t OK but on the whole a lot of people are just trying to dismiss it,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d638b2bbfe860c87c433b082a40ac5078961feb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d638b2bbfe860c87c433b082a40ac5078961feb/0_0_2200_1468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eva Huffaker, 15, a student at Baraboo High School, has spoken out against an image that has received international attention of boys in her high school giving what appears to be a Nazi salute.

      "bodyText": "Eva Huffaker hoped for an apology. What she got was another Sieg Heil. When the 15-year-old Jewish student at Baraboo high school first saw the now notorious prom night photograph of her fellow students with their arms raised stiffly in a Nazi salute, she picked out the faces she recognised. \u201cI didn\u2019t really believe it when I first saw it. It took a while to sink in that I knew some of the people in the photo and what they were doing and how offensive and hateful that gesture is. It was very shocking and terrifying,\u201d said Huffaker. The picture\u2019s sweep of social media drew a torrent of denunciations and abuse from around the country against the young men, their teachers and Baraboo officials, including death threats. But the rural Wisconsin city is grappling with a more complex response that has opened a divide over how to see the actions of the teenagers in the photo \u2013 a question framed by some as being with or against the students. Amid a series of community meetings, some in Baraboo are pressing for a collective apology from the boys even if it is accompanied by an acceptance that their salutes were more a prank than an endorsement of fascism. Others regard them as victims subject to a form of lynching with their futures tarnished by accusations of sympathy for white supremacy. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine being a 17-year-old and having the world looking upon you as the personification of evil,\u201d said Keri Olson, one of the organisers of a series of meetings in Baraboo to consider what to make of the photographs and how to react. \u201cThis is a community of 12,000 that all of a sudden has been cast in this light around the world. How do you prepare for that? How do you respond to that? It\u2019s been a state of crisis here.\u201d The divide is reflected at the high school itself. Some of the 60 students in the picture have apologised directly to Huffaker. A couple came to her house to say sorry to her family too. But Huffaker said they are the minority and that within the school, the teenagers in the photo are more often seen as the victims of the backlash. \u201cA lot of students have been saying, \u2018It\u2019s just a joke, they didn\u2019t mean it. This is being taken out of proportion and everyone just needs to calm down and just let it go.\u2019 Which is really upsetting to me because people think that it\u2019s OK just because they didn\u2019t mean it. There are students who realise that it wasn\u2019t OK but on the whole a lot of people are just trying to dismiss it,\u201d she said. Huffaker said some students even appeared to endorse the photo after it was posted on social media with the hashtag #barabooproud. \u201cThere were students who immediately after the picture came out went around saying \u2018We\u2019re Baraboo proud\u2019, kind of implying that they\u2019re not against this. And there have been antisemitic comments,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was an incident where a kid looked at me and he did the white supremacy symbol and then he stood up and did the Sieg Heil.\u201d The origins of the photograph remain debated and disputed even by those who were there. The photographer was a parent, Pete Gust, whose son is in the picture. Gust said he asked the students to wave and that he was surprised when they raised their arms in a fascist salute. Some parents were upset. One woman shouted to her son to put his arm down. The photo was taken in May but only became public when Gust put it on his website in November for reasons he has so far declined to explain despite demands from furious parents to know why he thought that was a good idea. Local officials were swift to condemn the picture. The district schools administrator, Lori Mueller, criticised the students for \u201cmaking extremely inappropriate gestures\u201d, said the photo \u201cis not reflective of the educational values and beliefs\u201d of Baraboo schools, and promised to \u201cpursue any and all appropriate actions, including legal\u201d. The police chief announced an investigation. That prompted Pastor Dan Gunderson of Walnut Hill Bible church, who knows some of the students and their parents from services and coaching a wrestling team, to come to the boys\u2019 defence. \u201cIt felt like our community, in order to prove that\u2019s not our community, felt it necessary to say those voices don\u2019t represent us. In that moment it felt like they were turning on the boys,\u201d he said. The pastor challenged Mueller, telling her she was well-intentioned but mistaken and had \u201cthrown the boys under the bus\u201d by playing into the hands of people he accused of pursuing a wider political agenda by piling responsibility for rising extremism in the US on to a group of teenagers. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire to have a narrative of small-town America being impacted by the presidency of Donald Trump and neo-Nazism and antisemitism and white supremacy,\u201d he said. Gunderson wrote a Facebook posting under the heading \u201cI Stand with Our Baraboo Boys\u201d which was quickly read across the city and came to mark out the divisions. The pastor thinks it is the boys who are owed an apology. He said that from conversations with those involved he believes the students were weary of the photo shoot and restless at being told by Gust to make different poses. \u201cOne boy said very specifically, \u2018I was making fun of the photographer. I was kind of mocking his request for us to do this\u2019,\u201d he said. But not all. A couple of students raised a fist, resistance-style. Several others kept their arms down including one who looks aghast. Some are clearly waving. One of the students, Jordan Blue, stands slightly apart on the far side of the back row. He said that some of the students deliberately raised their arms in a Nazi salute but did it as a joke. He also said that is not a justification. Gunderson said the students are being accused of an intent they did not have. \u201cThese boys are branded racists when they\u2019re not. This branding isn\u2019t just for now. In just a snapshot they are completely redefined and their futures are in jeopardy. Some of these boys come from extremely liberal homes. Parents \u2013 tough, tough guys \u2013 are coming to me with tears saying, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen to my son coming out of this?\u2019\u201d said Gunderson. \u201cNobody cares to hear it but I think these boys feel like they survived something. They\u2019re traumatised. They\u2019re scared.\u201d The social media clamour called for the young men to be suspended or expelled from school.

I don\u2019t want them to be punished for the rest of their lives for being stupid. But there\u2019s a lot of people who think this isn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d she said. Marcy Huffaker sees Gunderson\u2019s framing of the issue as support or otherwise for the young men in the photograph as avoiding the consequences of their actions. \u201cIt felt to us like you\u2019re either with the boys, and you want to protect the boys, or you\u2019re against the boys,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure it really matters what their intentions were at this point because it\u2019s a fact of that photo that has done such hurt.\u201d As Baraboo struggles to find a response, it has also got a closer look at itself.

This is a strange situation. The two leaders are potential allies who refuse to cooperate. Like Mrs May, but unlike most of his party, Mr Corbyn does not want a second referendum. He says he wants to reach out to her on issues including workers\u2019 rights. Mrs May, very belatedly, is trying to reach out, too. But unless there is more going on than is acknowledged, the two are talking at, not with, each other. Brexit is not just a potential disaster. It is a potential disaster that is being pursued with unwitting ineptitude.</p>",

Mrs May phoned some union leaders on Thursday. But she could have been doing that for two years and more. All this gave Mr Corbyn cover to dismiss the workers\u2019 rights amendment on Thursday at the end of a generally unrevealing speech in which he reiterated that Labour will vote against the government next week. This is a strange situation. The two leaders are potential allies who refuse to cooperate. Like Mrs May, but unlike most of his party, Mr Corbyn does not want a second referendum. He says he wants to reach out to her on issues including workers\u2019 rights. Mrs May, very belatedly, is trying to reach out, too. But unless there is more going on than is acknowledged, the two are talking at, not with, each other. Brexit is not just a potential disaster. It is a potential disaster that is being pursued with unwitting ineptitude.",

They waited two years for this election, and they waited days for its result. Early on Thursday, the country\u2019s electoral commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/10/congo-election-felix-tshisekedi-declared-winner-in-contentious-result\" title=\"\">announced</a> that an opposition candidate had won.

Critically, the country\u2019s respected Catholic church has said that the official results do not tally with data gathered by its 40,000 observers. The key to this bizarre development is not Mr Tshisekedi but Mr Kabila. His government has left half of DRC\u2019s 80 million people living on less than a dollar a day, despite its immense mineral resources, while he and those around him have amassed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/20/drc-vast-business-network-of-president-who-wont-step-down-revealed\" title=\"\">huge wealth</a>. Human rights groups say thousands of civilians have been killed by security forces and armed groups in the last two years. A devastating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/19/this-is-hell-devastated-congolese-village-embodies-drc-crisis\" title=\"\">humanitarian crisis</a> continues.</p> <p>But Mr Kabila has proved expert at hanging on to power since succeeding his assassinated father in 2001. Elections were delayed repeatedly as he sought to carry on after reaching the two-term limit on the presidency in 2016. Protests were lethally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/23/congo-steps-up-deadly-crackdown-after-more-protests-against-kabila\" title=\"\">suppressed</a>. When he eventually called elections, he barred western observers. A mysterious fire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/13/fire-destroys-new-voting-machines-ahead-of-drc-election-kabila\" title=\"\">destroyed voting machines</a>, polls were delayed, and officials said violence and an Ebola outbreak precluded voting in places. Widespread irregularities were followed by the lengthy wait for results, with suspicions growing as the government shut off the internet.</p> <p>Yet Mr Shadary performed so abysmally that the government apparently realised that naming him victor would not fly. It has been forced to acknowledge its rejection by three-quarters of voters. The widespread belief is that Mr Kabila has agreed a deal with Mr Tshisekedi. Mr Fayulu, a former businessman, is a relative political outsider, though he enjoys the backing of two heavyweights: the tycoon Mo\u00efse Katumbi and the former warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba. Mr Tshisekedi\u2019s father was an opposition leader and is deeply rooted in DRC politics: Mr Kabila may feel he will find it easier to exert control through political structures. At a minimum, it is thought, the president wants the safeguarding of his family\u2019s reported fortune, as well as immunity from any potential prosecution; he should not be given it. At most he hopes to hang on to power if not office \u2013 and perhaps to reclaim the latter in future, \u00e0 la Putin. (He has said that he wants to remain \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6b21f32-fc57-11e8-ac00-57a2a826423e\" title=\"\">available</a>\u201d for his country.)</p> <p>Mr Fayulu is almost certain to appeal to the constitutional court, but few expect it to overturn the results. How far will his backers, the church, regional players and to a lesser extent the international community, press the issue? Despite the fury of his supporters, many will be relieved to see Mr Kabila\u2019s party go, and may be satisfied that the presidency will be taken by the man they probably expected to vote for prior to Mr Fayulu\u2019s rise and the opposition\u2019s split. Concern for stability is a priority, given the country\u2019s bloody history. This is not the democratic transition that so many hoped for. Unless pressure is exerted and sustained, it may not be much of a transition at all. </p>",

Human rights groups say thousands of civilians have been killed by security forces and armed groups in the last two years. A devastating humanitarian crisis continues. But Mr Kabila has proved expert at hanging on to power since succeeding his assassinated father in 2001. Elections were delayed repeatedly as he sought to carry on after reaching the two-term limit on the presidency in 2016. Protests were lethally suppressed. When he eventually called elections, he barred western observers. A mysterious fire destroyed voting machines, polls were delayed, and officials said violence and an Ebola outbreak precluded voting in places. Widespread irregularities were followed by the lengthy wait for results, with suspicions growing as the government shut off the internet. Yet Mr Shadary performed so abysmally that the government apparently realised that naming him victor would not fly. It has been forced to acknowledge its rejection by three-quarters of voters. The widespread belief is that Mr Kabila has agreed a deal with Mr Tshisekedi. Mr Fayulu, a former businessman, is a relative political outsider, though he enjoys the backing of two heavyweights: the tycoon Mo\u00efse Katumbi and the former warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba. Mr Tshisekedi\u2019s father was an opposition leader and is deeply rooted in DRC politics: Mr Kabila may feel he will find it easier to exert control through political structures. At a minimum, it is thought, the president wants the safeguarding of his family\u2019s reported fortune, as well as immunity from any potential prosecution; he should not be given it. At most he hopes to hang on to power if not office \u2013 and perhaps to reclaim the latter in future, \u00e0 la Putin. (He has said that he wants to remain \u201cavailable\u201d for his country.) Mr Fayulu is almost certain to appeal to the constitutional court, but few expect it to overturn the results. How far will his backers, the church, regional players and to a lesser extent the international community, press the issue? Despite the fury of his supporters, many will be relieved to see Mr Kabila\u2019s party go, and may be satisfied that the presidency will be taken by the man they probably expected to vote for prior to Mr Fayulu\u2019s rise and the opposition\u2019s split. Concern for stability is a priority, given the country\u2019s bloody history. This is not the democratic transition that so many hoped for. Unless pressure is exerted and sustained, it may not be much of a transition at all.",

      "body": "<p>The acting teacher and coach Jennie Buckman, who has died of cancer aged 69, spent 21 years at the London drama school Rada, where she became head of acting.</p> <p>It is hard these days to go to the theatre, or sit in the cinema or in front of a TV drama series and not find yourself watching one of her former students, among them Sophie Okonedo, Adrian Lester, Matthew Macfadyen, Andrea Riseborough, Tom Hiddleston and Ben Whishaw. \u201cShe\u2019s my girl\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s my boy,\u201d Jennie would declare with pride.</p> <p>Jennie was also a playwright and director and, in her last decade, through her company <a href=\"http://www.giantstheatre.com/\" title=\"\">Giants</a>, she devised innovative ways of working with people whose voices are rarely heard in theatre: from Iranian and Kurdish women to members of the Irish Traveller community, military veterans, prisoners and council workers.</p> <p>Born in London to a Jewish family originally from the East End, Jennie was the youngest of three children of Irene (nee Amiel), a lawyer, and Bernard Buckman, a businessman. She was brought up in an environment in which stage and writing were paramount. In 1963 her mother published Twenty Tales from Shakespeare, which encouraged Jennie on her path.</p> <p>At South Hampstead high school, theatre became Jennie\u2019s realm. After a weekend trip to Stratford upon Avon, where her passion for Shakespeare was deepened and her critical skills honed, she would enlighten us less knowledgable classmates with her shrewd observations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1614415a214b2d1840df97d27a31e18caa4f3d7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1614415a214b2d1840df97d27a31e18caa4f3d7f/0_158_4240_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pandora by Jennie Buckman at the Arcola theatre, Dalston, east London, in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pandora by Jennie Buckman at the Arcola theatre, Dalston, east London, in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Workman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Midweek she might be found with a five-shilling standing ticket watching a more contemporary play \u2013 A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, or Roots, perhaps \u2013 after which she would explain with absolute clarity what worked or could be improved.</p> <p>She developed her directing and coaching talent (as well as her prodigious sense of humour) at school, where she started a lunchtime drama club. She went to Kent University in 1968 to study English and American literature, returning to London in 1971 to train as a teacher. For eight years she taught English and drama in comprehensive schools, encouraging students to write and produce their own plays.</p> <p>In 1979 Jennie joined Common Stock, a community theatre company dedicated to collaborative practice and improvisation techniques, to set up their youth theatre. Together with Chattie Salaman and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/mar/27/frank-whitten-obituary\" title=\"\">Frank Whitten</a>, she evolved the working method she would take further at Giants. In 1982 she also directed Jemma Redgrave in a youth theatre production of The Caucasian Chalk Circle at the Lyric Hammersmith. In 1984 she became artistic director. </p> <p>Chattie introduced Jennie to her son Nick Blatchley, who became Jennie\u2019s partner. They had three children, Michael, Zoe, and Joshua; and Jennie became stepmother to Joseph, Nick\u2019s son by a previous marriage.

      "bodyText": "The acting teacher and coach Jennie Buckman, who has died of cancer aged 69, spent 21 years at the London drama school Rada, where she became head of acting. It is hard these days to go to the theatre, or sit in the cinema or in front of a TV drama series and not find yourself watching one of her former students, among them Sophie Okonedo, Adrian Lester, Matthew Macfadyen, Andrea Riseborough, Tom Hiddleston and Ben Whishaw. \u201cShe\u2019s my girl\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s my boy,\u201d Jennie would declare with pride. Jennie was also a playwright and director and, in her last decade, through her company Giants, she devised innovative ways of working with people whose voices are rarely heard in theatre: from Iranian and Kurdish women to members of the Irish Traveller community, military veterans, prisoners and council workers. Born in London to a Jewish family originally from the East End, Jennie was the youngest of three children of Irene (nee Amiel), a lawyer, and Bernard Buckman, a businessman. She was brought up in an environment in which stage and writing were paramount. In 1963 her mother published Twenty Tales from Shakespeare, which encouraged Jennie on her path. At South Hampstead high school, theatre became Jennie\u2019s realm. After a weekend trip to Stratford upon Avon, where her passion for Shakespeare was deepened and her critical skills honed, she would enlighten us less knowledgable classmates with her shrewd observations. Midweek she might be found with a five-shilling standing ticket watching a more contemporary play \u2013 A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, or Roots, perhaps \u2013 after which she would explain with absolute clarity what worked or could be improved. She developed her directing and coaching talent (as well as her prodigious sense of humour) at school, where she started a lunchtime drama club. She went to Kent University in 1968 to study English and American literature, returning to London in 1971 to train as a teacher. For eight years she taught English and drama in comprehensive schools, encouraging students to write and produce their own plays. In 1979 Jennie joined Common Stock, a community theatre company dedicated to collaborative practice and improvisation techniques, to set up their youth theatre. Together with Chattie Salaman and Frank Whitten, she evolved the working method she would take further at Giants. In 1982 she also directed Jemma Redgrave in a youth theatre production of The Caucasian Chalk Circle at the Lyric Hammersmith. In 1984 she became artistic director. Chattie introduced Jennie to her son Nick Blatchley, who became Jennie\u2019s partner. They had three children, Michael, Zoe, and Joshua; and Jennie became stepmother to Joseph, Nick\u2019s son by a previous marriage. They married in 1991. Jennie had moved back into teaching and coaching in 1985 and over the next few years worked with the National Theatre, Guildhall School of Speech and Drama and Rose Bruford College, among others. She was renowned for her nonconformist and inclusive approach which, with her wicked sense of fun, created a refreshingly open and liberating environment for her students. Keen to keep improving her own skills, she took acting classes with Doreen Cannon, adapting Cannon\u2019s insights on Stanislavski\u2019s techniques to her own teaching methods. When Cannon moved to Rada as head of acting in 1986, she invited Jennie to join her. Jennie was to work at Rada as acting teacher, stage director and, from 2003, as head of acting. While at Rada, Jennie began writing her own plays, starting in 1999 for BBC Radio, for whom she wrote more than 60 episodes of the World Service drama Westway, as well as numerous plays for Radio 4, including Goodbye Moses (1999), about a restless West Indian spirit; The Slap (2000), an autobiographical coming-of-age story about matriarchy, Jewish culture and feminism; and Deptford Wives (2002), based on an 18th-century autobiography by a female shipwright and starring her sister-in-law Geraldine James. In 2002 she also wrote a series for Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour, Ten Days That Shook My World, based on time previously spent in Cuba, which she revisited in 2007 to work with Ulises Rodr\u00edguez Febles on Cuba Mi Amor, which was nominated for best radio play that year. In 2007 Jennie left Rada and in the following year founded Giants theatre company, becoming its artistic director. Giants represented the fruition of 40 years\u2019 work.

In 2016 the award-winning Piece of Silk, staged at the Hope theatre in Islington, evolved out of discussions with female survivors of domestic violence and forced marriage. Never Going to Beat You, developed with women from the organisation The Traveller Movement, also explored domestic abuse and has been adapted for film.

Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, accused her of breaching the ministerial code after Sturgeon admitted she had taken more than two months to tell civil servants she was being lobbied by Salmond over the inquiry, and discussed the case five times with him. Leonard told her: \u201cFirst minister, that was a grave error of judgment but it was also a clear potential breach of the ministerial code of conduct. \u201cAfter the events of this week, people need to have trust and confidence in the system and that\u2019s why the first minister herself should back a full parliamentary inquiry.\u201d After raising the issue at first minister\u2019s questions on Thursday, Leonard wrote to Sturgeon urging her to voluntarily refer herself to an independent commission charged with policing the Scottish ministerial code. Sturgeon said she would consider his request, and later on Thursday the Scottish government confirmed the first minister \u201cwould consider any request made to make a referral to the panel of advisers on the ministerial code and the government would, as always, co-operate with any parliamentary inquiry\u201d. Labour and the Tories argue that the first minister\u2019s five conversations with Salmond about the inquiry raise substantial concerns about the independence and integrity of the civil service investigation. With fresh questions emerging about the role of her close advisers and her husband, Peter Murrell, the Scottish National party\u2019s chief executive, they are now pressing for Holyrood to launch its own investigation into the affair. The Scottish government ministerial code states that any meetings on official government business have to be set up through the government office and that detailed records need to be made of those contacts. It adds: \u201cIf ministers meet external organisations or individuals and find themselves discussing official business without an official present \u2013 for example at a party conference, social occasion or on holiday \u2013 any significant content (such as substantive issues relating to government decisions or contracts) should be passed back to their private offices as soon as possible after the event.\u201d Sturgeon admitted at first minister\u2019s questions and then later to reporters that she had failed to tell Scottish civil servants that Salmond had met her at her home on 2 April to tell her about the government investigation into two cases of alleged sexual harassment, until two months after the meeting.

After refusing to discuss her contacts with Salmond until the government case collapsed this week, Sturgeon now says she only contacted Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary, in early June because Salmond had told her he was on the brink of launching legal action against the Scottish government. Sturgeon insisted at first minister\u2019s questions that this did not amount to interference but said she and the government would answer any questions and release any documents sought by a Holyrood inquiry. \u201cI am satisfied that I conducted myself appropriately in line with all the rules and parliament of course will perform its scrutiny role in the best way it considers necessary,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Over the past week, Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency if he does not get funding for his US-Mexico border wall. As the president set off for Texas on a visit to the border, he made a series of typically garbled statements on border security, but the message was clear: if Democrats don\u2019t agree to give Trump $5bn for the wall as part of a deal to end the partial government shutdown, he could invoke emergency powers. So what is a national emergency? It is typically described as a crisis, such as a national security issue, which threatens the safety of the country. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 allows presidents to redirect government money without approval from Congress. The act also allows a president to circumnavigate some laws while the emergency is addressed. If Trump does declare a national emergency he would have to specify exactly which powers he intends to use, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. How would Trump use the national emergency powers? He has threatened to declare the national emergency to build a wall along a stretch of the US-Mexico border, and has provided no further detail. Currently the president and Democratic leaders are at a standoff over funding for the wall, which has shut down 25% of the government for 20 days. More than 800,000 federal workers have either gone without pay or been put on unpaid leave. Trump says he will not sign a congressional budget proposal to reopen the government unless it includes $5bn for the wall. In his first televised address to the nation from the Oval Office this week, Trump gave a speech full of false claims and misleading statistics to paint a portrait of a crisis at the US-Mexico border, even as the rate of illegal immigration has steadily fallen over the years and in 2018 reached its lowest point in more than a decade. The president says the wall is needed to prevent drug trafficking and undocumented immigration, but most drug trafficking and migration into the US occurs at legal points of entry \u2013 not across unwalled parts of the border. Democrats say the wall is a waste of money, and have accused Trump of using rhetoric \u201cfull of misinformation and even malice\u201d. Where would the money come from? Probably from funding set aside for military construction projects \u2013 such as building army barracks and other improvements to bases used by the armed forces. Bruce Ackerman, a Yale law professor, wrote in the New York Times that Trump would probably use money from the military budget for the wall, and use military personnel to build it. Would declaring a national emergency work? Possibly not. There is widespread doubt over whether the situation at the border can be classified as an emergency. That means any declaration could become mired in months-long court proceedings. Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed skepticism about whether it would work. The House armed services committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, Adam Smith, told ABC that the president \u201cwould be wide open to a court challenge saying, where\u2019s the emergency?\u2019\u201d The Republican senator John Thune echoed that on CNN. Congress would also be able to pass a resolution blocking the emergency declaration. Has a national emergency been declared before? Yes. There are actually 30 national emergencies currently in effect. But the national emergencies have not been used for what some would say is a politically motivated wall. George W Bush declared a national emergency after the 9/11 attacks, and Barack Obama did the same during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. The majority of the other emergencies suspend or withhold money from foreign nationals or countries.",

      "bodyText": "The recorded, wiretapped life of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n has dominated this week\u2019s evidence at his trial for allegedly running the world\u2019s biggest narco-traffic organisation. For all his four (perhaps five) wives, serial mistresses and up to 19 children, Guzm\u00e1n used his own cyber-security system to spy on ladies in his life \u2013 even as US authorities eavesdropped on him. In one call, the cartel boss was recorded for US authorities hoping to one day arm a six-month-old daughter with an AK-47 Kalashnikov. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s electronic life was revealed thanks to evidence from an undercover FBI agent, Charles Stephen Marston, and the man he recruited: the cartel\u2019s top IT fixer, Cristian Rodr\u00edguez. Marston had posed as a Russian mafioso to lure Rodr\u00edguez into disclosing codes for communications using Voice over Internet Protocol using servers in the Netherlands. Rodr\u00edguez had already featured in evidence, when he was described by Colombian narco Jorge Cifuentes as having been too \u201cirresponsible\u201d to set up a proper encryption shield at one of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lairs. What Cifuentes did not know was that Rodr\u00edguez was worse than that: he was \u201cproactively cooperating\u201d with the FBI. Testifying on Wednesday, Rodr\u00edguez explained how he was instructed by Guzm\u00e1n to install a \u201cspyware\u201d called FlexiSPY on 50 \u201cspecial phones\u201d as Guzm\u00e1n called them. The cartel chief became obsessed with the technology, and wanted Rodr\u00edguez to hook it up to allow him access to other people\u2019s computers too. On one occasion Rod\u00edguez did so in the presence of the surveyed woman, whom Guzm\u00e1n \u201cdistracted\u201d while he installed the bug. A series of messages were then entered into evidence, exposing Guzm\u00e1n at a level of intimacy to which no other mafia don has ever been subjected in open court: texts to Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s current wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, and a mistress, Agustina Cabanillas Acosta, whom Guzm\u00e1n calls \u201cFiera\u201d \u2013 wild beast. Guzm\u00e1n tells Emma about an escape round the back of a safe house; \u201cOh love, that\u2019s horrible\u201d, she responds. Ms Coronel sat in court listening to the evidence and reading the messages for a second time, including those suggesting that she acted as an intermediary in the business \u2013 Ms Coronel has denied all illegal activity and knowledge of her husband\u2019s. In one message, Guzm\u00e1n says of his daughter Maria Joaquina, then aged six months: \u201cOur Kiki is fearless. I\u2019m going to give her an AK-47, so she can hang with me.\u201d With Ms Acosta, Guzm\u00e1n talks more business than pleasure: \u201cHow are the sales going?\u201d he texts, in 2012. \u201cLike busy bees,\u201d she replies. \u201cNonstop, my love.\u201d She then complains Guzm\u00e1n is spying on her \u2013 which he is. As the messages were shown, Guzm\u00e1n stared hard, apparently into space, twitching. Some observers noted that the couple refrained from their usual mutual glance before a break. Other recordings were more business-like, such as a conversation in which Guzm\u00e1n seeks assurance from a man called \u201cGato\u201d \u2013 the cat \u2013 that a favoured federal police commander is \u201creceiving the monthly payment\u201d. A cocaine distributor in Ohio is told to expect a consignment of methamphetamine instead. There\u2019s a chat between a senior cartel manager and an operative called \u201cCholo Iv\u00e1n\u201d telling him to hold off killing people he had kidnapped and bound \u201cto make sure so we don\u2019t execute innocent people\u201d. Iv\u00e1n is then scolded for beating up police officers: \u201cDon\u2019t be chasing cops,\u201d says Guzm\u00e1n, \u201cthey\u2019re the ones who help \u2026 Take it easy with the police.\u201d But there\u2019s a second thought: \u201cYou already beat them up once,\u201d adds Guzm\u00e1n, \u201cThey should listen now\u201d. The early part of the week was, by contrast, given over to the street-level, brutish violent business of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa cartel, courtesy of the first prosecution witness to defect from its lowest ranks, Edgar Galv\u00e1n from El Paso, Texas. Galv\u00e1n made for a more interesting witness than his lowly status would suggest, because he represents so many of his kind, and offered insight into how the non-commissioned ranks of a narco-trafficking operation work, how its small cogs turn. Aged 26, he became \u201cparty friends\u201d with a sicario \u2013 or hitman \u2013 for Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa cartel called Antonio \u201cJaguar\u201d Marrufo, tasked with the \u201ccleansing\u201d of Cuidad Ju\u00e1rez, the Mexican border city, of street-level affiliates of the Ju\u00e1rez cartel, La L\u00ednea, The Line. The acquaintance led to Galv\u00e1n to smuggling guns from Texas to Ju\u00e1rez \u2013 which he called juguetitos, \u201clittle toys\u201d \u2013 and modest quantities of cocaine in the opposite direction. The southbound traffic is of especial significance in the light of previous evidence from Vicente Zambada Niebla, the cartel\u2019s logistics manager and son of its cofounder, that 99% of the guns he bought for his organisation came from the US, the so-called \u201cIron River\u201d of legally-purchased American weapons that fuels Mexico\u2019s war. Jaguar showed Galv\u00e1n a \u201cmurder house\u201d with sloping floors to wash blood, in which he killed operatives for La L\u00ednea. Galv\u00e1n was arrested in 2011, and is serving 24 years, which he stands to reduce by testifying.",

The Guardian first highlighted a possible problem with Ladbrokes\u2019 bet-handling procedures in early November, when it emerged that a number of punters had reported similar experiences when attempting to place bets which were referred to the bookies\u2019 trading department for approval. All the bets were assigned a unique \u201creceipt number\u201d, the balance of the punter\u2019s account was apparently debited by the correct amount and the bets were then listed as having been \u201ccancelled\u201d rather than refused or declined. Several weeks later, Ladbrokes admitted that a \u201ctechnical glitch\u201d could have led some of its punters \u201cto believe that bets had been accepted\u201d when in fact they had not been placed. The firm said that it had contacted all customers affected and made \u201cgoodwill\u201d settlements in full on all bets that would have been winners. Three cases under consideration by IBAS were among those settled, but a new claim has now been lodged with the dispute resolution service for a \u00a321,500 payout on a bet which a Ladbrokes customer tried to place in October 2017. Paul Fairhead, who runs an online service to assist punters with betting disputes, said on Thursday that he is aware of \u201cdozens\u201d of punters who believe they have been affected by the glitch but have yet to hear from Ladbrokes. \u201cI would say dozens of customers who had a bet cancelled in this manner have still not been paid or even contacted as claimed,\u201d Fairhead said. \u201cTens of thousands of pounds are still at stake.

It\u2019s a significant risk, especially if your health starts deteriorating. Many people retire early not because they want or can afford to, but because they have to.\u201d The FCA also highlighted the increasing number of mortgages taken out on high multiples of the borrower\u2019s income. It said that loan-to-income ratios (LTIs) continue to increase. \u201cOver 25% of mortgages now have an LTI of greater than four times income, with an increasing number of loans near the banks\u2019 4.5 times LTI flow limit.\u201d Mortgage broker Jonathan Harris, of Anderson Harris, said: \u201cThe rising age of first-time buyers means many people don\u2019t get on the housing ladder until their late 30s, so the chances of having paid back the mortgage by state retirement age are increasingly slim. \u201cRising house prices mean people are having to take on bigger mortgages but this is less of a concern if you are still earning, can ultimately sell up and downsize and still have a decent property to live in. First-time buyers rarely go for 25-year terms now but opt for longer ones, and can always overpay and try to clear the loan more quickly as they can afford to do so.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The runner-up in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s presidential election has rejected the result as an \u201celectoral coup\u201d and called on his followers to resist \u201ca grave attack on the country\u2019s dignity\u201d, as the Catholic church said official results did not reflect polling station data. Martin Fayulu was beaten to second place by another opposition candidate, Felix Tshisekedi, who was declared the surprise winner of the 30 December presidential election in the early hours of Thursday. The result theoretically means the first electoral transfer of power in 59 years of independence in the DRC, but was deeply controversial because Fayulu had held a healthy lead in pre-election polling. It has also surprised some observers who believed authorities would ensure victory for the government candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, who was handpicked by the outgoing president, Joseph Kabila, as his successor. Senior church leaders made clear that the announced results did not correspond with data collected by 40,000 observers the church deployed on polling day 12 days ago. The church has refused to say publicly who won according to its findings, but diplomats briefed on the church data say it indicated a clear victory for Fayulu, in line with pre-election polls that had put him at least 20 points ahead of Tshisekedi. Official figures published by the electoral commission gave Tshisekedi 38%, four points ahead of Fayulu, a respected former business executive. His camp suspects Tshisekedi, the leader of DRC\u2019s main opposition party, won by cutting a power-sharing deal with Kabila. Kabila had engineered an electoral coup to deny him the presidency, Fayulu said on Thursday morning. In a statement issued later in the day, he said \u201cunacceptable electoral fraud\u201d had taken place that could lead to chaos across the country. \u201cNo Congolese can accept such treachery, such sham \u2026 we cannot accept at the end of this long crusade that the will of our people is not respected \u2026 All together, let us say \u2018no\u2019 to manufacturing of results and \u2018no\u2019 to an electoral holdup \u2026 Hand in hand may we pursue this struggle until the end,\u201d Fayulu told his followers. The continuing tensions threaten to tip the vast central African country into a cycle of protest, violent repression and worsening insecurity \u2013 dashing hopes that the election would mark a turning point in the DRC\u2019s troubled history. There were reports of scattered protests in some cities, with at least two reported deaths. Fayulu\u2019s supporters had long feared Kabila would either rig the vote in favour of Shadary or do a power-sharing deal with Tshisekedi. Tshisekedi paid his respects to Kabila, whom he described as \u201can important partner \u2026 in democratic transition in our country\u201d. Speaking to thousands of cheering supporters in the capital, Kinshasa, Tshisekedi said he would be the president \u201cof all Congolese\u201d. Barnab\u00e9 Kikaya Bin Karubi, one of Kabila\u2019s top advisers, said he accepted the result. \u201cOf course we are not happy as our candidate [Shadary] lost, but the Congolese people have chosen and democracy has triumphed,\u201d Kikaya told Reuters. Following an election itself delayed by two years, the announcement of results was postponed by a week. Adeline Van Houtte, research analyst for west Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said the delay had raised suspicions that the government wanted time to negotiate a backroom deal with Tshisekedi. \u201cA Tshisekedi presidency would be the least bad alternative to a Shadary victory for the regime as it would put a veil of legitimacy on the electoral process and would be more manageable than a Fayulu presidency,\u201d Van Houtte said. Robert Besseling, executive director of the risk consultancy EXX Africa, said Kabila had decided not to risk announcing a Shadary victory. \u201cInstead, he chose to split the opposition by creating a power-sharing deal \u2026 Kabila will be able to influence Tshisekedi, who now owes his ascendancy to power to Kabila\u2019s control of the electoral commission,\u201d Besseling said. The last two elections, in 2006 and 2011, both of which were won by Kabila, were marred by bloodshed. If Tshisekedi\u2019s victory is confirmed in the next 10 days by the constitutional court, he would be the first leader to take power via the ballot box in the DRC since Patrice Lumumba, who became prime minister shortly after the DRC won its independence from Belgium in 1960. Lumumba was toppled in a coup and killed four months later. Kabila, 47, has ruled since the 2001 assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila, who overthrew the long-serving dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. The DRC suffers from widespread corruption, continuing conflict, endemic disease, and some of the world\u2019s highest levels of sexual violence and malnutrition. It is also rich in minerals, including those crucial to the world\u2019s smartphones and electric cars. Kabila\u2019s second electoral mandate expired in 2016 and he only reluctantly called new elections under pressure from regional powers. The constitution forbade him from standing again and critics claimed he hoped to rule through Shadary, who has no political base of his own. However, the opposition was weakened by internal arguments and the exclusion by the electoral commission of two political heavyweights: Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former warlord, and Mo\u00efse Katumbi, a popular tycoon. Tshisekedi\u2019s father, \u00c9tienne, was a famous opposition leader under Mobutu. He died in 2017 and his son has inherited his party. Critics say Tshisekedi, 55, is unproven, inexperienced and lacks the charisma of his father. \u201cHis father was a man of the country. The son is very limited,\u201d Valentin Mubake, former secretary-general of Tshisekedi\u2019s Union for Democracy and Social Progress told the Guardian last month.",

Recently there has been a lot of talk and discussion of the problems with the roll-out of UC. However, the basic problem is not about the way the roll-out has been mishandled but about the underlying values and the ethos shaping the design of UC.</p> <p>As Professor Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said in his <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23881&amp;LangID=E\" title=\"\">November report</a> on poverty in UK, \u201cIn the area of poverty-related policy, the evidence points to the conclusion that the driving force has not been economic but rather a commitment to achieving radical social re-engineering \u2026 to pursue a single-minded \u2026 focus on getting people into employment at all costs \u2026 and wanting to make clear that being on benefits should involve hardship\u201d.</p> <p>It is claimed that the great virtue of UC is that it simplifies the system. Even this is not true as it only deals with the six most easily understood benefits (in fact three, as the other three are really variations on jobseeker\u2019s allowance) and not with the multiplicity of other benefits which have grown up to fix one or other of the benefit problems. The combining into UC of these three benefits, all under the control of separate agencies, enables the jobcentre staff to remove jobseeker\u2019s support, housing benefit and child tax credit all at once so that families are destitute and liable to lose their homes. Pre-UC this could not happen as jobcentre staff only had control of jobseeker\u2019s allowance. Hence the rapporteur\u2019s reference to social re-engineering. The only solution to the problems of universal credit is to get rid of it.<br><strong>Michael McLoughlin</strong><br><em>Wallington, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 In rural areas of Scotland visits are made by Post Office and bank buses. Why can\u2019t the Department for Work and Pensions provide a similar system, since it was they who closed all the jobcentres. On the issue of bus services and fares, I am sure it would not cost too much to offer everyone a bus pass and improve services. There are many people who would never use a bus, but it could be a lifeline for so many people and communities. Hopefully Louise Tickle\u2019s article will help Ray Taylor to secure employment nearer to his home.<br><strong>Margaret Vandecasteele</strong><br><em>Wick, Caithness</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have just gone through the ordeal that the government say is an easy transition to the new universal credit. The past five weeks have been one of the most stressful periods of my life, just like every time the government decides it want to crucify the most vulnerable of the country.</p> <p>On Monday my universal credit was awarded, leaving me \u00a393.58 per four weeks worse off compared with the employment and support allowance and housing benefit that I had. This now means a choice of food, heat or transportation. If I have to sell my car this will leave me housebound. I already had to budget just \u00a320 per week for food (before the reduction in my benefits). As for heating, I could only afford to put the heating on when my flat is below 10C, and only raising it to 12C.</p> <p>I am disabled, with mechanical scoliosis from an accident, meaning I walk with crutches indoors and use a wheelchair all other times. I also have Raynaud\u2019s, which means my circulation is severely restricted to my extremities. I suffer from deep depression with high anxiety. I can now see why other people have been driven to suicide by the government taking more and more away from the most vulnerable of this country.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I wonder if Amber Rudd saw Les Mis\u00e9rables on BBC One on Sunday, where Fantine was forced to sell her hair, teeth and, inevitably, herself. The day before on BBC Two, the title character of I, Daniel Blake was dying in a DWP toilet after being forced to sell his belongings by the \u201cwelfare\u201d system. My January universal credit payment was \u00a3346 as I\u2019d earned \u00a3185 in November. My rent is \u00a3317. My (Labour) MP is silent.<br><strong>Paul Burnett</strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p> <p>\u2022 If any benefit system is to be fair, following the disaster of the universal credit illustrated by I, Daniel Blake, the following golden rule ought to apply: for the health and wellbeing of the lowest-income men, women and children to flourish, the minimum household income must be enough to buy a healthy diet, water, fuel, clothes, transport and other necessities after the rent, council and income taxes are paid.</p> <p>In other words, if the definition of truly affordable housing is that rents shall be one-third of gross income, then the other two-thirds must be enough to cover the minimum quantities of the rest. Less than that and the income needed for food, fuel and the rest is demanded by by the landlord for rent on pain of eviction and or by the local authorities for council tax on pain of imprisonment. The minimum income standards (MIS) research needed by government was commissioned from the Family Budget Unit by the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust and published in 1998. MIS are now available from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation through the Living Wage Foundation. Achieving the good health and wellbeing of every UK citizen in or out of work must become a national priority.<br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Taxpayers Against Poverty</em></p> <p>\u2022 Re your article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/04/benefit-cap-single-mothers-make-up-85percent-of-those-affected-data-shows\" title=\"\">Single mothers make up 85% of people with benefits capped</a>, 4 January), we know that children particularly are suffering as a result of this policy. An article on 17 December described teachers\u2019 warning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/17/many-pupils-in-england-hungry-and-badly-clothed-say-teachers\" title=\"\">many pupils in England were hungry and badly clothed</a>. I feel ashamed that this appalling situation exists in this country in the 21st-century and is getting worse.</p> <p>My father died in 1962. My brother was 14 and I was 10. My mother always had two or three part-time jobs \u2013 paid on an hourly basis, with no perks or benefits such as pension contributions. We lived in rented accommodation. Every time she earned more than \u00a315 a week, her widowed mother\u2019s child allowance was reduced. It was a poverty trap.</p> <p>Here we are more than 50 years later and people are still living in a poverty trap. Today, though, the wealth divide is wider than ever. The wealthy enjoy an elevated standard of living on the back of lower-paid people who underpin the infrastructure of society.</p> <p>Something is seriously wrong with the system if children are going to school hungry. No policy, whatever the justification, is acceptable if it causes so much suffering.<br><strong>Sarah Taylor</strong><br><em>Winchester</em></p> <p>\u2022<em> In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email </em><a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\" title=\"\"><em>jo@samaritans.org</em></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here to upload it</em></strong></a><strong><em> and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

There are many people who would never use a bus, but it could be a lifeline for so many people and communities. Hopefully Louise Tickle\u2019s article will help Ray Taylor to secure employment nearer to his home. Margaret Vandecasteele Wick, Caithness \u2022 I have just gone through the ordeal that the government say is an easy transition to the new universal credit. The past five weeks have been one of the most stressful periods of my life, just like every time the government decides it want to crucify the most vulnerable of the country. On Monday my universal credit was awarded, leaving me \u00a393.58 per four weeks worse off compared with the employment and support allowance and housing benefit that I had. This now means a choice of food, heat or transportation. If I have to sell my car this will leave me housebound. I already had to budget just \u00a320 per week for food (before the reduction in my benefits). As for heating, I could only afford to put the heating on when my flat is below 10C, and only raising it to 12C. I am disabled, with mechanical scoliosis from an accident, meaning I walk with crutches indoors and use a wheelchair all other times. I also have Raynaud\u2019s, which means my circulation is severely restricted to my extremities. I suffer from deep depression with high anxiety. I can now see why other people have been driven to suicide by the government taking more and more away from the most vulnerable of this country. Name and address supplied \u2022 I wonder if Amber Rudd saw Les Mis\u00e9rables on BBC One on Sunday, where Fantine was forced to sell her hair, teeth and, inevitably, herself. The day before on BBC Two, the title character of I, Daniel Blake was dying in a DWP toilet after being forced to sell his belongings by the \u201cwelfare\u201d system. My January universal credit payment was \u00a3346 as I\u2019d earned \u00a3185 in November. My rent is \u00a3317. My (Labour) MP is silent. Paul Burnett Leeds \u2022 If any benefit system is to be fair, following the disaster of the universal credit illustrated by I, Daniel Blake, the following golden rule ought to apply: for the health and wellbeing of the lowest-income men, women and children to flourish, the minimum household income must be enough to buy a healthy diet, water, fuel, clothes, transport and other necessities after the rent, council and income taxes are paid. In other words, if the definition of truly affordable housing is that rents shall be one-third of gross income, then the other two-thirds must be enough to cover the minimum quantities of the rest. Less than that and the income needed for food, fuel and the rest is demanded by by the landlord for rent on pain of eviction and or by the local authorities for council tax on pain of imprisonment. The minimum income standards (MIS) research needed by government was commissioned from the Family Budget Unit by the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust and published in 1998. MIS are now available from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation through the Living Wage Foundation. Achieving the good health and wellbeing of every UK citizen in or out of work must become a national priority. Rev Paul Nicolson Taxpayers Against Poverty \u2022 Re your article (Single mothers make up 85% of people with benefits capped, 4 January), we know that children particularly are suffering as a result of this policy. An article on 17 December described teachers\u2019 warning that many pupils in England were hungry and badly clothed. I feel ashamed that this appalling situation exists in this country in the 21st-century and is getting worse. My father died in 1962. My brother was 14 and I was 10. My mother always had two or three part-time jobs \u2013 paid on an hourly basis, with no perks or benefits such as pension contributions. We lived in rented accommodation. Every time she earned more than \u00a315 a week, her widowed mother\u2019s child allowance was reduced. It was a poverty trap. Here we are more than 50 years later and people are still living in a poverty trap. Today, though, the wealth divide is wider than ever. The wealthy enjoy an elevated standard of living on the back of lower-paid people who underpin the infrastructure of society. Something is seriously wrong with the system if children are going to school hungry. No policy, whatever the justification, is acceptable if it causes so much suffering.

Judge Dorothee Pr\u00fcfer noted the men\u2019s decision to remain silent through the trial but said they could change their minds at any point, and emphasised that their decision would not alter the outcome. Two members of the nine-strong legal team representing the men told the court they did not expect their clients to receive a fair trial, referring to the evidence against them as more circumstantial than fact based. \u201cDespite the huge effort in their investigations, including a special commission, 50 telephone surveillance operations and mobile phone site analysis, 30 house searches and the deployment of sniffer dogs, the evidence collected is scant\u201d and had produced \u201cnot a single piece of drastic proof\u201d for the complicity of any of the four in the crime, Toralf N\u00f6ding, representing Wayci Remmo, told the court.

Stefan Conen, representing Wissam Remmo, accused the media of condemning the men ahead of the trial by reporting on the family\u2019s link to organised crime. He said as a result of the association, the police investigation had also been \u201cone-sided\u201d, and based on anonymous tipoffs from possible family rivals. The trial, which is taking place in a youth chamber of Berlin\u2019s regional court due to the fact that the men were adolescents at the time of the crime, is expected to continue until the spring. The gold coin was marketed as the world\u2019s largest by the Canadian Royal Mint, which said it had a face value of C$1m and could be used as legal tender. Next up in the witness stand will be the head of security at the Bode Museum, part of Berlin\u2019s museum island, one of the city\u2019s biggest attractions and a Unesco world heritage site. The museum, which has one of the world\u2019s biggest coin collections with more than half a million objects, has come under huge pressure to explain how it was that its alarm system was not triggered on the night of the theft and why an on-duty security guard headed into the museum\u2019s cellar precisely at the time the crime was being carried out.",

      "body": "<p>Exciting developments in televised Mykonos, as the Lindsay Lohan universe formally expands into different properties. Time was that Lindsay featured in the news primarily as the person picking up DUI charges when Paris Hilton wasn\u2019t, but she swiftly grew too large for the mid-00s Los Angeles party scene. There were unpaid hotel bills. There were failures to show up on film sets. There was a stolen necklace, and community service at a morgue. There was BBC3\u2019s decision to get her to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2010/jan/12/lindsay-lohan-tweeting-child-trafficking-india\" title=\"\">front a documentary on human trafficking in India</a>.</p> <p>In overview, then, Lindsay\u2019s has always been a story in the picaresque style \u2013 perhaps this is inevitable, given her terrible parents pushed her on stage at 11, when she made her debut in Disney\u2019s remake of The Parent Trap.</p> <p>During the second decade of the millennium, however, the Mean Girls star has certainly added to the gaiety of various nations. She resided on our own shores during the EU referendum, and the night the results were dropping in saw Lindsay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/lindsay-lohan-urges-uk-to-remain-and-wonders-where-sunderland-is\" title=\"\">unleash a series of tweets</a> so ancien regime they could only have been the direct inspiration for Theresa May\u2019s subsequent \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d speech. \u201cSorry #Kettering,\u201d ran one of these, \u201cbut where are you?\u201d</p> <p>Local MP Philip Hollobone was so incensed that he used the occasion of a Commons question to the then leader of the house Chris Grayling to assert that \u201ceveryone knows where Kettering is\u201d. A Grayling reply was forthcoming. \u201cLindsay Lohan \u2013 as a star of child and teen movies, a very entertaining actress at the time \u2013 hasn\u2019t necessarily fulfilled her professional potential,\u201d judged Chris, who would certainly know about not achieving one\u2019s professional potential. \u201cPerhaps now we know the reason why,\u201d he went on. \u201cShe should visit the fine town of Kettering and find herself returned to stardom.\u201d</p> <p>Well, there\u2019s careers advice gold right there. That said, this exchange did appear to elicit an apology from Lindsay, and a pledge to switch on the town\u2019s Christmas lights. A broken pledge, as it would turn out. But hey: it\u2019s hardly the most significant pledge to have been broken in the two and a half years since.</p> <p>By that stage, in any case, our heroine had moved on. East, in fact, to Turkey, where she fulfilled her obligations as the face of an energy drink by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/nov/03/lindsay-lohan-the-polyglot-calling-the-kettering-back\" title=\"\">handing out cans of it</a> to Syrian refugees in a camp. From there, it was a short hop to Athens, where she and a Greek business partner opened a nightclub called LOHAN.

      "bodyText": "Exciting developments in televised Mykonos, as the Lindsay Lohan universe formally expands into different properties. Time was that Lindsay featured in the news primarily as the person picking up DUI charges when Paris Hilton wasn\u2019t, but she swiftly grew too large for the mid-00s Los Angeles party scene. There were unpaid hotel bills. There were failures to show up on film sets. There was a stolen necklace, and community service at a morgue. There was BBC3\u2019s decision to get her to front a documentary on human trafficking in India. In overview, then, Lindsay\u2019s has always been a story in the picaresque style \u2013 perhaps this is inevitable, given her terrible parents pushed her on stage at 11, when she made her debut in Disney\u2019s remake of The Parent Trap. During the second decade of the millennium, however, the Mean Girls star has certainly added to the gaiety of various nations. She resided on our own shores during the EU referendum, and the night the results were dropping in saw Lindsay unleash a series of tweets so ancien regime they could only have been the direct inspiration for Theresa May\u2019s subsequent \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d speech. \u201cSorry #Kettering,\u201d ran one of these, \u201cbut where are you?\u201d Local MP Philip Hollobone was so incensed that he used the occasion of a Commons question to the then leader of the house Chris Grayling to assert that \u201ceveryone knows where Kettering is\u201d. A Grayling reply was forthcoming. \u201cLindsay Lohan \u2013 as a star of child and teen movies, a very entertaining actress at the time \u2013 hasn\u2019t necessarily fulfilled her professional potential,\u201d judged Chris, who would certainly know about not achieving one\u2019s professional potential. \u201cPerhaps now we know the reason why,\u201d he went on. \u201cShe should visit the fine town of Kettering and find herself returned to stardom.\u201d Well, there\u2019s careers advice gold right there. That said, this exchange did appear to elicit an apology from Lindsay, and a pledge to switch on the town\u2019s Christmas lights. A broken pledge, as it would turn out. But hey: it\u2019s hardly the most significant pledge to have been broken in the two and a half years since. By that stage, in any case, our heroine had moved on. East, in fact, to Turkey, where she fulfilled her obligations as the face of an energy drink by handing out cans of it to Syrian refugees in a camp. From there, it was a short hop to Athens, where she and a Greek business partner opened a nightclub called LOHAN. Filmed on its steps on opening night, Lindsay debuted a mixed European accent best described as the full Steve McClaren. Speaking only haltingly in the strange American tongue, she announced that this was only the start of an empire. \u201cThere\u2019s bigger things to be done with the LOHAN club,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThere is spas, there is refugee camps.\u201d Sure. Actually, no: what? \u201cWe create peaceful locations where we can all be happy,\u201d Lindsay went on. \u201cAnd we start with the refugees, and then we open nice places, and maybe one of the refugees will open a place with us \u2026 I want LOHAN to be a celebration of everybody coming together, in the European nations.\u201d Mmm. It wasn\u2019t entirely clear \u2013 it rarely is \u2013 but Lindsay did assert of the Lohan club brand that \u201cwe can make it a good purpose\u201d and it \u201cwill fix bad things in the world\u201d. \u201cWe have to help people,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cAnd if we can do it with a nightclub, or with a spa, or with refugee camps, or with containers \u2026\u201d Was the Enigma machine in one of the containers? Because I struggled to decode the business model here. Luckily, all has become clear with madam\u2019s current venture. Having surfaced in the headlines only briefly in 2017 (\u201cI was racially profiled at Heathrow and asked to remove my headscarf\u201d) and in 2018 (\u201cLindsay Lohan accuses homeless Moscow family of trafficking their own children\u201d), Lindsay has now returned to the primetime cable schedules with an MTV show called Lindsay Lohan Beach Club: Paradise Boss. The premise? Lindsay Lohan has opened a Mykonos beach club.

All in all, the show is going to struggle to resolve its central tension: that Lindsay is a professional beach club owner who prizes the reputation of her business above all; and that the people who staff it are only pretending to be dedicated beach club workers on reality TV. Still, this isn\u2019t the only fish the growing Lohan brand has to fry. As Lindsay revealed to Jimmy Fallon this week: \u201cThere will eventually be an island.\u201d So happily \u2013 or rather, less sadly \u2013 the universe has other plans for expansion.",

Exeter this week learned that their Argentina wing Santiago Cordero will join Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles next season after they were unable to match the Top 14 club\u2019s offer because of the constraints of the Premiership\u2019s salary cap. \u201cSantiago has been fantastic and done better than we could have hoped for but there are financial realities involved in putting together a squad,\u201d said the Exeter coach, Rob Baxter. \u201cWe cannot offer extra contracts to everybody and strengthen the squad. \u201cI like the salary cap and the quality of competition it creates but in France they link it to your income. In this country, it does not matter if you are losing millions of pounds or making millions, the cap does not change. There are probably some things that need sorting out.\u201d Exeter were the only club in the top-flight to make a profit last year.",

But also winning, naturally. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely jigsaw for me,\u201d Alexander says. \u201cWe have to try to get some of the athletes who haven\u2019t been on court for a while, like Emily Mannix, more court time in this series, to expose her to that fire. But you don\u2019t just get a start in a Test as a Diamond. You have to earn your spot. We need to find the balance and we need to win.\u201d But former Roses player Tamsin Greenway believes England can take the series. \u201cThe vibe around the squad is that they are the best team at the moment, that they can win it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Housby-Harten partnership brings with it a hell of a lot of confidence, as they\u2019re the only shooting combination in world netball which truly shares the load. \u201cIf the Aussies lose to England, they\u2019ll have six full months before the World Cup to ponder \u2018oh goodness, can we actually beat them?\u2019 The self-doubt will creep in.\u201d Alexander gets the long game. \u201cAre we hungry? Let\u2019s just say, we all know what\u2019s coming in July.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales police minister, Troy Grant, has apologised for comments criticising a magistrate over the sentencing of former Adelaide archbishop Philip Wilson. Grant criticised magistrate Robert Stone\u2019s decision in July to sentence Wilson to six months in custody for concealing child sexual abuse, describing it as \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cnot a deterrent\u201d. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The comments sparked outrage from the legal community, with the former president of the NSW Law Society, Doug Humphreys, saying it was inappropriate for government ministers to make \u201cunfounded criticism or incorrect assertions about judicial rulings\u201d and calling for an apology. Humphreys said politicians \u201cplay a fundamental role in upholding the key pillar of our democratic society \u2013 the rule of law\u201d. \u201cThis requires not only that governments and their officials be accountable under the law, but also that they respect, in accordance with the separation of powers, judicial process,\u201d he said at the time. Grant initially said he stood by the comments, but in a notice published in the Newcastle Herald and on the ABC last month, he apologised for the comments. \u201cI now accept that my remarks may have had the regrettable effect of casting doubt on the learned magistrate\u2019s professional abilities and application of the law,\u201d the notice read. \u201cI have apologised unreservedly to Magistrate Stone for any harm he has sustained and for the hurt and embarrassment suffered as a result of my statements.\u201d Wilson resigned as archbishop of Adelaide in July after becoming the most senior Catholic clergyman in the world to be convicted of concealing child sexual abuse. He was sentenced to serve six months\u2019 home detention in August but the sentence was quashed in December when the Newcastle district court judge Roy Ellis upheld Wilson\u2019s appeal against the conviction. In July though, Grant told Sydney radio station 2GB that he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the sentence, and claimed Stone had failed to apply amendments to sentencing laws. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely appalled at this sentence of Wilson,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI had involvement, having been the officer during my police career that uncovered the paedophilia and cover-ups in the Maitland-Newcastle diocese back in 1995. \u201cThis is no deterrent as a sentence, it\u2019s appalling, the children deserve better, the victims deserve better, and the community do.\u201d He said Stone had failed to apply an amendment to sentencing laws which require judges to apply punishments according to contemporary community standards. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been done in this case, and that\u2019s why everyone is so disgusted,\u201d he said.

On the one hand the lack of a dominant figure or figures (like in the men\u2019s game) means the list of potential champions is long. The last eight women\u2019s singles grand slams have been claimed by eight different players, five of the most recent seven going to first-timers, and four of the past seven to players seeded no better than 14th. Throw in the No 1 ranking passing through six pairs of hands in the past 20 months and it\u2019s near impossible to predict a WTA event with any confidence.</p> <p>But this evenness and depth also makes for treacherous draws. To win a women\u2019s singles title it\u2019s near impossible to avoid a former grand slam champion or world No 1 along the way. For example, Venus Williams and Victoria Azarenka both head to Melbourne unseeded, while Maria Sharapova lurks as 30th seed in Barty\u2019s quarter of the draw. But it is a draw that, on paper at least, Barty should be delighted with. The most dangerous pitfalls have been avoided until the fourth round when she is scheduled to cross paths with defending champion Caroline Wozniacki.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/10/andy-murrays-australian-open-hopes-dealt-blow-during-practice-session\">Andy Murray's Australian Open hopes dealt blow during practice session</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Beyond Barty, consecutive fourth round appearances at Melbourne Park in 2016 and 2017 testify to Daria Gavrilova\u2019s quality but the 24-year old continues to bubble under without completely breaking through. However, if Gavrilova makes it past US Open champion Naomi Osaka in the second round and books some showcourt time under lights, her Tiggerish on-court personality makes her a must-watch. Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107 will also be a chance to give the home fans something to cheer after making a strong return from a serious shoulder injury, while the evergreen Sam Stosur continues to keep on keeping on in her 20th season as a professional.</p> <p>The likelihood of an Australian man breaking the country\u2019s near 17-year grand slam drought is remote, and there are three good reasons for that: Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, and Roger Federer. Between them those three legends have hoovered up 51 of the past 60 available slams. They begin another grand slam fortnight seeded one, two and three.</p> <p>So it is with limited expectations that Alex De Minaur will take centre stage. The 19-year old is the only Australian male seed, a product of an astonishing breakout 2018 during which his ranking exploded from 209 to 31. De Minaur was recognised by his peers as the ATP World Tour\u2019s newcomer of the year, an award that arrived with plaudits for the Sydneysider\u2019s tenacity and fighting spirit. \u201cHe reminds everybody of a certain Lleyton Hewitt,\u201d Jo-Wilfried Tsonga remarked last week, and it would come <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/20/mini-hewitt-alex-de-minaur-continues-to-thrill-mentor-and-idol\">as little surprise </a>to anyone who has watched De Minaur in action to know Hewitt is a long-time mentor and frequent doubles partner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/09/underarm-serve-between-legs-seals-bernard-tomic-win-over-nick-kyrgios\">Bizarre underarm serve between legs seals Bernard Tomic win over Nick Kyrgios</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With De Minaur in the ascendancy, Nick Kygrios should escape the laser beam spotlight for a change. Still the most naturally talented Australian on the circuit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/08/kyrgios-and-tomic-could-learn-from-osaka-and-show-us-they-care\">Kyrgios\u2019 ranking has plummeted to 51</a> after a succession of injuries (and a spider bite) and poor form. The consequence of dropping outside the top 32 is an opening round blockbuster with Milos Raonic, compounded by a potential second round date with Stan Wawrinka. If he can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/26/john-mcenroe-fearful-nick-kyrgios-will-run-himself-out-of-tennis\">get his head together</a> for a week or two he has the game to go deep but in current form and facing a horror draw this seems unlikely to be Kyrgios\u2019s year.</p> <p>In between De Minaur and Kryrgios sit the hardworking pair of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/10/matthew-ebden-in-career-best-showing-at-shanghai-masters\">Matthew Ebden</a> and John Millman, the latter still basking in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/04/john-millman-federer-vanquisher-brisbane-local-and-liverpool-fan\">knocking off Federer</a> in his previous grand slam. However, between them they have accumulated just six wins in the main draw at Melbourne Park. Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/09/underarm-serve-between-legs-seals-bernard-tomic-win-over-nick-kyrgios\">Bernard Tomic</a> is showing glimpses of maturation, while Thanasi Kokkinakis, if he succeeds in qualifying, has the game to achieve greatness but his body and mindset have not kept pace with his potential. The 22-year old also beat Federer last year but it was a largely disappointing campaign featuring spells on the second-tier Challenger circuit.</p> <p>If the singles draws leave an Australian\u2019s appetite unsated there is plenty more to enjoy over in the doubles. John Peers won on home soil in 2017 with partner Henri Kontinen and they teamed up again for three titles last season, while Barty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/10/ash-barty-claims-maiden-grand-slam-title-with-doubles-victory\">broke her grand slam duck</a> at Flushing Meadows in September alongside Coco Vandeweghe.</p>",

Barty sits comfortably in the upper echelon of women\u2019s tennis, cutting a relaxed figure on and off court, a far cry from her hiatus from the sport from 2014 to 2016 which included a stint in the WBBL. \u201cI certainly fear no-one and I feel like I can go out there and match it with the world\u2019s best,\u201d she asserted earlier this week after dispensing with the world No 1 Halep at the Sydney International. The current openness of the women\u2019s game is a double-edged sword for Barty\u2019s chances. On the one hand the lack of a dominant figure or figures (like in the men\u2019s game) means the list of potential champions is long. The last eight women\u2019s singles grand slams have been claimed by eight different players, five of the most recent seven going to first-timers, and four of the past seven to players seeded no better than 14th. Throw in the No 1 ranking passing through six pairs of hands in the past 20 months and it\u2019s near impossible to predict a WTA event with any confidence. But this evenness and depth also makes for treacherous draws. To win a women\u2019s singles title it\u2019s near impossible to avoid a former grand slam champion or world No 1 along the way. For example, Venus Williams and Victoria Azarenka both head to Melbourne unseeded, while Maria Sharapova lurks as 30th seed in Barty\u2019s quarter of the draw. But it is a draw that, on paper at least, Barty should be delighted with. The most dangerous pitfalls have been avoided until the fourth round when she is scheduled to cross paths with defending champion Caroline Wozniacki. Beyond Barty, consecutive fourth round appearances at Melbourne Park in 2016 and 2017 testify to Daria Gavrilova\u2019s quality but the 24-year old continues to bubble under without completely breaking through. However, if Gavrilova makes it past US Open champion Naomi Osaka in the second round and books some showcourt time under lights, her Tiggerish on-court personality makes her a must-watch. Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107 will also be a chance to give the home fans something to cheer after making a strong return from a serious shoulder injury, while the evergreen Sam Stosur continues to keep on keeping on in her 20th season as a professional. The likelihood of an Australian man breaking the country\u2019s near 17-year grand slam drought is remote, and there are three good reasons for that: Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, and Roger Federer. Between them those three legends have hoovered up 51 of the past 60 available slams. They begin another grand slam fortnight seeded one, two and three. So it is with limited expectations that Alex De Minaur will take centre stage. The 19-year old is the only Australian male seed, a product of an astonishing breakout 2018 during which his ranking exploded from 209 to 31. De Minaur was recognised by his peers as the ATP World Tour\u2019s newcomer of the year, an award that arrived with plaudits for the Sydneysider\u2019s tenacity and fighting spirit. \u201cHe reminds everybody of a certain Lleyton Hewitt,\u201d Jo-Wilfried Tsonga remarked last week, and it would come as little surprise to anyone who has watched De Minaur in action to know Hewitt is a long-time mentor and frequent doubles partner. With De Minaur in the ascendancy, Nick Kygrios should escape the laser beam spotlight for a change. Still the most naturally talented Australian on the circuit Kyrgios\u2019 ranking has plummeted to 51 after a succession of injuries (and a spider bite) and poor form. The consequence of dropping outside the top 32 is an opening round blockbuster with Milos Raonic, compounded by a potential second round date with Stan Wawrinka. If he can get his head together for a week or two he has the game to go deep but in current form and facing a horror draw this seems unlikely to be Kyrgios\u2019s year. In between De Minaur and Kryrgios sit the hardworking pair of Matthew Ebden and John Millman, the latter still basking in knocking off Federer in his previous grand slam. However, between them they have accumulated just six wins in the main draw at Melbourne Park. Elsewhere, Bernard Tomic is showing glimpses of maturation, while Thanasi Kokkinakis, if he succeeds in qualifying, has the game to achieve greatness but his body and mindset have not kept pace with his potential. The 22-year old also beat Federer last year but it was a largely disappointing campaign featuring spells on the second-tier Challenger circuit. If the singles draws leave an Australian\u2019s appetite unsated there is plenty more to enjoy over in the doubles. John Peers won on home soil in 2017 with partner Henri Kontinen and they teamed up again for three titles last season, while Barty broke her grand slam duck at Flushing Meadows in September alongside Coco Vandeweghe.",

Michael Lambert, the former secretary of NSW Treasury, was commissioned by the government to look into the failings of building regulation in NSW, after a fire in a building in Bankstown in 2012 revealed shocking breaches of the building code. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Two young women leapt from the fifth floor of the building to escape the fire. Connie Zhang died while Ginger Jiang was severely injured. Subsequent investigations revealed an illegal roof over the atrium that held smoke in, and multiple breaches of fire safety requirements. But while the NSW government moved promptly to tighten up on certification of fire safety systems in high rise buildings, Lambert says the rest of his nearly 150 recommendations have languished. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been three years. The fire safety issue was a time bomb so they did something on that, but they haven\u2019t implemented the rest of the report,\u201d he said. The cracks that appeared in the 34-storey Opal Tower at Olympic Park just before Christmas, causing the evacuation hundreds of residents, have again turned the spotlight on NSW\u2019s building regulation, and more broadly, on whether Australia will emerge from the latest housing boom with a legacy of substandard buildings. The Lambert report found \u201cthe incidents of building defects is significant\u201d and \u201cthe incidence appears higher in NSW than elsewhere\u201d. But he wasn\u2019t able to be clearer than that, because there are still no audits of buildings to assess whether they meet the required standards. The only statistics on defects collected by government are those generated by people complaining about their builders to NSW Fair Trading. A 2012 survey by the City Futures project the University of NSW surveyed 1,020 strata owners across NSW, and found 72% of all respondents (85% in buildings built since 2000) knew of at least one significant defect in their complex. As the building boom has gathered pace, the problems have probably got worse, Lambert says. Developers, who do not require any qualifications, have piled into the industry, and the demand for tradespeople has meant that less qualified people are working on major projects. In NSW there is no requirement for builders to be licensed if they are working on commercial projects, though residential builders are required to hold licences in order to access home warranty insurance. \u201cThe Opal Tower is likely the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Lambert told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere are hundreds of smaller projects, mainly medium rise in the suburbs, that will have problems.\u201d Lambert produced his draft report in August 2015 and a final report in October of that year, which outlined a litany of problems in building regulation in NSW. These included fragmented responsibility within government, multiple agencies that were underresourced, no requirements on those checking building work \u2013 the certifiers \u2013 to have proper qualifications and a lack of any audits to see whether they were doing their job. He put forward more than 100 recommendations, including 12 he said should be implemented within six months from the date of the final report, which was October 2015. While Lambert backed the continued use of private certifiers to sign off on building work, he suggested a top-to-bottom overhaul of the system to strengthen it. This included making one minister responsible for building regulation; bringing agencies together; introducing reforms aimed at greater independence and professionalisation for certifiers; making other professionals in the system more accountable; and introducing a system of audits so that the public could be confident that certifiers were performing their role. He also urged the government to properly resource the regulators, after finding \u201csignificantly lower resourcing of regulators\u201d in NSW than other states. The government moved promptly to require those certifying fire safety systems to have competency in that area. The Fire Safety Association will now set the standards for those signing off on fire systems. Previously, no fire-specific qualifications were required. But Lambert recommended a major overhaul for all certifiers, designed to boost their independence from developers, who pay for their services, and to professionalise the industry. Most states now rely on private certifiers to ensure building standards are met. In NSW people can opt to have a council-employed inspector or a private certifier employed by the developer, to sign off that building work is to code and in line with the development consent. In practice, most builders and developers use private certifiers, especially on major projects like high rise residential buildings. In its response to his report, the government promised to pass new laws dealing with the role and qualifications of certifiers by the second half of 2017. A bill, which fell short of Lambert\u2019s expectations, was put out for consultation in September 2018 and was passed in October. A spokesman for the fair trading and innovation minister, Matt Kean, said it would come into force in the next few months. The explanatory note on the bill said it \u201cclarifies a certifier\u2019s role and responsibilities, enhances independence, strengthens disciplinary procedures and facilitates better coordination of certifier functions\u201d. Lambert told Guardian Australia he had tried in vain to progress the report with two successive ministers for fair trading and innovation, Victor Dominello and Kean. \u201cThe bureaucrats don\u2019t want change and ministers do not seem motivated to push change,\u201d he said. One of his key recommendations was that building regulation be brought under the control of one minister. At the moment, the minister for planning is responsible for implementing the national building codes at state level and attends the intergovernmental meetings , but licensing of residential builders and certifiers rests with the minister for fair trading and is treated as a consumer issue. The government agreed to consolidation in 2016 in its response to the Lambert report, but nothing has happened. A spokesperson said the government remained to committed to the goal and it was a matter of \u201csequencing\u201d. The government also agreed to establish a high level committee of regulators and a consultation committee to help progress reform. But again, nothing has happened. Lambert said: \u201cI arranged for the current minister, Matt Kean, to meet with industry and he had agreed at that meeting to set up a committee to help fast-track the reforms and provide feedback. But later he walked away from it.\u201d The other problem identified was the largely paper-based systems relating to buildings. Paperwork is spread across councils, the Department of Planning and the certifiers\u2019 files, making it difficult for building purchasers and neighbours to find out whether the building has been certified as complying with the building standards. \u201cAs a priority step to fill data gaps, amendments will be prepared for introduction into parliament before the end of 2016, the government said in its response to Lambert. \u201cThese will provide the power to require certifying authorities and accreditation holders to report certain building and development data.\u201d Again, this step seems to have fallen by the wayside. After the Opal Tower evacuation, Kean announced that 25% to 30% of the industry would be audited. The details of the audit program are under consideration and have yet to be announced, so it is unclear whether this will involve checking buildings to see whether they are in line with what has been certified, or checking the paperwork. Asked about the slow progress, Kean, who became minister in January 2017, disagreed. \u201cMichael Lambert was asked to review laws regulating certifiers. In October, I passed nation-leading certification reforms, implementing Michael Lambert\u2019s key recommendations, with serious penalties for certifiers who do the wrong thing,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe Lambert Review was superseded by the Shergold Weir report that was initiated by the federal building ministers\u2019 forum. NSW has led the nation in implementing the recommendations from this report.\u201d Following the worldwide scare about aluminium composite cladding after the Grenfell tower disaster in London, Prof Peter Shergold AC and Bronwyn Weir examined the building regulatory systems across jurisdictions, as well as the broader problems that impact the effective implementation of the national construction code. Their report was delivered to the building ministers\u2019 forum in April 2018 and made recommendations to improve Australian building safety and compliance. Kean will deliver his response to the Shergold Weir report before the next building ministers\u2019 forum in February. But in the meantime, one of the biggest building booms in Australian history has seen skylines around the country changed forever, as literally hundreds of medium and high density projects are constructed, arguably under regulatory systems full of holes. The Opal Tower saga is emblematic of that system. Just who is to blame will likely take some time to sort out. The government has asked two engineering professors to urgently investigate the tower\u2019s safety, after cracks appeared. \u201cI do not want to pre-empt Professor Hoffman and Professor Carter\u2019s investigation into the Opal Tower,\u201d Kean said. \u201cWhat we have seen at the Opal Tower is clearly unacceptable and my heart goes out to the residents. \u201cYour home is often your biggest investment and people have every right to expect that their home is safe and free from defects. That it is especially the case when it is a new building like the Opal Tower.\u201d But once immediate liability is sorted out, it might be worth reflecting on the full cost of regulatory inertia.

      "bodyText": "For some years, the Academy Awards have been seeking to shake up their annual telecast, in an attempt to freshen the ceremony and lure a larger \u2013 and younger \u2013 audience. Veteran producers have been let go; edgier hosts employed \u2013 and ratings continued to fall. This year, however, a radical reinvention of the ceremony has been all but forced on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, following the decision of Kevin Hart to step down three days after he was announced as host in December. Hart \u2013 an actor and comedian particularly popular with exactly the demographic the Oscars were keen to court \u2013 was reportedly told to apologise anew for homophobic remarks he had made in the past or quit his post. He chose the latter, but speculation had been strong as no replacement was unveiled \u2013 and Hart did indeed apologise a few days later anyway. Last week, he appeared on Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s chatshow and declared he would be open to a return, if only to \u201ctake a stand against the trolls\u201d who he felt had hounded him online. But the backlash to the interview was considerable, with many objecting to Hart\u2019s appropriation of victimhood and DeGeneres\u2019s agreement with his assessment that his detractors were simply \u201chaters\u201d. Reports have now emerged in the Hollywood trade press that the telecast team have resigned themselves to the lack of a replacement and sought instead to secure the services of countless stars to act as awards presenters. Top of the producers Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss\u2019s wish list for the 24 February show is said to be the cast of the Avengers franchise, ahead of the release two months later of the \u201cfinal\u201d instalment, Endgame. The 2013 telecast featured a dry run for such an event, with Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L Jackson together on stage, among many others. ABC, the network that broadcasts the Oscars in the US, is owned by Disney, which also now owns Marvel. Should such topline talent be enticed on to the stage, a host-free setup could be perceived as a win-win: audiences are reportedly increasingly bored by the political rhetoric that can make up much of the patter of an official emcee, while publicists and studios would be pleased by the diminished opportunities for the ceremony to go off-script. Such a situation is not entirely without precedent: in 1989, producer Allan Carr and director Jeff Margolis oversaw a show that replaced the opening monologue with a now-infamous 11-minute musical number involving a duet between the actor Rob Lowe and an unknown actor, Eileen Bowman, dressed as Snow White. The show was appallingly received by critics, audiences and all those present in the room, with Paul Newman, Gregory Peck, Julie Andrews and Billy Wilder signing an open letter deriding it as \u201can embarrassment to both the Academy and the entire motion picture industry\u201d. Lowe is still attempting to live it down, while Bowman returned to her San Diego hometown the following morning, never to return to Los Angeles. Carr never worked again and lived most of the remaining years of his life as a recluse. Multiple hosts have also been sighted through the years, with Bob Hope, Jack Lemmon, Rosalind Russell and Donald Duck sharing the billing in 1958, Carol Burnett, Michael Caine, Charlton Heston and Rock Hudson in 1973 and Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn and Paul Hogan in 1987. The most recent example came in 2011, when James Franco and Anne Hathaway acted as co-hosts. Their efforts were widely perceived to be disastrous, with a striking lack of chemistry or humour, and had a negative impact on the careers of both. Speaking in 2017, Franco again denied being stoned during the engagement, but did admit to having either \u201chigh or low energy. In my head, I was trying to be the straight man. I guess I just went too far or came across as the dead man \u2026 I mean, I shouldn\u2019t have been doing it\u201d.",

Andy Anokye, 31, who performs under the stage name Solo 45, denies 31 charges including 22 counts of rape and five counts of false imprisonment. Anokye also denies two charges of assault by penetration and two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Jurors at Bristol crown court were told Anokye was a member of the grime collective Boy Better Know. Prosecuting, Christopher Quinlan QC alleged that Anokye \u201cviolently treated, bullied and sexually abused\u201d four women over a two-year period. \u201cHe imprisoned, physically assaulted and sexually violated and raped four women,\u201d he told the jury. \u201cHe filmed, for posterity, a great deal of what he did.\u201d Quinlan said each of the four women would give evidence during Anokye\u2019s trial, due to last for five weeks. \u201cThey don\u2019t know each other,\u201d he said. \u201cYet we say each of them suffered in similar ways at different times at the hands of this defendant.\u201d The court heard one of the women came forward to police with allegations against Anokye and he was arrested. His mobile phone and laptop were seized and examined by officers, who contacted three other women. \u201cWhat they disclosed to the police is, we say, reflected by the 31 allegations that he now faces,\u201d Quinlan said. \u201cHe physically assaulted, falsely imprisoned \u2013 that is to hold them against their will \u2013 and raped each of them repeatedly. \u201cWe say he is a violent and controlling narcissist, a bully, a sadist who derives satisfaction and sexual pleasure from inflicting pain and suffering on women who we allege are his victims.\u201d Quinlan said Anokye was a grime artist and described the genre as \u201ca form of dance music influenced by garage music\u201d. The court heard that notable artists associated with this genre included Skepta and Stormzy. \u201cThey don\u2019t have anything to do with this case though their names will feature,\u201d Quinlan said. \u201cHe was known, or became known, to each of the four women through their knowledge or taste for music of that type. \u201cHe will assert that the sexual conduct with each of them was at all times consensual and there was never any occasion where he did anything with them or to them to which they were not consenting.\u201d Quinlan said the musician \u201cincessantly\u201d questioned the women about their sexual history.

Anokye is said to have told the woman he had people in that area to shoot her \u2013 causing her to have a panic attack. Quinlan claimed Anokye stabbed a woman in her leg and used a knife to strike her head repeatedly. \u201cHe poured bleach in her mouth, he threatened to brand her with a hot iron,\u201d he told the jury. Police examining Anokye\u2019s mobile phones and computer discovered searches for the term \u201cdacryphilia\u201d. \u201cEssentially it means sexual arousal from another\u2019s fears,\u201d Quinlan said. \u201cTears and terror may have given him a sexual thrill.\u201d Anokye, of Bristol, denies all the charges against him and the case continues.",

He wanted to know if they sold P\u0105czki, donuts eaten on the Polish answer to pancake day. They call it Fat Thursday (T\u0142usty Czwartek) and the 72-year-old was trying to order a big batch for a Rotary Club do next month. \u201cWe\u2019ve recently had a new Polish member and I thought it would be nice to make her feel welcome,\u201d the retired policeman said.

      "bodyText": "The former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown has been remembered at a private funeral in the Somerset village where he lived. John Major joined Ashdown\u2019s widow, Jane, and other friends and family at the service on Thursday in St Mary\u2019s church, Norton Sub Hamdon, which was billed as an occasion to celebrate the life of the former marine. Lord Ashdown died aged 77 on 22 December, two months after revealing he was being treated for bladder cancer. His body was carried into the church in a wicker casket. As well as the 40 or so people in the church, hundreds watched the service on TV screens in the village hall. Speaking at the service, Myles Wickstead, a local Lib Dem and friend of Ashdown, said he had \u201cespoused the values of openness and tolerance, and he found them in this village which he loved\u201d. Wickstead added: \u201cHe was never happier than when at the Lord Nelson on a Friday night, indulging in a mixture of arguments, fun, gossip, banter and, of course, drink. \u201cOur community and our country now are poorer that Paddy has gone.\u201d Ashdown was christened Jeremy, but given the nickname Paddy when he went to school in England after spending his childhood years in Northern Ireland. The Rev Peter Thomas, who led the service, said: \u201cLocally, you wouldn\u2019t get away with any other name. God also knew him as Paddy, not Jeremy, and probably didn\u2019t call him Lord.\u201d Ashdown led the Lib Dems for 11 years from 1988 and was credited with increasing the party\u2019s popularity. This was reflected in a rise in the number of MPs and notable successes in local council elections. He remained active in politics after stepping down as leader and the ardent pro-European was still commenting on what he called the \u201cBrexit shambles\u201d weeks before his death. Ashdown quit the House of Commons in 2001 to become the UN high representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina, a position he held for four years. David Laws, who succeeded Ashdown as the MP for Yeovil and would later serve in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition cabinet, was present. There was also a woman accompanied by a pony sporting yellow party rosettes. The current Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, paid tribute to Ashdown on Twitter.",

The spokesman said: \u201c[In relation to] the motion that would follow from the Grieve amendment, there would only be 90 minutes of debate on the motion, is our understanding, and only one amendment could be selected.\u201d The government was controversially defeated on Wednesday by 308 to 297 after John Bercow, the Speaker, allowed the Conservative backbencher to submit an amendment reducing the amount of time May would have to act. Any Brexit plan B debate would be likely to be held in a crisis atmosphere with intense pressure on MPs to decide how to act.

Some games developed using SpatialOS, such as the London-developed spaceflight MMO Lazarus, have decided to shut down their servers until the dispute is resolved. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be down for an undetermined amount of time, basically until the dispute is resolved, one way or another,\u201d Lazarus\u2019s developer, Spilt Milk, said in a tweet. Others have been pushing to stay up until the situation has been made clear. Worlds Adrift, another British game with elements of Fortnite combined with World of Warcraft, would stay live for now, its developer Bossa Studios tweeted. \u201cWhatever is happening in the background outside of our control, our focus is ensuring players are looked after,\u201d it said. Narula argued that the spat showed the danger of building a livelihood on a tech platform with unilateral power to change the rules. He said: \u201cWhat today\u2019s incident shows is that a slip of a pen can upend the livelihood of thousands of people. All these services say at the end of their terms of service that they can amend these at will. My contract, my livelihood, is amendable at whim. \u201cMost people don\u2019t abuse it. But I think it shows us a fundamental vulnerability.\u201d Improbable achieved global attention in 2017 when it received a $502m (\u00a3390m) investment from Japan\u2019s SoftBank corporation, instantly valuing the startup, founded in 2012, at more than $1bn. Narula said at the time that the investment underscored Improbable\u2019s core belief: that \u201cthe next major phase in computing will be the emergence of large-scale virtual worlds\u201d.",

Jacques Gounon, the chief executive of Getlink, the cross-channel rail operator\u2019s parent company, told the UK transport secretary, Chris Grayling, the contracts may have been illegally awarded. \u201cIt is with serious concern that we have read in this weekend\u2019s press details of agreements between HMG [Her Majesty\u2019s government] and certain ferry operators up to \u00a3107m to provide additional capacity to be sold into the market even if a deal is reached,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI must bring to your attention the distortionary and anti-competitive effects of such an action, which would be a unilateral breach not only of the concession agreement with Eurotunnel, but more widely of existing competition and state aid law.\u201d Gounon was speaking after the controversy over a \u00a314m contract awarded to Seaborne Freight, a startup company, to revive a ferry service from Ramsgate in Kent to Ostend in Belgium. The company did not have any ships at the time of the award and is in the process of chartering them. He pointed out Eurotunnel offered the quickest link to France and the company had already been working on contingency options the government was aware of, including additional freight trains and a terminal for unaccompanied trailers, but added that this needed government support. Gounon said the company was ready and waiting for the government to act and \u201cremains prepared to deliver additional capacity under equivalent contracts to those you have signed with ferry operators\u201d. Eurotunnel was one of the first companies to warn the government of the potential risk Brexit posed to transport in Kent. It is deeply frustrated by what Eurotunnel described as the government\u2019s lack of engagement. Grayling announced on Christmas Eve that the government had awarded \u00a3103m to three ferry companies to provide additional cargo capacity in the event that the Dover-Calais route becomes congested in a no-deal Brexit scenario. The largest contracts went to Brittany Ferries and the Danish cargo company DFDS, with the third going to Seaborne Freight. Grayling defended his department\u2019s accelerated tender process and said he made no apologies for supporting a British startup. But Grayling was also criticised by the chief of Calais port, who said he was \u201cvery angry\u201d over the deal between the government and Seaborne Freight. \u201cI\u2019m very shocked, I consider it disrespectful for Calais and Dover,\u201d said Jean-Marc Puissesseau. Portsmouth port has expressed its frustration with the government over plans to use nearby land for lorries, and said part of the M3 may be closed to provide space for these vehicles in the worst-case scenario. Seaborne Freight\u2019s chief executive, a former Royal Navy submarine officer, has defended the government\u2019s decision, saying the company is run by a collection of experienced \u201cold dogs\u201d who will charter, rather than own, cargo ships. A councillor in Ramsgate warned the port will not be ready for services in April. It has not been used as a ferry terminal for some years and only last Thursday did excavation of the seabed begin, so ferries and large cargo ships can start operating out of the harbour again.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>THE ITALIAN JOB</strong></h2> <p>The Fiver knows a good deal when it sees one. If we were, to pluck an image out of thin air, a highly capable 28-year-old midfielder who had never quite been fully appreciated in a decade\u2019s service to his current club, then a five-year stint in one of football\u2019s most imposing citadels might seem a fairly smart bit of work. Let\u2019s call that midfielder \u201cAaron Ramsey\u201d, let\u2019s call the club about to lose him \u201cArsenal\u201d and let\u2019s call the European powerhouse about to spirit him away \u201cJuventus\u201d. Suddenly it all seems <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/09/aaron-ramsey-arsenal-juventus-five-year-deal-36m\">rather real</a>.</p> <p>Of course The Fiver\u2019s rapier wit and ability to blunder a few paragraphs out midway through every afternoon have endeared us so much to our employers that we can\u2019t entirely sympathise with Ramsey\u2019s status in north London. But it is something of a conundrum that, while Arsenal draw breath for next season\u2019s Battle For Fourth, a player they apparently have little future use for will be heading to the summit of Serie A and \u2013 presumably \u2013 a regular place in the latter stages of Big Cup, preparing to slot into the middle alongside Blaise Matuidi and Miralem Pjanic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/09/aaron-ramsey-arsenal-juventus-five-year-deal-36m\">Arsenal\u2019s Aaron Ramsey agrees five-year deal with Juventus worth \u00a336m</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ramsey will be asked to channel his inner John Charles, \u201c<em>Il Gigante Buono</em>\u201d, in Turin. They love a buccaneering Welshman there \u2013 those who can remember the 1950s and 60s, anyway \u2013 and if history is an accurate guide he should increase his league title tally from zero to something near Charles\u2019s tally of three. It has been some time coming: Ramsey was struck by horror-knack soon after joining Arsenal; recovered only to find himself the target of brainless boo-boys; cast that all aside to score seemingly every time he kicked a ball in 2013-14; scored two FA Cup final winners in a period when the Emirates Cup was the only other trophy to which they gave the glad eye; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/10/aaron-ramsey-arsenal-juventus\">kept on keeping on</a>, yet still never quite found his rightful place, either in the team or supporters\u2019 affections.</p> <p>A rumbustious reincarnation of early $tevie Mbe? A canny operator with Lampard-esque timing? Perhaps an all-round string-puller extraordinaire of the Toni Kroos stripe? Nobody has ever quite worked out what Ramsey is, but then it would take a crack class of PhD students in undelivered promise to work out what Arsenal have been in the past few years either. Tough decisions \u2013 like giving Mesut \u00d6zil a bumper new deal and then realising your biggest creative threat comes from Sead Kolasinac \u2013 need making and Unai Emery already has one well-remunerated playmaker to keep happy, after all. Their planning might have been shoddy but Ramsey\u2019s might have turned out to be rather astute. His present and future employers\u2019 trajectories are already set for now, and he won\u2019t change that; he should be remembered properly as a winner in future, though, and that might be the sweetest deal of all.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cIn particular, for young men who find themselves deprived of viable routes to employment opportunities, gambling promises an alternative route to wealth, social capital and masculine affirmation, yet most end up ensnared in a cycle of indebtedness\u201d \u2013 a major new study reveals the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/10/football-gambling-dire-consequences-young-men-bet-new-study\">\u201cdire consequences\u201d</a> of football\u2019s relationship with gambling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c288076050f691504d26f2b5914426eef73f8f1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c288076050f691504d26f2b5914426eef73f8f1d/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"26 out of 44 Premier League and Championship clubs have a gambling company as their main shirt sponsor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">26 out of 44 Premier League and Championship clubs have a gambling company as their main shirt sponsor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>RECOMMENDED LISTENING</h2> <p>It\u2019s only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/jan/10/cups-var-transfers-and-championship-chat-football-weekly-extra-podcast\">Football Weekly Extra</a>.</p> <h2>SUPPORT THE GUARDIAN</h2> <p>Producing the Guardian\u2019s thoughtful, in-depth journalism [the stuff not normally found in this email, obviously \u2013 Fiver Ed] is expensive, but supporting us isn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "THE ITALIAN JOB The Fiver knows a good deal when it sees one. If we were, to pluck an image out of thin air, a highly capable 28-year-old midfielder who had never quite been fully appreciated in a decade\u2019s service to his current club, then a five-year stint in one of football\u2019s most imposing citadels might seem a fairly smart bit of work. Let\u2019s call that midfielder \u201cAaron Ramsey\u201d, let\u2019s call the club about to lose him \u201cArsenal\u201d and let\u2019s call the European powerhouse about to spirit him away \u201cJuventus\u201d. Suddenly it all seems rather real. Of course The Fiver\u2019s rapier wit and ability to blunder a few paragraphs out midway through every afternoon have endeared us so much to our employers that we can\u2019t entirely sympathise with Ramsey\u2019s status in north London. But it is something of a conundrum that, while Arsenal draw breath for next season\u2019s Battle For Fourth, a player they apparently have little future use for will be heading to the summit of Serie A and \u2013 presumably \u2013 a regular place in the latter stages of Big Cup, preparing to slot into the middle alongside Blaise Matuidi and Miralem Pjanic. Ramsey will be asked to channel his inner John Charles, \u201cIl Gigante Buono\u201d, in Turin. They love a buccaneering Welshman there \u2013 those who can remember the 1950s and 60s, anyway \u2013 and if history is an accurate guide he should increase his league title tally from zero to something near Charles\u2019s tally of three. It has been some time coming: Ramsey was struck by horror-knack soon after joining Arsenal; recovered only to find himself the target of brainless boo-boys; cast that all aside to score seemingly every time he kicked a ball in 2013-14; scored two FA Cup final winners in a period when the Emirates Cup was the only other trophy to which they gave the glad eye; kept on keeping on, yet still never quite found his rightful place, either in the team or supporters\u2019 affections. A rumbustious reincarnation of early $tevie Mbe? A canny operator with Lampard-esque timing? Perhaps an all-round string-puller extraordinaire of the Toni Kroos stripe? Nobody has ever quite worked out what Ramsey is, but then it would take a crack class of PhD students in undelivered promise to work out what Arsenal have been in the past few years either. Tough decisions \u2013 like giving Mesut \u00d6zil a bumper new deal and then realising your biggest creative threat comes from Sead Kolasinac \u2013 need making and Unai Emery already has one well-remunerated playmaker to keep happy, after all. Their planning might have been shoddy but Ramsey\u2019s might have turned out to be rather astute. His present and future employers\u2019 trajectories are already set for now, and he won\u2019t change that; he should be remembered properly as a winner in future, though, and that might be the sweetest deal of all. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIn particular, for young men who find themselves deprived of viable routes to employment opportunities, gambling promises an alternative route to wealth, social capital and masculine affirmation, yet most end up ensnared in a cycle of indebtedness\u201d \u2013 a major new study reveals the \u201cdire consequences\u201d of football\u2019s relationship with gambling.

      "body": "<p>The first time Meek Mill took part in a rap battle, he left in tears. \u201cThe guy battling me was 16 years old, and I was 13 or 14 \u2013 he was more advanced than me,\u201d the 31-year-old recalls. \u201cI lost by a long shot, but it gave me ambition. I told everybody before I left: \u2018One day, you all will be playing my music.\u2019\u201d Hours before we sit down to chat in a ritzy Manhattan restaurant, the rapper\u2019s fourth proper studio album, Championships, goes into the US charts at No 1. It is his second chart-topping record, after Dreams Worth More Than Money in 2015.</p> <p>As he sips camomile tea with a side order of raw ginger, Meek \u2013 real name Robert Rihmeek Williams \u2013 carefully unlocks a giant, diamond-studded chain, and places it on the table with the care of Indiana Jones swapping idols in Raiders of the Lost Ark. \u201cI\u2019m sick as hell right now,\u201d he croaks between sips. His whirlwind schedule doesn\u2019t allow for much rest; he\u2019ll be whisked across town to tape an appearance on The Daily Show after our conversation and has just come from the set of a film about urban dirt-bike riders, 12 O\u2019Clock Boys. It\u2019s his acting debut, portraying a character who \u201c[reflects] on myself \u2013 someone who\u2019s been in prison and comes home and tries to change his life\u201d.</p> <p>The release of Championships should be a triumphant moment for Meek. His strongest record yet, it pairs Meek\u2019s penchant for full-throated intensity with glossy, cavernous beats. With its big-deal guest appearances, it has already made headlines, from speculation about whether Jay-Z\u2019s pointed lines on What\u2019s Free address Kanye West\u2019s newfound Donald Trump fanaticism, to Meek\u2019s team-up with his one-time rival Drake on Going Bad. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy when it\u2019s competition \u2013 it\u2019s our job,\u201d Meek says, stating that any bad blood between him and Drake is now firmly in the past. \u201cJay wasn\u2019t talking to Kanye \u2013 he was talking to whoever was influencing Kanye. I never viewed that as a diss when I put it on my record.\u201d</p> <p>The album arrives at a time when public goodwill towards Meek has never been stronger. \u201cGetting support from the people is always a great feeling,\u201d he says. He has needed it over the past 18 months. His history of legal troubles, culminating in a five-month jail stint last year, can be traced back to his upbringing in north Philadelphia, where his family moved following the death of his father when Meek was five.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a1ed6a17ccf17687201855060b6e706ba1442bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a1ed6a17ccf17687201855060b6e706ba1442bd/27_0_2946_1768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing in the US last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing in the US last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arik McArthur/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGrowing up in the rough neighbourhoods in America is all the same \u2013 coming up around drugs, violence, murder,\u201d he says. \u201cThe police are there, but not to the level of protection. Coming up in a ruthless environment as a kid, you learn from what you see.\u201d He relied on female role models, from his sister and mother to the music of Deborah Cox and Lauryn Hill. \u201cIt made me look at women as stronger,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mom did everything for us \u2013 I\u2019ve always viewed her as a man and a woman, all in one. It made me think all women were extremely strong and manly.\u201d</p> <p>His uncle, the Philadelphia-based DJ Grandmaster Nell, played hip-hop records for Meek at his grandmother\u2019s house, and Meek developed his distinctive flow \u2013 imagine a sentient air horn, or a boxing announcer\u2019s theatrical timbre turned up to the max. \u201cIf you were to walk out [of] here and someone drove by half a block away, playing my music loud, you could still hear my voice,\u201d he claims, citing Jay-Z\u2019s protege Memphis Bleek as a formative influence.</p> <p>Throughout his adolescence, scuffles with police were a constant. Meek estimates that by the age of 18 he had been arrested 10 times for charges that didn\u2019t stick. Then, in January 2007, he was arrested for illegal gun possession \u2013 and his decade-long legal troubles began. \u201cI was carrying a gun because I felt I needed it to survive,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you put me back in that situation right now, I\u2019d still carry that gun. People like me die on a daily basis.\u201d When the cops approached him in south-west Philadelphia, Meek claims, he tossed the gun to the ground and lay on the ground, preparing for arrest; the arresting officer, Reginald Graham, maintains that Meek instead pointed the gun directly at him. \u201cFrom there on in, it was lights out,\u201d Meek alleges. \u201cI was getting knocked out.</p> <p>\u201cI was prepared to face the consequences,\u201d Meek says of the gun charge, but the cops also charged him with drug dealing and assaulting a police officer. The guilty verdict led to a one-year prison sentence and 10 years\u2019 probation. Prison conditions \u2013 showering amid excrement-smeared walls, washing his underwear in the sink, navigating soap shortages \u2013 stay with Meek. \u201cIt was a big transition,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to adapt.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU2FWrxiGcI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DU2FWrxiGcI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Meek Mill\u2019s Trauma.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>To this day, he contests the dealing and assault charges, and he\u2019s not alone; in March last year, Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/crime/meek-mill-philadelphia-district-attorney-larry-krasner-wont-oppose-release-prison-20180314.html\" title=\"\">cast doubt on Graham\u2019s original report</a>. \u201cIn the ghettoes of America, if you\u2019re a young man pointing a gun at a cop, you\u2019re dead,\u201d is Meek\u2019s comment on the accusation. \u201cPolice officers will tell you: \u2018We\u2019re trained to kill you if you threaten our lives.\u2019 That\u2019s normal.\u201d</p> <p>When the judge Genece Brinkley was assigned to preside over his probation, Meek hoped she would show a measure of sympathy for his situation: \u201cShe\u2019s a black judge. She comes from my neighbourhood.\u201d</p> <p>After a brief dalliance with TI\u2019s Grand Hustle label, Meek linked up with the Miami rapper Rick Ross\u2019s Maybach Music Group, but his rise to stardom was interrupted by legal difficulties.

      "bodyText": "The first time Meek Mill took part in a rap battle, he left in tears. \u201cThe guy battling me was 16 years old, and I was 13 or 14 \u2013 he was more advanced than me,\u201d the 31-year-old recalls. \u201cI lost by a long shot, but it gave me ambition. I told everybody before I left: \u2018One day, you all will be playing my music.\u2019\u201d Hours before we sit down to chat in a ritzy Manhattan restaurant, the rapper\u2019s fourth proper studio album, Championships, goes into the US charts at No 1. It is his second chart-topping record, after Dreams Worth More Than Money in 2015. As he sips camomile tea with a side order of raw ginger, Meek \u2013 real name Robert Rihmeek Williams \u2013 carefully unlocks a giant, diamond-studded chain, and places it on the table with the care of Indiana Jones swapping idols in Raiders of the Lost Ark. \u201cI\u2019m sick as hell right now,\u201d he croaks between sips. His whirlwind schedule doesn\u2019t allow for much rest; he\u2019ll be whisked across town to tape an appearance on The Daily Show after our conversation and has just come from the set of a film about urban dirt-bike riders, 12 O\u2019Clock Boys. It\u2019s his acting debut, portraying a character who \u201c[reflects] on myself \u2013 someone who\u2019s been in prison and comes home and tries to change his life\u201d. The release of Championships should be a triumphant moment for Meek. His strongest record yet, it pairs Meek\u2019s penchant for full-throated intensity with glossy, cavernous beats. With its big-deal guest appearances, it has already made headlines, from speculation about whether Jay-Z\u2019s pointed lines on What\u2019s Free address Kanye West\u2019s newfound Donald Trump fanaticism, to Meek\u2019s team-up with his one-time rival Drake on Going Bad. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy when it\u2019s competition \u2013 it\u2019s our job,\u201d Meek says, stating that any bad blood between him and Drake is now firmly in the past. \u201cJay wasn\u2019t talking to Kanye \u2013 he was talking to whoever was influencing Kanye. I never viewed that as a diss when I put it on my record.\u201d The album arrives at a time when public goodwill towards Meek has never been stronger. \u201cGetting support from the people is always a great feeling,\u201d he says. He has needed it over the past 18 months. His history of legal troubles, culminating in a five-month jail stint last year, can be traced back to his upbringing in north Philadelphia, where his family moved following the death of his father when Meek was five. \u201cGrowing up in the rough neighbourhoods in America is all the same \u2013 coming up around drugs, violence, murder,\u201d he says. \u201cThe police are there, but not to the level of protection. Coming up in a ruthless environment as a kid, you learn from what you see.\u201d He relied on female role models, from his sister and mother to the music of Deborah Cox and Lauryn Hill. \u201cIt made me look at women as stronger,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mom did everything for us \u2013 I\u2019ve always viewed her as a man and a woman, all in one. It made me think all women were extremely strong and manly.\u201d His uncle, the Philadelphia-based DJ Grandmaster Nell, played hip-hop records for Meek at his grandmother\u2019s house, and Meek developed his distinctive flow \u2013 imagine a sentient air horn, or a boxing announcer\u2019s theatrical timbre turned up to the max. \u201cIf you were to walk out [of] here and someone drove by half a block away, playing my music loud, you could still hear my voice,\u201d he claims, citing Jay-Z\u2019s protege Memphis Bleek as a formative influence. Throughout his adolescence, scuffles with police were a constant. Meek estimates that by the age of 18 he had been arrested 10 times for charges that didn\u2019t stick. Then, in January 2007, he was arrested for illegal gun possession \u2013 and his decade-long legal troubles began. \u201cI was carrying a gun because I felt I needed it to survive,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you put me back in that situation right now, I\u2019d still carry that gun. People like me die on a daily basis.\u201d When the cops approached him in south-west Philadelphia, Meek claims, he tossed the gun to the ground and lay on the ground, preparing for arrest; the arresting officer, Reginald Graham, maintains that Meek instead pointed the gun directly at him. \u201cFrom there on in, it was lights out,\u201d Meek alleges. \u201cI was getting knocked out. \u201cI was prepared to face the consequences,\u201d Meek says of the gun charge, but the cops also charged him with drug dealing and assaulting a police officer. The guilty verdict led to a one-year prison sentence and 10 years\u2019 probation. Prison conditions \u2013 showering amid excrement-smeared walls, washing his underwear in the sink, navigating soap shortages \u2013 stay with Meek. \u201cIt was a big transition,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to adapt.\u201d To this day, he contests the dealing and assault charges, and he\u2019s not alone; in March last year, Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney cast doubt on Graham\u2019s original report. \u201cIn the ghettoes of America, if you\u2019re a young man pointing a gun at a cop, you\u2019re dead,\u201d is Meek\u2019s comment on the accusation. \u201cPolice officers will tell you: \u2018We\u2019re trained to kill you if you threaten our lives.\u2019 That\u2019s normal.\u201d When the judge Genece Brinkley was assigned to preside over his probation, Meek hoped she would show a measure of sympathy for his situation: \u201cShe\u2019s a black judge. She comes from my neighbourhood.\u201d After a brief dalliance with TI\u2019s Grand Hustle label, Meek linked up with the Miami rapper Rick Ross\u2019s Maybach Music Group, but his rise to stardom was interrupted by legal difficulties. After a party celebrating the release of Meek\u2019s 2012 debut, Dreams and Nightmares, he was briefly detained by police after a car he was riding in was pulled over (no charges were filed). \u201cIt always felt to me that, as I got bigger, things got worse,\u201d he says. As the years passed, it became increasingly clear that Brinkley was not the sympathetic figure that Meek had hoped for. The probation officer she assigned to him would allegedly phone at 6am every day, demanding to know his every move, even though he wasn\u2019t under house arrest; in 2013, Brinkley ordered him to attend etiquette classes because of his perceived rudeness during court proceedings.

      "bodyText": "More than half a billion pounds of council workers\u2019 pension money has been directly invested by local authorities in arms companies implicated in Saudi Arabia\u2019s military campaign in Yemen, in which thousands of civilians have been killed. Council pension funds have sizeable shareholdings in BAE Systems, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, according to nearly 100 freedom of information requests. Between them, 43 pension funds directly hold shares worth \u00a3566m in the five companies and earned more than \u00a318.5m in dividends in 2018, a period in which civilian deaths reportedly surged and a punishing famine took hold. The councils also hold hundreds of millions of pounds in shares in the five companies via pooled investments, which they do not control directly. The holdings mean thousands of local authority staff will have their retirement payouts part-funded by the companies, some of which manufacture arms linked to incidents in which civilians and children were killed. The Guardian gathered the data through the freedom of information website WhatDoTheyKnow.com. The Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a member of the parliamentary committee on arms export controls, said some council employees would be upset to learn how their retirement income was being funded. \u201cBritish council workers\u2019 retirement income is being funded by companies that have been allowed by the British and American governments to make much of their profits by satisfying the appetite of Saudi to kill, maim and starve millions of civilians in Yemen,\u201d he said. Russell-Moyle said some employees at Brighton and Hove city council, within his Brighton Kemptown constituency, would be \u201cfurious\u201d. The Campaign Against Arms Trade said council employees\u2019 retirement funds \u201cshould be invested in the public good, not in companies that profit from war and conflict\u201d. \u201cThese aren\u2019t just numbers on a spreadsheet; the weapons these companies are producing have had a devastating impact,\u201d said Andrew Smith, a CAAT spokesman. \u201cThe fighter jets and bombs that are being used in Yemen have played a crucial role in creating the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. \u201cCouncils should not be profiteering from the companies that have made these weapons and have been so complicit in the destruction.\u201d The five companies are key suppliers to the Saudi military, which is conducting a campaign in Yemen in which the death toll is estimated at more than 60,000 people, including thousands of civilians, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. Defence companies routinely point out that such contracts are the result of agreements between their national governments and Saudi Arabia. Lockheed Martin is one of two companies that build the GBU-12 Paveway II missile, and shrapnel fragments found at the site where 40 children on a school bus were killed by a Saudi warplane were reportedly traced back to the US company. Raytheon also makes Paveway missiles at a factory in Glenrothes, Scotland. Shards of bombs found at several sites where civilians died have been traced back to the US-based company, according to CNN. The Saudi air force uses Eurofighter Typhoons, made by a consortium including Airbus and the British company BAE Systems, while Tornado fighter-bombers are manufactured by BAE Systems. The kingdom bought 17% of everything the UK defence contractor sold last year and BAE Systems employs 6,000 people on the ground in Saudi Arabia. The US company Northrop Grumman is also a major contractor to the Saudi military, according to its website, which states it is \u201cheavily involved in the training and development of the Saudi military personnel, most notably providing technical services for the ministry of the national guard\u201d. The council with the largest investment in the five named companies is Lothian, which manages funds worth \u00a37.8bn for staff including Edinburgh city council workers. Its trustees have \u00a385m invested with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon, deriving \u00a33.8m in revenue from their holdings over the latest 12-month period for which records are available. West Yorkshire pension fund, including Leeds city council and Bradford council employees, had \u00a378.4m of holdings and earned \u00a32m of dividends, spread across BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and Airbus. Tameside pension fund, including Greater Manchester, has \u00a379m invested with Raytheon and BAE Systems, pulling in \u00a32.65m of dividend income over 12 months. A spokesman for Tameside council referred the Guardian to its ethical investment policy, which states \u201capplying ethical, environmental or any other non-commercial policy either to investments generally or to selecting fund managers would be inconsistent with our legal duties and responsibilities\u201d. The council added that trustees \u201cdo not actively invest in or disinvest from companies solely or largely for social, ethical or environmental reasons\u201d. A further 40 local authority pension funds hold similar investments, with values ranging from negligible sums to tens of millions of pounds. The Guardian has approached West Yorkshire pension fund and Lothian pension fund for comment.",

If you look at any men\u2019s rights sites the variety of ways in which women can be shamed is mind-boggling: being fat is not just bad; being a foodie when you are slim is also bad.

But it does. Shaming exists to keep us objectified, even to ourselves. And, of course, we all internalise it. Shame is the water we learn to swim in and in which some of us drown.

I just got sent a dress code for my teenager\u2019s school, which focused only on what girls must not wear; nothing about boys at all. When we ask that female pleasure be integrated into sex education, it is because it is key to any discussion about consent. This is not radical \u2013 it is realistic.</p> <p>The taboo on female pleasure surfaces in the oddest of places. The Os\u00e9 \u201c personal massager\u201d, made by a female tech and using micro-robotics, and promising \u201chands-free\u201d orgasms for women, won an award for innovation at the Consumer Electronics Show in the US. But that award from the Consumer Technology Association has been withdrawn, with the organisation saying that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/08/ces-dildo-gender-sex-toy-ose-personal-massager\" title=\"\">Os\u00e9 broke a rule</a> that entries not be \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane\u201d. This from an organisation at whose show a sex doll for men was launched, and which features VR porn exhibits.</p> <p>We have \u201crapeable\u201d robots, but something that may pleasure women is profane. All this endless shaming is about the male gaze and the idea that women are there only to please it. All this is disrupted the minute women refuse to be ashamed of ourselves, our bodies, our pleasures.</p> <p>This is much easier said than done when we live in a world where the powers that be think a clever young woman can be brought low by a picture of her bare feet. But she can\u2019t. She will keep on dancing. As we all should. For the sheer hell of it.</p> <p>\u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist</p>",

When we ask that female pleasure be integrated into sex education, it is because it is key to any discussion about consent. This is not radical \u2013 it is realistic. The taboo on female pleasure surfaces in the oddest of places. The Os\u00e9 \u201c personal massager\u201d, made by a female tech and using micro-robotics, and promising \u201chands-free\u201d orgasms for women, won an award for innovation at the Consumer Electronics Show in the US. But that award from the Consumer Technology Association has been withdrawn, with the organisation saying that the Os\u00e9 broke a rule that entries not be \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane\u201d. This from an organisation at whose show a sex doll for men was launched, and which features VR porn exhibits. We have \u201crapeable\u201d robots, but something that may pleasure women is profane. All this endless shaming is about the male gaze and the idea that women are there only to please it. All this is disrupted the minute women refuse to be ashamed of ourselves, our bodies, our pleasures. This is much easier said than done when we live in a world where the powers that be think a clever young woman can be brought low by a picture of her bare feet. But she can\u2019t. She will keep on dancing. As we all should. For the sheer hell of it. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",

The film has won numerous awards, including the influential People\u2019s Choice award at the Toronto film festival, and three Golden Globes: for best film (musical or comedy), best supporting actor for Ali, and best screenplay, for which Farrelly and Vallelonga are both credited, along with Brian Hayes Currie. Farrelly was nominated for best director but did not win. However, despite its liberal credentials, Green Book has become a lightning rod for criticism. Thematically, it has come under fire as an example of a \u201cwhite saviour\u201d narrative, while the film\u2019s portrayal of a close friendship between Vallelonga and Shirley was flatly denied by Shirley\u2019s family in an interview with Shadow &amp; Act. In the same article, Ali was reported to have apologised for any offence caused by his portrayal of Shirley (who died in 2013), and was quoted as saying: \u201cI did the best I could with the material I had.\u201d Mortensen also apologised for using a racial slur during a Q&amp;A about the film in November.",

Teach children bookies\u2019 odds don\u2019t add up | Greg Wood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McGee spent two years working closely with two groups of football supporters aged 18-35 in Bristol and Derry, recording their gambling habits in depth, in a research project funded by the British Academy.</p> <p>His findings, shared exclusively with the Guardian, include some of the young men telling him they can no longer watch a football match unless they have multiple bets; commonly they have up to 25 accounts with online gambling companies, and their football conversations with mates are all about betting, rather than the game.</p> <p>Participants said the gambling companies\u2019 marketing is extremely effective, particularly the offers of \u201cfree\u201d bets, and that their losses did not feel like real money because they are placed so casually on a phone and no longer involve going to a bookmaker\u2019s shop.</p> <p>One told McGee the \u201cbuzz\u201d of gambling is \u201cup there with sex and drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d, saying: \u201cAnd I think because of that, gambling is the worst addiction of the lot.\u201d</p> <p>That participant, a 31-year-old father of two in Derry, ultimately disclosed to McGee he had turned to drug dealing for a period to try to recoup money saved for a family holiday, which he had lost gambling.</p> <p>The participant told McGee he had 40 accounts with online betting companies and cannot watch matches, except the odd Premier League game, without betting. This includes in-play bets on the number of corners, throw-ins or yellow cards. He said he was \u201cin debt to my eyeballs\u201d on high-interest payday loans taken out to cover gambling losses, and his credit was \u201cblacklisted to the max\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gambling promises a route to wealth, social capital and masculine affirmation yet most end up in a cycle of indebtedness</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Darragh McGee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He said that gambling \u201ctook over my life for a while\u201d and he has deep regrets about having neglected his baby daughter, because he would \u201csit on the laptop, continuous gambling for the day\u201d when looking after her. He told McGee he had lost two friends to suicide, one directly attributed to gambling debts. Derry, like other areas of Northern Ireland, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/20/northern-ireland-suicides-troubles-death-toll\" title=\"\">some of the highest suicide rates in Britain</a>.</p> <p>As McGee came to know the groups, he found the intensity of the online gambling culture in football has had catastrophic impacts on many of the participants. \u201cFar from being the knowledge-based, risk-free activity it is marketed as, the profound appeal of online sports gambling has had dire consequences for many young men,\u201d McGee has concluded, in research which is complete and due to be published academically next year.</p> <p>\u201cThe study documented the unfolding stories of several young men whose everyday lives are punctuated by deepening social and financial precarity, high-interest payday loans and bank debt, mortgage defaults, family breakdown, and mental health struggles.</p> <p>\u201cIn particular, for young men who find themselves deprived of viable routes to employment opportunities, gambling promises an alternative route to wealth, social capital and masculine affirmation, yet most end up ensnared in a cycle of indebtedness.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb0ac0c6528b1feba02059b981fb901d59696d42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb0ac0c6528b1feba02059b981fb901d59696d42/275_596_3157_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young men commonly they have up to 25 accounts registered with online gambling companies, the research found.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young men commonly they have up to 25 accounts registered with online gambling companies, the research found.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McGee shared his findings after the major online betting companies represented by the Remote Gambling Association announced they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/06/gambling-firms-back-live-sports-advertising-ban-bet365-william-hill-ladbrokes\" title=\"\">voluntarily stop \u201cwhistle-to-whistle\u201d television advertising</a> during the broadcasting of live sport, except for horse racing.

      "bodyText": "The relentless involvement of betting companies in football has drawn a generation of young men into strongly associating their support for the game with gambling, leading to \u201cdire consequences\u201d for many, a study has found. The explosion in marketing and sponsorship since the last Labour government deregulated gambling in 2005, combined with the ease of online betting via smartphones, has resulted in the \u201cgamblification\u201d of watching football, according to research conducted by Dr Darragh McGee of the University of Bath. McGee spent two years working closely with two groups of football supporters aged 18-35 in Bristol and Derry, recording their gambling habits in depth, in a research project funded by the British Academy. His findings, shared exclusively with the Guardian, include some of the young men telling him they can no longer watch a football match unless they have multiple bets; commonly they have up to 25 accounts with online gambling companies, and their football conversations with mates are all about betting, rather than the game. Participants said the gambling companies\u2019 marketing is extremely effective, particularly the offers of \u201cfree\u201d bets, and that their losses did not feel like real money because they are placed so casually on a phone and no longer involve going to a bookmaker\u2019s shop. One told McGee the \u201cbuzz\u201d of gambling is \u201cup there with sex and drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d, saying: \u201cAnd I think because of that, gambling is the worst addiction of the lot.\u201d That participant, a 31-year-old father of two in Derry, ultimately disclosed to McGee he had turned to drug dealing for a period to try to recoup money saved for a family holiday, which he had lost gambling. The participant told McGee he had 40 accounts with online betting companies and cannot watch matches, except the odd Premier League game, without betting. This includes in-play bets on the number of corners, throw-ins or yellow cards. He said he was \u201cin debt to my eyeballs\u201d on high-interest payday loans taken out to cover gambling losses, and his credit was \u201cblacklisted to the max\u201d. He said that gambling \u201ctook over my life for a while\u201d and he has deep regrets about having neglected his baby daughter, because he would \u201csit on the laptop, continuous gambling for the day\u201d when looking after her. He told McGee he had lost two friends to suicide, one directly attributed to gambling debts. Derry, like other areas of Northern Ireland, has some of the highest suicide rates in Britain. As McGee came to know the groups, he found the intensity of the online gambling culture in football has had catastrophic impacts on many of the participants. \u201cFar from being the knowledge-based, risk-free activity it is marketed as, the profound appeal of online sports gambling has had dire consequences for many young men,\u201d McGee has concluded, in research which is complete and due to be published academically next year. \u201cThe study documented the unfolding stories of several young men whose everyday lives are punctuated by deepening social and financial precarity, high-interest payday loans and bank debt, mortgage defaults, family breakdown, and mental health struggles. \u201cIn particular, for young men who find themselves deprived of viable routes to employment opportunities, gambling promises an alternative route to wealth, social capital and masculine affirmation, yet most end up ensnared in a cycle of indebtedness.\u201d McGee shared his findings after the major online betting companies represented by the Remote Gambling Association announced they would voluntarily stop \u201cwhistle-to-whistle\u201d television advertising during the broadcasting of live sport, except for horse racing. That measure was proposed by the Labour party as part of a reform package including a 1% levy \u2013 10 times the current 0.1% levy \u2013 to fund research and treatment for gambling addiction. McGee welcomes the proposed whistle-to-whistle advertising ban as \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but said: \u201cA generation of young people already view gambling as a normalised part of sport. Turning the tide will require stronger state regulation and a genuine commitment to redistributing a greater slice of the losses incurred by British gamblers to education and treatment for problem gambling. Educating the next generation about the dangers will be key.\u201d The betting companies have such huge \u201cvisibility\u201d via ubiquitous sport sponsorship, marketing and advertising, and have had a free hand for so long, that the voluntary ban is unlikely to limit the amounts being gambled. The participants in his research said that once they were signed up to betting accounts and apps, the constant prompts during matches, and marketing offers, particularly offers of \u201cfree\u201d or matched bets, were powerful encouragements to gamble. A total of \u00a314.4bn was lost by people betting in the UK from April 2017 to March 2018, according to figures produced by the Gambling Commission, an increase from \u00a313.8bn the previous year. Of that total, \u00a35.3bn was lost gambling online, a 12.8% increase on the previous year. Online betting companies have targeted football in an industrialised way, paying for sponsorship and advertising, including in football-related media \u2013 the Guardian accepts such advertising \u2013 at a time when revenues from other advertisers are diminishing. This season, nine out of the 20 Premier League clubs have a gambling company as their main shirt sponsor, and as many as 17 out of the 24 Championship clubs. SkyBet sponsors the Football League and its three divisions, and is promoted by Sky during sports TV coverage. Major betting companies based in the UK, offshore and in overseas countries, particularly Asia, also sponsor billboards around pitches, which are prominent during broadcasts. Research by Goldsmiths University last year found gambling logos or branding were on screen for between 71% and 89% of Match of the Day programmes, even though the BBC does not carry actual advertising. McGee\u2019s work with younger fans has led him to conclude that the marketing has \u201chooked\u201d a generation into \u201can accelerated sports culture in which the casual staking of money is an essential accompaniment to watching the game\u201d. He says \u201ca new generation of sports fans view gambling as vital to their enjoyment of sport\u201d.

The country\u2019s dairy farmers are depending on you.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2018/dec/17/the-best-cheese-in-the-world-is-running-out-fast-what-should-we-eat-instead\">The best cheese in the world is running out fast. What should we eat instead?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Americans eat an awful lot of cheese: almost 37lb per person, per year. Yet apparently that\u2019s still not enough. Demand for American-made cheese is seriously falling behind supply. According to recent data from the Department of Agriculture, we\u2019re currently experiencing a 1.4bn-pound cheese surplus.</p> <p>Lucas Fuess, director of dairy market intelligence at HighGround Dairy, a consulting firm, explains that cheese is literally sitting in cold storage facilities waiting for some aspiring pizza-maker to give it a home.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal to have some cheese in warehouses, to make sure there\u2019s enough in the pipeline,\u201d Fuess said. \u201cThe amount that\u2019s in there currently is, if not a record, very close to record high.\u201d</p> <p>In part this can be linked to lower dairy consumption and the growing popularity of veganism. Plant-based products such as almond-milk <a href=\"https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/features/natural-boom-plant-milks-flood-market-dairy-alternatives/\">have experienced rapid sales growth</a>.</p> <p>Since 2008, milk production <a href=\"https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Milk_Production_and_Milk_Cows/milkprod.php\">has surged by 13%</a>, but domestic demand for milk has dropped sharply. As demand decreases, the price of milk drops, and farmers receive less per gallon produced. This appears to have pushed farmers to produce even more milk to make up the shortfalls in their income, exacerbating the problem.</p> <p>Producing American cheese helps farmers to use up milk they can\u2019t sell and that would otherwise go off. At the end of November 2018, US cheese production had grown yet again for the 67th consecutive month.</p> <p>But the problem is Americans are eating less cheese, too.</p> <p>American diets are moving away from processed cheeses like Velveeta and Kraft, and many of the nation\u2019s leading fast and casual restaurants are trying new things. Panera, like others, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-10/american-cheese-is-no-longer-america-s-big-cheese\">has replaced</a> American cheese in their sandwiches with a four-cheese combo made up of fontina, cheddar, monteau and smoked gouda.</p> <p>According to Euromonitor International, sales of processed cheese are projected to drop 1.6% this year, the fourth year in a row.</p> <p>In part, that\u2019s because many Americans now think processed cheese is gross, but also because they\u2019re au fait with quality cheese from around the world. It\u2019s hard to turn back to an indestructible fluorescent orange mess once you\u2019ve tried <a href=\"https://www.cheese.com/brie-de-meaux/\">brie de meaux</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing increased sales of more exotic, specialty, European-style cheeses.

      "bodyText": "Say cheese, America. No, seriously, please start saying cheese at the grocery store. The country\u2019s dairy farmers are depending on you. Americans eat an awful lot of cheese: almost 37lb per person, per year. Yet apparently that\u2019s still not enough. Demand for American-made cheese is seriously falling behind supply. According to recent data from the Department of Agriculture, we\u2019re currently experiencing a 1.4bn-pound cheese surplus. Lucas Fuess, director of dairy market intelligence at HighGround Dairy, a consulting firm, explains that cheese is literally sitting in cold storage facilities waiting for some aspiring pizza-maker to give it a home. \u201cIt\u2019s normal to have some cheese in warehouses, to make sure there\u2019s enough in the pipeline,\u201d Fuess said. \u201cThe amount that\u2019s in there currently is, if not a record, very close to record high.\u201d In part this can be linked to lower dairy consumption and the growing popularity of veganism. Plant-based products such as almond-milk have experienced rapid sales growth. Since 2008, milk production has surged by 13%, but domestic demand for milk has dropped sharply. As demand decreases, the price of milk drops, and farmers receive less per gallon produced. This appears to have pushed farmers to produce even more milk to make up the shortfalls in their income, exacerbating the problem. Producing American cheese helps farmers to use up milk they can\u2019t sell and that would otherwise go off. At the end of November 2018, US cheese production had grown yet again for the 67th consecutive month. But the problem is Americans are eating less cheese, too. American diets are moving away from processed cheeses like Velveeta and Kraft, and many of the nation\u2019s leading fast and casual restaurants are trying new things. Panera, like others, has replaced American cheese in their sandwiches with a four-cheese combo made up of fontina, cheddar, monteau and smoked gouda. According to Euromonitor International, sales of processed cheese are projected to drop 1.6% this year, the fourth year in a row. In part, that\u2019s because many Americans now think processed cheese is gross, but also because they\u2019re au fait with quality cheese from around the world. It\u2019s hard to turn back to an indestructible fluorescent orange mess once you\u2019ve tried brie de meaux. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing increased sales of more exotic, specialty, European-style cheeses. Some of those are made in the US; a lot of them aren\u2019t,\u201d Andrew Novakovic, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University told NPR this week. Since imported cheese costs more than domestic, a few blocks of the good stuff might not leave much left in the old cheese budget for anything else. The cheese mountain is crushing farmers. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen record numbers of dairy farms close because milk prices are so low that dairy farms aren\u2019t profitable any more,\u201d Feueff added. \u201cThis cheese that is hanging over the market is preventing prices from raising higher and it\u2019s reaching a critical level.\u201d Trump\u2019s trade policy has also played a role in the cheesepocalypse. In response to his tariffs, three top importers of US milk and cheese products \u2013 Mexico, Canada and China \u2013 have instituted retaliatory tariffs that will have a significant impact on American dairy farmers\u2019 bottom line, according to a study from Texas A&amp;M University. \u201cAs long as the tariffs are still on in Mexico, it remains a challenge to move cheese out of the country and move those stocks lower,\u201d Fuess explained. It\u2019s not the end of the line. Analysts have noted large buyers of cheese increasing offerings or finding new ways to use it. McDonald\u2019s recently launched a breakfast sandwich with two slices of American cheese. \u201cFast-food companies are taking this opportunity with low cheese prices to increase cheese on their dishes,\u201d says Fuess.

They also appeared to be briefly blocked from entering parliament. \u201cThere are a number of cases that we have referred to the Crown Prosecution Service in relation to what\u2019s been going over the last few days,\u201d DC House said. He said he could not go into specifics but confirmed that online abuse was part of the cases involved. House said: \u201cSocial media comments and ongoing dialogue, by a number of individuals, [are] being monitored by the police and do form part of the investigations that we are carrying out. \u201cThere is a distinction between someone putting out misleading information or even fake news, and somebody inciting violence or racial hatred. We are interested in the latter.\u201dHouse confirmed that more police officers have been deployed around parliament after the incident highlighted an increasingly rowdy atmosphere over Brexit. He said: \u201cWe have seen, as you would expect in the political situation, an increase in numbers of demonstrators and an increase in the passion exhibited by demonstrators on both sides of the debate over the last few days. \u201cWe have increased the number of officers down there and they are under clear instruction that no member of the public is to be impeded from going about their lawful business. \u201cWhether it is an MP going into parliament, or anyone else going about their job, people have got an absolute right to go about their lawful daily lives without impediment from someone. That is clearly a balance and clearly outside parliament we are seeing it tested to the extreme limit.\u201d Asked whether police powers were sufficient to tackle the kind of abuse witnessed, House said: \u201cIt is a matter for the home secretary to look at if there is specific legislation that could be put in place around greater protection. \u201cWe are having daily liaison meetings with a number of stakeholders in relations to the issues around parliament, to make sure that we can facilitate people going about their lawful business [so that] specifically working, not just MPs, but aides and others people working within parliament, can get in and out and are not in any way alarmed by what\u2019s going on whilst we try to maintain the ability of people to carry out lawful demonstrations.\u201d",

He\u2019s recorded Mozart piano concertos with both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/feb/24/classicalmusicandopera.shopping3\">Scottish Chamber Orchestra</a> and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, but south of the border at least he has only appeared occasionally in that dual role. One of those few exceptions was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/18/classicalmusicandopera.reviews2\">a concert at the Barbican with the SCO almost 11 years ago</a>, when coincidentally Anderszewski played the same pair of concertos that he presented here with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Haydn\u2019s D major Piano Concerto, and Beethoven\u2019s First Concerto in C.</p> <p>Clearly, then, he feels these two particular concertos go well together, and certainly his performance of the Haydn transformed it from a standard example of 18th-century classicism into a piece of engaging elegance and wit that stood up well alongside the convention-busting exuberance of early Beethoven.

      "bodyText": "For such an intensely self-critical artist as Piotr Anderszewski, who takes such meticulous care over every detail of everything he plays, directing piano concertos from the keyboard makes total sense. He\u2019s recorded Mozart piano concertos with both the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, but south of the border at least he has only appeared occasionally in that dual role. One of those few exceptions was a concert at the Barbican with the SCO almost 11 years ago, when coincidentally Anderszewski played the same pair of concertos that he presented here with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Haydn\u2019s D major Piano Concerto, and Beethoven\u2019s First Concerto in C. Clearly, then, he feels these two particular concertos go well together, and certainly his performance of the Haydn transformed it from a standard example of 18th-century classicism into a piece of engaging elegance and wit that stood up well alongside the convention-busting exuberance of early Beethoven. His typically crisp rhythms and clean, crystalline sound gave it buoyancy and sparkling vitality, which the CBSO seemed delighted to follow. The solo playing in the Beethoven was just as poised and controlled, but the effect was far grander and more imposing, even wild in the finale, so that it seemed to come from a different world altogether, far away from the Mozart piano concerto in the same key, K503, which seems to have served as Beethoven\u2019s model. There was also some Mozart between the Haydn and Beethoven, the G minor symphony K550.

      "body": "<h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/24/filmawards.filmnews\" title=\"\">The Hours</a> (2002)</h2> \n<p>This was the performance that earned Nicole Kidman her Oscar for best actress \u2013 playing Virginia Woolf in an agonised spiritual state, somewhere between paralysis and a trance, grappling with the possibilities of fiction and her own depression. It is a good, if somewhat overrated performance, with Kidman playing to her queenly, statuesque qualities, but not quite tapping into the inner fire of her better performances. For some reason, she had to play the part with a silly prosthetic nose that made her look like Big Bird.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74374775ec37e3362f511a49109e632146ef2536\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74374775ec37e3362f511a49109e632146ef2536/0_0_3504_2329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kidman as Virginia Woolf in The Hours.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kidman as Virginia Woolf in The Hours.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/11/destroyer-review-nicole-kidman-transforms-for-bitter-noir-dirge\" title=\"\">Destroyer</a> (2018)</h2> \n<p>Opinions are divided on this most conspicuous of Kidman\u2019s castings-against-type (I prefer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/14/the-paperboy-review\" title=\"\">The Paperboy</a> in this vein), but she brings a tough, stolid, plausible presence to her uglied-up role as the undercover cop, physically and psychologically scarred by her experiences embedded in a robbery crew. Years after the events that brutalised her, she becomes convinced that she can finally take down the culprit; her bitterness and anguish are forcefully portrayed.</p> \n<h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/10/3\" title=\"\">Eyes Wide Shut</a> (1999)</h2> \n<p>Kidman had the distinction of working with Stanley Kubrick on his final film: hers is an intelligent and well-judged contribution to a minor, but interesting and overpoweringly atmospheric film, an adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler\u2019s 1926 novella Dream Story, updated to late-20th-century New York. Kidman plays the wife of Tom Cruise\u2019s sexually tortured high-society doctor and she is frank and open about sexuality in a way that he is not. It is she who will keep this film from sliding down the posterity rankings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c72cabc49628a78faeee6e0fa85a62fcb7e2444a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c72cabc49628a78faeee6e0fa85a62fcb7e2444a/0_0_2400_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Charlotte Bless in The Paperboy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Charlotte Bless in The Paperboy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Interfoto USA/Sipa/Allstar/Millennium Films</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/14/the-paperboy-review\" title=\"\">The Paperboy</a> (2012)</h2> \n<p>No film and no performance of Kidman\u2019s has been more misunderstood on first release. She was cast against type in this brash, uproarious Florida noir, giving a cracking performance as Charlotte Bless, the needy, dysfunctional peroxide blonde who starts up a pen-pal romance with a killer on death row. Kidman has some truly outrageous scenes, sending up her own image and getting stuck into every luridly horrible moment. Terrific stuff.</p> \n<h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/may/20/artsfeatures.londonfilmfestival2003\" title=\"\">Dogville</a> (2003)</h2> \n<p>Kidman\u2019s aura of sophisticated mystery and desire is perfect for this daring experiment in filmed theatre from master auteur/prankster Lars von Trier. She plays Grace, a woman apparently on the run from criminals, who is taken in by the uptight provincial folk of Dogville, Colorado, and becomes the focus of their obsessively repressed moralism and desire. Without Kidman, this would be nothing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a66fa5073815489f8842378725503f00ec18bf1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a66fa5073815489f8842378725503f00ec18bf1/0_0_3504_2332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kidman in Dead Calm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kidman in Dead Calm.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/02/dead-calm-rewatched-nicole-kidman-steals-the-show-in-high-seas-thriller\" title=\"\">Dead Calm</a> (1989)</h2> \n<p>Kidman had her breakthrough with this terrific suspense thriller that has something of Alfred Hitchcock and Roman Polanski. She and Sam Neill play a couple alone on a yacht, who encounter a disturbing young man (Billy Zane) who begs to come aboard. This is Kidman in her early, frizzy-haired incarnation, a more natural, earthy performance than any she has since been known for, but this is great stuff as her character, left all alone, has to outwit and outmanoeuvre the creepy stranger.</p> \n<h2>4. The Portrait of a Lady (1996)</h2> \n<p>This is Kidman in rarefied form. Director Jane Campion creates for her, or from her, a shimmering haze of mystery in this adaptation of Henry James\u2019s novel in which she plays the beautiful American Isabel Archer who finds herself attracted to John Malkovich\u2019s louche and cynical artist. For many, the exquisiteness of her appearance here makes it peak Kidman. She goes into her distinctive trance, which also mesmerises the audience.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0b9ce78b2a068fa26696d885bf8631e391f6e4f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0b9ce78b2a068fa26696d885bf8631e391f6e4f/0_0_1762_1217/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Presenting the weather in To Die For.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Presenting the weather in To Die For.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Columbia</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>3. To Die For (1995)</h2> \n<p>This was the key early role for Kidman, a barnstorming lead turn in which, interestingly, it was director Gus Van Sant who divined that her star quality lay not in ordinariness, but in something more fabricated and unearthly. She is the sinister and ruthless weather presenter on local cable TV who is desperate to become a star at all costs. Nowadays, she would be an Instagram influencer.</p> \n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,1343418,00.html\" title=\"\">Birth</a> (2004)</h2> \n<p>This is a film that grows with each rewatching and no one but Kidman could have carried it off with such dignity and flair. She plays Anna, a beautiful, wealthy Manhattan widow who is astonished when a 10-year-old boy walks into her life and announces he is the reincarnation of her dead husband. And he does this, citing details that only her late husband could possibly know. The single, extended shot of Kidman\u2019s stricken face as we and she realise that she now believes it, is incredible, and so is her scene with the boy when they discuss how they will marry, or remarry, in 10 or so years, when he comes of age.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d1cde998726f1f2f45803b040780568e354b18\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d1cde998726f1f2f45803b040780568e354b18/0_0_3000_2211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicole Kidman in The Others.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"737\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In The Others.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Miramax</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/nov/02/nicolekidman\" title=\"\">The Others</a> (2001)</h2> \n<p>This is the perfect Kidman film, a ghost story in the style of Henry James that, more than any other, elicits her almost spiritual aura of beauty and mystery with its occult trace of sexiness. In this movie, she is part Grace Kelly, part Deborah Kerr, with a touch of Kathleen Byron. (I should also say she was once cast as Grace Kelly in the terrible Grace of Monaco, which managed to misunderstand both Kelly and Kidman). Here, she plays the statuesque chatelaine of a grand but oppressively gloomy country house. Her husband has gone off to fight in the second world war, leaving her to deal with the children and what few servants they can afford. They are terrified by what appear to be ghosts. Kidman\u2019s beautiful face, lit by candlelight, seems in this film to have been painted by John Everett Millais. She has a sheen of tragedy, and a kind of eroticised but refined victimhood. This is classic Kidman.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "10. The Hours (2002) This was the performance that earned Nicole Kidman her Oscar for best actress \u2013 playing Virginia Woolf in an agonised spiritual state, somewhere between paralysis and a trance, grappling with the possibilities of fiction and her own depression. It is a good, if somewhat overrated performance, with Kidman playing to her queenly, statuesque qualities, but not quite tapping into the inner fire of her better performances. For some reason, she had to play the part with a silly prosthetic nose that made her look like Big Bird. 9. Destroyer (2018) Opinions are divided on this most conspicuous of Kidman\u2019s castings-against-type (I prefer The Paperboy in this vein), but she brings a tough, stolid, plausible presence to her uglied-up role as the undercover cop, physically and psychologically scarred by her experiences embedded in a robbery crew. Years after the events that brutalised her, she becomes convinced that she can finally take down the culprit; her bitterness and anguish are forcefully portrayed. 8. Eyes Wide Shut (1999) Kidman had the distinction of working with Stanley Kubrick on his final film: hers is an intelligent and well-judged contribution to a minor, but interesting and overpoweringly atmospheric film, an adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler\u2019s 1926 novella Dream Story, updated to late-20th-century New York. Kidman plays the wife of Tom Cruise\u2019s sexually tortured high-society doctor and she is frank and open about sexuality in a way that he is not. It is she who will keep this film from sliding down the posterity rankings. 7. The Paperboy (2012) No film and no performance of Kidman\u2019s has been more misunderstood on first release. She was cast against type in this brash, uproarious Florida noir, giving a cracking performance as Charlotte Bless, the needy, dysfunctional peroxide blonde who starts up a pen-pal romance with a killer on death row. Kidman has some truly outrageous scenes, sending up her own image and getting stuck into every luridly horrible moment. Terrific stuff. 6. Dogville (2003) Kidman\u2019s aura of sophisticated mystery and desire is perfect for this daring experiment in filmed theatre from master auteur/prankster Lars von Trier. She plays Grace, a woman apparently on the run from criminals, who is taken in by the uptight provincial folk of Dogville, Colorado, and becomes the focus of their obsessively repressed moralism and desire. Without Kidman, this would be nothing. 5. Dead Calm (1989) Kidman had her breakthrough with this terrific suspense thriller that has something of Alfred Hitchcock and Roman Polanski. She and Sam Neill play a couple alone on a yacht, who encounter a disturbing young man (Billy Zane) who begs to come aboard. This is Kidman in her early, frizzy-haired incarnation, a more natural, earthy performance than any she has since been known for, but this is great stuff as her character, left all alone, has to outwit and outmanoeuvre the creepy stranger. 4. The Portrait of a Lady (1996) This is Kidman in rarefied form. Director Jane Campion creates for her, or from her, a shimmering haze of mystery in this adaptation of Henry James\u2019s novel in which she plays the beautiful American Isabel Archer who finds herself attracted to John Malkovich\u2019s louche and cynical artist. For many, the exquisiteness of her appearance here makes it peak Kidman. She goes into her distinctive trance, which also mesmerises the audience. 3. To Die For (1995) This was the key early role for Kidman, a barnstorming lead turn in which, interestingly, it was director Gus Van Sant who divined that her star quality lay not in ordinariness, but in something more fabricated and unearthly. She is the sinister and ruthless weather presenter on local cable TV who is desperate to become a star at all costs. Nowadays, she would be an Instagram influencer. 2. Birth (2004) This is a film that grows with each rewatching and no one but Kidman could have carried it off with such dignity and flair. She plays Anna, a beautiful, wealthy Manhattan widow who is astonished when a 10-year-old boy walks into her life and announces he is the reincarnation of her dead husband. And he does this, citing details that only her late husband could possibly know. The single, extended shot of Kidman\u2019s stricken face as we and she realise that she now believes it, is incredible, and so is her scene with the boy when they discuss how they will marry, or remarry, in 10 or so years, when he comes of age. 1. The Others (2001) This is the perfect Kidman film, a ghost story in the style of Henry James that, more than any other, elicits her almost spiritual aura of beauty and mystery with its occult trace of sexiness. In this movie, she is part Grace Kelly, part Deborah Kerr, with a touch of Kathleen Byron. (I should also say she was once cast as Grace Kelly in the terrible Grace of Monaco, which managed to misunderstand both Kelly and Kidman). Here, she plays the statuesque chatelaine of a grand but oppressively gloomy country house. Her husband has gone off to fight in the second world war, leaving her to deal with the children and what few servants they can afford. They are terrified by what appear to be ghosts. Kidman\u2019s beautiful face, lit by candlelight, seems in this film to have been painted by John Everett Millais. She has a sheen of tragedy, and a kind of eroticised but refined victimhood. This is classic Kidman.",

Might need a few spare chains and brake blocks too.\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokesman for OS said it was up to Guinness World Records to adjudicate, but added: \u201cWe think this street in Wales has every chance of being the world\u2019s steepest street.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, the people of Dunedin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/10/worlds-steepest-street-welsh-town-challenges-new-zealand-for-guinness-world-record\">may not give in without a scrap</a>.</p> \n<p>Located in an otherwise quiet valley of the South Island city, Baldwin Street has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2015/apr/21/new-zealand-drift-trike-dunedin-baldwin-worlds-steepest-street-video\">attracted daredevils</a> and adventure sports enthusiasts, prompting the local council to upgrade infrastructure and residents to launch cottage industries selling food, drinks and souvenirs. </p> \n<p>On social media Dunedin\u2019s residents were contemplating a life without their treasured title. \u201cWe would have to change signage around the street and reprint a lot of brochures around town,\u201d wrote one person on Facebook. \u201cI have a great solution though: we just redo the signs and reprint the brochures with the title \u2018the world\u2019s first steepest street\u2019.

Helped by a small army of citizens, Myrddyn Phillips spent a tiring day trekking up and down Ffordd Pen Llech in Harlech, north-west Wales, to try to prove it was steeper than Baldwin Street in Dunedin. Dozens of measurements taken by Phillips, who has surveyed hundreds of hills and mountains, will be crunched by a mathematician and sent on to the local authority, Gwynedd council, to be verified.

Headley also argues that the Harlech street is more \u201corganic\u201d than Dunedin\u2019s, flanked by 300-year-old houses and an ancient route to the castle. \u201cI think we don\u2019t make enough of the town. If the street proves to be the steepest it could be a boost to the place,\u201d he said. The people of Harlech received a boost from Ordnance Survey, which has analysed the street from afar. Eddie Bulpitt, a developer and consultant on geospatial information systems at OS, said the road rose 60 metres over its 350-metre length. He said: \u201cThe steepest five-metre section of road is a crampon, belay, rappel-needing, roped-on 46.30%. That\u2019s steep.\u201d He continued: \u201cHowever, the steepest 10-metre section [the crucial distance for the world record] is 39.25%.\u201d Bulpitt added: \u201cSo, great test of the legs to cycle up and a test of nerves to keep braking to a minimum on the way down. Might need a few spare chains and brake blocks too.\u201d A spokesman for OS said it was up to Guinness World Records to adjudicate, but added: \u201cWe think this street in Wales has every chance of being the world\u2019s steepest street.\u201d However, the people of Dunedin may not give in without a scrap. Located in an otherwise quiet valley of the South Island city, Baldwin Street has attracted daredevils and adventure sports enthusiasts, prompting the local council to upgrade infrastructure and residents to launch cottage industries selling food, drinks and souvenirs. On social media Dunedin\u2019s residents were contemplating a life without their treasured title. \u201cWe would have to change signage around the street and reprint a lot of brochures around town,\u201d wrote one person on Facebook. \u201cI have a great solution though: we just redo the signs and reprint the brochures with the title \u2018the world\u2019s first steepest street\u2019. Tourists wouldn\u2019t know the difference.\u201d Another suggested Baldwin Street should reinvent itself as the world\u2019s steepest cycle lane, while another mooted idea was to resurface the top of the street to increase the gradient and retain the title. The mayor of Dunedin, Dave Cull, said the street had faced challenges before but had seen them off. \u201cIf Wales turns out to have a steeper one we will just have to arrange one of our periodic earthquakes and tilt Baldwin a bit more,\u201d he joked. It takes about 10 minutes to walk up the 350-metre-long Baldwin Street, but residents often do it in seven. \u201cI have angina and climbing 276 steps is cheaper than going to the gym,\u201d said Bindi Bezar, who operates a gift shop at the bottom of the street. The increasing popularity of the street has been a mixed blessing for residents, with some enjoying the novelty and others fed up with tourists going to the toilet in their gardens and peering into their houses. \u201cI think a lot of tourists don\u2019t know this is a real street, that people actually live here,\u201d said Beverley McClay. \u201cIt\u2019s very social, very busy. I often come out in my dressing gown to meet people, and the tourists like to watch me stacking wood, they ask me what I am doing.\u201d In the past two years Baldwin Street has also become a popular destination in an unusual social media trend: snapping pictures at odd angles that create the optical illusion of the houses being severely lopsided. The trend has significantly increased visitor numbers, especially during the winter season, when tourists used to avoid the area. Guinness World Records sets out a definition for the steepest street based on its maximum gradient over a 10-metre span, comparing the vertical rise to the horizontal distance. The street or road also must be a public thoroughfare that is commonly used by the public, who are able to drive vehicles across it.",

The move on Thursday by the Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine comes as calls grow for a relaxation of the rules. People seeking asylum in the UK are only allowed to work if they have been waiting on a claim for 12 months or more and can fill a role on the shortage occupation list, which includes positions such as classical ballet dancers and geophysicists. The Home Office aims to process all initial asylum claims within six months, but 48% go beyond that target. This means people have been essentially banned from working while they wait months, and often years, for a decision on their claim, living on the \u00a35.39 a day the government provides.

As Corbyn declared: \u201cA government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all.\u201d</p> <p>That used to mean a government fell and a prime minister resigned, with an election inevitable. No longer. Instead, here is a government with no majority, surviving only on bungs to a handful of unionist extremists who don\u2019t represent remain-voting Northern Ireland. Even then, it still loses vote after humiliating vote, with no intention of resigning in the honourable, old-fashioned way.

But it\u2019s unlikely any Tories will vote to bring themselves down, causing an immediate election. The Labour conference prescribed a sequence for what happens next, deciding to keep open <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/23/brexit-corbyn-under-pressure-from-all-sides-over-peoples-vote\" title=\"\">all options</a>, including a second referendum.</p> <p>But what if Corbyn got his wish? It is just possible: if the likes of Amber Rudd and Dominic Grieve think their own government is driving Britain headlong into a no-deal exit, they might pull the emergency brake and vote themselves down. But an election called now would cause both major parties near-terminal dilemmas in how to fight it. Labour might hope, and try, to make it about other issues, but this time there would be no ducking the question. On Thursday, Corbyn talked of a victorious Labour government reopening negotiations on better terms. That\u2019s what he must say this week, in the prescribed sequencing, but next week that will change.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election in a speech in Wakefield on Thursday morning. That\u2019s what oppositions do, so what\u2019s new? The government\u2019s essential, all-consuming, defining policy of our era is about to be voted down in parliament. The shadow of the loss of 5,000 Jaguar Land Rover jobs sharpens the immediacy of the nightmare \u2013 with Brexit said to be partly to blame. As Corbyn declared: \u201cA government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all.\u201d That used to mean a government fell and a prime minister resigned, with an election inevitable. No longer. Instead, here is a government with no majority, surviving only on bungs to a handful of unionist extremists who don\u2019t represent remain-voting Northern Ireland. Even then, it still loses vote after humiliating vote, with no intention of resigning in the honourable, old-fashioned way. If John Bercow \u2013 this morning called \u201cspeaker of the devil\u201d by the Sun \u2013 is stretching the rules, he is only responding to this extraordinary constitutional crisis. The spirit of his role is to stand up for parliament, as this majority-less government makes serial attempts to deny MPs any say. If, as expected, the PM\u2019s deal fails on 15 January, Labour will immediately call for a vote of no confidence in her government, as it should. But it\u2019s unlikely any Tories will vote to bring themselves down, causing an immediate election. The Labour conference prescribed a sequence for what happens next, deciding to keep open all options, including a second referendum. But what if Corbyn got his wish? It is just possible: if the likes of Amber Rudd and Dominic Grieve think their own government is driving Britain headlong into a no-deal exit, they might pull the emergency brake and vote themselves down. But an election called now would cause both major parties near-terminal dilemmas in how to fight it. Labour might hope, and try, to make it about other issues, but this time there would be no ducking the question. On Thursday, Corbyn talked of a victorious Labour government reopening negotiations on better terms. That\u2019s what he must say this week, in the prescribed sequencing, but next week that will change. It is entirely impossible that Labour, its members, its MPs and polling pressure from its voters could allow a campaign in favour of any kind of Brexit; but nor, many say, could it baldly call for remain. It would have to put a referendum into its manifesto, with the party supporting remain. There would be dissenters. But that would be nothing compared with the warfare that would break out over the Tory manifesto in an election now. The party would fragment in radically different directions: European Research Group v remainers, referendumites, Canadians and Norwegians. Besides, they would need a new leader fast, and their membership would choose a more divisive ardent Brexiteer. A chaotic general election might be catnip to political commentators, psephologists and constitutional academics, fuelling speculation that out of this mayhem new parties might be forged in a changed political landscape. Frankly, I see no significant change without proportional representation. Until then, iron electoral lore locks all change within the two and half parties we have, crushing newcomers. Voters will still have to hold their noses and vote for the portmanteau party they least dislike, far left and far right of each party obliged to cohabit unhappily.

It certainly did not attract the kind of controversy that such a delay might have warranted: \u201cManchester City believe in treating their players handsomely,\u201d the Athletic News glowingly reported. The family cannot have been too upset, because three months after Jones\u2019s death his nephew William, better known as Lot, signed for City, going on to play 301 games for them. It was many years before clubs were compelled to supply a trained medic for every match and they were in no hurry to immunise players even when a tetanus vaccine became available \u2013 Neil Phillips, England\u2019s team doctor, was astonished to find that many players were not protected before the 1970 World Cup. But in the months after Jones\u2019s injury, customers at one Manchester sports shop would have noticed a new range of cleansing ointments, produced by the shop\u2019s co-owner Billy Meredith: after the death of his great friend and former schoolmate the legendary Welsh forward decided footballers should probably learn how to clean their wounds themselves.",

Beautiful store, huge range of books, very welcoming and knowledgeable staff, a real community spirit developed through relationships and massively built through their amazing author talks held in local churches, halls and sometimes the cathedral. I LOVE this shop and don\u2019t know what Ely would be like without it. We\u2019ve considered moving away from Ely a couple of times \u2026 but I kid ye not when I say that the fact of Topping and Company has kept us there.<br><em>Ian, Ely</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://mrbsemporium.com/\">Mr B\u2019s Book Emporium of Reading Delights</a>, Bath</h2> <p>I visit Mr B\u2019s each time I go to Bath and find it to be the most soothing, relaxing space. The children\u2019s section as you go into the shop is really charming. Upstairs, they have created really tranquil spaces to browse and read in and the selection of titles they have is very comprehensive. The staff are incredibly friendly without being overbearing, and I have never felt pressured into purchasing anything - though I always do because their stock is so brilliant.<br><em>Daisy, London</em></p> <p>The staff are what make it. My boyfriend bought me a \u2018reading spa\u2019 for Christmas one year: two hours sitting by the fire talking to a knowledgeable member of staff about my literary tastes and his favourites. Two coffees, a slice of cake and about 25 book recommendations later I went home with seven hand-picked books and a list of what to look for next.<br><em>Liz, Bristol</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://thebookhousethame.co.uk/\">The Book House</a>, Thame</h2> <p>This shop is part of my life. I remember visiting all the time as a small child and loving the fact that the chairs were small, the tables low and you could read the books in the children\u2019s section whilst your parent/s were in the rest of the shop. Then as I grew up, I continued to purchase books as the team were so good at recommendations and would order in specific books. I now live away from the area but every time I go home, I pay a visit to the Book House for old times\u2019 sake.

It sells new and secondhand books on three floors, well-ordered, always open, friendly staff, and whole rooms dedicated to music and to children. And it has the best cafe (even better than Barter Books in Northumberland!) hidden behind a moving bookcase serving generous portions and lashings of tea all day long, where you can sit and ponder how to whittle down the 10 books you\u2019ve found to a manageable five.<br><em>Michael, south London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddf1cfec5be1ebdc4123b93f6a2b0ad9b90b318f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddf1cfec5be1ebdc4123b93f6a2b0ad9b90b318f/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carrie and Tim Morris, inside their bookshop Booka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim and Carrie Morris, inside their bookshop Booka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/JON SUPER</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.bookabookshop.co.uk/about/\">Booka</a>, Oswestry</h2> <p>Booka is my happy place. The shop is light, bright and airy and the books are always beautifully displayed. I can browse for hours in there and I always find something unusual - the shop runs a lot of different book clubs and events so there\u2019s always an eclectic selection of titles and genres, as opposed to just the usual big hitters. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and their author events are fantastic - I\u2019ve been to see Jodi Picoult, Matt Haig, Imogen Hermes Gower, and Eowyn Ivey and they\u2019ve all been fabulous, insightful evenings. Plus there\u2019s a lovely cafe with locally made cakes, and the shop sells some really unusual gifts and cards too - so it\u2019s perfect for choosing presents!<br><em>Amy, Staffordshire</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://fiveleavesbookshop.co.uk/\">Five Leaves</a>, Nottingham</h2> <p>It\u2019s hidden away down an alley just 30 seconds from the city hall but absolutely worth seeking out. Five Leaves has a marvellous selection of radical and broadly less commercial books and poetry. It\u2019s a work of love, and arouses strong loyalty among the shop\u2019s customers.<br><em>Andrew, London</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.itsinnottingham.com/directory/books-and-pieces\">Books &amp; Pieces</a>, Nottingham</h2> <p>The lady who runs the shop is deliciously sarcastic and caustic.

While much of the rest of the independent (socialist and progressive) bookshop network has disappeared, the imagination and enthusiasm of the shop has been inspirational. Long may they prosper, long may they continue to persuade me to spend too much money!<br><em>Richard, Exeter</em></p> <p>I found it by accident many years ago while looking for some lunch near the British Museum.

They have a small but amazing range of titles which they have often read themselves and there are always unusual books on display. The shop has shareholders from the community and, although it is tiny, lots of community events are held there. There is also a tiny cafe in it, which has amazing homemade cake and coffee - a great place to meet friends and talk books.

It\u2019s a treasury of joy and wonders!<br><em>Anonymous, Penzance</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.octoberbooks.org/\">October Books</a>, Southhampton</h2> <p>October Books is a bookshop with values. As well as mainstream books, it promotes books that give voice to marginalised groups and causes, and also sells fair trade and sustainable food and household products. It holds events to promote and discuss certain books, raising the profile and encouraging people to come together and discuss issues. It\u2019s run as a cooperative, and has weathered the storm of capitalism for decades, sticking to values of equality and justice. It is firmly supported by local people, shown when OB was supported in buying premises when rents got too high - this faith in the local community is typical of OB.<br><em>Jacquie, Southhampton</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"295c41fc79935dd4fbd332a44d1a59dca56215e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/295c41fc79935dd4fbd332a44d1a59dca56215e0/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Politics and Prose in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Politics and Prose in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.politics-prose.com/\">Politics and Prose</a>, Washington DC</h2> <p>It\u2019s the beating heart of liberal America - as metaphorically as far from Trump as you can get.

It used to be a majestic cinema; I saw movies as a teenager there back in the eighties \u2026 Long since it has become a magnificent bookshop. You can find all kinds of books and music there. Buenos Aires would still be the pride of Borges: so full of beautiful little bookstores, many of which, like a speakeasy, you need to be taken to by a friend.

There is a well-stocked selection of Irish authors, books \u2018as gaeilge\u2019 and a foreign languages section.

I LOVE this shop and don\u2019t know what Ely would be like without it. We\u2019ve considered moving away from Ely a couple of times \u2026 but I kid ye not when I say that the fact of Topping and Company has kept us there. Ian, Ely Mr B\u2019s Book Emporium of Reading Delights, Bath I visit Mr B\u2019s each time I go to Bath and find it to be the most soothing, relaxing space. The children\u2019s section as you go into the shop is really charming. Upstairs, they have created really tranquil spaces to browse and read in and the selection of titles they have is very comprehensive. The staff are incredibly friendly without being overbearing, and I have never felt pressured into purchasing anything - though I always do because their stock is so brilliant. Daisy, London The staff are what make it. My boyfriend bought me a \u2018reading spa\u2019 for Christmas one year: two hours sitting by the fire talking to a knowledgeable member of staff about my literary tastes and his favourites. Two coffees, a slice of cake and about 25 book recommendations later I went home with seven hand-picked books and a list of what to look for next. Liz, Bristol The Book House, Thame This shop is part of my life. I remember visiting all the time as a small child and loving the fact that the chairs were small, the tables low and you could read the books in the children\u2019s section whilst your parent/s were in the rest of the shop. Then as I grew up, I continued to purchase books as the team were so good at recommendations and would order in specific books. I now live away from the area but every time I go home, I pay a visit to the Book House for old times\u2019 sake. This shop is integral to the town and does so much for the community. Anonymous, Teddington Word on the Water, Kings Cross, London Moored on the canal, this lovely shop plays jazz and has a seating area by the water. It\u2019s quirky, friendly and had to fight very hard to not be driven off the waterways by local authorities and the Canal and River Trust. I remember finding the exact title I was looking for while watching a couple dance to jazz music in the sunshine with a swan attempting to join in (or maybe just bite them; it wasn\u2019t clear!) Cassi, Banbury Scarthin Books, Cromford It always helps draw us towards Derbyshire: after a morning on the hills (or if it\u2019s raining) this is the perfect bookshop. It sells new and secondhand books on three floors, well-ordered, always open, friendly staff, and whole rooms dedicated to music and to children. And it has the best cafe (even better than Barter Books in Northumberland!) hidden behind a moving bookcase serving generous portions and lashings of tea all day long, where you can sit and ponder how to whittle down the 10 books you\u2019ve found to a manageable five. Michael, south London Booka, Oswestry Booka is my happy place. The shop is light, bright and airy and the books are always beautifully displayed. I can browse for hours in there and I always find something unusual - the shop runs a lot of different book clubs and events so there\u2019s always an eclectic selection of titles and genres, as opposed to just the usual big hitters. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and their author events are fantastic - I\u2019ve been to see Jodi Picoult, Matt Haig, Imogen Hermes Gower, and Eowyn Ivey and they\u2019ve all been fabulous, insightful evenings. Plus there\u2019s a lovely cafe with locally made cakes, and the shop sells some really unusual gifts and cards too - so it\u2019s perfect for choosing presents! Amy, Staffordshire Five Leaves, Nottingham It\u2019s hidden away down an alley just 30 seconds from the city hall but absolutely worth seeking out. Five Leaves has a marvellous selection of radical and broadly less commercial books and poetry. It\u2019s a work of love, and arouses strong loyalty among the shop\u2019s customers. Andrew, London Books &amp; Pieces, Nottingham The lady who runs the shop is deliciously sarcastic and caustic. Like a real-life female version of Bernard Black. The shop is full of charm, with books piled high across a table in the middle as well as bookshelves from floor to ceiling brimming with them too. Anonymous, Derbyshire Bookmarks, Bloomsbury, London Bookmarks has been my go-to bookshop for history, political theory and politics for the last 40 years. While much of the rest of the independent (socialist and progressive) bookshop network has disappeared, the imagination and enthusiasm of the shop has been inspirational. Long may they prosper, long may they continue to persuade me to spend too much money! Richard, Exeter I found it by accident many years ago while looking for some lunch near the British Museum. I spent over an hour in there and bought several books, and completely forgot about lunch. David, Hereford Malvern Book Co-operative, Malvern It was set up when the town\u2019s last independent bookshop closed and is staffed by a team of people who really love books. They have a small but amazing range of titles which they have often read themselves and there are always unusual books on display. The shop has shareholders from the community and, although it is tiny, lots of community events are held there. There is also a tiny cafe in it, which has amazing homemade cake and coffee - a great place to meet friends and talk books. It has a great vibe \u2013 you don\u2019t get that with online shopping! Karen, Malvern The Edge of the World Bookshop, Penzance The very fact that it exists and flourishes and has even expanded in past few years shows how much support and love there is locally for independent bookshops \u2026 The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and set out great displays. Books are easy to order and they also have gorgeous stationery. It\u2019s a treasury of joy and wonders! Anonymous, Penzance October Books, Southhampton October Books is a bookshop with values. As well as mainstream books, it promotes books that give voice to marginalised groups and causes, and also sells fair trade and sustainable food and household products. It holds events to promote and discuss certain books, raising the profile and encouraging people to come together and discuss issues. It\u2019s run as a cooperative, and has weathered the storm of capitalism for decades, sticking to values of equality and justice. It is firmly supported by local people, shown when OB was supported in buying premises when rents got too high - this faith in the local community is typical of OB. Jacquie, Southhampton Politics and Prose, Washington DC It\u2019s the beating heart of liberal America - as metaphorically as far from Trump as you can get. It has a great range of subjects chosen by excellent subject experts (including their music section), it has a great speaker program and the cafe serves a delicious lemon drizzle cake. Nigel, Washington Page Two Books, Melbourne A beautiful treasure trove of secondhand, new and rare books in the heart of Fitzroy. The owner is incredibly knowledgeable about books and will always recommend something that is perfect going on your recent or favourite reads. And there is the most incredible fashion room at the back of the shop - full of rare and beautiful fashion editions - a must for any fashion / luxury lover! Anna, Melbourne El Ateneo, Gran Splendid, Buenos Aires This splendorous bookshop is located in a central area of Buenos Aires. It used to be a majestic cinema; I saw movies as a teenager there back in the eighties \u2026 Long since it has become a magnificent bookshop. You can find all kinds of books and music there. Buenos Aires would still be the pride of Borges: so full of beautiful little bookstores, many of which, like a speakeasy, you need to be taken to by a friend. You might have walked past a thousand times without realising on the outside, the oasis within. There won\u2019t be a sign or window, just an ordinary door and a bell. Helen, Buenos Aires Shakespeare and Company, Paris It\u2019s exactly what the perfect bookshop should be like. A vast selection of brilliant books; sections on just about every topic you can think of; the occasional chair you can relax in and read; a magical \u201cnon linear\u201d structure; and the following message on the stairs: \u2018I wish I could show you when you are lonely or in darkness the astonishing light of your own being\u2019. Symon, Hertfordshire Chapters, Dublin There is a formidable selection of new books on the ground floor, while the first floor is dedicated to secondhand and remaindered books. It is extremely well-organised and books are very reasonably priced. There are plenty of first editions and old paperbacks. There is a well-stocked selection of Irish authors, books \u2018as gaeilge\u2019 and a foreign languages section. There is no caf\u00e9, so the experience is really all about the browsing and buying. Alan, Dublin Clarke\u2019s Bookshop, Cape Town It\u2019s small, but not too small, big enough to contain a surprising number of books that I\u2019ve never come across before - especially books about South Africa. The staff are few but knowledgeable and do not hassle. Sometimes you will encounter friends there but also quite curious strangers!

      "bodyText": "The Egyptian government is calling for access to the certification documents for all Egyptian antiquities displayed at the National Museum of Scotland, following a row over plans by the museum to display a casing stone from the Great Pyramid of Giza next month. Shaaban Abdel Gawad, the head of the repatriation department at Egypt\u2019s ministry of antiquities, told the Guardian: \u201cIf we find that anything left Egypt illegally, we work to repatriate it back to Egypt, as is our right.\u201d Authorities in Cairo first raised objections after reading reports last week that the Edinburgh museum planned to exhibit the casing stone as part of a new permanent gallery called Ancient Egypt Rediscovered. The National Museum says its curators are confident that they have legal title to the stone, which was removed from Egypt by an engineer working for Scotland\u2019s astronomer royal in 1872. But Abdel Gawad said his ministry was pressing to gain access to the artefact\u2019s ownership and export documents, along with Egypt\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs. He added that if a lack of documents proves that the pyramid stone was illegally smuggled out of Egypt, \u201call necessary measures\u201d would be taken to recover them. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for them to send the documentation to us. After we get this, we can discuss next steps,\u201d said Abdel Gawad, who expects to have the paperwork within the next week. \u201cWe can\u2019t say if anything is illegal or legal until we see the documentation they have. Every documentation process is different, and every case is different,\u201d he added. A spokesperson for National Museums Scotland confirmed: \u201cWe have received a communication from the embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt and we are currently in correspondence with them.\u201d Egyptian law number 117 of 1983 bans the trade or export of antiquities, including those removed from Egypt prior to the law being in place. The outspoken former Egyptian antiquities minister Zahi Hawass called the Edinburgh exhibition \u201cdisgraceful\u201d during a TV interview. He dismissed the museum as exhibiting \u201cstones thrown everywhere\u201d, using the exhibit as \u201ccheap propaganda for the museum\u201d, with \u201cno truth at all\u201d. A spokesperson for the museum said: \u201cAfter reviewing all the documentary evidence we hold, we are confident that we have legal title to the stone and the appropriate permissions and documentation were obtained in line with common practice at the time.\u201d However, it refused to offer more detail on what that documentation consisted of. According to museum officials, the large block of fine white limestone is one of the few surviving casing stones from the Great Pyramid and will be the only one to be displayed anywhere in the world outside of Egypt. The casing stone was discovered in 1872 by a British engineer called Waynman Dixon, who was working on behalf of the astronomer royal of Scotland, Charles Piazzi Smyth. Alongside his geologist wife, Jessie, Piazzi Smyth conducted the first largely accurate survey of the Great Pyramid seven years earlier, for which he is said to have gained the official permission of the viceroy of Egypt and the assistance of the Egyptian Antiquities Service. Dixon reportedly uncovered the casing stone in a rubble heap following road building works, and transported it back to Scotland, where Piazzi Smyth originally displayed the block in their Edinburgh home. Clad in white, polished limestone, the Great Pyramid of Giza was built for King Khufu and dates back to c2589\u20132566 BC. It is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex. Few of the casing stones survive on the Great Pyramid itself after a huge earthquake in 1303 AD loosened many of them, which were then taken to be used in buildings elsewhere in the area.",

Out here in the trenches we\u2019ll continue doing what we\u2019re doing without having to worry about any significant legislation that could disrupt our plans over the next few years. This is shaping up to be the best Congress ever. My dad would love it.",

There are simple descriptors of the themes in each song: genuinely illuminating when dealing with a writer such as Cox, whose lyrics are famously made up on the spot, stream-of-consciousness style. But most telling of all might be the press release trumpeting the arrival of Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared? to the world, unmistakably also Cox\u2019s handiwork.

      "body": "<p>The quickest way to describe Yelena Moskovich\u2019s novels is to say that her books are like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/17/david-lynch-film-director-dreams\" title=\"\">David Lynch films</a>. This, at least, is the comparison reviewers resort to most frequently to convey her surreal and lyrical style. It\u2019s true that Moskovich writes sentences that lilt and slink, her plots developing as a slow seduction and then clouding like a smoke-filled room. Her latest novel, <em>Virtuoso</em>, is an arrestingly self-assured follow-up to her 2016 debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/14/the-natashas-yelena-moskovich-review-debut-novel\" title=\"\"><em>The Natashas</em></a>. It is similarly concerned with sexuality and violence, told in an off-kilter idiom, written by someone with a distinct taste for the weird.</p> <p>And \u201cweird\u201d is, perhaps, the simplest way to put it. Moskovich wears her weirdness with an indifferent dignity: <em>Virtuoso</em> is nonchalantly cool, heedlessly independent and puzzlingly askew. It\u2019s also hard to resist. You may like it \u2013 as I emphatically did \u2013 and yet find yourself hard pressed to say exactly why. If you don\u2019t care for it, you might find that its oddness stays with you nonetheless, like the residue of a headache-inducing perfume. Whichever the case, <em>Virtuoso</em> lingers.</p> <p>The novel opens with a naked woman lying lifeless in a hotel room. This is Dominique, we\u2019ll learn later. She is French, an actor, only moderately successful; she has been struggling with depression. We don\u2019t quite \u201cmeet\u201d her in this opening sequence, not only because she\u2019s dead, but because Moskovich\u2019s narrative begins as a camera, dispassionately close up to the corpse.</p> <p>When the lens pans out, we see Dominique\u2019s wife returning to their suite. She sets down a bag of lemons, finds the body and tries to revive it. This is Aim\u00e9e: younger, a medical secretary, in love with Dominique but incapable, it turns out, of saving her.</p> <p>Filmic, here, is the right word and yet still not enough. It\u2019s a dramatic scene but it\u2019s Moskovich\u2019s turn of phrase, often unexpected and poetically cryptic, that makes us see it. The back of Dominique\u2019s knee is \u201ca gasp\u201d, the phone fallen from its cradle is \u201cbeeping hysterics\u201d, while Aim\u00e9e\u2019s hands \u201cclam at the sternum\u201d. She is \u201cscavenging the body for breath\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019d be right to detect a hint of Lynch\u2019s Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, and there\u2019s a touch of Elena Ferrante, too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From here, the novel both flashes back to the beginning of their relationship and proceeds forward, growing ever more surreal. Aim\u00e9e begins to suspect that she is being haunted by a mysterious blue vapour. Other characters and subplots emerge: an eerie online relationship between an American teenager and an eastern European housewife conducted via a lesbian chat room, and a friendship between two Czech girls, Jana and Zorka, growing up in the communist Prague of the 1980s. Moskovich pulls this off with some skill, moving confidently between timeframes and narrators.</p> <p>Women \u2013 their friendships that can be formative and erotically charged, their desires that can feel unspeakable and intense \u2013 are clearly Moskovich\u2019s focus. She is especially alert to how visceral and disconnected the experience of a body can be. Images of spit, sweat, urine, bruises and welts surface repeatedly. Jana\u2019s armpits are damp when we first meet her; six-year-old Zorka has a \u201cstreak of violet blue\u201d under a swollen eye. She picks her nose and collects her saliva in a cup under the bed. Aim\u00e9e, in shock at the hospital, finds her chair filling \u201cwith a wet heat\u201d. The female body is unruly, difficult to keep in check: desire is like that, too. When a teenage Aim\u00e9e develops a crush on a girl called C\u00e9line dancing in a lesbian nightclub, she stares at her desperately, filled with both vicious hatred and hopeless lust: \u201cC\u00e9line, her eyes of green venom glowing in the spotlight, smoke crawling out of her red mouth\u201d.</p> <p>So you\u2019d be right to detect a hint of Lynch\u2019s <em>Blue Velvet</em> and <em>Mulholland Drive</em>, but there are other, equally potent influences as well.

It only had to \u201censure full and effective de-referencing within the EU\u201d.</p> <p>The UK-based free speech organisation Article 19 led an intervention by eight non-governmental organisations, which warned of the potential harm to internet users\u2019 rights to access information if Google lost the case.</p> <p>The ECJ established the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d in a landmark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/13/right-to-be-forgotten-eu-court-google-search-results\">2014 ruling</a> relating to a Spanish citizen\u2019s claim against material about him found on Google searches.<em> </em>It allows European citizens to ask search engines to remove links to \u201cinadequate, irrelevant or \u2026 excessive\u201d content.</p> <p>Google has been inundated with millions of requests since then to remove material from online searches. ECJ rulings are binding in the UK.</p> <p>Thomas Hughes, the executive director of Article 19, said: \u201cWe welcome Advocate General Szpunar\u2019s opinion that the CJEU should place limits on the scope of de-referencing carried out by search engines.</p> <p>\u201cEuropean data regulators should not be able to determine the search results that internet users around the world get to see.

The court must limit the scope of the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 in order to protect global freedom of expression and prevent Europe from setting a precedent for censorship that could be exploited by other countries.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Cumbley, a solicitor at the London law firm Linklaters,<strong> </strong>said: \u201cThis is a really important case pitting fundamental rights to privacy against freedom of expression. The case highlights the continuing conflict between national laws and the internet, which does not respect national boundaries.</p> <p>\u201cThe opinion contains a clear recommendation that the right to remove search results from Google should not have global effect. There are a number of good reasons for this, including the risk other states would also try and suppress search results on a global basis. This would seriously affect people\u2019s right to access information.</p> <p>\u201cThe court of justice is not required to follow this opinion, but it seems very likely they will in this case.\u201d </p>",

The UK-based free speech organisation Article 19 led an intervention by eight non-governmental organisations, which warned of the potential harm to internet users\u2019 rights to access information if Google lost the case. The ECJ established the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d in a landmark 2014 ruling relating to a Spanish citizen\u2019s claim against material about him found on Google searches. It allows European citizens to ask search engines to remove links to \u201cinadequate, irrelevant or \u2026 excessive\u201d content. Google has been inundated with millions of requests since then to remove material from online searches. ECJ rulings are binding in the UK. Thomas Hughes, the executive director of Article 19, said: \u201cWe welcome Advocate General Szpunar\u2019s opinion that the CJEU should place limits on the scope of de-referencing carried out by search engines. \u201cEuropean data regulators should not be able to determine the search results that internet users around the world get to see. They should only be able to de-list websites within their country\u2019s jurisdiction, and should balance the rights of both privacy and free speech when making that decision. \u201cWe hope that the CJEU will follow Szpunar\u2019s opinion when it issues its judgment in this case later this year. The court must limit the scope of the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 in order to protect global freedom of expression and prevent Europe from setting a precedent for censorship that could be exploited by other countries.\u201d Richard Cumbley, a solicitor at the London law firm Linklaters, said: \u201cThis is a really important case pitting fundamental rights to privacy against freedom of expression. The case highlights the continuing conflict between national laws and the internet, which does not respect national boundaries. \u201cThe opinion contains a clear recommendation that the right to remove search results from Google should not have global effect. There are a number of good reasons for this, including the risk other states would also try and suppress search results on a global basis. This would seriously affect people\u2019s right to access information. \u201cThe court of justice is not required to follow this opinion, but it seems very likely they will in this case.\u201d",

In 1993, Jackson was accused of sexually molesting 13-year-old Jordan Chandler \u2013 he denied the claims, and later settled out of court for $23m. In 2005, a jury found Jackson not guilty of molesting Gavin Arvizo and related charges. Arvizo was aged 13 at the time of the alleged offence. In 2013 and 2014, after Jackson\u2019s death in 2009, two further lawsuits were filed by Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who each alleged that Jackson had abused them in the early 1990s when they were children. Both cases were dismissed for being filed too long after the alleged incidents.",

      "body": "<p>Jim Bachor makes street art \u2013 quite literally.</p> <p>For the last few years the 52-year-old has been making art out of the blight on our roads.</p> <p>Inspired to make mosiacs after a trip to Italy in the late 90s, Bachor has become \u201cthe pothole guy\u201d, decorating holes in streets with colourful designs ranging from chickens to Aretha Franklin\u2019s face.</p> <p>He made his first pothole mosaic in 2013, just outside his home in Chicago. \u201cThe potholes in our street were particularly bad,\u201d he says. \u201cI put two and two together. I had this unsolvable problem outside of our house, and 100 yards away in my studio I have this passion for an art form that is so durable.\u201d</p> <p>Wearing a high-vis jacket and armed with traffic cones, Bachor has so far created 79 installations around the world including in New York and Helsinki. He creates the mosaics in his studio, fixing the artwork on a cheesecloth. Bachor then prepares the concrete on site and carefully sets the mosaic in the road. It takes about two hours, and he\u2019s back the next day when the concrete is set to scrub off the excess.</p> <p>His requirements are specific \u2013 he even sent a pothole scout out in New York to find the right ones. The pothole can\u2019t be in the centre of the street, it needs to be a road in a relatively good condition, and it must be a rough size of 18 to 24 inches, and a couple of inches deep.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t know the legalities of filling in potholes without permission, and his New York installations were <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/454876/jim-bachor-nyc-pothole-mosaic/\">removed by the city\u2019s transport department</a>.<br><br>His work seems to cause less trouble in his hometown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/dec/31/city-life-in-miniature-the-tiny-cement-sculptures-hidden-across-europe\">City life in miniature: the tiny cement sculptures hidden across Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere was one time on south side of Chicago.

      "bodyText": "Jim Bachor makes street art \u2013 quite literally. For the last few years the 52-year-old has been making art out of the blight on our roads. Inspired to make mosiacs after a trip to Italy in the late 90s, Bachor has become \u201cthe pothole guy\u201d, decorating holes in streets with colourful designs ranging from chickens to Aretha Franklin\u2019s face. He made his first pothole mosaic in 2013, just outside his home in Chicago. \u201cThe potholes in our street were particularly bad,\u201d he says. \u201cI put two and two together. I had this unsolvable problem outside of our house, and 100 yards away in my studio I have this passion for an art form that is so durable.\u201d Wearing a high-vis jacket and armed with traffic cones, Bachor has so far created 79 installations around the world including in New York and Helsinki. He creates the mosaics in his studio, fixing the artwork on a cheesecloth. Bachor then prepares the concrete on site and carefully sets the mosaic in the road. It takes about two hours, and he\u2019s back the next day when the concrete is set to scrub off the excess. His requirements are specific \u2013 he even sent a pothole scout out in New York to find the right ones. The pothole can\u2019t be in the centre of the street, it needs to be a road in a relatively good condition, and it must be a rough size of 18 to 24 inches, and a couple of inches deep. He doesn\u2019t know the legalities of filling in potholes without permission, and his New York installations were removed by the city\u2019s transport department. His work seems to cause less trouble in his hometown. \u201cThere was one time on south side of Chicago. This cop gets out and walks up to me and says, \u2018Are you that pothole guy?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018That is so fucking cool.\u2019\u201d Find more of Jim Bachor\u2019s art on his website.

The 48-year-old single mother says it took years before she was able to gain access to affordable housing in 2015 under the Section 811 program for people with disabilities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/08/us-government-shutdown-2019-explained\">How bad is the US government shutdown and can it be resolved?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since then, Trail has lived in a two-bedroom apartment in Stafford, Virginia, with her nine-year-old daughter.</p> <p>But now she is worried she will lose her home thanks to the government shutdown triggered by a fight over funding for a wall on the Mexican border.</p> <p>With the partial shutdown nearing three weeks, federal agencies such as the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud) have furloughed the majority of their staff. This shutdown is now the second-longest in US history and NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/because-shutdown-more-1-000-affordable-housing-contracts-have-expired-n955971\">reported</a> that more than 1,000 federal contracts with private landlords providing housing have expired in those weeks.</p> <p>When that news broke, Trail panicked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the new US morning briefing\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4300\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"A different kind of daily email\" data-form-description=\"Sign up and get a daily US news briefing from the Guardian\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks, you'll start getting the US morning briefing soon.\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the new US morning briefing</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI called my rental office this morning and they haven\u2019t heard anything. I called Senator [Tim] Kaine\u2019s office in [Washington] DC and Richmond but unfortunately most of the calls I\u2019ve made, the voicemails are full or the phone systems are down because of the mass influx of calls, so this causes a lot of stress,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Right now, through various social services, Trail has a monthly income of just over $1,000. Some of that goes to her son in Richmond, $200 is spent on groceries for her small family while another $250 goes towards rent and utilities. Average rent in the area for her apartment is at least $1,300, she estimates, higher than her monthly income. Not much is left over, she says, so if she\u2019s kicked out of her Hud-subsidized housing, she\u2019ll be homeless because she can\u2019t afford a motel.</p> <p>Because of her disabilities, ranging from fibromyalgia and PTSD to neuropathy, she can\u2019t work. </p> <p>\u201cThis is very triggering,\u201d she began, referring to a <a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/huds-jan-4-letter-to-multi-family-housing-program-landlords/3371/\">letter,</a> first published by the Washington Post, sent to landlords by Hud officials asking them not to evict tenants after they realized funding for multi-family programs were not renewed before the government closed at the end of December.</p> <p>\u201cAt one time I was homeless,\u201d she said. Before she had her daughter, she spent nearly 15 years sleeping in motel rooms and on couches. And before that, she spent her childhood in foster care.</p> <p>Trail doesn\u2019t want her daughter to experience even one night in a motel room, explaining why the potential of losing her affordable housing hit her especially hard. \u201cThis puts single mothers into a position where they\u2019re very vulnerable,\u201d she continued, her voice rising. \u201cA lot of us are being held emotionally hostage.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/05/how-the-government-shutdown-affects-museums\">How the government shutdown affects museums</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to a statement posted on the National Low Income Housing Coalition\u2019s website, Hud has been in contact with the organization, <a href=\"https://nlihc.org/article/government-shutdown-now-third-week-impacts-housing-programs-and-tenants\">stating</a> \u201cthat while resources for project-based assistance are sufficient for January, funding becomes more uncertain if the shutdown lasts beyond this month\u201d.</p> <p>Diane Yentel, the NLIHC president and CEO, told the Guardian that the shutdown was a threat to America\u2019s most vulnerable people.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority are deeply poor seniors, people with disabilities and families with children. Already, as a result of the shutdown, Hud cannot cover the costs for subsidized homes housing an estimated 70,000 low-income seniors and people with disabilities. Owners of these properties are being asked to cover the costs in the meantime, but the longer the shutdown continues the less likely they will be able to do so,\u201d she said in a statement.</p> <p>The Guardian contacted Hud by telephone and email and received no response.</p> <p>Some landlords are saying they will step into the gap. Heather Goff, whose family owns approximately 200 Hud housing units in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, told the Guardian no one will be evicted from any of their properties. Their reasoning is threefold: first, her grandparents acquired the properties in the mid-70s so most are owned outright. Second, she says, their properties are Section 8 housing, meaning the tenants pay 30%, Section 8 vouchers pick up a large chunk and Hud pays for whatever is left over.</p> <p>Finally, if someone isn\u2019t able to cover rent, the Goff family pays because \u201csome of our tenants we\u2019ve had for decades and are really a part of our extended family\u201d, she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe will do what it takes to keep our [people] housed,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But not all low-income tenants are as secure as Goff\u2019s. Many are speaking out on social media weeks after the viral hashtag #shutdownstories was used to inform the public of the real-world impact of a long-term government shutdown affecting more than 800,000 employees.</p> <p>Twitter user Suzn worried about her elderly mother in public housing, lamenting: \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about my 93-[year-old] mother. She lives in HUD approved housing for seniors. She submitted all paperwork to recertify as low income. HUD shut down &amp; can\u2019t do whatever is needed to mediate with landlord. Will she be a casualty of shutdown? Too close to home.\u201d</p> <p>In Ogden, Utah, a disabled woman in Hud housing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeannieRobinett/status/1082698461294747648\">posted</a>: \u201cI\u2019m disabled, on housing, unable to work. Mr. President where will I go? Do you care? Is there a room in one of your places where I can live for free? Will I stay warm? Will I be safe?

      "bodyText": "Desiree Trail was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2001 after surviving a multiple sexual assaults, getting clean after a drug addiction and weaving in and out of homelessness. The 48-year-old single mother says it took years before she was able to gain access to affordable housing in 2015 under the Section 811 program for people with disabilities. Since then, Trail has lived in a two-bedroom apartment in Stafford, Virginia, with her nine-year-old daughter. But now she is worried she will lose her home thanks to the government shutdown triggered by a fight over funding for a wall on the Mexican border. With the partial shutdown nearing three weeks, federal agencies such as the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud) have furloughed the majority of their staff. This shutdown is now the second-longest in US history and NBC News reported that more than 1,000 federal contracts with private landlords providing housing have expired in those weeks. When that news broke, Trail panicked. \u201cI called my rental office this morning and they haven\u2019t heard anything. I called Senator [Tim] Kaine\u2019s office in [Washington] DC and Richmond but unfortunately most of the calls I\u2019ve made, the voicemails are full or the phone systems are down because of the mass influx of calls, so this causes a lot of stress,\u201d she said. Right now, through various social services, Trail has a monthly income of just over $1,000. Some of that goes to her son in Richmond, $200 is spent on groceries for her small family while another $250 goes towards rent and utilities. Average rent in the area for her apartment is at least $1,300, she estimates, higher than her monthly income. Not much is left over, she says, so if she\u2019s kicked out of her Hud-subsidized housing, she\u2019ll be homeless because she can\u2019t afford a motel. Because of her disabilities, ranging from fibromyalgia and PTSD to neuropathy, she can\u2019t work. \u201cThis is very triggering,\u201d she began, referring to a letter, first published by the Washington Post, sent to landlords by Hud officials asking them not to evict tenants after they realized funding for multi-family programs were not renewed before the government closed at the end of December. \u201cAt one time I was homeless,\u201d she said. Before she had her daughter, she spent nearly 15 years sleeping in motel rooms and on couches. And before that, she spent her childhood in foster care. Trail doesn\u2019t want her daughter to experience even one night in a motel room, explaining why the potential of losing her affordable housing hit her especially hard. \u201cThis puts single mothers into a position where they\u2019re very vulnerable,\u201d she continued, her voice rising. \u201cA lot of us are being held emotionally hostage.\u201d According to a statement posted on the National Low Income Housing Coalition\u2019s website, Hud has been in contact with the organization, stating \u201cthat while resources for project-based assistance are sufficient for January, funding becomes more uncertain if the shutdown lasts beyond this month\u201d. Diane Yentel, the NLIHC president and CEO, told the Guardian that the shutdown was a threat to America\u2019s most vulnerable people. \u201cThe vast majority are deeply poor seniors, people with disabilities and families with children. Already, as a result of the shutdown, Hud cannot cover the costs for subsidized homes housing an estimated 70,000 low-income seniors and people with disabilities. Owners of these properties are being asked to cover the costs in the meantime, but the longer the shutdown continues the less likely they will be able to do so,\u201d she said in a statement. The Guardian contacted Hud by telephone and email and received no response. Some landlords are saying they will step into the gap. Heather Goff, whose family owns approximately 200 Hud housing units in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, told the Guardian no one will be evicted from any of their properties. Their reasoning is threefold: first, her grandparents acquired the properties in the mid-70s so most are owned outright. Second, she says, their properties are Section 8 housing, meaning the tenants pay 30%, Section 8 vouchers pick up a large chunk and Hud pays for whatever is left over. Finally, if someone isn\u2019t able to cover rent, the Goff family pays because \u201csome of our tenants we\u2019ve had for decades and are really a part of our extended family\u201d, she said. \u201cWe will do what it takes to keep our [people] housed,\u201d she said. But not all low-income tenants are as secure as Goff\u2019s. Many are speaking out on social media weeks after the viral hashtag #shutdownstories was used to inform the public of the real-world impact of a long-term government shutdown affecting more than 800,000 employees. Twitter user Suzn worried about her elderly mother in public housing, lamenting: \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about my 93-[year-old] mother. She lives in HUD approved housing for seniors. She submitted all paperwork to recertify as low income. HUD shut down &amp; can\u2019t do whatever is needed to mediate with landlord. Will she be a casualty of shutdown? Too close to home.\u201d In Ogden, Utah, a disabled woman in Hud housing posted: \u201cI\u2019m disabled, on housing, unable to work. Mr. President where will I go? Do you care? Is there a room in one of your places where I can live for free? Will I stay warm? Will I be safe? Mr. President, do you have a heart?\u201d Trail says her nine-year-old has the same questions for Trump. Her daughter hates him, Trail says with a laugh. \u201cA lot is riding on my [child\u2019s] future. This man, [Trump], said it could go on for months. It\u2019s just to appease his ego, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Trail said she has gotten into arguments with family members who support the shutdown and staunchly believe in holding out until the government gets the approval for Trump to build a wall. But those same family members, who don\u2019t agree with her liberal views, assure her they will never let her go homeless if she has to move as a result of the shutdown. Will her daughter have to switch schools, she interrupts herself. Some people, those who can\u2019t afford motel rooms, live in the woods near her home. \u201cI don\u2019t even have the money to pay for a motel,\u201d she admitted, not wanting to say out loud where she and her daughter would have to go if the shutdown dragged into the coming months. \u201cI need to keep a roof over my head,\u201d she said.",

A run or a visit to the gym may not give you an opportunity to bond with your colleagues, but a) not all colleagues are worth bonding with, and b) it will do wonders for your physical and mental health.</p> <h2><strong>All right, then. Is it OK to use the words \u2018al desko\u2019?</strong></h2> <p>Again, it depends who you talk to. It\u2019s an \u201cabomination\u201d, says author Helen Jones. Etiquette expert Meier, however, thinks it \u201cadds humour to a rather dull form of dining and makes people think of dining at their desks in a way that requires thoughtfulness\u201d. So she\u2019s all for it.</p> <h2><strong>What about boozing in the office?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cUnacceptable,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cThat\u2019s another clear rule \u2013 you don\u2019t drink within office hours.\u201d</p> <p>Spicer is less dogmatic. \u201cIn most normal offices there\u2019s a sense of when you\u2019re able to drink and when you\u2019re not. In my workplace, after about 4pm on Friday it\u2019s maybe OK to have a glass or two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6eb823651169be301aa74571d10c2bf2b898026e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eb823651169be301aa74571d10c2bf2b898026e/0_0_1269_1269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn recent years,\u201d he notes, \u201cthere\u2019s been a kind of blurring between workspace and non-workspace, and many organisations are beginning to design their workplaces to look like bars. Some shared workplaces provide an unlimited supply of beer as well as tea and coffee.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think drinking\u2019s fine, within reason,\u201d says Daisley. \u201cOpening a bottle of red at your desk? Probably not OK. But there\u2019s good evidence that a bit of moderate drinking can increase people\u2019s affinity for one another.\u201d Normally that\u2019s reserved for the pub, he says, but a lot of workers don\u2019t like them, or don\u2019t have time to go drinking after work.</p> <h2><strong>Tea and coffee?</strong></h2> <p>A rare area of consensus: everyone agrees it\u2019s OK to have these at your desk. But should you make your own or have some sort of round?</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a very important idea,\u201d says Spicer. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like buying a round in the pub but without the alcohol. It ties the group together into a kind of formal ritual. It might seem like a pain in the butt when you have to constantly get people coffee or tea, but it binds people together and gives them a reason to speak to each other.\u201d</p> <p>Or, occasionally, to shirk a few minutes\u2019 work. \u201cI\u2019m against them,\u201d says journalist Sophia Furber. \u201cI used to have them in a previous job and whenever I got to my editor to ask if she wanted a cuppa she would snipe: \u2018I\u2019d rather you brought in some news.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s not the only potential conflict: everyone who has been part of a tea or coffee round will be familiar with the colleagues who are much happier drinking than making. \u201cThere are definitely givers and takers,\u201d is how Daisley puts it.</p> <p>Still, there are worse abuses of the facilities. \u201cI once worked with a guy who made hot dogs in the coffee maker,\u201d recalls development scientist Sarah Callens.</p> <h2><strong>Is there any food you should avoid?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/nov/28/index-offensive-al-desko-lunches-office-packed-lunch\" title=\"\">Anything too smelly, for a start.</a> \u201cThere used to be someone at my work who cooked fish at lunchtime,\u201d Daisley says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a considerate thing to do, is it? I don\u2019t want the office to smell of kippers.

You\u2019re turning people into infants, taking away their right to self-determination. \u201cIf people sit down to lunch together,\u201d he adds, \u201cthey do tend to collaborate better \u2013 unless you force them to do it, in which case all that benefit tends to go. You\u2019ve just got to let people do what they want. If you have no agency, you feel unhappy, you feel demotivated, you feel estranged from your job.\u201d And let\u2019s not forget that scarfing down a sandwich at your desk leaves you free to spend the rest of your break exactly as you want. A run or a visit to the gym may not give you an opportunity to bond with your colleagues, but a) not all colleagues are worth bonding with, and b) it will do wonders for your physical and mental health. All right, then. Is it OK to use the words \u2018al desko\u2019? Again, it depends who you talk to. It\u2019s an \u201cabomination\u201d, says author Helen Jones. Etiquette expert Meier, however, thinks it \u201cadds humour to a rather dull form of dining and makes people think of dining at their desks in a way that requires thoughtfulness\u201d. So she\u2019s all for it. What about boozing in the office? \u201cUnacceptable,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cThat\u2019s another clear rule \u2013 you don\u2019t drink within office hours.\u201d Spicer is less dogmatic. \u201cIn most normal offices there\u2019s a sense of when you\u2019re able to drink and when you\u2019re not. In my workplace, after about 4pm on Friday it\u2019s maybe OK to have a glass or two. \u201cIn recent years,\u201d he notes, \u201cthere\u2019s been a kind of blurring between workspace and non-workspace, and many organisations are beginning to design their workplaces to look like bars. Some shared workplaces provide an unlimited supply of beer as well as tea and coffee.\u201d \u201cI think drinking\u2019s fine, within reason,\u201d says Daisley. \u201cOpening a bottle of red at your desk? Probably not OK. But there\u2019s good evidence that a bit of moderate drinking can increase people\u2019s affinity for one another.\u201d Normally that\u2019s reserved for the pub, he says, but a lot of workers don\u2019t like them, or don\u2019t have time to go drinking after work. Tea and coffee? A rare area of consensus: everyone agrees it\u2019s OK to have these at your desk. But should you make your own or have some sort of round? \u201cI think it\u2019s a very important idea,\u201d says Spicer. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like buying a round in the pub but without the alcohol. It ties the group together into a kind of formal ritual. It might seem like a pain in the butt when you have to constantly get people coffee or tea, but it binds people together and gives them a reason to speak to each other.\u201d Or, occasionally, to shirk a few minutes\u2019 work. \u201cI\u2019m against them,\u201d says journalist Sophia Furber. \u201cI used to have them in a previous job and whenever I got to my editor to ask if she wanted a cuppa she would snipe: \u2018I\u2019d rather you brought in some news.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s not the only potential conflict: everyone who has been part of a tea or coffee round will be familiar with the colleagues who are much happier drinking than making. \u201cThere are definitely givers and takers,\u201d is how Daisley puts it. Still, there are worse abuses of the facilities. \u201cI once worked with a guy who made hot dogs in the coffee maker,\u201d recalls development scientist Sarah Callens. Is there any food you should avoid? Anything too smelly, for a start. \u201cThere used to be someone at my work who cooked fish at lunchtime,\u201d Daisley says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a considerate thing to do, is it? I don\u2019t want the office to smell of kippers. I think it\u2019s just about respect for others.\u201d \u201cNever fish,\u201d agrees City worker Rosie Johnson. As well as \u201cmicrowaved cephalopod leftovers\u201d and \u201ccollective fish and chips in a small shared space\u201d, Callens objects to: \u201cChilli con carne al desko, sandwich platters that pong and curl in the centre of the table for two hours after everyone has eaten, chicken that smells like the bus \u2026\u201d Even nice smells can be a problem, Daisley warns. \u201cAre you creating desires and urges in people that they would like to be free of?\u201d But it\u2019s not just odours you have to worry about. Callens has an aversion to \u201ccrisp bag rustling\u201d, while HR manager Nicky Maine hates \u201cpeople who eat apples. I cannot abide that tearing and wrenching sound, followed by munching. In fact, I detest the very word \u2018munching\u2019.\u201d \u201cI love the fact that we\u2019re going to ban apples,\u201d says Daisley. \u201cWhat, we\u2019re just going soft fruit only? Pears are OK because they\u2019re a touch more giving \u2026\u201d Still, this leaves plenty on the menu. Or does it? Respondent after respondent complained about workmates who hog the microwave by cooking jacket potatoes from scratch, or fail to free it for the next user the moment the timer goes ping. And if you don\u2019t offend your colleagues\u2019 noses, ears or sense of urgency, you still have to contend with their aesthetic judgments. \u201cI have a colleague who puts cheddar cheese on sweet things: hot cross buns, Christmas cake, malt loaf etc,\u201d says teacher Johanna Johnston. \u201cIt\u2019s the not-rightness that bothers me! None of these items need adornment.\u201d Rosie Johnson, meanwhile, even objects to white bread sarnies, on the ground that white bread \u201cis not the bread of self-care\u201d. It\u2019s enough to give you indigestion. \u2022 An earlier version of this article referred to Sarah Callens as Cullen. This has been corrected.",

One of the ideas that will be discussed by a board made up of the governing body, the regions and two independent members, is downgrading at least one of the four to a development team on reduced funding.</p> <p>The Dragons are the most likely victim despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 the WRU\u2019s ownership, attracting the lowest average crowd of the modestly supported quartet and rarely contesting for a place in the European Champions Cup. Wales\u2019s wait to provide a winner for that tournament will go into next season with the Scarlets and the Blues among this season\u2019s also-rans.</p> <p>When Wales went regional in 2003, it was because the WRU felt that having nine professional clubs meant that talent was spread too thinly. Now there is a belief that four is too many and the game\u2019s finances mean that the tier that underpins the regions, the Welsh Premiership, provides a rickety bridge between the amateur and professional games because it is underfunded.</p> <p>It is the same in England with the financial gulf between the Premiership and the Championship now a chasm that will only get wider. The CVC money provides an opportunity for the top flight to invest in the level below, not through altruism but to help provide a better competition for players to emerge from.</p> <p>It won\u2019t happen and if Premiership clubs get their way over ringfencing it will be irreversible. They have talked about relegation being suspended for four years and then reviewed, but without considerable investment the Championship will atrophy and become more amateur than semi-professional. For all the top sides like to talk about France when it comes to the playing budgets and recruitment of top players, they have less to say about how relegation is enshrined there and the second division properly financed so that coming up is more of a step than a leap.</p> <p>The CVC money, we are told, will not be used to stoke wage inflation. That appears to be fanciful. The players affected will be those on the fringe of a squad, earning around \u00a350,000, who will make way for academy players. One head coach lamented recently that a player of his who was on \u00a3300,000 was offered a 20% increase which was trumped by a rival who offered to almost double his salary. The lesson of football in the Premier League era is that no matter how much a club\u2019s turnover increases, fans will always be squeezed. There is never enough money.</p> <p>Just as Wales are talking about the future, so should England. The partnership with CVC has emboldened the clubs, providing them with a war chest should they find themselves in conflict with the RFU and potentially heading for the courts. They need to be careful because it is hard to see how CVC can quickly recoup its investment and start to make a lavish profit from a club tournament which, for all the advances it has made, has limited appeal.</p> <p>Is it using the Premiership as a stalking horse with its eyes on Test rugby when all the home unions, the RFU included, are facing financial challenges? The tweak to the global calendar that will come into play next season will have little impact because, apart from allowing the Super Rugby tournament to be played in one block, tournaments will still overlap and players will remain overburdened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb5dbc318329b6c0c8d87e2d3f222853ae766682\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb5dbc318329b6c0c8d87e2d3f222853ae766682/0_330_5100_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leigh Halfpenny will miss the start of the Six Nations as he seeks to recover from a concussion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leigh Halfpenny will miss the start of the Six Nations as he seeks to recover from a concussion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The length of the season is increasing because of money: the longer it lasts, the greater the earning potential for clubs.

      "bodyText": "\u201cMoney love can help you on, heal you and sustain you, but never turn your back upon, how money love it can change you.\u201d So sang Brian Protheroe in 1974 and money has certainly changed rugby union in the last 24 years. As the 12 Premiership clubs, along with London Irish, plot how to spend the \u00a3200m they have received from a private investment company, which largely involves acting as a cartel and shutting out aspirants to the top flight, the Welsh Rugby Union is this week in talks with its four regions about funding for next season, part of a new agreement called Project Reset. Three of the regions, the Scarlets, Ospreys and Cardiff Blues, this season get \u00a36.8m from central funds with the Dragons, which is owned by the Union, receiving \u00a36m. One of the ideas that will be discussed by a board made up of the governing body, the regions and two independent members, is downgrading at least one of the four to a development team on reduced funding. The Dragons are the most likely victim despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 the WRU\u2019s ownership, attracting the lowest average crowd of the modestly supported quartet and rarely contesting for a place in the European Champions Cup. Wales\u2019s wait to provide a winner for that tournament will go into next season with the Scarlets and the Blues among this season\u2019s also-rans. When Wales went regional in 2003, it was because the WRU felt that having nine professional clubs meant that talent was spread too thinly. Now there is a belief that four is too many and the game\u2019s finances mean that the tier that underpins the regions, the Welsh Premiership, provides a rickety bridge between the amateur and professional games because it is underfunded. It is the same in England with the financial gulf between the Premiership and the Championship now a chasm that will only get wider. The CVC money provides an opportunity for the top flight to invest in the level below, not through altruism but to help provide a better competition for players to emerge from. It won\u2019t happen and if Premiership clubs get their way over ringfencing it will be irreversible. They have talked about relegation being suspended for four years and then reviewed, but without considerable investment the Championship will atrophy and become more amateur than semi-professional. For all the top sides like to talk about France when it comes to the playing budgets and recruitment of top players, they have less to say about how relegation is enshrined there and the second division properly financed so that coming up is more of a step than a leap. The CVC money, we are told, will not be used to stoke wage inflation. That appears to be fanciful. The players affected will be those on the fringe of a squad, earning around \u00a350,000, who will make way for academy players. One head coach lamented recently that a player of his who was on \u00a3300,000 was offered a 20% increase which was trumped by a rival who offered to almost double his salary. The lesson of football in the Premier League era is that no matter how much a club\u2019s turnover increases, fans will always be squeezed. There is never enough money. Just as Wales are talking about the future, so should England. The partnership with CVC has emboldened the clubs, providing them with a war chest should they find themselves in conflict with the RFU and potentially heading for the courts. They need to be careful because it is hard to see how CVC can quickly recoup its investment and start to make a lavish profit from a club tournament which, for all the advances it has made, has limited appeal. Is it using the Premiership as a stalking horse with its eyes on Test rugby when all the home unions, the RFU included, are facing financial challenges? The tweak to the global calendar that will come into play next season will have little impact because, apart from allowing the Super Rugby tournament to be played in one block, tournaments will still overlap and players will remain overburdened. The length of the season is increasing because of money: the longer it lasts, the greater the earning potential for clubs. In a week when yet another player has retired early because of injury \u2013 Ben John at the age of 27 \u2013 the Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny will miss the start of the Six Nations as he struggles to shake off the symptoms of his latest concussion. Given the increasingly attritional nature of the sport and the short close season, a return to the amateur calendar \u2013 when the game shut down between the end of April and the beginning of September \u2013 would help, but there is no chance of that happening. Money again. Club owners have long recognised that the game\u2019s regulations, which were drawn up in amateur times, impede their ambition, not least the one regarding automatic release of players for international matches in designated windows. Their options are limited: there has been talk of a breakaway, but who with? French clubs would have to break the law there to join in and teams in the other countries are yoked to their unions. The game would shrink when it needs to expand. Clubs that have overreached themselves in recent years by spending what they did not have are counting the cost. London Welsh crashed to the bottom of the English league system, following in the trail of London Scottish and Richmond. Rotherham nearly went after their Premiership experiences and Neath face another winding-up order over an unpaid tax bill. As Protheroe continued: \u201cMoney love will fill your head, feed you and obey you. But very softly you must tread or in the ground she will lay you.\u201d \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

      "bodyText": "Labour has accused the government of squandering taxpayers\u2019 money on bursaries of up to \u00a325,000 and beyond to attract top graduates into teaching, many of whom then fail to take up teaching posts. According to Labour analysis of Department for Education (DfE) data, trainee teachers awarded the highest bursary of \u00a325,000 and above were the least likely to end up in a teaching post, compared with those on smaller bursaries or no financial incentive at all. Eighty per cent of postgraduate teacher trainees awarded the \u00a325,000-plus bursary were teaching in state-funded schools in 2015-16 after qualification, compared with 89% of those who received no bursary. Of those awarded the lowest-value bursaries of less than \u00a35,000, 90% were in a teaching post. Bursaries are intended to attract high-quality graduates into teaching, particularly in priority subjects where it is often hard to recruit, but according to Labour they are failing to keep top teachers in the profession and are therefore a waste of public money. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s strategy to deal with the teacher recruitment and retention crisis they have created is failing badly, and it is taxpayers who are paying the price for the failures of Tory ministers. \u201cThey have missed recruitment targets in six consecutive years and their inability to attract high-achieving graduates to the profession is wasting taxpayers\u2019 money and letting students down.\u201d The bursaries offered by the DfE depend on qualifications and subject, and are among a number of measures being used by the government to address the teacher recruitment crisis in the UK and increase the quality of teachers. According to Labour analysis, in 2015-16 nearly \u00a322m was spent on bursaries for trainees who did not go on to take up a teaching post. More than \u00a36.1m of that went on top \u00a325,000-plus payments for graduates with firsts in chemistry, computing, mathematics, modern foreign languages and physics. The analysis comes as the education secretary, Damian Hinds, prepares to launch the government\u2019s teacher recruitment and retention strategy. Official statistics published in November revealed the government had missed its teacher training targets in most secondary school subjects. Fewer than half (47%) of the trainees required were recruited in physics and just a quarter of the required design and technology trainees were taken on, according to the figures. The DfE roundly rejected Labour\u2019s criticisms of the bursaries policy. According to officials, though the employment rate for bursary-holders who qualify as teachers is lower than the equivalent rate for non-bursary-holders, it is down to the quality of the graduates who attract bursaries who are in greater demand elsewhere in the economy, rather than the award of a bursary itself. The schools standards minister, Nick Gibb, said: \u201cOur bursaries and scholarships are not just an exercise in increasing teacher numbers. \u201cThey are specifically tailored so that we attract the right candidates for certain vital subjects and developed with bodies such as the Institute of Physics and the Royal Society of Chemistry. \u201cThis is especially important in a competitive graduate labour market with unemployment at its lowest level since the 1970s. \u201cIn addition to these bursaries, we are working with school leaders and unions on a strategy to drive recruitment, boost retention and strip away unnecessary workload, to ensure that teaching remains an attractive and fulfilling profession.\u201d The DfE is testing new financial incentives for mathematics teachers \u2013 who are in particularly short supply \u2013 including upfront bursaries of \u00a320,000 and a maths scholarship worth \u00a322,000. These are followed by two additional payments of up to \u00a37,500 to encourage talented maths teachers to stay in the profession. Jack Worth, the school workforce lead at the National Foundation for Educational Research, said: \u201cThere has been a long-term need to attract teachers into subjects such as maths and science which offer the highest bursaries. \u201cHowever, they are mostly aimed at increasing recruitment into training and, in order to be effective and offer good value for money, bursaries need to be coupled with a robust retention strategy.\u201d Rayner promised teachers more money under Labour. \u201cYears of real-terms pay cuts have made it impossible for schools to recruit the staff they need, and teachers are leaving the profession in record numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a generation of children paying the price for Tory failure in our schools. \u201cThrough our National Education Service, Labour will invest in our schools and provide ringfenced funding to give teachers the pay rise they deserve.\u201d",

The <a href=\"https://theasc.com/\">American Society of Cinematographers</a> turned 100 this month and, though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/roger-deakins-oscars-2018-best-cinematography-blade-runner-2049\">last year\u2019s Oscar for the category</a> drew attention after the first nomination for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/25/woman-cameraman-snubbed-mudbound-rachel-morrison-nominated-oscar\">female cinematographer</a>, and Twitter users reguarly share examples of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnePerfectShot\">\u201cOne Perfect Shot\u201d</a>, the art of \u201cpainting with light\u201d is little understood.</p> <p>Cinematographers are responsible for photographing films, but in practice their job is more complex. The skill of the cinematographer, or director of photography, is to combine visual artistry with technical knowledge and a certain amount of people management. \u201cMaybe as many as 80 people on a movie come under your direct command,\u201d says Bill Butler, the Oscar-nominated cinematographer who worked on classics including Jaws and One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. \u201cNext to the director, it\u2019s the cinematographer who is really in charge of everything, from the costume you wear to the makeup. You do a lot more than just take meter readings.\u201d</p> <p>The ASC was established to formalise the role of and distinguish cinematographers from camera operators, but it had more to do with practicalities and problem solving. In the silent film era, movie cameras were generally heavy hand-cranked machines, and the centre of gravity of the US film industry was shifting from the east coast to the west. The technology and the medium were new, so camera operators everywhere faced common difficulties, such as annoying white streaks on footage, caused by static electricity. The east-coast based Cinema Camera Club, formed by a team of Edison\u2019s camera operators, and the Static Club of America, based in Los Angeles and led by Universal\u2019s Harry H Harris, collaborated on solutions to these issues, pooling their wisdom. Soon enough, Edison cinematographer Phil Rosen suggested a national organisation to his Hollywood colleague Charles Rosher.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_07ktacEGo8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_07ktacEGo8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_07ktacEGo8\">Watch the trailer for Leave No Trace, shot by Michael McDonough</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about making pretty pictures,\u201d says Mandy Walker, whose CV includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/12/hidden-figures-review-john-glenn-taraji-henson-black-nasa-octavia-spencer-janelle-monae\">Hidden Figures</a>, Australia and the forthcoming Mulan. \u201cThe most important part of my job is helping the director tell a story with the images of the film and camera and lighting and lenses. The decisions we make are the most important.\u201d</p> <p>Butler agrees: \u201cOne of the things that is important is your ability to understand the truth in the film you\u2019re making. Where should you put the camera? How should your camera look at this story? If you do it wrong, then you interrupt the truth you\u2019re trying to get to.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, the job has changed beyond recognition in the last century. By the time the ASC was founded in 1919, to keep up with the demand for movies, films were increasingly being shot under artificial lights in studios rather than outside in the sunlight. Camera operators had to become cinematographers, or directors of photography, manipulating various different lights and lenses to create specific effects. As the job became more technical and with more opportunities for creative expression, still photographers such as Charles Rosher entered the movies. \u201cThere was a stage when you had two directors on set, a director of actors and the director of photography,\u201d says McDonough. \u201cEventually the actors became pre-eminent, so the director of actors became pre-eminent.\u201d</p> <p>Through the 1920s, much cinematographic flair, especially in Hollywood, was focused on making the stars look more beautiful. This was the birth of the three-point lighting system with a key, a fill and a backlight to add a glamorous effect to stars\u2019 faces, often accompanied by a generous amount of soft focus. Cinematographers were also widely expected to compose each shot, and the growing use of camera movement gave them more seniority: they would need to employ a camera operator and focus puller, too.</p> <p>More challenges and innovations were to come. By the 1940s and 50s, cinematographers were more regularly asked to light for Technicolor (although using crisp enough light that films would still look good on TV, in black-and-white) and create widescreen compositions. In the 60s, the use of handheld cameras and \u201csoft light\u201d (that is, bouncing light off reflective surfaces around a space rather than using direct sources), changed the game again. In the 1970s, Garrett Brown invented the Steadicam, removing the need for expensive dolly tracks, and allowing for a new range of faster, more fluid camera movements.</p> <p>That\u2019s around the time that Butler started to work in cinema, after years spent on live TV. He brought some techniques from television and from European cinema to Hollywood, including bounce lighting and the extensive use of handheld photography in Jaws. \u201cI was original in my style mainly because of my background in television. It very much affected what I did in film and, when things were changing from the old, old style of cinematography, all the rules started to get broken.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1a9f1eeff079871186b31f04b25d99163887a752\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a9f1eeff079871186b31f04b25d99163887a752/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha Robinson in The Love Witch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I loved working on The Love Witch because I was able to recreate a lot of the lighting from the 50s and 60s,\u2019 says cinematographer David Mullen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Oscilloscope</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 21st century, the cinematographer\u2019s remit is only expanding.

      "bodyText": "A former prison governor who led an official review into Islamist extremism in prisons has said jails in the UK have become \u201cincubators\u201d of radical behaviour, and repeated calls for the most subversive offenders to be separated from other inmates. Ian Acheson, who led the independent government review of Islamist extremism in prisons and probation in 2016, said the high number of lower-tariff extremist offenders entering squalid, overcrowded jails, combined with a low chance of them receiving treatment for their behaviour, were behind the worsening problem. He called for the \u201cenlightened separation of extremist ideologues\u201d in prison, but acknowledged it was a \u201ccontroversial\u201d recommendation. Acheson, writing in an essay published by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, said: \u201cIn 2018, 41% of convictions for terrorism-related offences were of sentences of four years or less. In particular, these lower-tariff prisoners enter a penal system severely disordered by overcrowding, squalor and insufficient staff. \u201cThe prospect of them receiving treatment for their offending behaviour in this environment pales beside the pragmatic attraction of safety in religious or ideological groups that provide security, kudos and structure. \u201cIn this respect, prisons in the UK, in particular in England and Wales, have become incubators of extremism. \u201cPolicymakers can and must at least remove those most able to capitalise on this chaos by spreading the message of violent extremism. Individuals who pose a threat must not be allowed to weaponise the grievances of those in search of meaning and excitement.\u201d Acheson\u2019s review concluded the threat posed by ideologues with relatively free access in prison to radicalise the next generation of offenders was so great that only incapacitating them would work. \u201cEnlightened separation of extremist ideologues in prison and community-based reintegration of offenders on release are new, more agile ways of dealing with this threat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot speak to dead terrorists. We can speak for dead victims. They demand that policymakers take risks to ensure that the people who wish to harm us through a corrupt ideology are engaged, not shunned. \u201cThis should happen not because states are weak, but because they are confident the strength of their values will ultimately prevail.\u201d The number of extremist prisoners is relatively low compared with the wider prison population, but Acheson argued their impact was potentially lethal. The Ministry of Justice previously said it believed about 700 prisoners were a risk due to their extremist views. It is understood the figure was an overall estimate of all inmates linked to any form of extremism, including Islamist or far-right ideologies. As of 30 September 2018, there were 224 people in custody in Britain for terrorism-related offences, an increase of 5% on the previous year. Acheson said: \u201cWhile the numbers of convicted terrorists remain relatively small in a prison population of around 83,000, the lethal risk radicalised prisoners represent to national security in and outside prisons means policymakers cannot be complacent.\u201d Police and security services have been dealing with a surge in the number of convicted terrorists released from prison. More than 40% of the sentences for terrorism offences over a 10-year period would have been served by the end of 2018, Guardian analysis showed. More than 80 of the 193 sentences for terrorism offences between 2007 and 2016 will have run out by the end of this year. Among those recently released from prison was Anjem Choudary, the hate preacher and leader of the banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun, which inspired a number of Britons to join Isis. The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, in the foreword to the collection of essays from Acheson and seven other experts on counter-extremism, said: \u201cExtremism based on a perversion of the religion of Islam \u2013 the turning of religious belief into a totalitarian political ideology \u2013 remains the most potent global security threat. \u201cSecurity measures are of course necessary.

      "bodyText": "1) Cody Parkey was left feeling like the loneliest man in the world after watching his last-gasp potentially game-winning field goal bounce off the upright and crossbar in the Chicago Bears\u2019 playoff defeat by the Philadelphia Eagles (keep an eye on the mascot in the background, too). Maybe we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by Parkey\u2019s supposed misfortune. He has a knack when it comes to finding the woodwork. Here he is clattering the goal-frame four times from four kicks in a match last November. And here are those doinks immortalised in Tecmo Super Bowl. Parkey still has some way to go before he matches this single rugby union penalty, though. It boinged off the crossbar and post a full four times! Over to you Cody. 2) The Australian Open kicks off on Monday and, as always, Roger Federer is among the favourites. Here\u2019s his emotional journey to winning a 20th grand slam title in Melbourne last year, when Caroline Wozniacki finally won her first. Her ding-dong battle with Simona Halep was one of the matches of the year. There have been countless classic matches down the years but here are some of the best: Chris Evert Lloyd v Martina Navratilova in 1982, Boris Becker v Omar Camporese in 1991, Jennifer Capriati v Martina Hingis in 2002, Andy Roddick v Younes El Aynaoui in 2003 and Marat Safin v Roger Federer in 2005. And will Bernard Tomic have the chutzpah to try this bizarre underarm serve against an opponent at Melbourne Park? We hope so. 3) Some passes are so good you just have to watch them over and over again. Lionel Messi\u2019s to Luis Su\u00e1rez against Getafe was one such piece of creative brilliance.

And here\u2019s Espanyol\u2019s David L\u00f3pez with an entertaining long-range assist \u2013 not that he meant it. 4) Ellyse Perry was on fire for the Sydney Sixers in the Women\u2019s Big Bash league, with brilliant batting, a couple of wickets and a superb diving catch to boot. The best catch this week though? This fan may argue otherwise. Oh, and here\u2019s cricket with a banging donk on it. 5) Rally legend S\u00e9bastien Loeb has got off to a flying start in the 2019 Dakar Rally. Not that we should be surprised. The man can drive. See for yourself with this onboard view of him bossing the Monte Carlo course in 2015 in the snow \u2026 at night.

Our favourites from below the line last week 1) Urban downhill mountain biking in Colombia. 2) Player gets the ball belted into his nuts \u2013 and sets up goal for opposition team. 3) When live animal mascots collide. 4) Every goal that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r scored for Manchester United?

It is broadcast live on ABC in the US, on Sky in the UK, and on Channel Nine in Australia. The red carpet portion of the show is broadcast live by the E! network.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who decides on the Oscars?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscars are voted for by members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (aka Ampas), which currently numbers just under 8,000 voting members, divided into 17 separate branches, including actors, directors, costume designers, etc. (To join, names have to be proposed and approved by individual branches.) The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived white/male/elderly bias of its voters \u2013 and a drive to create a more diverse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many Oscars are there and how does a film get nominated?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are 24 categories \u2013 ranging from best picture to best sound mixing \u2013 presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg's PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).</p>\n    <p>Each of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries \u2013 first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination \u2013 which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do Oscar winners win?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscar statuette isn't solid gold:&nbsp;it's gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn't own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won't sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Appearing on breakfast TV show Good Morning America, Hart said: \u201cI am done with it.

He said the UN needed to bypass them, ideally through municipal councils.</p> <p>The conference was a last chance for the UN mission to restore its credibility and for Libya to achieve a peaceful transition, Dabbashi said. The UN has not yet announced an agenda, format or timetable for the conference.</p> <p>Dabbashi\u2019s warning came as suggestions mounted that Khalifa Haftar, the strongman who is the dominant figure in Libya\u2019s east, is determined to reunify the country militarily, if necessary by staging an assault on the capital, Tripoli.</p> <p>Salam\u00e9 said Haftar, the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army, is committed to the political process.</p> <p>But Haftar has been at loggerheads with the UN-backed Government of National Accord, led by Fayez al-Serraj for more than four years, splitting Libya\u2019s chief institutions including the central bank, the government and security forces.</p> <p>While Dabbashi did not explicitly state which foreign powers he was accusing of interference, Haftar\u2019s allies are primarily Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and increasingly France, while the GNA government is dependent on Qatar and, in recent months, Turkey.</p> <p>Over the past year, Haftar, presenting himself as capable of defeating jihadists and the Muslim Brotherhood, has been slowly building diplomatic support in Paris and Rome, alongside his longstanding allies in Cairo and the UAE.</p> <p>The prospects of the UN holding free and fair elections this year depend on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/30/arab-spring-aftermath-syria-tunisia-egypt-yemen-libya\">securing stability in the country</a>, but fighting continues, including in the south, the port of Derna, sporadically in Tripoli, as well as south of Sirte.</p> <p>The GNA\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs in the capital was attacked by Islamic State fighters on Christmas Day, leaving two people dead.</p> <p>Salam\u00e9 is hoping increased oil revenues, exhaustion at political infighting and UN support can persuade Libyans to accept the outcome of the elections.</p> <p>The interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, installed in October, told BBC Arabic that elements of the Tripoli militia were running a parallel operation inside his ministry, executing their agendas away from the government\u2019s orders.</p> <p>\u201cWe have now a parallel interior ministry in Tripoli,\u201d he said, claiming they had a huge amount of money to run their operations. \u201cThey are not militias, but illegal groups that contribute to fostering chaos and lack of security.

      "bodyText": "Libya risks losing its final chance to find a peaceful solution to four years of deadlock because political parties backed by the west are plotting to hijack crucial talks, a former Libyan diplomat has told the UN. The warning from the country\u2019s former ambassador to the UN Ibrahim Dabbashi was issued in an open letter to Ghassan Salam\u00e9, the UN special envoy for Libya. Salam\u00e9 is hoping to hold a national conference this month before presidential and parliamentary elections due by the summer, which are designed to bring the war-torn country back together. Dabbashi said in his letter, published on Monday, that \u201csome Libyan parties backed by the active members of the UN security council are trying hijack the national conference\u201d. He said Salam\u00e9 should not be fooled by these groups, which he said already occupy the chaotic political scene and were seeking to flood the meeting to maintain their power, rather than find a long-term political solution. He said the UN needed to bypass them, ideally through municipal councils. The conference was a last chance for the UN mission to restore its credibility and for Libya to achieve a peaceful transition, Dabbashi said. The UN has not yet announced an agenda, format or timetable for the conference. Dabbashi\u2019s warning came as suggestions mounted that Khalifa Haftar, the strongman who is the dominant figure in Libya\u2019s east, is determined to reunify the country militarily, if necessary by staging an assault on the capital, Tripoli. Salam\u00e9 said Haftar, the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army, is committed to the political process. But Haftar has been at loggerheads with the UN-backed Government of National Accord, led by Fayez al-Serraj for more than four years, splitting Libya\u2019s chief institutions including the central bank, the government and security forces. While Dabbashi did not explicitly state which foreign powers he was accusing of interference, Haftar\u2019s allies are primarily Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and increasingly France, while the GNA government is dependent on Qatar and, in recent months, Turkey. Over the past year, Haftar, presenting himself as capable of defeating jihadists and the Muslim Brotherhood, has been slowly building diplomatic support in Paris and Rome, alongside his longstanding allies in Cairo and the UAE. The prospects of the UN holding free and fair elections this year depend on securing stability in the country, but fighting continues, including in the south, the port of Derna, sporadically in Tripoli, as well as south of Sirte. The GNA\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs in the capital was attacked by Islamic State fighters on Christmas Day, leaving two people dead. Salam\u00e9 is hoping increased oil revenues, exhaustion at political infighting and UN support can persuade Libyans to accept the outcome of the elections. The interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, installed in October, told BBC Arabic that elements of the Tripoli militia were running a parallel operation inside his ministry, executing their agendas away from the government\u2019s orders. \u201cWe have now a parallel interior ministry in Tripoli,\u201d he said, claiming they had a huge amount of money to run their operations. \u201cThey are not militias, but illegal groups that contribute to fostering chaos and lack of security. They act on behalf of foreign nations,\u201d Bashagha added. If the political impasse continues, Haftar may come to be seen as a more attractive proposition to some western countries, which are now as interested in stability as in democracy. Donald Trump last week described the removal of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 as a catastrophe, saying the country would be better off if the former dictator were still in power. But a western embrace of Haftar as the man to bring security back to Libya would have to overlook claims that the Libyan National Army, in the name of defeating terrorism, has committed acts worthy of referral to the international criminal court (ICC). A legal opinion by the human rights lawyer Rodney Dixon QC said forces under the command of Haftar \u201cappear to be involved in the commission of the war crimes of murder, mutilation, torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and the targeting of civilians. These acts prima facie constitute crimes and violations of the Geneva convention.\u201d Dixon, an expert in international law and regarded as a critic of Saudi Arabia, was shown videos compiled in the past three to four months. He said that in his opinion, the violence in the videos served as \u201ca stark reminder of the gruesome crimes being perpetrated with impunity in eastern Libya, and of the urgent need for decisive, corrective action\u201d.

Furthermore, those in charge should at least have known of these crimes, or had reason to know, and the failure to act to prevent or punish them could render those superiors criminally liable.\u201d The UN security council has made Libya subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC, which in August last year issued a warrant for the arrest of a commander in the Libyan National Army, Mahmoud al-Werfalli. He was accused of ordering and participating in summary executions of prisoners in Benghazi, but remains at large.

Police launched the investigation, named Operation Horizon, after 14 drugs-related deaths in Barrow-in-Furness since December 2017. Twenty-two people were arrested following raids in Barrow, Coventry and London. The police recovered class A drugs and thousands of pounds in cash. Police said they had been planning the operation for 10 months after a jump in drug-related deaths. A police spokesperson said the raids showed the force\u2019s determination to stem the supply of drugs into south Cumbria. Temporary Ch Supt Rob O\u2019Connor said: \u201cI make no apologies for the fact that my officers over the last two days have forced entry to the homes of suspects and given them a rude awakening by dragging them out of their beds at six in the morning. \u201cPeople who deal drugs bring misery to others\u2019 lives, and sadly we have seen too many people in south Cumbria die due to drug misuse. Too many people become victims of crime committed by addicts who break into people\u2019s houses and cars to feed their addictions.\u201d O\u2019Connor added that the raids and arrests were made possible in part thanks to the addition of 25 new police officers dedicated to community policing. Officers from Cumbria were assisted by the north-west regional organised crime unit, the Metropolitan Police Service and West Midlands police. The Cumbria police and crime commissioner, Peter McCall, said: \u201cI know that controlling illegal drug use and supply is a significant concern for the public and this operation is but one example of the work the police are doing to deal robustly with those who try to deal drugs into Cumbria.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s room for manoeuvre should her Brexit deal be rejected next week was further constrained on Wednesday night, after the government lost a second dramatic parliamentary showdown in as many days. An increasingly boxed-in prime minister must now set out her plan B within three working days of a defeat next Tuesday, after the rebel amendment passed. There were furious scenes in the House of Commons as the Speaker, John Bercow, took the controversial decision to allow a vote on the amendment, tabled by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve. A string of MPs, including the leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, repeatedly intervened to question the Speaker\u2019s approach. Some accused him of being biased against Brexit. But parliament went on to back Grieve as the prime minister was defied by Conservative rebels determined to hand control of the Brexit process to MPs if next week\u2019s vote is lost. The fresh defeat, which followed a separate backbench amendment to the finance bill on Tuesday, means the government will have to return to parliament swiftly with a plan. An accelerated timetable will also pile the pressure on Labour to move quickly. The motion setting out the government\u2019s plan can be amended by MPs hoping to push their own alternative proposals, from a second referendum to a harder Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party will have to decide which to back. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, on Wednesday became the most senior Labour figure to suggest that the article 50 process might have to be extended, if the deadlock in parliament could not be broken. He told MPs: \u201cThere is a question of the extension of article 50, which may well be inevitable now, given the position that we are in, but of course we can only seek it, because the other 27 [EU members] have to agree.\u201d Starmer also said: \u201cWe are going to have to look at what available options are realistically still on the table and what now are the merits of each of them.\u201d Corbyn will use a speech in Wakefield on Thursday to step up his demands for a general election, and frame Labour\u2019s approach to next week\u2019s key vote and the steps the party will take afterwards. \u201cA government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all. So I say to Theresa May: if you are so confident in your deal, call that election, and let the people decide,\u201d he will say. \u201cTo break the deadlock, an election is not only the most practical option, it is also the most democratic option.\u201d He will insist the best way to overcome the divisions that drove the Brexit vote is to elect a Labour government. Government sources on Wednesday night confirmed reports that they are considering making another concession, on workers\u2019 rights, in a bid to win over Labour MPs. May could accept an amendment backed by MPs including Labour\u2019s John Mann, that would offer stronger protections for workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. Mann was among a group of Labour MPs who met the prime minister on Wednesday to discuss what changes she could make to win their support for her deal, with other attendees including Stoke Central MP Gareth Snell. Meanwhile, May will seek to underline international support for her stance, as she welcomes the Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, to Britain. The pair will announce a series of trade and cultural collaborations, and hail the end of an export ban on British meat products to Japan. The government announced details of new concessions on the Brexit deal on Wednesday, in an attempt to win over sceptics. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, announced that the government would accept a proposal from the Tory MP Hugo Swire that will allow MPs to vote, before the Irish backstop is implemented, if a trade deal has not been reached by mid-2020. May\u2019s spokesman said the plan would give MPs the options of implementing the backstop, extending the transition period, or \u201calternative ways you could look at, including technology\u201d. But the idea that it would strengthen MPs\u2019 powers to prevent the backstop coming into force was swiftly dismissed in Brussels. An EU diplomat said: \u201cThis is a purely internal arrangement in the UK. What counts is the treaty and the legally binding commitments in the treaty and why would the UK not want to honour its international obligations?\u201d Asked if the EU would have to concur with whatever decision was reached, the spokesman said it would not. \u201cMy understanding on that is that it\u2019s a decision for the UK parliament as to which route we choose to go down.\u201d However, one senior Brexiter agreed with the view in Brussels that the withdrawal treaty, once ratified, would trump any vote in Westminster. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of international treaties!\u201d he said. More details were also announced of the so-called \u201cStormont lock\u201d, giving the Northern Ireland assembly a \u201cstrong role\u201d in regulatory arrangements if the backstop comes into force. But with the assembly currently suspended, a paper published by the government setting out the plans was quickly rubbished by the Democratic Unionist party. Winning over the DUP was at the heart of No 10\u2019s strategy for smoothing the path to May\u2019s deal being passed by parliament. But there has been little sign since the new year that its resolve to reject the deal has weakened. Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s leader at Westminster, described the latest proposals as \u201ccosmetic and meaningless\u201d. Earlier, Bercow had clashed repeatedly with MPs over his decision to fly in the face of parliamentary convention and allow the Grieve motion to be voted on. \u201cThe chair is simply seeking to discharge the responsibility of the holder of the office to the best of his ability,\u201d he insisted, speaking about himself in the third person. \u201cThat is what I have always done, and no matter what people say or how forcefully they say it, or how many times they say it or by what manner of coordination it is said, I will continue to do what I believe to be right.\u201d The Conservative Simon Hoare was one of the MPs expressing concern. He said the decision plunged parliament into \u201cpretty choppy and dangerous waters at the time in our nation\u2019s affairs when, frankly, we can least afford it\u201d. Another MP challenged the Speaker about a sticker on his car that \u201cmakes derogatory comments about Brexit\u201d. Bercow shot back that the car belonged to his wife. Rebel backbenchers believe the decision to allow the vote strengthens their hand in what they expect to be a series of battles in the days ahead, as they seek to prevent the government leading Britain out of the EU without a deal. Downing Street sought to play down the significance of the amendment. A spokesman said: \u201cOur intention has always been to respond quickly and provide certainty on the way forward in the event that we lose the meaningful vote.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 January 2019.

In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit and the coronavirus, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers. Many businesses which deal with complex supply chains also want additional help with the new red tape and import charges imposed after Boris Johnson's Brexit deal saddled them with extra costs.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Graham Stapleton, the chief executive who took the helm in January, said: \u201cThis has been a challenging third quarter for the business, driven by exceptionally mild weather and ongoing weak consumer confidence.\u201d</p> \n<p>Halfords has been hit as shoppers rein in on non-essentials as they worry about their finances during an uncertain political and economic time.</p> \n<p>The cycle market is also facing fierce price competition, particularly from the fast-growing online sports retailer Wiggle.</p> \n<p>Evans Cycles fell into administration in October after several years in the red.

      "body": "<p>Three \u2013 or was it four? \u2013 days after he shut himself in a pitch-black bathroom, Rich Alati started to hallucinate. He saw little white, bubble-like balls, floating around the room. To calm himself he imagined he was in a magical cloud, cozy and relaxed. Embracing the visions was key. \u201cOr else,\u201d he says, \u201cyou might get a little scared.\u201d</p> <p>Alati was in the dark for a bet, which makes a little more sense once you know he is a professional poker player. On 10 September last year, the American was sitting at a poker table at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, when he was asked a question by a fellow professional player, Rory Young: how much would it take for him to spend time in complete isolation, with no light, for 30 days? An hour later a price had been agreed: $100,000.</p> <p>Young would hand over the money if Alati could last 30 days in a soundproofed bathroom with no light. He would be delivered food from a local restaurant, but the meals would come at irregular intervals to prevent him from keeping track of time. There would be no TV, radio, phone or access to the outside world but he would be allowed some comforts: a yoga mat, resistance band, massage ball, and, appropriately for a bathroom, lavender essential oils as well as a sugar and salt scrub. If Alati failed he would have to pay Young $100,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/04/all-in-writer-puts-poker-book-on-hold-after-making-200000-playing-the-game\">All in: writer puts poker book on hold after making $200,000 playing cards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Poker players are known to bet on <a href=\"http://www.888.com/blog/the-insane-world-of-crazy-prop-bets/\">just about anything</a> but some thought Alati had taken things too far. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do this bet for any amount of money,\u201d professional poker player Danielle Moon Anderson <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dmoonandersen/posts/10106195587599810\">noted at the time</a>. Dr Michael Munro, a psychologist Young consulted before agreeing to the bet, told Young: \u201cEven if he lasts for 30 days, it will be extremely taxing on his mental health for the short and potentially long term.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s good reason for such caution. Solitary confinement is often used as punishment, most notably in the United States, where inmates in solitary are isolated in their cells 23 hours a day. The <a href=\"https://undocs.org/A/RES/70/175\">United Nations\u2019 Nelson Mandela Rules</a> state that keeping someone in solitary for more than 15 days constitutes torture.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wi.edu/psyd-faculty-terry-kupers\">Dr Terry Kupers</a>, a psychiatrist at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, says the bet risked trivializing solitary confinement. \u201cAnxiety, anger and despair, often with a high risk of suicide, is the average clinical presentation of prisoners in solitary,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While there would be notable differences between Alati\u2019s experiences and those of a prisoner in solitary \u2013 most notably, he could leave at any time \u2013 Young believed the American was unlikely to last the 30 days. \u201cIt\u2019s just so cruel to the human mind to do that,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Alati was confident. He had practiced meditation and yoga, and was certain his experiences at silent retreats would help him. On 21 November, a crowd of families and friends gathered at the house where the challenge would take place. Alati and Young\u2019s lawyers were there as well as cameramen from a production company interested in buying television rights to the story. For that reason, as well as safety, the entire bet would be recorded. Alati\u2019s father was given the power to pull Alati out at any time should he show signs of not being \u201cin the right headspace,\u201d as Alati puts it.</p> <p>At 8.05pm, Alati walked into the bathroom, and darkness fell. He stood for a moment, frozen. Then he lay down and fell asleep.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The bathroom mirrors were covered to prevent any reflection, and the doors, though unlocked, were sealed to block out any light. A mattress was wedged between the sink and a countertop. In front of the sink and next to the mattress was Alati\u2019s yoga mat. And across from that was the bathtub.</p> <p>\u201cMy memory is really good,\u201d Alati says. He had examined the room before the challenge started, and when he woke up in complete darkness, he could picture his surroundings. He told himself that he should do what he normally does when he wakes up, and began his routine.</p> <p>He brushed his teeth. He then filled up the bathtub, adding Epsom salts and lavender oil to calm his mind, and scoured himself with the sugar and salt scrub. From the bath, he went to the shower in the corner of the room to rinse off. He then headed to the sink, where he used Q-tips on his ears, combed his hair, and lotioned his body. He got dressed and ate. He did yoga and meditated. \u201cI was remembering where everything is, and everything goes back to that exact place,\u201d Alati says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I live my life anyways.\u201d</p> <p>And that was his plan. He was going to live his normal life as if normal \u201cwas living in darkness for the rest of my life.\u201d He had 720 hours and absolutely no distractions \u2013 and he\u2019d use that time to improve himself. \u201cHow can I give myself a better sugar scrub ... how can I stretch it deeper, how can I be more calm, how can I be more patient?\u201d he says.</p> <p>From the outside his life was, well, a little dull. Young, who had began watching the video stream in earnest, said \u201cit became a bit boring after a while because it\u2019s not like he\u2019s doing anything different.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/16/secret-life-poker-player\">The secret life of a professional poker player: I\u2019m on the fringes of society | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The biggest hurdles were mental. As well as the hallucinations, his thoughts twice started to spiral negatively, fast. \u201cIt happened so quick. It went from positive thoughts to like what if, what if, what if?\u201d Alati says. Such thoughts were dangerous without company to distract him. In isolation, they could lead to despair. When they cropped up, Alati started doing yoga, and he refocused on his body, on his pose and stretch.</p> <p>Some parts were easier. With so much time and only himself for company, Alati\u2019s thoughts were a source of entertainment and a lifeline. \u201cThe thoughts would just come to you, and if you don\u2019t make sure that they go in a good direction, they can spiderweb out of control and lead you to a bad place,\u201d Alati says.</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a73317a011f1f702a3646420511f43d3edf64c08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a73317a011f1f702a3646420511f43d3edf64c08/44_0_2070_1242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rich Alati says he has learned to value small pleasures since his challenge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rich Alati says he has learned to value small pleasures since his challenge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Alati</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the 10-day mark, Young started to worry that Alati might make the 30 days, noting he looked \u201ctotally fine\u201d. He worried he had miscalculated: Young hadn\u2019t known Alati \u2013 a gregarious, fast talker \u2013 for long before they had made the bet. \u201cHis personality did not reflect that of someone who was proficient with meditation,\u201d Young said.</p> <p>On day 15, Young\u2019s voice came on over the loudspeaker. Alati jumped out of bed, happy to hear a voice that wasn\u2019t his own. Young told Alati that he had been in for around two weeks and that he had an offer for him: Alati could leave if he paid out $50,000.</p> <p>Alati\u2019s laughed in disbelief. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Alati recalls telling Young. \u201cDude, I just sat in here for two weeks, and you want me to hand over half my money?\u201d He laid back down discouraged. He\u2019d spent 15 long days in the bathroom \u2013 \u201cno walk in the park\u201d in his words \u2013 and he had to gear up for 15 more.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a pretty aggressive negotiation tactic by me,\u201d Young concedes. He waited a few days and came back with another offer. Alati was skeptical. \u201cI don\u2019t know, kid, your buyout offers are trash,\u201d Alati recalls telling Young. Young offered to pay Alati $25,000 to come out. The money was finally in Alati\u2019s favor. He considered the offer for an hour \u2013 and then declined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v1/index.html?vertical=sport&amp;title=Guardian%20sport%20on%20social%20media&amp;description=&amp;link-1-headline=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fguardian_sport&amp;link-2-headline=Like%20us%20on%20Facebook&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardiansport&amp;link-3-headline=Find%20us%20on%20Instagram&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fguardian_sport%2F&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardianfootball\" data-alt=\"Social\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v1/index.html?vertical=sport&title=Guardian%20sport%20on%20social%20media&description=&link-1-headline=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fguardian_sport&link-2-headline=Like%20us%20on%20Facebook&link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardiansport&link-3-headline=Find%20us%20on%20Instagram&link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fguardian_sport%2F&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardianfootball\">Social</a> </figure>  <p>Alati waited for a few days until Young came back on the loudspeaker and asked if he had any offers of his own. Alati said he wouldn\u2019t come out for less than $75,000, to which Young countered with an offer of $40,000. They settled on $62,400. Alati had had been in the silence and dark for 20 days.</p> <p>Young was relieved. He had come to a gradual realization that he hadn\u2019t given enough weight to the fact that Alati was there by choice. \u201cSo if you\u2019re in solitary confinement in prison, that\u2019s a scary situation. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to get out ever,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, if he lasts, he gets 100k, but these guys in solitary confinement get nothing \u2013 they have to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Kupers says that distinction \u2013 \u201cremembering why he is there, that it is not permanent\u201d \u2013 is crucial. \u201cPrisoners in solitary confinement tell me they are afraid they will never be released and they will die in solitary.\u201d</p> <p>Alati, after his own taste of isolation, agrees. \u201c[Prisoners in solitary] are not given a bathtub with sugar scrubs, and essential oil and food, and a yoga mat. They\u2019re not given that stuff, so if I didn\u2019t have that stuff, and I wasn\u2019t actually free and I wasn\u2019t being paid, that\u2019s why [it would be a] punishment.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Alati was ready to leave the bathroom. He put on eclipse sunglasses, which blocked out any light, to protect his eyes. When he finally emerged, the noise and commotion was overwhelming. He was handed a phone, and Alati looked at it for a moment, remembering that life existed with phones and technology, before he began speaking into it. It was his sister.</p> <p>Friends and family surrounded him, and social interaction was \u201ca bit of a culture shock\u201d. He was surprised by the number of choices he had and that social niceties needed to be observed. \u201cI knew how to do everything \u2013 I just forgot,\u201d Alati says. \u201cI can\u2019t just start doing push-ups on a bathtub in front of people. I can\u2019t just start walking around with no underwear.\u201d</p> <p>Despite paying out $62,400, Young is happy he took the bet. \u201cI think it is a good story of when two people want to test whether they can do something, they do it in a fair environment and can work together, and even though one of us lost a sizable chunk of money, we both feel great about it.\u201d</p> <p>Alati says he is happy, too. He hopes his story serves as a positive for others about overcoming challenges in a world of bad news. He says he has learned to value patience and things we take for granted, like chairs, tables and lamps or simply being outside. \u201cWe truly go about our day to day and put up these blinders because there\u2019s so much distraction, but if you just look at the world with a different perspective and just see it, this is something,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is really something.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Three \u2013 or was it four? \u2013 days after he shut himself in a pitch-black bathroom, Rich Alati started to hallucinate. He saw little white, bubble-like balls, floating around the room. To calm himself he imagined he was in a magical cloud, cozy and relaxed. Embracing the visions was key. \u201cOr else,\u201d he says, \u201cyou might get a little scared.\u201d Alati was in the dark for a bet, which makes a little more sense once you know he is a professional poker player. On 10 September last year, the American was sitting at a poker table at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, when he was asked a question by a fellow professional player, Rory Young: how much would it take for him to spend time in complete isolation, with no light, for 30 days? An hour later a price had been agreed: $100,000. Young would hand over the money if Alati could last 30 days in a soundproofed bathroom with no light. He would be delivered food from a local restaurant, but the meals would come at irregular intervals to prevent him from keeping track of time. There would be no TV, radio, phone or access to the outside world but he would be allowed some comforts: a yoga mat, resistance band, massage ball, and, appropriately for a bathroom, lavender essential oils as well as a sugar and salt scrub. If Alati failed he would have to pay Young $100,000. Poker players are known to bet on just about anything but some thought Alati had taken things too far. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do this bet for any amount of money,\u201d professional poker player Danielle Moon Anderson noted at the time. Dr Michael Munro, a psychologist Young consulted before agreeing to the bet, told Young: \u201cEven if he lasts for 30 days, it will be extremely taxing on his mental health for the short and potentially long term.\u201d There\u2019s good reason for such caution. Solitary confinement is often used as punishment, most notably in the United States, where inmates in solitary are isolated in their cells 23 hours a day. The United Nations\u2019 Nelson Mandela Rules state that keeping someone in solitary for more than 15 days constitutes torture. Dr Terry Kupers, a psychiatrist at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, says the bet risked trivializing solitary confinement. \u201cAnxiety, anger and despair, often with a high risk of suicide, is the average clinical presentation of prisoners in solitary,\u201d he says. While there would be notable differences between Alati\u2019s experiences and those of a prisoner in solitary \u2013 most notably, he could leave at any time \u2013 Young believed the American was unlikely to last the 30 days. \u201cIt\u2019s just so cruel to the human mind to do that,\u201d he says. But Alati was confident. He had practiced meditation and yoga, and was certain his experiences at silent retreats would help him. On 21 November, a crowd of families and friends gathered at the house where the challenge would take place. Alati and Young\u2019s lawyers were there as well as cameramen from a production company interested in buying television rights to the story. For that reason, as well as safety, the entire bet would be recorded. Alati\u2019s father was given the power to pull Alati out at any time should he show signs of not being \u201cin the right headspace,\u201d as Alati puts it. At 8.05pm, Alati walked into the bathroom, and darkness fell. He stood for a moment, frozen. Then he lay down and fell asleep. *** The bathroom mirrors were covered to prevent any reflection, and the doors, though unlocked, were sealed to block out any light. A mattress was wedged between the sink and a countertop. In front of the sink and next to the mattress was Alati\u2019s yoga mat. And across from that was the bathtub. \u201cMy memory is really good,\u201d Alati says. He had examined the room before the challenge started, and when he woke up in complete darkness, he could picture his surroundings. He told himself that he should do what he normally does when he wakes up, and began his routine. He brushed his teeth. He then filled up the bathtub, adding Epsom salts and lavender oil to calm his mind, and scoured himself with the sugar and salt scrub. From the bath, he went to the shower in the corner of the room to rinse off. He then headed to the sink, where he used Q-tips on his ears, combed his hair, and lotioned his body. He got dressed and ate. He did yoga and meditated. \u201cI was remembering where everything is, and everything goes back to that exact place,\u201d Alati says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I live my life anyways.\u201d And that was his plan. He was going to live his normal life as if normal \u201cwas living in darkness for the rest of my life.\u201d He had 720 hours and absolutely no distractions \u2013 and he\u2019d use that time to improve himself. \u201cHow can I give myself a better sugar scrub ... how can I stretch it deeper, how can I be more calm, how can I be more patient?\u201d he says. From the outside his life was, well, a little dull. Young, who had began watching the video stream in earnest, said \u201cit became a bit boring after a while because it\u2019s not like he\u2019s doing anything different.\u201d The biggest hurdles were mental. As well as the hallucinations, his thoughts twice started to spiral negatively, fast. \u201cIt happened so quick. It went from positive thoughts to like what if, what if, what if?\u201d Alati says. Such thoughts were dangerous without company to distract him. In isolation, they could lead to despair. When they cropped up, Alati started doing yoga, and he refocused on his body, on his pose and stretch. Some parts were easier. With so much time and only himself for company, Alati\u2019s thoughts were a source of entertainment and a lifeline. \u201cThe thoughts would just come to you, and if you don\u2019t make sure that they go in a good direction, they can spiderweb out of control and lead you to a bad place,\u201d Alati says. *** Around the 10-day mark, Young started to worry that Alati might make the 30 days, noting he looked \u201ctotally fine\u201d. He worried he had miscalculated: Young hadn\u2019t known Alati \u2013 a gregarious, fast talker \u2013 for long before they had made the bet. \u201cHis personality did not reflect that of someone who was proficient with meditation,\u201d Young said. On day 15, Young\u2019s voice came on over the loudspeaker. Alati jumped out of bed, happy to hear a voice that wasn\u2019t his own. Young told Alati that he had been in for around two weeks and that he had an offer for him: Alati could leave if he paid out $50,000. Alati\u2019s laughed in disbelief. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Alati recalls telling Young. \u201cDude, I just sat in here for two weeks, and you want me to hand over half my money?\u201d He laid back down discouraged. He\u2019d spent 15 long days in the bathroom \u2013 \u201cno walk in the park\u201d in his words \u2013 and he had to gear up for 15 more. \u201cIt was a pretty aggressive negotiation tactic by me,\u201d Young concedes. He waited a few days and came back with another offer. Alati was skeptical. \u201cI don\u2019t know, kid, your buyout offers are trash,\u201d Alati recalls telling Young. Young offered to pay Alati $25,000 to come out. The money was finally in Alati\u2019s favor. He considered the offer for an hour \u2013 and then declined. Alati waited for a few days until Young came back on the loudspeaker and asked if he had any offers of his own. Alati said he wouldn\u2019t come out for less than $75,000, to which Young countered with an offer of $40,000. They settled on $62,400. Alati had had been in the silence and dark for 20 days. Young was relieved. He had come to a gradual realization that he hadn\u2019t given enough weight to the fact that Alati was there by choice. \u201cSo if you\u2019re in solitary confinement in prison, that\u2019s a scary situation. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to get out ever,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, if he lasts, he gets 100k, but these guys in solitary confinement get nothing \u2013 they have to do that.\u201d Kupers says that distinction \u2013 \u201cremembering why he is there, that it is not permanent\u201d \u2013 is crucial. \u201cPrisoners in solitary confinement tell me they are afraid they will never be released and they will die in solitary.\u201d Alati, after his own taste of isolation, agrees. \u201c[Prisoners in solitary] are not given a bathtub with sugar scrubs, and essential oil and food, and a yoga mat. They\u2019re not given that stuff, so if I didn\u2019t have that stuff, and I wasn\u2019t actually free and I wasn\u2019t being paid, that\u2019s why [it would be a] punishment.\u201d *** Alati was ready to leave the bathroom. He put on eclipse sunglasses, which blocked out any light, to protect his eyes. When he finally emerged, the noise and commotion was overwhelming. He was handed a phone, and Alati looked at it for a moment, remembering that life existed with phones and technology, before he began speaking into it. It was his sister. Friends and family surrounded him, and social interaction was \u201ca bit of a culture shock\u201d. He was surprised by the number of choices he had and that social niceties needed to be observed. \u201cI knew how to do everything \u2013 I just forgot,\u201d Alati says. \u201cI can\u2019t just start doing push-ups on a bathtub in front of people. I can\u2019t just start walking around with no underwear.\u201d Despite paying out $62,400, Young is happy he took the bet. \u201cI think it is a good story of when two people want to test whether they can do something, they do it in a fair environment and can work together, and even though one of us lost a sizable chunk of money, we both feel great about it.\u201d Alati says he is happy, too. He hopes his story serves as a positive for others about overcoming challenges in a world of bad news. He says he has learned to value patience and things we take for granted, like chairs, tables and lamps or simply being outside. \u201cWe truly go about our day to day and put up these blinders because there\u2019s so much distraction, but if you just look at the world with a different perspective and just see it, this is something,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is really something.\u201d",

May\u2019s emphasis on generations of NHS users may be cliched political rhetoric \u2013 the children, as they say, are our future \u2013 but by pitching public services as a deal between the generations, she quite unintentionally landed on something important. This country\u2019s health and care system is currently riddled with a damaging generational divide, one that manifests itself in anything from a deficit in joined up services to outright bad feeling. Prof Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, the largest representative body for independent social care services in the country, recently warned the UK was \u201ccompletely and institutionally ageist\u201d, saving particular scorn for the health and social care system. \u201cOlder people don\u2019t get the services they have a legal right to,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, a younger person with brain damage will have a care plan from the NHS that includes maintaining links with their family and accessing education.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see why those working with older people feel ageism is rife.

Working-age disabled people are currently enduring horrendous social care treatment, with many as young as 20 forced to go to bed at 6pm and to watch their youth squandered away. Perhaps the greatest intergenerational divide comes in how to pay for social care. A recent poll showed a stark gulf in opinion, with younger adults far less keen than older people to raise taxes to fund social care: while 54% of over-65s saw increasing taxation as the best solution to ease pressure on the system, fewer than one in four of those aged 18 to 44 agreed. Instead, younger people were more likely to want volunteers to help plug the gap in social care provision. It\u2019s not hard to see why. Asking squeezed millennials like me to pay more tax for the future is a hard sell when you\u2019re struggling with the rent, squeezed wages, and no pension plan now.

It would be easy, then, to believe social care was completely irrelevant to our young lives. And yet it is a system that we will all come face to face with at some point, if not as a user then as a carer.

It was a creative renaissance. Directors seized the chance to get weird. Paul Thomas Anderson scored $37m to assemble the lyrical montage Magnolia. David O Russell shouldered $47m to satirize the Gulf war. Even Spike Jonze, a music video director with zero film credits to his name, secured $13m to transport audiences to a multiverse of John Malkoviches.</p> <p>The risk paid off. These up-and-coming directors became major 21st-century voices. Still, part of the reason Anderson, Russell and Jonze are still the kings of the kooks is that today\u2019s directors haven\u2019t been given the same golden ticket. The talent exists; the cash doesn\u2019t. Ambitious mid-priced films went extinct when the DVD empire began to crumble in 2008. Instead of betting on auteurs, studios put their chips on big screen superheroes. Break out at this year\u2019s Sundance, and instead of being handed the freedom to dream, you\u2019ll be given the keys to a franchise \u2013 and a conference table of producers as chaperones. Or you\u2019ll stay small and scrappy forever, cranking out a terrific body of work that struggles to be seen amid the crush of streaming media competing for the audience\u2019s attention at a couple bucks a pop, or flat-out free.</p> <p>Much has changed. Twenty years ago, two big-budget Julia Roberts romantic comedies atop the box office chart was a given. Now, both the genre and the star have been squired to streaming. Raunchy teenage comedies like American Pie are, like, totally awkward in an era where dating and sex are on the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/fewer-teens-having-sex-as-decline-in-risky-behaviors-continue/2018/01/04/a868bf84-f15c-11e7-97bf-bba379b809ab_story.html?noredirect=on\">decline</a>, and raunchy teenage dramas like Cruel Intentions are cloistered on TV to be recast as Riverdale characters who audiences can still safely see as cartoons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"25728641ee0d9d9e2dbd663007cd2fb107af72a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25728641ee0d9d9e2dbd663007cd2fb107af72a9/0_0_2579_1690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Buena Vista</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sex is out, horror is in. And for that, we can thank 1999, too, as The Blair Witch Project launched a mania for mirco-budget nightmares that refuses to crawl back under the bed. The Blair Witch Project (which still holds up fabulously) begat Paranormal Activity which begat Blumhouse Pictures who begat everything from The Purge to Get Out to Insidious to Sinister. Add all four of their budgets together, and they <em>still</em> cost less than Being John Malkovich \u2013 even without inflation. As for M Night Shyamalan, hyped as \u201cThe Next Spielberg\u201d on the cover of Newsweek after The Sixth Sense, he\u2019s finally accepted the Spielberg\u2019s populist template never fit an egotist who prefers to provoke. He\u2019s also found happiness in low-budget thrills like The Visit, Split and the upcoming Glass (all three produced, of course, by Blumhouse).</p> <p>Probe the films of 1999 and a suspicion slithers in that we\u2019re stuck in The Matrix ourselves. The near past is repeating like a programming glitch, or, say, an endless parade of Malcovi. There\u2019s deja vu remakes of Tarzan and The Mummy and Pok\u00e9mon and Galaxy Quest and the just-announced Toy Story 4. The Star Wars universe continues to propel the box office, as it\u2019s done since The Phantom Menace. Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst\u2019s comedy Dick about two teen girls who bring down Nixon\u2019s corrupt administration makes for an apropos rewatch, as does Alexander Payne\u2019s black comedy Election, in which a high-achieving blonde female candidate hamstrung by sexism and fraud loses her campaign to a dummy who never seriously intended to win. And if the Oscars mimic this year\u2019s Golden Globes, Green Book winning best picture will be cringeworthy as American Beauty beating a field of worthier contenders in 1999. At least Kevin Spacey won\u2019t be in attendance.</p> <p>But we\u2019re also feeling a deeper connection to 1999, one that vibrates in our wiring. The Y2K panic triggered film-makers to think pessimistically about the future of human survival. The Wachowskis assumed we were toast. Kevin Smith\u2019s Dogma and the Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick End of Days embraced the apocalypse. And David Fincher\u2019s Fight Club and Sam Mendes\u2019s American Beauty feared that mankind had become too weak and materialistic to survive the millennium.</p> <p>What\u2019s scary about today \u2013 a time in which our nerves are again quivering with anxieties about capitalism, despotism and an all-but-inevitable environmental catastrophe \u2013 is that we\u2019ve now been shaped by those films\u2019 misanthropy. Not just the mens rights activists who\u2019ve adopted The Matrix\u2019s red pill/blue pill analogy as their own twisted \u201ctruth\u201d or the Twitter trolls incubated on the internet who idolize Fight Club\u2019s Tyler Durden. As for the solution, Fincher suggested boxing and domestic terrorism. Mendes touted weightlifting, crushing on underage girls, and, ultimately, suicide.</p> <p>In 1999, our heroes didn\u2019t win. They failed, they disappeared, they died, they blew up their world. And they left a residue of cynicism we\u2019re still scraping off, from our political apathy to the studios\u2019 resentment that their DVD cash cow dropped dead. \u201cThe future is our world, Morpheus,\u201d gloated The Matrix\u2019s Agent Smith. He was right. Yet, we can change our tomorrow.</p>",

Even Spike Jonze, a music video director with zero film credits to his name, secured $13m to transport audiences to a multiverse of John Malkoviches. The risk paid off. These up-and-coming directors became major 21st-century voices. Still, part of the reason Anderson, Russell and Jonze are still the kings of the kooks is that today\u2019s directors haven\u2019t been given the same golden ticket. The talent exists; the cash doesn\u2019t. Ambitious mid-priced films went extinct when the DVD empire began to crumble in 2008. Instead of betting on auteurs, studios put their chips on big screen superheroes. Break out at this year\u2019s Sundance, and instead of being handed the freedom to dream, you\u2019ll be given the keys to a franchise \u2013 and a conference table of producers as chaperones. Or you\u2019ll stay small and scrappy forever, cranking out a terrific body of work that struggles to be seen amid the crush of streaming media competing for the audience\u2019s attention at a couple bucks a pop, or flat-out free. Much has changed. Twenty years ago, two big-budget Julia Roberts romantic comedies atop the box office chart was a given. Now, both the genre and the star have been squired to streaming. Raunchy teenage comedies like American Pie are, like, totally awkward in an era where dating and sex are on the decline, and raunchy teenage dramas like Cruel Intentions are cloistered on TV to be recast as Riverdale characters who audiences can still safely see as cartoons. Sex is out, horror is in. And for that, we can thank 1999, too, as The Blair Witch Project launched a mania for mirco-budget nightmares that refuses to crawl back under the bed. The Blair Witch Project (which still holds up fabulously) begat Paranormal Activity which begat Blumhouse Pictures who begat everything from The Purge to Get Out to Insidious to Sinister. Add all four of their budgets together, and they still cost less than Being John Malkovich \u2013 even without inflation. As for M Night Shyamalan, hyped as \u201cThe Next Spielberg\u201d on the cover of Newsweek after The Sixth Sense, he\u2019s finally accepted the Spielberg\u2019s populist template never fit an egotist who prefers to provoke. He\u2019s also found happiness in low-budget thrills like The Visit, Split and the upcoming Glass (all three produced, of course, by Blumhouse). Probe the films of 1999 and a suspicion slithers in that we\u2019re stuck in The Matrix ourselves. The near past is repeating like a programming glitch, or, say, an endless parade of Malcovi. There\u2019s deja vu remakes of Tarzan and The Mummy and Pok\u00e9mon and Galaxy Quest and the just-announced Toy Story 4. The Star Wars universe continues to propel the box office, as it\u2019s done since The Phantom Menace. Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst\u2019s comedy Dick about two teen girls who bring down Nixon\u2019s corrupt administration makes for an apropos rewatch, as does Alexander Payne\u2019s black comedy Election, in which a high-achieving blonde female candidate hamstrung by sexism and fraud loses her campaign to a dummy who never seriously intended to win. And if the Oscars mimic this year\u2019s Golden Globes, Green Book winning best picture will be cringeworthy as American Beauty beating a field of worthier contenders in 1999. At least Kevin Spacey won\u2019t be in attendance. But we\u2019re also feeling a deeper connection to 1999, one that vibrates in our wiring. The Y2K panic triggered film-makers to think pessimistically about the future of human survival. The Wachowskis assumed we were toast. Kevin Smith\u2019s Dogma and the Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick End of Days embraced the apocalypse. And David Fincher\u2019s Fight Club and Sam Mendes\u2019s American Beauty feared that mankind had become too weak and materialistic to survive the millennium. What\u2019s scary about today \u2013 a time in which our nerves are again quivering with anxieties about capitalism, despotism and an all-but-inevitable environmental catastrophe \u2013 is that we\u2019ve now been shaped by those films\u2019 misanthropy. Not just the mens rights activists who\u2019ve adopted The Matrix\u2019s red pill/blue pill analogy as their own twisted \u201ctruth\u201d or the Twitter trolls incubated on the internet who idolize Fight Club\u2019s Tyler Durden. As for the solution, Fincher suggested boxing and domestic terrorism. Mendes touted weightlifting, crushing on underage girls, and, ultimately, suicide. In 1999, our heroes didn\u2019t win. They failed, they disappeared, they died, they blew up their world. And they left a residue of cynicism we\u2019re still scraping off, from our political apathy to the studios\u2019 resentment that their DVD cash cow dropped dead. \u201cThe future is our world, Morpheus,\u201d gloated The Matrix\u2019s Agent Smith. He was right. Yet, we can change our tomorrow.",

My team is working tirelessly to apprehend those responsible for this cowardly attack.\u201d</p> <p>Writing on Facebook, Josh Grant, who said he was the victim\u2019s uncle, said: \u201cRip to my little nephew, stabbed 7 times today in London. Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m never gonna see you again. Uncle Josh will never forget you.\u201d</p> <p>He wrote that the family had moved to London from Arnold in Nottingham six months ago and that he had warned his nephew to behave. \u201c[He] didn\u2019t listen. He looked up to me so much. I tried to show the right way. I feel so shit and upset right now.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking at the scene in Leyton, Solomon, who would not give his second name, said he had previously been in a relationship with Jaden\u2019s grandmother and that the boy was \u201ca good, loving child\u201d who was \u201csensible and knowledgable\u201d. </p> <p>The factors driving such violence are being urgently studied as the homicide rate rises and drug markets change.</p> <p>A council-commissioned report in Waltham Forest, which looked at youth violence and gangs, found that poverty and the drug trade were key factors. It found that younger children were being recruited as drug runners, and some aged 12-17 were said to be increasingly involved in serious violence, both as victims and perpetrators.</p> <p>The gangs were driven increasingly by profits from the illegal drug market, rather than postcode rivalries and protecting territory, the study by academics at London South Bank University found.</p> <p>The report found that gangs in the area were grooming children as young as 10, sometimes persuading them to commit a petty crime such as shoplifting as a means of normalising criminal behaviour.</p> <p>Clare Coghill, the leader of Waltham Forest council, said poverty had left young people vulnerable to being drawn into gang activity. Speaking about the report\u2019s findings, she said: \u201cThese kids are not doing this to get cars and trainers. They are doing this to eat and have a sense of social belonging.\u201d</p> <p>Crime is an issue that worries locals. A close family friend, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cMy sister and I drove down [Bickley Road] 15 minutes before it happened. I can\u2019t believe it. We\u2019re going to keep having this conversation until people do something about it. They should have cameras on all these roads because they know these are the hot roads where things are happening.</p> <p>\u201cMy brothers were just asking my mum if we can move because it\u2019s really bad here. My brother has been targeted before. He got jumped out on and he doesn\u2019t even know who these people are. It was probably a case of mistaken identity. He had to run home. It\u2019s just not safe.\u201d</p> <p>Jaden is believed to be the youngest murder victim in London since 14-year-old Corey Junior Davis was shot dead in Forest Gate in September 2017. There were 134 homicides in 2018, the highest since 2008.</p> <p>On Tuesday night witnesses described how the 14-year-old was knocked off his motor scooter \u2013 which threw his helmet 10 metres away \u2013 before his attackers stabbed him, including in the back. Jaden\u2019s killing is one of three violent incidents in five days in Leyton. On Wednesday afternoon a man is thought to have been injured in an attack on Bromley Street, three streets down from where Jaden was killed the previous evening. On Saturday a woman in her 30s was stabbed on Church Street, a short walk away. Police said there was nothing to suggest that the incidents were linked at this stage.</p> <p>Police said a section 60 order was in place, which allows officers to stop and search people within a defined area without needs for reasonable grounds and in order to prevent and deter further violence.</p>",

Soole said: \u201cEverything we know so far points to the fact that this appears to be a targeted attack and those who carried it out had only one objective, which was to inflict fatal injuries on Jaden. \u201cWe continue to investigate why Jaden was singled out and retain an open mind at this time. My team is working tirelessly to apprehend those responsible for this cowardly attack.\u201d Writing on Facebook, Josh Grant, who said he was the victim\u2019s uncle, said: \u201cRip to my little nephew, stabbed 7 times today in London. Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m never gonna see you again. Uncle Josh will never forget you.\u201d He wrote that the family had moved to London from Arnold in Nottingham six months ago and that he had warned his nephew to behave. \u201c[He] didn\u2019t listen. He looked up to me so much. I tried to show the right way. I feel so shit and upset right now.\u201d Speaking at the scene in Leyton, Solomon, who would not give his second name, said he had previously been in a relationship with Jaden\u2019s grandmother and that the boy was \u201ca good, loving child\u201d who was \u201csensible and knowledgable\u201d. The factors driving such violence are being urgently studied as the homicide rate rises and drug markets change. A council-commissioned report in Waltham Forest, which looked at youth violence and gangs, found that poverty and the drug trade were key factors. It found that younger children were being recruited as drug runners, and some aged 12-17 were said to be increasingly involved in serious violence, both as victims and perpetrators. The gangs were driven increasingly by profits from the illegal drug market, rather than postcode rivalries and protecting territory, the study by academics at London South Bank University found. The report found that gangs in the area were grooming children as young as 10, sometimes persuading them to commit a petty crime such as shoplifting as a means of normalising criminal behaviour. Clare Coghill, the leader of Waltham Forest council, said poverty had left young people vulnerable to being drawn into gang activity. Speaking about the report\u2019s findings, she said: \u201cThese kids are not doing this to get cars and trainers. They are doing this to eat and have a sense of social belonging.\u201d Crime is an issue that worries locals. A close family friend, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cMy sister and I drove down [Bickley Road] 15 minutes before it happened. I can\u2019t believe it. We\u2019re going to keep having this conversation until people do something about it. They should have cameras on all these roads because they know these are the hot roads where things are happening. \u201cMy brothers were just asking my mum if we can move because it\u2019s really bad here. My brother has been targeted before. He got jumped out on and he doesn\u2019t even know who these people are. It was probably a case of mistaken identity. He had to run home. It\u2019s just not safe.\u201d Jaden is believed to be the youngest murder victim in London since 14-year-old Corey Junior Davis was shot dead in Forest Gate in September 2017. There were 134 homicides in 2018, the highest since 2008. On Tuesday night witnesses described how the 14-year-old was knocked off his motor scooter \u2013 which threw his helmet 10 metres away \u2013 before his attackers stabbed him, including in the back. Jaden\u2019s killing is one of three violent incidents in five days in Leyton. On Wednesday afternoon a man is thought to have been injured in an attack on Bromley Street, three streets down from where Jaden was killed the previous evening. On Saturday a woman in her 30s was stabbed on Church Street, a short walk away. Police said there was nothing to suggest that the incidents were linked at this stage. Police said a section 60 order was in place, which allows officers to stop and search people within a defined area without needs for reasonable grounds and in order to prevent and deter further violence.",

Jan, an IT specialist from the former Yugoslavia, has set up a new business in Switzerland where he says the approach could not be more welcoming. He said the drop in the value of the pound \u201ckilled\u201d his business because the cost of paying subcontractors in places such as Romania and India has shot up, destroying his margin.

His story reflects the struggles of many small to medium-sized businesses hit by the collapse of the pound after the referendum and its continuing weakness today. Jan, who did not want his real name used, managed to get well paid jobs in the capital and diverted some of his savings into a fund which eventually allowed him to set up his own business developing e-learning apps and games.

The country is not in the EU but it couldn\u2019t be more different than Britain post-2016. \u201cIt is amazing to me that Britain by \u2018wanting more control\u2019 in 2016 decided to become more like Serbia in 1988 than Switzerland in 2018,\u201d he said. He said he is watching from the sidelines with interest but predicts mayhem in the event of a no-deal Brexit for small to medium-sized businesses with sub-contractors in Europe. After Brexit he predicts it will become difficult to move money around, as he found out when he moved lock, stock and barrel to Switzerland. \u201cWhen I moved, the bank were imposing restrictions all of a sudden. It might have been to do with money-laundering measures, but the fact is it is difficult and who knows what will happen after Brexit? Who knows what the banks will do?\u201d he said,. \u201cI would like to stress that we were pure net positive for UK, taking the money from US customers and bringing it to Her Majesty in the form of taxes. This was new money that did not exist before in the UK. Frankly, I still can\u2019t believe what has happened and that a nation can work actively to chase out people like me. \u201cI still keep the company in the UK but only for minor UK-based transactions, and maybe in the tiny remote hope that this madness will be stopped. \u201cNobody seems to care about how small businesses will function day to day with international trade and nobody is taking care of this in an organised manner. I decided I could not have my business held hostage so moved and I got out,\u201d he said. If you are a small business owner and are being impacted by Brexit, email lisa.ocarroll@theguardian.com",

He has crushed dissent at home and wreaked havoc abroad, propping up a dictator in Syria, allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/26/skripal-poisonings-bungled-assassination-kremlin-putin-salisbury\">poisoning people in the UK</a> and helping elect Donald Trump as the American president. No wonder he has been described as the most powerful man in the world.</p> <p>Now Putin, judo black belt and former KGB agent, is to be portrayed on the Washington DC stage, just two miles from the White House. On 18 January, <a href=\"https://www.arenastage.org/tickets/season-landing/kleptocracy/\">Kleptocracy,</a> directed by Jackson Gay and penned by Kenneth Lin, a former writer on House of Cards, will receive its world premiere at the Arena Stage theatre.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/03/broadway-2019-clintons-tootsie-beetlejuice-what-to-expect\">The Clintons, Tootsie and Beetlejuice: what to expect on Broadway in 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The play, written before the US election in 2016, is inspired by the power struggle between Putin and the wealthy oligarch <a href=\"https://www.khodorkovsky.com/\">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is a crossroads in history when it was hoped Russia would embrace western liberal capitalism and become \u201cmore like us\u201d. It did not quite work out that way. The play is also an undeniably timely exploration of US-Russia relations after the cold war.</p> <p>The man who will play Putin is Christopher Geary, 30, previously seen in the Geffen Playhouse\u2019s These Paper Bullets! Although the Russian president is <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/beck-bennett-15166/impersonation/vladimir-putin-285102\">parodied by a bare-chested Beck Bennett</a> on Saturday Night Live, neither Geary nor Lin is aware of him having been portrayed in American theatre before.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s utterly enigmatic and fascinating and very disciplined in some manners and then selfish and can be cruel,\u201d Geary says. \u201cBut I think what I\u2019m trying to focus on is I have to find the humanity in him because it does exist, and trying to find what he wants deep down is really essential.\u201d</p> <p>Putin is not the kind of person you would want to encounter on a dark night. To take one example, in 2007 <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/12/europe/putin-merkel-scared-dog/index.html\">he brought his big black pet labrador</a> in to meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who looked distinctly uncomfortable \u2013 she has reportedly been fearful of dogs since one attacked her in 1995. But the Putin presented to Washington audiences will not be a pantomime villain.</p> <p>Geary continues: \u201cPutin goes home at night and goes to bed with thoughts and concerns, just like everybody else. So it\u2019s that headspace that I\u2019m more interested in. My job as an actor is to employ empathy, every character that I play. You hear in training: don\u2019t judge your character, don\u2019t judge your character. Empathy, I think, is one of the most powerful tools that an actor can use.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53b87496d118471ba8242c91d66fc17da2ec6c4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53b87496d118471ba8242c91d66fc17da2ec6c4d/0_0_6049_4033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Geary as Vladimir Putin, Max Woertendyke as Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Bront\u00eb England-Nelson as Inna Khodorkovsky)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Geary as Vladimir Putin, Max Woertendyke as Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Bront\u00eb England-Nelson as Inna Khodorkovsky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Powell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the Russian autocrat\u2019s public posturing will be recreated on stage, but so will his mysterious interior life. \u201cYou do see flashes of his public persona but you also see a private Putin, moments where he is talking directly to the audience.

So I said: \u2018Of course I\u2019ll write this play for you, it\u2019s very interesting, I\u2019m not sure that people are going to want to see a Broadway play about Vladimir Putin.\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cBut the world has changed a lot since then.\u201d</p> <p>When Lin consulted Putin experts, their general advice was: \u201cDon\u2019t get too poetic with him, he\u2019s not this grand figure, he is a bureaucrat.\u201d But that hardly makes for good theatre. The playwright says: \u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t have that influence on the world so if you\u2019re dramatising that character, since he is a public figure that looms so large, you\u2019re not necessarily trying to create a facsimile of the man, you\u2019re trying to create a facsimile of what he does to the world.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s the danger of what might happen if he allowed this oligarch to become the most powerful and popular and wealthiest and beloved person in Russia. These are the things that Putin has to grapple with. He\u2019s not only this kind of cipher that American media has presented him to be. He\u2019s a person who has to grapple with very real problems of being the leader of Russia, and these are problems that are baked into Russia in a lot of ways because of what\u2019s transpired before.\u201d</p> <p>This is also Khodorkovsky\u2019s play. He was the richest and arguably most ruthless oligarch during the wild west capitalism that filled the Soviet vacuum. He owned the country\u2019s biggest oil company, Yukos, and sought to open Russia\u2019s markets to the world, only to find Putin blocking his path. Khodorkovsky spent a decade in prison on fraud and embezzlement charges that many analysts believe to have been politically motivated. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/20/mikhail-khodorkovsky-freed-putin-pardon-russia\">He was released in 2013</a> after Putin pardoned him and since lived in exile in Switzerland and the UK.</p> <p>Lin reflects: \u201cIt\u2019s very much a story about an outsider. The fact that <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/russia-s-yukos-trial-is-anti-semitism-at-the-heart-of-mikhail-khodorkovsky-s-prosecution-a-353670.html\">Khodorkovsky was Jewish in Russia</a> is a very big deal. There were lots of constraints that were put on his life because of his heritage. For me, as a Chinese man living in America and feeling like the other and always on the hunt for opportunities to get into the cracks, to entrench myself, to root myself even more in this country, I really understood that character. Here we have the privatisation of a world superpower: this is the greatest opportunity any outsider can have to get inside.\u201d</p> <p>Khodorkovsky found himself in a struggle with Putin for the soul of Russia. \u201cKhodorkovsky could have sold his oil company to an American oil company, and a Russian oil company would have been able to be traded on the stock exchange. Russia could have been opened up to the west as per what it seems like Khodorkovsky\u2019s plans were. Who knows how things would have really happened. It\u2019s a battle of wills for who\u2019s going to win at the end and be the top dog, certainly, but also which direction is this country going to be taken in.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.arenastage.org/about-us/whos-who/leadership/\">Molly Smith,</a> artistic director of Arena Stage, has described Kleptocracy, with its depiction of capitalist greed, corruption and chaos, as \u201cthe most dangerous play\u201d it will mount this season. Lin asks: \u201cWhen does capitalism turn into kleptocracy? When does democracy fall prey to manipulation? What is our greater impact on the world stage?

      "body": "<p>A lot is riding on Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman, which <a href=\"http://link.hollywoodreporter.com/view/5716b3778cc2b2f6768b46919alx9.69a/6b5741f0\">a new report suggests</a> is due to begin shooting in November - with or without Ben Affleck as the tortured Dark Knight.</p> <p>Warner Bros\u2019 struggling DC extended universe of superhero movies currently lacks a central pivot, despite decent enough solo outings for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/04/wonder-woman-review-gloriously-badass-breath-fresh-air-gal-gadot\">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/11/aquaman-review-a-complete-bellyflop-jason-momoa\">Aquaman</a>. The studio would love to see Reeves somehow come up with a movie that repositions the caped crusader at the heart of the DC world. And yet it is difficult to see how the main creative thrust behind the successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/11/rise-planet-of-apes-review\">Planet of the Apes remake</a> trilogy can carve out his own vision without taking Batman out of the Justice League, and potentially the DCEU itself, altogether. Bruce Wayne surely needs to be given the chance to breathe the foul Gotham City air once again, free of responsibility for fending off attacks from bad CGI alien interlopers or resurrecting Superman due to his own foolhardy behaviour. Everything we\u2019ve heard about Reeves\u2019 plans <a href=\"https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2018/08/02/matt-reeves-just-revealed-a-whole-bunch-of-things-about-the-batman\">suggests he will take a back-to-basics approach</a>, restoring the furrow-browed superhero to his roots as a sleuth-some Gotham City vigilante.</p> <p>This has to be a good thing. For the last three years, ever since Zack Snyder\u2019s ill-fated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/22/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-ben-affleck-henry-cavill\">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a> failed to wow anyone outside a hardcore of DC fans, Warner has been trying and failing to convince the world that Batfleck was a good idea poorly managed. It did this by tweaking the movie\u2019s sequels and spin-offs to rid them of the worst knuckleheaded excesses of Snyder\u2019s films. But the truth is that casting Affleck was a terrible idea carried out terribly, and no amount of shoehorned \u201ccomedy\u201d one-liners was going to save films such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/15/justice-league-ben-affleck-dc-comics\">Justice League</a> from being roundly dismissed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60ac5023b99481104c1936897c27efed38bd2e35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60ac5023b99481104c1936897c27efed38bd2e35/0_213_4995_2997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One-liners \u2026 Justice League.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One-liners \u2026 Justice League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The temptation must surely be for Reeves to make with the Lazarus Pit, and resurrect a new and more workable Batman \u2013 preferably played by anyone but Affleck. Perhaps DC needs two cinematic universes: one based on the grimy Gotham underworld and its cavalcade of leering freaks and deviants; the other filled with sci-fi-tinged superheroes who wouldn\u2019t look out of place in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/15/the-20-best-marvel-films-ranked\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, such as Aquaman, Wonder Woman and the Flash.</p> <p>For the Batman of Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight trilogy, or the TV series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/dec/05/gotham-dick-tracy-batman-lot-of-fun\">Gotham</a>, has often seemed about as likely to meet Superman or the other members of the Justice League as Luke Skywalker is to encounter Genghis Khan. It is quite possible to imagine the worst big-screen caped crusaders, George Clooney or Val Kilmer, meeting just about anyone in the DC \u2019verse \u2013 even the buffoonish Shazam!

      "bodyText": "A lot is riding on Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman, which a new report suggests is due to begin shooting in November - with or without Ben Affleck as the tortured Dark Knight. Warner Bros\u2019 struggling DC extended universe of superhero movies currently lacks a central pivot, despite decent enough solo outings for Wonder Woman and Aquaman. The studio would love to see Reeves somehow come up with a movie that repositions the caped crusader at the heart of the DC world. And yet it is difficult to see how the main creative thrust behind the successful Planet of the Apes remake trilogy can carve out his own vision without taking Batman out of the Justice League, and potentially the DCEU itself, altogether. Bruce Wayne surely needs to be given the chance to breathe the foul Gotham City air once again, free of responsibility for fending off attacks from bad CGI alien interlopers or resurrecting Superman due to his own foolhardy behaviour. Everything we\u2019ve heard about Reeves\u2019 plans suggests he will take a back-to-basics approach, restoring the furrow-browed superhero to his roots as a sleuth-some Gotham City vigilante. This has to be a good thing. For the last three years, ever since Zack Snyder\u2019s ill-fated Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice failed to wow anyone outside a hardcore of DC fans, Warner has been trying and failing to convince the world that Batfleck was a good idea poorly managed. It did this by tweaking the movie\u2019s sequels and spin-offs to rid them of the worst knuckleheaded excesses of Snyder\u2019s films. But the truth is that casting Affleck was a terrible idea carried out terribly, and no amount of shoehorned \u201ccomedy\u201d one-liners was going to save films such as Justice League from being roundly dismissed. The temptation must surely be for Reeves to make with the Lazarus Pit, and resurrect a new and more workable Batman \u2013 preferably played by anyone but Affleck. Perhaps DC needs two cinematic universes: one based on the grimy Gotham underworld and its cavalcade of leering freaks and deviants; the other filled with sci-fi-tinged superheroes who wouldn\u2019t look out of place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, such as Aquaman, Wonder Woman and the Flash. For the Batman of Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight trilogy, or the TV series Gotham, has often seemed about as likely to meet Superman or the other members of the Justice League as Luke Skywalker is to encounter Genghis Khan. It is quite possible to imagine the worst big-screen caped crusaders, George Clooney or Val Kilmer, meeting just about anyone in the DC \u2019verse \u2013 even the buffoonish Shazam! That\u2019s because there is nothing stylistically singular about them at all, unless one is counting the Batnipples. Where other superheroes seem to grow as part of the ensemble, Batman \u2013 certainly based on our experience with the last few DC movies \u2013 only seems to diminish. Perhaps Gotham\u2019s dark knight is simply too weird, too idiosyncratic a superhero to ever play nicely with others. The only question is why DC wasn\u2019t well aware of this, given that its own Lego Batman Movie mined Bruce Wayne\u2019s extreme narcissism and inelegant misanthropy for comedy gold so successfully. Might The Batman see the emergence of a dark knight whose presence in the wider DC world is left pretty much open to question? And would this be such a bad thing? It\u2019s possible Warner simply doesn\u2019t have the confidence in its own plans, particularly after the lukewarm reactions to Justice League, to manage the movie in any other way. Its entire approach to the DCEU seems to have been a case of one step forward, six tentative steps back, so we\u2019re about as likely to see a considered, Marvel-style route to world-building at this late stage as we are to see the Joker giving up his life of crime and embarking on a new career as a supermarket shelf stacker.

      "body": "<p>Cycling in London is on the rise \u2013 up <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/londons-long-term-cycling-potential-mapped-out\">56% on some routes</a> since 2014. The construction a few years ago of a number of protected cycle lanes in the city centre undoubtedly helped drive this change, but there are additional ways to boost the number of people on bikes. We explore 10 ideas below \u2013 please contribute yours in the comments section.</p> <h2>Free bikes</h2> <p>If the benefits of cycling \u2013 both economic and environmental \u2013 outweigh the cost of bikes overall, then why not simply give bikes away?</p> <p>Like most cycling initiatives, this idea can be traced to the Netherlands, where the anarchist group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/26/story-cities-amsterdam-bike-share-scheme\">Provo</a> distributed 10,000 white bikes to the city of Amsterdam in the 1960s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"813e69c560c834dc7d10e84e04099e2f1274d848\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/813e69c560c834dc7d10e84e04099e2f1274d848/0_0_1675_2500/670.jpg\" alt=\"John Lennon and Yoko Ono (L) with a \u201cProvo\u201d bike in Amsterdam in 1969.\" width=\"670\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Lennon and Yoko Ono with a Provo bike in Amsterdam in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These were free for everyone to use, on the basis that \u201cper kilometre [one bike] would cost the municipality only 10% of what it contributed to public transport per person per kilometre\u201d. The authorities hadn\u2019t made the same calculations, however, and the white bikes were quickly removed \u2013 or were stolen.</p> <p>Variations have since cropped up round the world. In <a href=\"https://www.bikesa.asn.au/adelaidefreebikes\">Adelaide</a>, free daily hire bikes are available to visitors and residents as part of the Australian city\u2019s Smart Move strategy. <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/50122/cycling_in_birmingham/1316/free_bikes\">Birmingham</a> in the UK ran a scheme last year where residents of poorer postcodes could apply for a free bike if they agreed to ride it. Meanwhile, in <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3030704/in-sweden-free-bikes-to-commuters-who-promise-to-drive-less\">Gothenburg</a>, Sweden, the government is giving free bikes to commuters who promise to drive less.</p> <h2>Filtered permeability</h2> <p>In 1977, Groningen \u2013 a small city in the northern Netherlands \u2013 underwent a rapid transformation. Provisional signs and barriers were covertly erected to direct cars out of the city centre until they were gradually, over several months, confined to areas outside it.</p> <p>By selectively reducing the number of city streets available to vehicles, journeys that were once relatively easy by car became arduous and convoluted. Residents chose to cycle instead of drive, even when heading to a big furniture and homewares store such as Ikea \u2013 whose specially designed cargo bikes are popular with locals.</p> <p>The idea, later termed \u201cfiltered permeability\u201d by transport planning professor <a href=\"https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/SteveMelia\">Steve Melia</a>, applied in a single stroke what he calls the three most important principles for increasing urban cycling: separation from motor traffic, consistent design, and making bike journeys quicker and more convenient than car journeys.</p> <h2>20mph zones</h2> <p>Excluding cars entirely isn\u2019t always practical \u2013 and can make life difficult for disabled people, as well as preventing access for ambulances, fire services and delivery lorries.</p> <p>Slowing cars down makes city centres more hospitable to cyclists \u2013 but does putting up 20mph or 30kph speed signs actually have an effect?</p> <p>Evidence from <a href=\"http://www.roadsafetyobservatory.com/Evidence/Details/11583\">Portsmouth</a> (where the speed limit was reduced from 30mph to 20mph on around 94% of roads) and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-43050841\">Bristol</a> (where 20mph was introduced on several main routes) suggests that 20mph zones increase both perceptions of road safety, and actual road safety \u2013 and lead to more people walking and cycling.</p> <p>But a November report from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/20-mph-speed-limits-on-roads\">Department for Transport</a> concluded that, over 12 schemes across Britain, 20mph zones have achieved on average a less than 1mph reduction in median speed.</p> <p>Urban designer and transport planner <a href=\"http://www.urbanmovement.co.uk/john-dales.html\">John Dales</a> suggests that, regardless of signposting, \u201cdesigning the street, as a whole, to achieve the desired speed is the key thing\u201d. The more successful low-speed areas include physical designs which make it natural for drivers to go slower. These include humps, <a href=\"https://www.trafficchoices.co.uk/traffic-schemes/speed-table.shtml\">speed tables</a>, rough surfaces, tight corners and carriageway narrowing lanes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ff453601af855baa530109ce6d32ff3f1f9095b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ff453601af855baa530109ce6d32ff3f1f9095b/0_196_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Groningen, the Netherlands, where residents chose to cycle instead of drive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Groningen, the Netherlands, where residents chose to cycle instead of drive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CHROMORANGE/Alexander Bernhard/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Residents choosing to cycle instead of drive in Groningen, the Netherlands. Photograph: Chromorange/Alexander Bernhard/Alamy</p></li> </ul> <h2>Strict liability</h2> <p>What if legislation alone could encourage more people to cycle?</p> <p>In the Netherlands, liability is automatically placed with the more powerful road user, unless it can be proven they were not at fault. The law is designed to protect vulnerable road users from financial damage caused by drivers of motorised vehicles. Unlike in the UK, a motorist who hits a cyclist in the Netherlands must prove they were doing everything they could to avoid contact \u2013 otherwise they will be liable for damages.</p> <p>Supporters say stacking the law in this way would encourage people to drive more carefully.</p> <h2>\u2018Dutch reach\u2019</h2> <p>For many people the real roadblock to cycling in cities is fear. According to statistics from the UK Department for Transport, <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/personal/factsheets/cyclefactsheet.pdf\">almost half</a> of all adults strongly agree that \u201cthe idea of cycling on busy roads [is frightening]\u201d.</p> <p>One way to get around this could be by teaching drivers to use the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cyclinguk.org/blog/samjones/dutch-reach\">Dutch reach</a>\u201d, a term actually coined by an American cyclist <a href=\"https://www.dutchreach.org/about/\">Michael Charney</a>. By opening a car door with the hand furthest from the handle, the driver is forced to turn their body towards the door, becoming more likely to catch sight of approaching cyclists in their peripheral vision.</p> <p>One study in Chicago found that about one-in-five bicycle accidents involve car doors, with many happening as cyclists swerve to avoid collision. Even in Vancouver \u2013 another city with a notable cycle lane network \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/cycling-safety-study-final-report.pdf\">dooring</a>\u201d is the most common cause of injury for cyclists colliding with cars.</p> <p>In the UK, where \u201cdooring\u201d is responsible for an average of <a href=\"http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/what-dooring-illegal-945813?_ga=2.145025975.2028363485.1542708203-400956654.1542706836\">700 injuries and two deaths</a> every year, the government announced in October that Dutch reach will be added to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/commuting/news/article/dutch-reach-highway-code-53143/\">highway code</a>. Traffic safety organisations like the AAA will begin teaching it to US drivers <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/12/dutch-reach-bicycle-car-door-driver-education-traffic-safety/577975/.\">from January</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84a1c91c03c7e8968bd57d74c873e0a44d11a0d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84a1c91c03c7e8968bd57d74c873e0a44d11a0d5/0_1369_2703_1621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The \u2018Dutch reach\u2019 \u2013 opening a car door with the hand furthest from the handle \u2013 makes drivers becoming more likely to spot approaching cyclists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018Dutch reach\u2019 \u2013 opening a car door with the hand furthest from the handle \u2013 makes drivers becoming more likely to spot approaching cyclists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hympi/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The \u2018Dutch reach\u2019 \u2013 opening a car door with the hand furthest from the handle \u2013 makes drivers becoming more likely to spot approaching cyclists. Photograph: Hympi/Alamy</p></li> </ul> <h2>De-subsidise motoring</h2> <p>According to American professor <a href=\"https://www.shoupdogg.com/\">Donald Shoup</a>, car driving is subsidised greatly by the general public. When parking spaces are provided free of charge to the motorist, their cost is absorbed into the cost of other things \u2013 be that supermarket prices, company fees, or taxes.</p> <p>In his ground-breaking 2005 book The High Cost of Free Parking \u2013 and his latest tome, <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/05/parking-is-sexy-now-thank-donald-shoup/560876/\">Parking and the City</a>, published this year \u2013 Shoup argues that these economic subsidies pull people into cars, to the cost of everyone else.</p> <p>In California, Shoup managed to get a new state law requiring employers who provide subsidised parking for their employees to also offer a cash allowance in lieu of a parking space \u2013 so taking the fringe benefit of free parking and transforming it into an incentive for cycling.</p> <p>Although, so far only one workplace has actually implemented the \u201cparking cash out\u201d. At the Sony studio in Santa Monica, cyclist Gary Kavanagh discovered this idea independently of Shoup, and pitched it to his HR department only to find it was unenforced state law. Soon enough, his cycle commuting made him $120 richer each month. He chronicled the experience in his <a href=\"https://garyridesbikes.blogspot.com/2008/10/no-on-santa-monica-measure-t-also-known.html\">blog</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for this kind of incentive to start influencing behaviour,\u201d he writes. \u201cSome part-time bike commuters who would occasionally drive became full-time bike commuters. Some people who never rode bikes before suddenly embraced it full swing, and would come to my desk to ask bicycle questions.\u201d</p> <h2>Car-free days</h2> <p>Can banning cars from part of a city for just for one day help lead to long-term change? Supporters say it gives people a taste of what the city could be like in a less car-dominated future.</p> <p>Many think that car-free Sundays in the Netherlands in the 1970s were pivotal to the country\u2019s transformation in the following decades. Since then cities around the world have tried their own version, with congested Asian cities such as Chengdu and Jakarta even roping off a few streets.</p> <p>Paris has been leading the way in Europe, with the almost five-mile distance between the Arc de Triomphe and the Place de la Nation closed to car traffic once a year, which is soon to be increased to once a month.</p> <p>London does not have a large-scale car-free day but one Sunday in September the city\u2019s boroughs agree to the closure of 50 individual streets. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carfreedayldn?lang=en\">London car-free day campaign</a> is pushing mayor Sadiq Khan for more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"20270a46fc1415f8abfb1c57ebf3d9edf8579b90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20270a46fc1415f8abfb1c57ebf3d9edf8579b90/0_228_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A car-free day in Jakarta, 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A car-free day in Jakarta, 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beawiharta/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A car-free day in Jakarta, 2012. Photograph: Beawiharta/Reuters</p></li> </ul> <h2>Park and pedal</h2> <p>In a new twist on park and ride, some cities \u2013 such as Oxford, York and Cambridge \u2013 are offering park and pedal schemes which provide free parking for vehicles outside the city as an incentive to hop on a bike and cycle into the centre.</p> <p>There are two of these \u201cbicycle interchanges\u201d a mile outside Oxford, where cyclists can leave bikes at Redbridge or Seacourt park before catching a bus, or park their car at the site and ride into the city centre.</p> <p>In Seville, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/28/seville-cycling-capital-southern-europe-bike-lanes\">Bus&amp;Bici scheme</a> entitles resident commuters to free bike rental for the last leg of their journey \u2013 as long as they return it by midnight.</p> <h2>Pay people to cycle</h2> <p>Some countries operate cycle-to-work schemes \u2013 with tax exemptions on bike purchases \u2013 but this can be taken to the next level by directly paying people to get on their bikes.</p> <p>Governments in several European states have experimented with the idea. The Netherlands trialled a scheme in 2018 allowing companies to pay employees 19 cents for every kilometre they cycle to and from work. Congested Milan is also contemplating a similar programme and, on a smaller scale, one company in Christchurch, New Zealand, pays employees an extra <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/new-zealand-cycle-cash-10-a-day-employees-work-company\">$5 a day</a> if they cycle to and from work.</p> <p>Paying people to cycle could even be profitable for a city. Elly Blue\u2019s book <a href=\"http://takingthelane.com/bikenomics/\">Bikenomics</a> explores the economic benefits of cycling and finds that cities benefit from reduced congestion, while businesses benefit from reduced sick leave and improved employee satisfaction.</p> <p>One trial in France, though, <a href=\"https://www.ademe.fr/evaluation-mise-oeuvre-experimentale-lindemnite-kilometrique-velos\">showed that</a> a monetary incentive only attracted a certain type of commuter \u2013 with most of the rise in cycle commuting coming not from former drivers, but from dissolved carpooling arrangements.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2018/sep/16/car-free-in-paris-and-brussels-in-pictures\">Car-free day in Paris and Brussels \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>And finally \u2026 the Tullock spike</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0925753594900221\">Studies</a> have shown that injuries to pedestrians increased when seatbelt laws were introduced in Australia in the early 1970s. The argument goes that as drivers\u2019 sense of safety grew, they became more likely to take risks, and subconsciously drove a little faster or a bit more recklessly. While the legislation had made those inside the cars safer, it had shifted the risk on to other road users \u2013 particularly cyclists and pedestrians.</p> <p>American economist <a href=\"https://cei.org/content/memory-gordon-tullock\">Gordon Tullock</a> proposed one novel way of getting around this. He suggested that more lives would be saved if the government ordered sharp spikes to be installed on all steering wheels, leaving drivers perpetually poised on the edge of serious injury.</p> <p>His idea was built on by several others, including economist <a href=\"https://fee.org/articles/passing-a-law-wont-get-it-done/\">Sandy Ikeda</a>, who suggested that the best possible safety measure would be to \u201cban brakes on cars\u201d.</p> <p>But both were proposed strictly as a thought experiment \u2026</p> <p><em>What other ways can help promote urban cycling?

      "bodyText": "Cycling in London is on the rise \u2013 up 56% on some routes since 2014. The construction a few years ago of a number of protected cycle lanes in the city centre undoubtedly helped drive this change, but there are additional ways to boost the number of people on bikes. We explore 10 ideas below \u2013 please contribute yours in the comments section. Free bikes If the benefits of cycling \u2013 both economic and environmental \u2013 outweigh the cost of bikes overall, then why not simply give bikes away? Like most cycling initiatives, this idea can be traced to the Netherlands, where the anarchist group Provo distributed 10,000 white bikes to the city of Amsterdam in the 1960s. These were free for everyone to use, on the basis that \u201cper kilometre [one bike] would cost the municipality only 10% of what it contributed to public transport per person per kilometre\u201d. The authorities hadn\u2019t made the same calculations, however, and the white bikes were quickly removed \u2013 or were stolen. Variations have since cropped up round the world. In Adelaide, free daily hire bikes are available to visitors and residents as part of the Australian city\u2019s Smart Move strategy. Birmingham in the UK ran a scheme last year where residents of poorer postcodes could apply for a free bike if they agreed to ride it. Meanwhile, in Gothenburg, Sweden, the government is giving free bikes to commuters who promise to drive less. Filtered permeability In 1977, Groningen \u2013 a small city in the northern Netherlands \u2013 underwent a rapid transformation. Provisional signs and barriers were covertly erected to direct cars out of the city centre until they were gradually, over several months, confined to areas outside it. By selectively reducing the number of city streets available to vehicles, journeys that were once relatively easy by car became arduous and convoluted. Residents chose to cycle instead of drive, even when heading to a big furniture and homewares store such as Ikea \u2013 whose specially designed cargo bikes are popular with locals. The idea, later termed \u201cfiltered permeability\u201d by transport planning professor Steve Melia, applied in a single stroke what he calls the three most important principles for increasing urban cycling: separation from motor traffic, consistent design, and making bike journeys quicker and more convenient than car journeys. 20mph zones Excluding cars entirely isn\u2019t always practical \u2013 and can make life difficult for disabled people, as well as preventing access for ambulances, fire services and delivery lorries. Slowing cars down makes city centres more hospitable to cyclists \u2013 but does putting up 20mph or 30kph speed signs actually have an effect? Evidence from Portsmouth (where the speed limit was reduced from 30mph to 20mph on around 94% of roads) and Bristol (where 20mph was introduced on several main routes) suggests that 20mph zones increase both perceptions of road safety, and actual road safety \u2013 and lead to more people walking and cycling. But a November report from the Department for Transport concluded that, over 12 schemes across Britain, 20mph zones have achieved on average a less than 1mph reduction in median speed. Urban designer and transport planner John Dales suggests that, regardless of signposting, \u201cdesigning the street, as a whole, to achieve the desired speed is the key thing\u201d. The more successful low-speed areas include physical designs which make it natural for drivers to go slower. These include humps, speed tables, rough surfaces, tight corners and carriageway narrowing lanes. Residents choosing to cycle instead of drive in Groningen, the Netherlands. Photograph: Chromorange/Alexander Bernhard/Alamy Strict liability What if legislation alone could encourage more people to cycle? In the Netherlands, liability is automatically placed with the more powerful road user, unless it can be proven they were not at fault. The law is designed to protect vulnerable road users from financial damage caused by drivers of motorised vehicles. Unlike in the UK, a motorist who hits a cyclist in the Netherlands must prove they were doing everything they could to avoid contact \u2013 otherwise they will be liable for damages. Supporters say stacking the law in this way would encourage people to drive more carefully. \u2018Dutch reach\u2019 For many people the real roadblock to cycling in cities is fear. According to statistics from the UK Department for Transport, almost half of all adults strongly agree that \u201cthe idea of cycling on busy roads [is frightening]\u201d. One way to get around this could be by teaching drivers to use the \u201cDutch reach\u201d, a term actually coined by an American cyclist Michael Charney. By opening a car door with the hand furthest from the handle, the driver is forced to turn their body towards the door, becoming more likely to catch sight of approaching cyclists in their peripheral vision. One study in Chicago found that about one-in-five bicycle accidents involve car doors, with many happening as cyclists swerve to avoid collision. Even in Vancouver \u2013 another city with a notable cycle lane network \u2013 \u201cdooring\u201d is the most common cause of injury for cyclists colliding with cars. In the UK, where \u201cdooring\u201d is responsible for an average of 700 injuries and two deaths every year, the government announced in October that Dutch reach will be added to the highway code. Traffic safety organisations like the AAA will begin teaching it to US drivers from January. The \u2018Dutch reach\u2019 \u2013 opening a car door with the hand furthest from the handle \u2013 makes drivers becoming more likely to spot approaching cyclists. Photograph: Hympi/Alamy De-subsidise motoring According to American professor Donald Shoup, car driving is subsidised greatly by the general public. When parking spaces are provided free of charge to the motorist, their cost is absorbed into the cost of other things \u2013 be that supermarket prices, company fees, or taxes. In his ground-breaking 2005 book The High Cost of Free Parking \u2013 and his latest tome, Parking and the City, published this year \u2013 Shoup argues that these economic subsidies pull people into cars, to the cost of everyone else. In California, Shoup managed to get a new state law requiring employers who provide subsidised parking for their employees to also offer a cash allowance in lieu of a parking space \u2013 so taking the fringe benefit of free parking and transforming it into an incentive for cycling. Although, so far only one workplace has actually implemented the \u201cparking cash out\u201d. At the Sony studio in Santa Monica, cyclist Gary Kavanagh discovered this idea independently of Shoup, and pitched it to his HR department only to find it was unenforced state law. Soon enough, his cycle commuting made him $120 richer each month. He chronicled the experience in his blog. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for this kind of incentive to start influencing behaviour,\u201d he writes. \u201cSome part-time bike commuters who would occasionally drive became full-time bike commuters. Some people who never rode bikes before suddenly embraced it full swing, and would come to my desk to ask bicycle questions.\u201d Car-free days Can banning cars from part of a city for just for one day help lead to long-term change? Supporters say it gives people a taste of what the city could be like in a less car-dominated future. Many think that car-free Sundays in the Netherlands in the 1970s were pivotal to the country\u2019s transformation in the following decades. Since then cities around the world have tried their own version, with congested Asian cities such as Chengdu and Jakarta even roping off a few streets. Paris has been leading the way in Europe, with the almost five-mile distance between the Arc de Triomphe and the Place de la Nation closed to car traffic once a year, which is soon to be increased to once a month. London does not have a large-scale car-free day but one Sunday in September the city\u2019s boroughs agree to the closure of 50 individual streets. The London car-free day campaign is pushing mayor Sadiq Khan for more. A car-free day in Jakarta, 2012. Photograph: Beawiharta/Reuters Park and pedal In a new twist on park and ride, some cities \u2013 such as Oxford, York and Cambridge \u2013 are offering park and pedal schemes which provide free parking for vehicles outside the city as an incentive to hop on a bike and cycle into the centre. There are two of these \u201cbicycle interchanges\u201d a mile outside Oxford, where cyclists can leave bikes at Redbridge or Seacourt park before catching a bus, or park their car at the site and ride into the city centre. In Seville, the Bus&amp;Bici scheme entitles resident commuters to free bike rental for the last leg of their journey \u2013 as long as they return it by midnight. Pay people to cycle Some countries operate cycle-to-work schemes \u2013 with tax exemptions on bike purchases \u2013 but this can be taken to the next level by directly paying people to get on their bikes. Governments in several European states have experimented with the idea. The Netherlands trialled a scheme in 2018 allowing companies to pay employees 19 cents for every kilometre they cycle to and from work. Congested Milan is also contemplating a similar programme and, on a smaller scale, one company in Christchurch, New Zealand, pays employees an extra $5 a day if they cycle to and from work. Paying people to cycle could even be profitable for a city. Elly Blue\u2019s book Bikenomics explores the economic benefits of cycling and finds that cities benefit from reduced congestion, while businesses benefit from reduced sick leave and improved employee satisfaction. One trial in France, though, showed that a monetary incentive only attracted a certain type of commuter \u2013 with most of the rise in cycle commuting coming not from former drivers, but from dissolved carpooling arrangements. And finally \u2026 the Tullock spike Studies have shown that injuries to pedestrians increased when seatbelt laws were introduced in Australia in the early 1970s. The argument goes that as drivers\u2019 sense of safety grew, they became more likely to take risks, and subconsciously drove a little faster or a bit more recklessly. While the legislation had made those inside the cars safer, it had shifted the risk on to other road users \u2013 particularly cyclists and pedestrians. American economist Gordon Tullock proposed one novel way of getting around this. He suggested that more lives would be saved if the government ordered sharp spikes to be installed on all steering wheels, leaving drivers perpetually poised on the edge of serious injury. His idea was built on by several others, including economist Sandy Ikeda, who suggested that the best possible safety measure would be to \u201cban brakes on cars\u201d. But both were proposed strictly as a thought experiment \u2026 What other ways can help promote urban cycling? Share your ideas in the comments below.

Communities in the Menindee Lakes region, where two fish kills have occurred since December, have said over-extraction by irrigators helped cause the catastrophe that has put a spotlight on the environmental management of Australia\u2019s largest river system. On Thursday, New South Wales Labor called for a special commission of inquiry into the environmental disaster as the cotton industry sought to defend itself against criticism it was behind the depletion of river flows. Cotton Australia said drought was affecting the river system and that the industry was also suffering, forecasting its crop this season would be half of the previous year\u2019s. \u201cOn the Barwon-Darling, the impact on cotton production is even more devastating with zero hectares of cotton being grown in Bourke this season, down from 4,000 hectares the year before,\u201d the general manager of Cotton Australia, Michael Murray, said. \u201cCotton Australia is very proud of our industry that produces a quality fibre that is in demand both here at home and around the world. But, as an industry, we are growing very tired of being \u2018the whipping boy\u2019 for all the problems that are being brought on by this crippling drought. \u201cThe recent fish deaths in the Barwon-Darling river system at Menindee was a devastating sight. However, it is wrong to blame cotton growers for this incident.\u201d The immediate cause of the mass fish kill is believed to be a sudden drop in temperature that killed algal blooms in the water, depleting it of oxygen and causing fish to die. But Richard Kingsford, the director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of NSW, said it was a disaster that had been many years in the making because too much water had been diverted from the system for agriculture. \u201cDroughts would have contributed to the blue green algae outbreak,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the river droughts are happening more often and they\u2019re more intense as a result of the irrigation industry in the Darling diverting water from the river over the last 10 to 20 years.\u201d He said the problem could be traced back to management of water by state and federal levels of government and both of the major parties. The NSW Labor leader, Michael Daley, called on Thursday for the Berejiklian government to establish a special commission of inquiry into the state\u2019s water management. \u201cThe scale of this disaster is extraordinary and unprecedented,\u201d the opposition leader said in a statement. \u201cThe people of NSW have watched for 18 months as water theft scandals, water mismanagement and now ecological disasters have rocked far west rivers.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, sought to assure residents of the state\u2019s far west the government was working to find a solution. Her comments come a day after the minister for primary industries and water, Niall Blair, was criticised for bypassing a large gathering of people waiting to ask him questions on a visit to Menindee. \u201cWe\u2019re working through it as fast as we can to see what solutions we can contribute towards and I commend him [Blair] for being on the ground,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Thursday\u2019s papers have gone after the Speaker of the House, John Bercow, whose decision to allow a vote giving Theresa May three days to present a Brexit \u201cplan B\u201d if her deal is defeated was considered at best \u201ccontroversial\u201d and at worst a demonstration of \u201cflagrant prejudice\u201d. The prejudice line came form the Mail, which ran its story under the headline \u201cOut of order!\u201d and called Bercow an \u201cegotistical preening popinjay [who] has shamelessly put his anti-Brexit bias before the national interest \u2013 and is a disgrace to his office\u201d. Similar sentiments from the Express \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re so out of order!\u201d \u2013 which suggested Bercow was now facing pressure to quit \u201cafter \u2018disgracefully\u2019 flouting parliamentary rules to help Remainers seize more control over Brexit\u201d. They cited ex-ministers, the former speaker Betty Boothroyd and constitutional experts, whom the paper said were \u201cunited in a chorus of anger over the Commons \u2018stitch-up\u2019 that led to a government defeat\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s front page features a striking picture from parliament, with Bercow at the centre, and reports \u201cfurious scenes in the House of Commons as the Speaker John Bercow took the controversial decision to allow a vote on the amendment, tabled by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve\u201d. The paper\u2019s headline: \u201cMay\u2019s power ebbing away as she suffers another humiliating defeat\u201d. The i has a similar focus, writing: \u201cMay losing control of Brexit\u201d, adding \u201cTories outraged after Speaker is accused of ignoring his own officials about rebels\u201d. The Sun labelled Bercow \u201cSpeaker of the devil\u201d and reported on the \u201cfury at Bercow bid to scupper Brexit\u201d, saying \u201cthe controversy sparked a near riot in parliament\u201d. The Telegraph follows its precedent of recent weeks on Brexit stories, offering a neutral headline \u2013 \u201cMr Speaker takes control\u201d \u2013 but then sticking in the knife in the body copy, saying: \u201cThe Speaker ignored legal advice and parliamentary precedent to allow a vote that gives Mrs May just three days to present a plan B for Brexit if she loses the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 next Tuesday.\u201d The Times \u2013 \u201cTory rebels join forces with Labour over Brexit\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t lead with Bercow\u2019s role in the vote, instead focusing on how May\u2019s \u201cBrexit strategy was in tatters last night after Tory Remainer rebels opened talks with Labour\u201d. But it didn\u2019t spare the Speaker, saying he had \u201coutraged ministers by overruling advice from officials in order to help an alliance of rebel Tories and opposition MPs to inflict the defeat, the second for the government in 24 hours\u201d. The Mirror claims it as a victory for Labour, saying: \u201cMay caves in on workers\u2019 rights to save Brexit deal\u201d. The paper says \u201cDesperate Theresa May is ready to give in to key Labour demands on workers\u2019 rights in a bid to salvage her Brexit deal\u201d. The FT has \u201cMay offers MPs \u2018backstop\u2019 veto after second Commons defeat\u201d and says the Speaker came \u201cunder fire\u201d. It reports that \u201cEurosceptic Tory MPs were furious that yesterday\u2019s vote was allowed by Commons Speaker John Bercow, who they view as an opponent of Brexit.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The world needs to understand what Brazil has become, before it\u2019s too late. Jair Messias Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil is not just another country that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/01/jair-bolsonaro-inauguration-brazil-president\" title=\"\">elected a far-right president</a> at a time when the world\u2019s most powerful nation is led by Donald Trump. It\u2019s not just South America\u2019s version of the current trend of countries sliding into authoritarianism, like we\u2019ve seen in Hungary, Poland, Turkey and the Philippines. It\u2019s not simply a peripheral nation with a pathetic leader. Brazil has become the apocalyptic vanguard that signals how radical this moment is \u2013 one with the power to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/02/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-amazon-rainforest-protections\" title=\"\">worsen the climate crisis at top speed</a> and blight the entire planet.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Bolsonaro was elected in October, on his pledge to go back \u201850 years'. Brazil lived under a military dictatorship then</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The election of Bolsonaro is a response to what we might call civilisation\u2019s new discontent. Maybe people can\u2019t identify the source of their anxiety, which has driven up the consumption of tranquillisers and sedatives. The average citizen might apply more familiar labels to the corrosion of their quality of life, air, and water; to a relentless fear of the \u201cother\u201d; to the feeling they\u2019re walking in quicksand. But what\u2019s underpinning this new discontent pervading all areas of human experience is our climate crisis.</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro was elected in October, on his pledge to go back \u201c50 years\u201d. Fifty years ago, Brazil lived under a military dictatorship. For Bolsonaro and his followers, who are outright defenders of torture and the elimination of adversaries, it was a glorious era. Despite the terrifying menace of nuclear war, the world was still a place where science promised nothing but progress and solutions \u2013 it delivered no bad news, like global warming, that led to limitations on an individual\u2019s daily life or on government actions. It was a time when white, heterosexual men held power and knew precisely who they were. They may have faced some resistance from minorities, but they still enjoyed absolute hegemony.</p> \n<p>We cannot comprehend what is now happening in Brazil \u2013 and around the world \u2013 unless we understand that our culture wars are tightly bound up with humanity\u2019s need to say goodbye to 20th-century illusions of power and face a planet made more hostile by human hand. Things will soon reach catastrophic levels if nations and their residents do not unite in a global effort to do something extremely hard and unpopular: impose limits on ourselves to counteract global warming.</p> \n<p>The election of Bolsonaro ties all this together like no other event. The Bolsonaro administration promises a \u201cnew era\u201d \u2013 a return to a time free of doubts and insecurity, with certainty about what a man is and what a woman is and a clear sense who\u2019s in charge of the public sphere and the family. Their ultra-conservatism is at times corny, at times biblical \u2013 but never innocent.</p> \n<p>Soon after Bolsonaro\u2019s inauguration last week, the minister of women, family, and human rights, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damares_Alves\" title=\"\">Damares Alves</a> \u2013 an evangelical pastor \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cafecomkremlin/status/1080851084971773952\" title=\"\">stated in a video</a> that now \u201cgirls wear pink and boys, blue\u201d. Beside her, a supporter held an Israeli flag. Some neo-Pentecostals likewise waved Israeli flags at the inauguration. These religious groups, who are growing numerically and wielding greater power in Brazil, voted overwhelmingly for Bolsonaro.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7dd0e4fb-72d8-4fe4-94c6-efbb51728243\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dVdgCFJZmgI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A significant portion of them believe Jews will play a role in fulfilling scriptural prophesies about the return of the Messiah. It must be remembered that Bolsonaro was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/Jair_Bolsonaro_Brazil\" title=\"\">baptised in the River Jordan</a>, in Israel, a couple of years before the presidential campaign. Now in power, he has announced that Brazil will move its embassy to Jerusalem, which, say these evangelicals, will be the \u201cstage for Armageddon\u201d. In a recent visit to Brazil, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared: \u201cWe have no better friends in the world than the evangelical community.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/15/brazil-foreign-minister-ernesto-araujo-climate-change-marxist-plot\" title=\"\">Ernesto Ara\u00fajo</a>, the dogmatic foreign minister, said Bolsonaro\u2019s rise will be marked by \u201cGod through the nation\u201d. He has also written that climate change is an \u201cideology\u201d dreamed up so imperialist nations could determine Brazil\u2019s future. \u201cThe people who say there are no men and women are the same ones who preach that countries don\u2019t have the right to protect their borders,\u201d Ara\u00fajo stated in his inaugural speech.</p> \n<p>This Brazil, stitched from a patchwork of dogmas, might be a fascinating topic of study if it didn\u2019t put the whole planet at risk. Ideological discourse serves to instil the notion of destiny and to ensure cohesion within a population frightened about everything it might lose, from salaries and jobs to symbolic positions in the realms of race, gender, and sexual orientation. When Bolsonaro says he\u2019s going to \u201cfree Brazil from political correctness\u201d, he\u2019s pledging to break both the \u201cchains\u201d that force people to respect minorities and those that curtail devastation of the Amazon forest.</p> \n<p>In his first days in power, the president shifted responsibility for demarcation of indigenous and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilombola\" title=\"\"><em>quilombola</em></a> territory \u2013 which makes up a large part of the protected Amazon \u2013 to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/02/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-amazon-rainforest-protections\" title=\"\">agriculture ministry</a>. This government sector is controlled by agribusiness, responsible for much of deforestation and eager to get their hands on the remaining forest. Bolsonaro promised to turn the public land occupied by indigenous peoples into private land where mining and agribusiness concerns can reap profits. The goal is to make more forest land available for capitalist speculation: cattle, soybeans, mining, and major construction projects.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"887b9b0c-78db-4c53-8910-bc6c990ab548\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MWiZzmtr8eo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This is why government ideologues fabricated the idea that \u201ccommunism\u201d \u2013 a system never implemented in Brazil and now largely irrelevant worldwide \u2013 is a looming threat to Brazilians. The supposed \u201cinternational Marxist plot\u201d serves to justify turning the forest into a commodity. In this fantasy, indigenous peoples, who are the chief barrier to destruction of the Amazon, are portrayed as a \u201cthreat to national sovereignty\u201d.</p> \n<p>The deforestation rate for 2018 was the highest in a decade. The mere possibility that Bolsonaro might win had a liberating effect on deforesters and further inflamed conflicts in a country where more environmental defenders are killed than in any other.</p> \n<p>Without the world\u2019s biggest tropical forest, there is no way to control global warming. If Bolsonaro\u2019s messianic capitalism is not stopped, life on this planet will be much worse for everyone. For a contingent of neo-Pentecostal evangelicals, this may be welcomed as an apocalypse preceding the final salvation of \u201ctrue believers\u201d. For most of humanity, it will bring nothing but horror and suffering \u2013 perpetuated by the stupidity of a species with delusions of grandeur.</p> \n<p><em>Translated by Diane Grosklaus Whitty</em></p> \n<p>\u2022Eliane Brum is a Brazilian journalist, writer and documentary maker</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world needs to understand what Brazil has become, before it\u2019s too late. Jair Messias Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil is not just another country that elected a far-right president at a time when the world\u2019s most powerful nation is led by Donald Trump. It\u2019s not just South America\u2019s version of the current trend of countries sliding into authoritarianism, like we\u2019ve seen in Hungary, Poland, Turkey and the Philippines. It\u2019s not simply a peripheral nation with a pathetic leader. Brazil has become the apocalyptic vanguard that signals how radical this moment is \u2013 one with the power to worsen the climate crisis at top speed and blight the entire planet. The election of Bolsonaro is a response to what we might call civilisation\u2019s new discontent. Maybe people can\u2019t identify the source of their anxiety, which has driven up the consumption of tranquillisers and sedatives. The average citizen might apply more familiar labels to the corrosion of their quality of life, air, and water; to a relentless fear of the \u201cother\u201d; to the feeling they\u2019re walking in quicksand. But what\u2019s underpinning this new discontent pervading all areas of human experience is our climate crisis. Bolsonaro was elected in October, on his pledge to go back \u201c50 years\u201d. Fifty years ago, Brazil lived under a military dictatorship. For Bolsonaro and his followers, who are outright defenders of torture and the elimination of adversaries, it was a glorious era. Despite the terrifying menace of nuclear war, the world was still a place where science promised nothing but progress and solutions \u2013 it delivered no bad news, like global warming, that led to limitations on an individual\u2019s daily life or on government actions. It was a time when white, heterosexual men held power and knew precisely who they were. They may have faced some resistance from minorities, but they still enjoyed absolute hegemony. We cannot comprehend what is now happening in Brazil \u2013 and around the world \u2013 unless we understand that our culture wars are tightly bound up with humanity\u2019s need to say goodbye to 20th-century illusions of power and face a planet made more hostile by human hand. Things will soon reach catastrophic levels if nations and their residents do not unite in a global effort to do something extremely hard and unpopular: impose limits on ourselves to counteract global warming. The election of Bolsonaro ties all this together like no other event. The Bolsonaro administration promises a \u201cnew era\u201d \u2013 a return to a time free of doubts and insecurity, with certainty about what a man is and what a woman is and a clear sense who\u2019s in charge of the public sphere and the family. Their ultra-conservatism is at times corny, at times biblical \u2013 but never innocent. Soon after Bolsonaro\u2019s inauguration last week, the minister of women, family, and human rights, Damares Alves \u2013 an evangelical pastor \u2013 stated in a video that now \u201cgirls wear pink and boys, blue\u201d. Beside her, a supporter held an Israeli flag. Some neo-Pentecostals likewise waved Israeli flags at the inauguration. These religious groups, who are growing numerically and wielding greater power in Brazil, voted overwhelmingly for Bolsonaro. A significant portion of them believe Jews will play a role in fulfilling scriptural prophesies about the return of the Messiah. It must be remembered that Bolsonaro was baptised in the River Jordan, in Israel, a couple of years before the presidential campaign. Now in power, he has announced that Brazil will move its embassy to Jerusalem, which, say these evangelicals, will be the \u201cstage for Armageddon\u201d. In a recent visit to Brazil, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared: \u201cWe have no better friends in the world than the evangelical community.\u201d Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, the dogmatic foreign minister, said Bolsonaro\u2019s rise will be marked by \u201cGod through the nation\u201d. He has also written that climate change is an \u201cideology\u201d dreamed up so imperialist nations could determine Brazil\u2019s future. \u201cThe people who say there are no men and women are the same ones who preach that countries don\u2019t have the right to protect their borders,\u201d Ara\u00fajo stated in his inaugural speech. This Brazil, stitched from a patchwork of dogmas, might be a fascinating topic of study if it didn\u2019t put the whole planet at risk. Ideological discourse serves to instil the notion of destiny and to ensure cohesion within a population frightened about everything it might lose, from salaries and jobs to symbolic positions in the realms of race, gender, and sexual orientation. When Bolsonaro says he\u2019s going to \u201cfree Brazil from political correctness\u201d, he\u2019s pledging to break both the \u201cchains\u201d that force people to respect minorities and those that curtail devastation of the Amazon forest. In his first days in power, the president shifted responsibility for demarcation of indigenous and quilombola territory \u2013 which makes up a large part of the protected Amazon \u2013 to the agriculture ministry. This government sector is controlled by agribusiness, responsible for much of deforestation and eager to get their hands on the remaining forest. Bolsonaro promised to turn the public land occupied by indigenous peoples into private land where mining and agribusiness concerns can reap profits. The goal is to make more forest land available for capitalist speculation: cattle, soybeans, mining, and major construction projects. This is why government ideologues fabricated the idea that \u201ccommunism\u201d \u2013 a system never implemented in Brazil and now largely irrelevant worldwide \u2013 is a looming threat to Brazilians. The supposed \u201cinternational Marxist plot\u201d serves to justify turning the forest into a commodity. In this fantasy, indigenous peoples, who are the chief barrier to destruction of the Amazon, are portrayed as a \u201cthreat to national sovereignty\u201d. The deforestation rate for 2018 was the highest in a decade. The mere possibility that Bolsonaro might win had a liberating effect on deforesters and further inflamed conflicts in a country where more environmental defenders are killed than in any other. Without the world\u2019s biggest tropical forest, there is no way to control global warming. If Bolsonaro\u2019s messianic capitalism is not stopped, life on this planet will be much worse for everyone. For a contingent of neo-Pentecostal evangelicals, this may be welcomed as an apocalypse preceding the final salvation of \u201ctrue believers\u201d. For most of humanity, it will bring nothing but horror and suffering \u2013 perpetuated by the stupidity of a species with delusions of grandeur.

Detroit is also the third most segregated city in America, and has one of the worst transit systems in the country. According to Nasser Beydoun, a gas station owner and the chairman of the Arab American Civil Rights League, this means that \u201cinteractions between Arabs and African Americans are usually only transactional and rarely social, which often leads to flash points.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/aug/04/dearborn-michigan-divided-muslim-american-donald-trump-documentary\">Dearborn, Michigan: a divided city grappling with what it means to be Muslim and American</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At November\u2019s Arab American book awards, Safia Elhillo, the first-ever Sudanese American poetry winner, spoke openly about the conflict and its impact on her person. \u201cThere has always been a tension for me around the fact that I find community with other Arabophone people while always being made aware of the relative blackness of my body in those spaces,\u201d she said in her acceptance speech. \u201cSo many atrocities have been committed in the pursuit of Arab identity and the erasure of identities that do not fit within it, namely to try and discard Africanness and blackness with a lot of trauma as the cost.\u201d</p> <p>Complicating the issue, of course, is that \u201cArab\u201d and \u201cAfrican American\u201d are not neat categories. Chaldeans, who are Christians from Iraq and own many of the party stores in Detroit, speak Arabic, but, given that they\u2019ve increasingly been targeted by Muslim extremists in the Middle East, no longer tend to identify as Arabs (and some are now fervent Trump supporters). Yemenis, who have historically identified as people of color and traditionally lived in black neighborhoods in Detroit, are often shunned by other Arabs for being darker-skinned. Lebanese and Syrian residents, regardless of whether they are Muslim or Christian, might define themselves as white, and some members of the Sudanese community identify as both black and Arab. In short, contrary to popular belief, there is no Arab monolith in this corner of Michigan.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on US census forms and many college applications, Arabs are still directed to classify themselves as white, despite decades of activism by Arab Americans demanding a separate category for individuals from the Middle East and North Africa. Reality doesn\u2019t match those documents. It is fear, Beydoun told me, that animates daily life for many Arab Americans; even opening up a bank account, or booking airline travel, can be a humiliating experience, he said. Beydoun himself was on a no-fly list, which crippled his ability to do business until he successfully sued the US government to remove himself from it. And this fear can lead to animus.</p> <p>In 2013, Dawud Walid, the executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, launched a campaign to ban the term <em>abeed </em>called \u201cDrop the A-Word.\u201d Walid believes that hostilities stem, in part, from a failure of immigrant communities to understand what African Americans faced, and continue to face, in Detroit, particularly in regards to housing discrimination. He also said that the problem has \u201cless to do with religion or race than it has to do with class\u201d and that \u201c<em>abeed</em> is pretty much the one Arabic word that all black people in Detroit know\u201d.</p> <p>The government and police have only contributed to strained relations; Orville Hubbard, the mayor of Dearborn from 1942 to 1978, was an open segregationist whose motto was \u201cKeep Dearborn clean\u201d. Sally Howell, the director of the Center for Arab American Studies, told me that earlier generations of Arabs who came to Dearborn \u2013 beginning in the late 1800s, to work in the auto industry \u2013 often saw themselves as white, blue-collar workers, and \u201csometimes adopted the prejudices toward African Americans that some white, blue-collar workers have\u201d. But, Howell added, \u201cthe new awareness of the severity of white nationalism has made everyone feel like they are coming up short. I see alliances forming, in response to Trump, and I do feel a bit of optimism.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/28/ramadan-american-muslims-hamtramck-michigan-trump\">'It's brought us together': at Ramadan, American Muslims on life in the age of Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I heard it again and again: that Trump\u2019s presidency is bringing people together who were once at odds and provoking increased and more nuanced reflection. Detroit native the Rev Horace Sheffield called for a boycott of Arab businesses in the city in early 2001, after an African American man, Kalvin Porter, was beaten to death by two Yemeni immigrants at a gas station; they were acquitted in 2000 by a jury with only one African American on it. Now, he said, \u201cI have come to realize that the real issue is that we need more black ownership. It\u2019s not about being anti-Arab. It\u2019s about being pro-us. As black people, we have some unhelpful attitudes as well toward Arabs, like this notion many black people have that Arabs get free money from the government to start their businesses or this idea that Arabs are the only business owners in Detroit who don\u2019t live in Detroit.\u201d</p> <p>Beydoun, of the Arab American Civil Rights League, is of the same mind. \u201cAfrican Americans have to benefit economically. We can\u2019t, as Arabs, say, \u2018Let\u2019s sit down and talk,\u2019 and yet not hire African Americans in our businesses. What I would really love to see is Arabs and African Americans opening businesses together,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One such business already exists: the Bottom Line coffee shop in Detroit is owned by Noura Ballout, a Lebanese American, and two African Americans, Al and Pat Harris. One of the ways they have encouraged community building is by holding an open mic every Friday night. On the evening I attended, an African American poet spoke about gentrification in Detroit and how he is often made to feel unwelcome in his hometown: \u201cWalk into a gas station / And an Arab or Chaldean man says to me / You are all animals.\u201d</p> <p>News broke, as the event was ending, that former president George HW Bush had died. Several Iraqi Americans in the room fought back tears as they shared stories of how their parents were displaced and forced into refugee camps during the war Bush led against Iraq. Later, another black writer spoke about about how people of color disproportionately serve in the US military.</p> <p>The Bottom Line\u2019s slogan is \u201cA lot can happen over a cup of coffee in Detroit\u201d. There\u2019s truth to it, I think. That night, there seemed to be, between attendants, a shared understanding: that their problem is not so much with each other as it is with the US government and its record on race and foreign policy. When the cafe closed, we stood in the street, swapped contact information, made plans to see each other again. Then we drove off to our own \u2013 segregated \u2013 Michigan neighborhoods.</p> <ul> <li><p>Zahir Janmohamed has written for the New York Times, the Washington Post, Foreign Policy and other publications.

He also said that the problem has \u201cless to do with religion or race than it has to do with class\u201d and that \u201cabeed is pretty much the one Arabic word that all black people in Detroit know\u201d. The government and police have only contributed to strained relations; Orville Hubbard, the mayor of Dearborn from 1942 to 1978, was an open segregationist whose motto was \u201cKeep Dearborn clean\u201d. Sally Howell, the director of the Center for Arab American Studies, told me that earlier generations of Arabs who came to Dearborn \u2013 beginning in the late 1800s, to work in the auto industry \u2013 often saw themselves as white, blue-collar workers, and \u201csometimes adopted the prejudices toward African Americans that some white, blue-collar workers have\u201d. But, Howell added, \u201cthe new awareness of the severity of white nationalism has made everyone feel like they are coming up short. I see alliances forming, in response to Trump, and I do feel a bit of optimism.\u201d I heard it again and again: that Trump\u2019s presidency is bringing people together who were once at odds and provoking increased and more nuanced reflection. Detroit native the Rev Horace Sheffield called for a boycott of Arab businesses in the city in early 2001, after an African American man, Kalvin Porter, was beaten to death by two Yemeni immigrants at a gas station; they were acquitted in 2000 by a jury with only one African American on it. Now, he said, \u201cI have come to realize that the real issue is that we need more black ownership. It\u2019s not about being anti-Arab. It\u2019s about being pro-us. As black people, we have some unhelpful attitudes as well toward Arabs, like this notion many black people have that Arabs get free money from the government to start their businesses or this idea that Arabs are the only business owners in Detroit who don\u2019t live in Detroit.\u201d Beydoun, of the Arab American Civil Rights League, is of the same mind. \u201cAfrican Americans have to benefit economically. We can\u2019t, as Arabs, say, \u2018Let\u2019s sit down and talk,\u2019 and yet not hire African Americans in our businesses. What I would really love to see is Arabs and African Americans opening businesses together,\u201d he said. One such business already exists: the Bottom Line coffee shop in Detroit is owned by Noura Ballout, a Lebanese American, and two African Americans, Al and Pat Harris. One of the ways they have encouraged community building is by holding an open mic every Friday night. On the evening I attended, an African American poet spoke about gentrification in Detroit and how he is often made to feel unwelcome in his hometown: \u201cWalk into a gas station / And an Arab or Chaldean man says to me / You are all animals.\u201d News broke, as the event was ending, that former president George HW Bush had died. Several Iraqi Americans in the room fought back tears as they shared stories of how their parents were displaced and forced into refugee camps during the war Bush led against Iraq. Later, another black writer spoke about about how people of color disproportionately serve in the US military. The Bottom Line\u2019s slogan is \u201cA lot can happen over a cup of coffee in Detroit\u201d. There\u2019s truth to it, I think. That night, there seemed to be, between attendants, a shared understanding: that their problem is not so much with each other as it is with the US government and its record on race and foreign policy. When the cafe closed, we stood in the street, swapped contact information, made plans to see each other again. Then we drove off to our own \u2013 segregated \u2013 Michigan neighborhoods.

The woman, referred to only by her surname Song in South Korean media reports, was sentenced this week after a court found her guilty of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the spread of obscene images on Soranet, which she allegedly set up with her husband and another couple in 1999. The file-sharing site, which used an overseas server, once had more than one million users and hosted tens of thousands of images, including \u201crevenge porn\u201d and videos of women recorded secretly in toilets and other public places. It was closed in 2016 following complaints from women\u2019s rights groups. \u201cBeyond the basic concept of pornography, the website severely violated and distorted the values and dignity of children and youths, as well as all human beings,\u201d the Seoul central district court said in its ruling, according to the Korea Herald. \u201cIt is difficult to measure how much harm the existence of the website caused our society, visibly and invisibly.\u201d Although it is illegal to distribute pornography in South Korea, videos featuring sexual content are widely shared via servers based overseas or through secret file-sharing sites, according to the country\u2019s media. Molka, or secretly filmed images of a sexual nature, has reached epidemic proportions in South Korea and last summer prompted huge demonstrations by women demanding that police take action against those who film and share the material. Of the 16,201 people arrested between 2012 and 2017 for making illegal recordings, 98% were men; 84% of the 26,000 victims recorded over that period were women, according to police. Last year the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, acknowledged that the use of spycams had become \u201cpart of daily life\u201d and called for tougher penalties for offenders. Government workers in Seoul have begun daily checks for spycams in public toilets in response to growing public outrage. Song was also fined 1.4 billion won (\u00a3980,000) and ordered to attend 80 hours of sexual violence prevention education, the Korea Herald said.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Brexit deal \u2013 PM\u2019s hands bound tighter still</h2> <p>Good morning, Warren Murray here with the news brought to order.</p> <p>A controversial amendment allowed by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has left Theresa May boxed in over her Brexit deal. The prime minister was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/09/theresa-may-brexit-authority-further-dented-worse-ahead\">again defied by Conservative rebel MPs</a> who voted with Labour in a cross-party alliance to adopt the amendment, which requires May to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/09/may-loses-grip-on-brexit-deal-after-fresh-commons-humiliation\">set out a \u201cplan B\u201d within three working days</a> if her EU-endorsed deal is defeated next Tuesday.</p> <p>The motion setting out the government\u2019s plan can be amended by MPs hoping to push their own alternative proposals, from a second referendum to a harder Brexit. An accelerated timetable will also pile the pressure on Labour to decide which to back. Jeremy Corbyn will today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/09/corbyn-to-again-call-for-general-election-to-break-brexit-deadlock\">repeat his calls for a general election</a>. Downing Street sought to play down the significance of the amendment \u2013 a spokesman said: \u201cOur intention has always been to respond quickly and provide certainty on the way forward in the event that we lose the meaningful vote.\u201d</p> <p>Bercow was accused of being biased against Brexit after he allowed the amendment, put forward by Dominic Grieve, to go forward. But he insisted: \u201cI am clear in the mind that I have taken the right course.\u201d Jessica Elgot writes that Bercow\u2019s judgment \u2013 and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/09/john-bercow-speaker-unafraid-to-hold-the-governments-feet-to-the-fire\">determination to side with the will of parliament over the government</a> \u2013 is likely to be pivotal in the coming days.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Job cuts at Jaguar \u2013 </strong>In news just breaking this morning, Jaguar Land Rover is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/10/jaguar-land-rover-job-cuts\">poised to announce up to 5,000 job losses</a>. The carmaker is reportedly set to embark on a savings programme amid falling sales in China, Brexit and a drop in demand for diesel cars. We\u2019ll have more on that story on the site during the day.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Congo election result announced \u2013 </strong>Riot police are on the streets in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where authorities have belatedly declared Felix Tshisekedi winner of the presidential election. Pre-election polls had given opposition frontrunner Martin Fayulu, a respected former business executive, a healthy lead. Fayulu\u2019s supporters believe outgoing President Joseph Kabila <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/10/congo-election-felix-tshisekedi-declared-winner-in-contentious-result\">may have done a power-sharing deal to put Tshisekedi in power</a> if his own anointed successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, did not win. Vote tallies compiled by the DRC\u2019s Catholic church found Fayulu clearly won the election, diplomatic officials told the Reuters news agency. Security forces took up positions outside the offices of the DRC\u2019s election commission and elsewhere in the capital, Kinshasa, amid fears of a violent response to the result.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Trump gets the hump \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/09/shutdown-trump-border-wall-demand\">stalked out of a meeting with Democrats over the federal shutdown</a>, gifting them the chance to reiterate that he is seeking to govern by \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d. Senator Chuck Schumer told reporters afterwards: \u201cThe president just got up and walked out \u2026 He asked Speaker Pelosi: \u2018Will you agree to my wall?\u2019 She said no, and he just got up and said we have nothing to discuss and walked out.\u201d The shutdown is nearing three weeks long. Elsewhere in US politics, the newly minted congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has hit out over \u201cdisgusting\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/10/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-hits-out-at-disgusting-media-publishing-fake-nude-image\">fake photos published by conservative media</a> that depicted her naked in a bathtub. \u201cThis was just a matter of time \u2026 Women in leadership face more scrutiny. Period.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Bad breath \u2013 </strong>It might seem a tad slow off the mark that officialdom is just realising even a fairly short ride on the tube makes your snot go black. Researchers have found air pollution in London\u2019s underground stations is up to 30 times higher than beside busy roads in the capital. Passengers breathe in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/09/london-underground-air-pollution-report-concerns-northern-line-particulates\">same concentration of particulates in an hour on the tube as they do in a full day above ground</a>. The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) has warned Transport for London (TfL) it is \u201clikely there is some health risk\u201d. Tests singled out the Northern Line and Hampstead station as particularly bad for hazardous PM2.5 particles. TfL says it has accepted the recommendations in the report and will carry out further monitoring and testing of dust samples.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Space oddity \u2013 </strong>Possibly alien starship exhaust, but probably stars crashing into each other in a galaxy far, far away \u2013 the verdict on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/09/repeating-fast-radio-bursts-from-deep-space-could-be-aliens\">\u201cfast radio bursts\u201d (FRBs) coming in from outer space</a>. A new, repeating source of origin for the millisecond-long pulses has been detected by a Canadian-led team with a new kind of radio telescope.

Nasa hopes to get it working again, and it did manage to discover the brightest ever quasar, with the intensity of about a trillion suns, before going offline.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Resolute in the new year \u2013 </strong>If you feel like your new year\u2019s resolutions are already slipping away, we\u2019ve got nine ways to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/10/struggling-with-new-year-resolutions-willpower\">boost your willpower, or at least make the most of your existing reserves</a>, to get fit, write that book, or stay off the drink. Remember that experiment with the children and the marshmallows, where they could eat one now, or two later? \u201cThe \u2018high delayers\u2019 went on to achieve greater academic success, better health and lower divorce rates,\u201d Anita Chaudhuri reminds us. \u201cSo there is more at stake than whether or not you make it to the end of Dry January.\u201d (The Briefing wonders, though, whether they factored in that some kids probably like marshmallows more than others.)</p> <h2>Today in Focus podcast: El Salvador\u2019s abortion ban on trial</h2> <p>The shocking case of Imelda Cortez has put El Salvador\u2019s strict abortion laws in the spotlight.

The Sun\u2019s headline is: \u201cSpeaker of the devil\u201d and the Express says: \u201cYou\u2019re so out of order!\u201d The Times reports: \u201cTory rebels join forces with Labour over Brexit\u201d, while the Mirror claims it as a victory for Labour and its constituency: \u201cMay caves in on workers\u2019 rights to save Brexit deal\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s splash is \u201cMay\u2019s power ebbing away as she suffers another humiliating defeat\u201d and the i has a similar focus, writing: \u201cMay losing control of Brexit\u201d. The FT goes with \u201cMay offers MPs \u2018backstop\u2019 veto after second Commons defeat\u201d. You can take a closer look at today\u2019s front pages here.

Amid the glorious scenery, you eat delicious, healthy vegetarian meals (and can even take a recipe book home), do yoga, hill walk, learn to meditate or reinvigorate your practice and your life. It\u2019s the perfect place to come if you just want some time out to reset yourself. I\u2019ve come here for the weekend and for a week. They operate on the Buddhist principle of Dana or generosity. You pay the deposit of \u00a375 (for a week) or \u00a350 (weekend) and then from a suggested scale (from \u00a3285 to \u00a3445 for a week). It\u2019s a magical place. \u2022 dhanakosa.com Carolann Seekers\u2019 rest, Carmarthenshire The Mandala Ashram in south-west Wales calls itself a \u201chome for seekers\u201d \u2013 and it really lives its values, offering a screen-free, turmeric-rich environment with a rule of silence from 9pm to breakfast, after which you\u2019re allocated a task to help the community function. You\u2019re invited to use this work to meditate on the values of \u201cright-living\u201d \u2013 even when off your yoga mat. If you manage to shatter two glass shelves as you clean out the fridge \u2013 as I did \u2013 you are supported in reflecting on mindfulness. \u2022 Three-day retreat \u00a3235 full-board, mandalayogaashram.co.uk Elizabeth Gowing New horizons, North Yorkshire After a short but destructive relationship broke me I Googled \u201cplace to go when you are tired\u201d and found Raw Horizons, near Thirsk in North Yorkshire. I spent five days and nights with five other women (all were there for different reasons) plus the life coach and her mum in their beautiful private house. While doing things I have never done before (guided meditation, daily yoga, collaging, goddess dancing and raw eating) I rediscovered my inner strength and mojo for life.

Peace, quiet, walks, sunsets, poetry library, whisky, fires, ghost stories, other writers and haggis. It\u2019s brilliant value for money, and the staff are exceptional, giving you just the right support. I can honestly say it changed my life \u2013 I quit my job soon after I came back and am heading back to Scotland soon. \u2022 \u00a3350 for five days full-board, moniackmhor.org.uk Kitty Nordic nature, Sweden I spent four days at a lakeside yoga retreat in the wild forest of Bergslagen, a two-hour drive from Stockholm. The enchanting setting offers a nourishing immersion into Nordic nature, yoga and spirituality. From the moment I arrived, I went offline, replacing screen time with yoga, meditation, forest walks, wild swimming, kirtan (shared recitation) and journalling. Highlights included a floating wood-fired sauna and wholesome vegetarian meals, inspired by Ayurveda (holistic healing).

New for the third generation is a softer, more rounded aesthetic with fabric sides. It is also slightly larger in all directions, measuring 99mm in diameter and 43mm tall.</p> <p>At the back is a circular power socket, replacing the microUSB socket of the old Dot, and a standard 3.5mm analogue socket for connecting to a stereo. On top you have the volume buttons, action button and the microphone mute button.</p> <p>You can also use Bluetooth to stream from the Dot to other speakers or from your phone or other device to the Dot to use it as Bluetooth speaker.</p> <h2>Improved sound</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"147a60a434eaafe9183563befa1440cc7652945e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/147a60a434eaafe9183563befa1440cc7652945e/3_0_3361_2019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon echo dot review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The speaker now projects out through the fabric sides of the new Dot, making it more capable of filling a room with music.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The updated design is joined by an improved speaker. The sound is fired out from the fabric sides of the new Dot, instead of the plastic top of the old model, projecting sound further into the room making it much better for music.</p> <p>The quality of the speaker has also been upgraded. It won\u2019t beat larger speakers, but for the money it sounds pretty good, edging out Google\u2019s Home Mini.</p> <p>The mids are punchy, the highs relatively crisp and while there\u2019s no real bass to speak of, the new Dot sounds relatively rounded for a small speaker.</p> <p>Feed it guitars and vocals from something like the live version of Hotel California by the Eagles from Hell Freezes Over and you\u2019re greeted with a warm, inviting tone. Classical tracks such as Jupiter from Holst\u2019s the Planets sound fairly rounded too. The Dot struggles with bass-driven electronica, but coped better than expected with Dr Dre\u2019s Still D.R.E. despite its pumping bassline.</p> <p>The Dot can also get pretty loud, although not quite as loud as Google\u2019s Home Mini, and the audio starts to distort in high-energy tracks at maximum volume.</p> <h2>Alexa</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0406439c9c60fed10b6315ef46431210b4c3101d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0406439c9c60fed10b6315ef46431210b4c3101d/0_0_3155_1893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon echo dot review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Press the mute button on the top of the Dot and see both the button light up and the light ring turn red so you know the microphones are disconnected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With smart speakers, the hardware you buy is only half the story: they live or die by the capability of the voice assistant within them.</p> <p>The Dot\u2019s Alexa performance is first rate, with its four-microphone array being able to hear you over things like the cooker hood going full pelt in the kitchen or when playing music at maximum volume even if you do have to shout a bit. Alexa also sounds good through the Dot\u2019s speakers.</p> <p>But where Alexa was the only game in town, it\u2019s now a two-horse race between Alexa and Google Assistant. For most things Alexa and Assistant are on a level playing field, particularly if you\u2019re not entirely integrated into Google\u2019s ecosystem already.</p> <p>Smart home control, music playback, podcasts, news briefings, playing radio stations, setting multiple alarms, timers and various other little bits like that all work great.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/04/how-do-i-get-best-from-alexa-amazon-echo-hacks-apps-accessories-skills\">How do I get the best from Alexa?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alexa has a lot of third-party \u201cskills\u201d (apps), including those from news publishers such as the Guardian, games such as Escape the Room, utilities such as National Rail app and silly things such Star Trek \u2013 Red Alert, so you can pretend you\u2019re on the starship Enterprise.</p> <p>You can change Alexa\u2019s wake word too, which is the word it listens out for when dormant before activating. \u201cAlexa\u201d is the default, but options include Echo, Computer or Amazon - helpful if you have anyone called Alex in your house and want to avoid accidental activations of either the Dot or the human.</p> <p>Where Google\u2019s Assistant has the edge is in interpreting speech when you mess up your questions, or when you issue multiple commands at once such as \u201cturn off the Christmas tree and the living room lights\u201d. Google can also answer a greater range of questions than Alexa.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"721469f11f416701e10a45894d7eb631c88a5246\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/721469f11f416701e10a45894d7eb631c88a5246/0_0_3920_2352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon echo dot review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The back of the new Dot has a new round power port for the included 15W charger, but still has the 3.5mm analogue output.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Alexa can finally recognise different voice profiles for different users in one home in the UK as of November</p></li> <li><p>The blue light ring around the top is easy to see from across the room</p></li> <li><p>You can buy things on Amazon via voice if you want, but it can be a laborious process unless you know the precise name of the item and variant.

      "bodyText": "Amazon\u2019s latest low-cost Alexa-powered smart speaker, the third-generation Echo Dot, looks better, sounds better, but still costs the same budget-friendly \u00a350. When the second-generation Echo Dot launched in the UK it had very little in the way of competition. Having everything that was good about Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant squeezed into a smaller package half the price of the bigger Echo, it was a no-brainer. But now the Echo Dot has some stiff competition from Google, in the form of the \u00a350 Home Mini and its Assistant, and Amazon\u2019s own second-generation Echo, which is now only \u00a390. What is it? The Echo Dot is Amazon\u2019s small, puck-like smart speaker with the firm\u2019s Alexa voice assistant built in. New for the third generation is a softer, more rounded aesthetic with fabric sides. It is also slightly larger in all directions, measuring 99mm in diameter and 43mm tall. At the back is a circular power socket, replacing the microUSB socket of the old Dot, and a standard 3.5mm analogue socket for connecting to a stereo. On top you have the volume buttons, action button and the microphone mute button. You can also use Bluetooth to stream from the Dot to other speakers or from your phone or other device to the Dot to use it as Bluetooth speaker. Improved sound The updated design is joined by an improved speaker. The sound is fired out from the fabric sides of the new Dot, instead of the plastic top of the old model, projecting sound further into the room making it much better for music. The quality of the speaker has also been upgraded. It won\u2019t beat larger speakers, but for the money it sounds pretty good, edging out Google\u2019s Home Mini. The mids are punchy, the highs relatively crisp and while there\u2019s no real bass to speak of, the new Dot sounds relatively rounded for a small speaker. Feed it guitars and vocals from something like the live version of Hotel California by the Eagles from Hell Freezes Over and you\u2019re greeted with a warm, inviting tone. Classical tracks such as Jupiter from Holst\u2019s the Planets sound fairly rounded too. The Dot struggles with bass-driven electronica, but coped better than expected with Dr Dre\u2019s Still D.R.E. despite its pumping bassline. The Dot can also get pretty loud, although not quite as loud as Google\u2019s Home Mini, and the audio starts to distort in high-energy tracks at maximum volume. Alexa With smart speakers, the hardware you buy is only half the story: they live or die by the capability of the voice assistant within them. The Dot\u2019s Alexa performance is first rate, with its four-microphone array being able to hear you over things like the cooker hood going full pelt in the kitchen or when playing music at maximum volume even if you do have to shout a bit. Alexa also sounds good through the Dot\u2019s speakers. But where Alexa was the only game in town, it\u2019s now a two-horse race between Alexa and Google Assistant. For most things Alexa and Assistant are on a level playing field, particularly if you\u2019re not entirely integrated into Google\u2019s ecosystem already. Smart home control, music playback, podcasts, news briefings, playing radio stations, setting multiple alarms, timers and various other little bits like that all work great. Alexa has a lot of third-party \u201cskills\u201d (apps), including those from news publishers such as the Guardian, games such as Escape the Room, utilities such as National Rail app and silly things such Star Trek \u2013 Red Alert, so you can pretend you\u2019re on the starship Enterprise. You can change Alexa\u2019s wake word too, which is the word it listens out for when dormant before activating. \u201cAlexa\u201d is the default, but options include Echo, Computer or Amazon - helpful if you have anyone called Alex in your house and want to avoid accidental activations of either the Dot or the human. Where Google\u2019s Assistant has the edge is in interpreting speech when you mess up your questions, or when you issue multiple commands at once such as \u201cturn off the Christmas tree and the living room lights\u201d. Google can also answer a greater range of questions than Alexa. Observations Alexa can finally recognise different voice profiles for different users in one home in the UK as of November The blue light ring around the top is easy to see from across the room You can buy things on Amazon via voice if you want, but it can be a laborious process unless you know the precise name of the item and variant. I turned it off. Price The Amazon Echo Dot (third generation) is available in black, grey or white costing \u00a349.99, although supply constraints mean you might need to shop around. For comparison, the previous version also cost \u00a350, while Google\u2019s competing Home Mini costs \u00a349. Amazon\u2019s larger Echo costs \u00a389.99, the Echo Plus \u00a3139.99, the Echo Spot \u00a3119.99 and the Echo Show \u00a3219.99. Verdict The new Echo Dot is a slight improvement over the old one in every way. It\u2019s more attractive, sounds better, hears you just as well, still has a 3.5mm socket and Bluetooth audio in and out. It isn\u2019t a patch on the larger Echo speakers, which are almost twice the price, but just about beats its closest rival, the Google Home Mini, on sound and connectivity. At \u00a350, or frequently \u00a330 on deals, you get a lot of smart speaker for the money with the Echo Dot. But where the original Echo Dot was a no-brainer, the decision now comes down to whether you want Alexa or Google Assistant in your tiny smart speaker, which is a much tougher call to make. Pros: can always hear you, small but loud enough, great device support, clear when muted, activity can been seen from across the room, Bluetooth, 3.5mm audio socket Cons: music distorts at max volume, no real bass, general knowledge not quite as good as Google Assistant Other reviews Amazon Echo second-generation review: smaller, cheaper and better Google Home review: the smart speaker that answers almost any question Google Home Mini review: a brilliant little \u00a350 voice assistant speaker",

In that one day, 588 survivors were brought aboard. The Aquarius can accommodate 600 people but we\u2019ve had to bring 1,000 on before.

If we arrived directly with an enormous ship it could risk damaging the migrants\u2019 boat, or people might start jumping into the water. The priority is always to ensure people will be able to stay afloat if anything happens.</p> <p>The rubber boats \u2013 this one is typical \u2013 tend to contain eight people for every square metre. The boats are very thin and are always overloaded and consequently very fragile. The people in this photo were fleeing Libya and had already spent 10 to 15 hours at sea, but their boat was in relatively good shape and was still completely inflated. The people were dehydrated, but thankfully no one was injured or had fallen overboard.</p> <p>This is one of the few images I have where the rescued people are looking straight at me. I shot it from the vantage point of one of the rescue boats; someone next to me from the rescue team must have been giving instructions about how to get on the Aquarius. The framing is very tight, which heightens the claustrophobia of being on the migrant boat. The shot represents maybe a third of its total length. Several people have told me the reflections in the water remind them of blood or fire. The sea is hostile: when you\u2019ve been on it for several hours, you burn, you dehydrate.</p> <p>In the middle of the sea, you\u2019re isolated. There\u2019s nobody around. If you don\u2019t photograph what\u2019s happening, there will be no evidence of broken boats, of the deaths. But there\u2019s an important ethic to respect: you don\u2019t photograph the faces of the dead or those who drowned. The images have to be informative for the public, and maintain the dignity of the subjects, who are in incredibly vulnerable situations. They have only the clothes on their backs, squeezed against one another on the rubber boats. On board the Aquarius we have discussions, we distribute food, we stay on watch. There are stories that are unbearable to hear, but there are moments that are enriching, too. During my last mission I took a mini printer and printed photos for the survivors.

Maritime law states that we should be able to disembark at the nearest safe port to the rescue, but that has become challenging.

Under President Barack Obama, who created Daca, participants were allowed to travel abroad under limited circumstances \u2013 including academic study \u2013 and return to the United States. But Donald Trump ordered an end to the Daca protections. Federal courts have ruled against him, ordering the program \u2013 which protects some 700,000 people \u2013 to stay in place for now. Park and his supporters say that should mean travel abroad is still allowed \u2013 but it\u2019s unclear if the federal government will agree. \u201cThe government should enforce the law as it currently stands, to allow Jin to fulfil his scholarly work,\u201d said Kristian Ramos of Define American, an immigrant advocacy group that supported Park\u2019s bid for the scholarship. Park, a resident of Queens in New York who founded the advocacy group Higher Dreams, first applied for the Rhodes scholarship last year and was rejected because Daca recipients did not qualify. But the organization changed its policy, and he reapplied and won the award. After graduating from Harvard last month, he plans to enroll at Oxford in the fall in spite of the uncertainty, and hopes to study migration and political theory. He said he\u2019s had trouble bringing up the potential perils with his parents, who cried when he won the scholarship. \u201cThis was especially meaningful for them. It was like a validation of the sacrifices they\u2019ve made for me,\u201d he told the AP. Regardless of what happens next, he considers Queens his home. \u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019m always going to know that fact. Even if I have to spend the rest of my life convincing the administration, or whoever comes next,\u201d he said.",

The word evokes the long-simmering resentments of the everyman, brought to a boil by charismatic politicians hawking impossible promises. Often as not, populism sounds like something from a horror film: an alien bacteria that has somehow slipped through democracy\u2019s defences \u2013 aided, perhaps, by Steve Bannon or some other wily agent of mass manipulation \u2013 and is now poisoning political life, creating new ranks of populist voters among \u201cus\u201d.

All responsible citizens have a responsibility to do their part in the battle \u2013 to know populism when they see it, understand its appeal (but not fall for it), and support politics that stop populism in its tracks, thereby saving democracy as we know it. \u201cBy fighting off the current infection,\u201d writes Yascha Mounk, until recently executive director of Blair\u2019s IGC and a prominent anti-populist writer, \u201cwe might just build up the necessary antibodies to remain immune against new bouts of the populist disease for decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>But as breathless op-eds and thinktank reports about the populist menace keep piling up, they have provoked a sceptical backlash from critics who wonder aloud if populism even exists. It is now relatively common to encounter the idea that, just as there were no real witches in Salem, there are no real populists in politics \u2013 just people, attitudes and movements that the political centre misunderstands and fears, and wants you, reader, to fear too, although without the burden of having to explain exactly why. Populism, in this framing, is a bogeyman: a nonentity invoked for the purpose of stirring up fear. This argument has even made its way to the centrist mainstream. \u201cLet\u2019s do away with the word \u2018populist,\u2019\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/opinion/populism-language-meaning.html\" title=\"\">wrote</a> the New York Times columnist Roger Cohen in July. \u201cIt\u2019s become sloppy to the point of meaninglessness, an overused epithet for multiple manifestations of political anger. Worse, it\u2019s freighted with contempt, applied to all voters who have decided that mainstream political parties have done nothing for their static incomes or disappearing jobs or sense of national decline these past two decades.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to deny that much talk of populism obscures more than it illuminates, and tells us more about anti-populist crusaders than any real live populist parties or voters. But long before populism became an object of transatlantic media fascination \u2013 before it became a zeitgeisty one-word explanation for everything \u2013 a small group of academics was studying it, trying to figure out exactly what it is and what lessons it holds for democratic politics. The debate they have produced is, like many academic debates, knotty and self-referential \u2013 and will always live in the shadow of the muddled media and political discourse. But it helps us see that the idea of populism is something more than just a centrist fairytale.</p> <p>Thanks in large part to the persistent failure of governments across the west to enact anything resembling a credible vision of shared prosperity and security in the post-manufacturing era, we are now living through a time when familiar webs connecting citizens, ideologies and political parties are, if not falling apart, at least beginning to loosen and shift. As a result, the question of populism is not going away. The coming years are likely to include all of the following: more movements being labelled as populist, more movements calling themselves populist, more movements defensively insisting that they are <em>not</em> populist, and more conversations about the extent to which populism represents the problem or the solution.</p> <p>The academic debate on populism shows us that making sense of this landscape requires more than just a usable definition of the P-word. In short, it shows us that we can\u2019t really talk about populism without talking about our conflicting conceptions of democracy \u2013 and the question of what it truly means for citizens to be sovereign.</p> <p>It may be telling that very little of the public discussion of the alleged populist threat to democracy has been devoted to the workings of democracy itself. Perhaps we assume, without much thought, that democracy is such a self-explanatory idea that we already know all there is to know about the subject. Or perhaps we have come to regard democracy in its existing western form \u2013 basically liberal democracy \u2013 as the only possible endpoint for the evolution of politics. Populism, though it comes in many forms, always reminds us that nothing could be further from the truth.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In 2004 a young Dutch political scientist named Cas Mudde published <a href=\"https://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/old/Jungar%20-%20The%20Populist%20Zeitgeist.pdf\" title=\"\">The Populist Zeitgeist</a>, a paper that proposed a new and concise definition of populism \u2013 one that would become the backbone of academic populism studies, a field that hardly existed at the time. Mudde was convinced that populism was a useful concept, which meant something more specific than \u201cdemocracy, but practised in a way that I find distasteful\u201d. He was especially keen to challenge two common intuitions about populism: that it is uniquely defined by \u201chighly emotional and simplistic\u201d rhetoric, and that it primarily consists of \u201copportunistic policies\u201d that aim to \u201cbuy\u201d the support of voters.</p> <p>Populism, Mudde argued, is more than just demagogy or opportunism. But it is not a fully formed political ideology like socialism or liberalism \u2013 it is instead a \u201cthin\u201d ideology, made up of just a few core beliefs. First: the most important division in society is an antagonistic one between \u201cthe people\u201d, understood to be fundamentally good, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/29/why-we-stopped-trusting-elites-the-new-populism\" title=\"\">\u201cthe elite\u201d</a>, understood to be fundamentally corrupt and out of touch with everyday life. Second: all populists believe that politics should be an expression of the \u201cgeneral will\u201d \u2013 a set of desires presumed to be shared as common sense by all \u201cordinary people\u201d. (Implicit in this belief is another: that such a thing as this \u201cgeneral will\u201d exists.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/29/why-we-stopped-trusting-elites-the-new-populism\">Why we stopped trusting elites</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A populist movement, then, is one that consistently promises to channel the unified will of the people, and by doing so undercut the self-serving schemes of the elite establishment. As the National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen put it in 2007: \u201cI will give voice to the people. Because in democracy only the people can be right, and none can be right against them.\u201d (Note how, in this formulation, there is no disagreement among \u201cthe people\u201d.) Or, in the more recent words of Donald Trump, speaking at his inauguration: \u201cWe are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people \u2026 The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.\u201d (Note how members of \u201cthe establishment\u201d are implicitly excluded from \u201cthe citizens\u201d.)</p> <p>For decades, attempts at clear-headed conversations about populism had been stymied by the question of how it could be attributed to parties and politicians that were so obviously different: how can Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, for example, both be called populist? In what way are Occupy Wall Street and Brexit both possible examples of populist phenomena? Mudde\u2019s simple definition caught on because it has no trouble answering this type of question. If populism is truly ideologically \u201cthin\u201d, then it has to attach itself to a more substantial host ideology in order to survive. But this ideology can lie anywhere along the left-right spectrum. Because, in Mudde\u2019s definition, populism is always piggybacking on other ideologies, the wide variety of populisms isn\u2019t a problem. It\u2019s exactly what you would expect.</p> <p>\u201cThe people\u201d and \u201cthe elite\u201d, Mudde wrote, are groupings with no static definition from one populist movement to another. These categories are, first and foremost, moral: people good, elites bad. The question of exactly who belongs in which group, though, depends on the character of the populist movement, and which \u201cthick\u201d ideology the populism ends up attached to. A populist \u201cpeople\u201d can define itself by an ethnic identity it feels is under threat, but just as easily by a shared sense of being victims of economic exploitation. What matters is that it blames a perceived class of corrupt elites; in the case of rightwing populisms, it may also heap scorn on some underclass, whether immigrants or racial minorities, whom the elites are accused of favouring with special treatment as part of their plot to keep power away from \u201creal people\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dfdd7784a1bc270d2ba52c359e032281afe22d16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfdd7784a1bc270d2ba52c359e032281afe22d16/338_62_4305_2583/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders supporters in California in March 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders supporters in California in March 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When The Populist Zeitgeist was published, populism wasn\u2019t a hot topic: in all of 2005, Mudde\u2019s paper was cited only nine times. But as the field of populism studies has ballooned alongside mainstream interest in the subject, the paper has become widely recognised as a classic. By a wide margin, Mudde is now the populism scholar most likely to be cited or interviewed by journalists \u2013 as often as not, for articles in which his definition intermingles with the same old sloppy generalisations he set out to overturn.</p> <p>Today, no academic disputes the dominance of Mudde\u2019s definition, especially among the growing number of scholars hoping to be part of the conversation about populism as a global phenomenon. One major factor in its success, in fact, is the way that it anticipated events in world politics. The market crashes of 2008 led to the emergence of anti-austerity movements \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/podemos-revolution-radical-academics-changed-european-politics\" title=\"\">Podemos</a> in Spain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syriza\" title=\"\">Syriza</a> in Greece, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy\" title=\"\">Occupy</a> worldwide \u2013 motivated by rage at financial institutions and the small class of people who benefited from their profits. These movements were obviously animated by a sense of opposition between \u201cthe people\u201d and \u201cthe elite\u201d \u2013 but old theories of populism that defined it specifically as rightwing, racist or anti-immigrant were insufficiently capacious to describe these new developments in populist politics.</p> <p>The thin-ideology definition is also extremely congenial to the landscape of contemporary academic political science, which places a considerable premium on broad frameworks that enable young scholars to do empirical, quantitative work. Many new scholars of populism no longer feel the need to argue over definitions. Instead, they perform textual analyses designed to detect how often populism\u2019s core ideas, as laid out in Mudde\u2019s 2004 article, pop up in party platforms, political speeches, manifestos and tweets. Or they administer surveys designed to track the prevalence of the core tenets of populism in different populations, searching for profiles of archetypal populist voters.</p> <p>Every time another paper relying on the ideological framework is published, it becomes a little more entrenched \u2013 a matter of some frustration to the minority of academics who still think it misses the point.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The rise of the thin-ideology definition, and its increasing influence in the still-ballooning public conversation about populism, has consistently provoked the objections of a small but persistent camp of dissenters within populism studies. These academics think defining populism in terms of core beliefs is a deep methodological error: many of them also think defining populism as an ideology runs the risk of making effective and worthwhile political strategies seem irresponsible, even dangerous.</p> <p>These academics are likely to stress the extent to which mainstream political parties in the US and Europe have converged in recent decades, narrowing the range of opinions that find real purchase in national decision-making. They take as a given that this has swelled the ranks of people who feel that what gets called democracy responds to their concerns much less than it caters to the whims of a small, wealthy, self-dealing class of elites \u2013 elites who vigorously deny their own complicity in this state of affairs, often by insisting that there is no alternative.</p> <p>As you might expect, these scholars tend to be most interested in challenges to the status quo that come from the left \u2013 from \u201cthe 99%\u201d of Occupy Wall Street and the Sanders campaign, to the \u201cmany not the few\u201d of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party \u2013 and foreground an insistence that politics is not yet serving the correct constituency. They are also instinctively alert to the possibility that the self-preserving centre will try to defang outsider challenges by making anyone who endorses them appear unreasonable, frightening and constitutionally unequipped for the sober task of governance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"030f24db79f26dfba0b9608ca4451018f401b265\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/030f24db79f26dfba0b9608ca4451018f401b265/0_92_2608_1565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Occupy Wall Street protest in New York, October 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Occupy Wall Street protest in New York, October 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone USA-Zuma/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This makes them suspicious of any suggestion that there is an identifiable ideology called populism that has fundamental similarities no matter where on the political spectrum it appears. For this crowd, talk of an essence of populism \u2013 however thin \u2013 shades too easily into a charge of guilt by association, which inevitably has the effect of saddling leftwing populist movements (or even populist-<em>looking</em> movements) with the baggage of their xenophobic and racist rightwing counterparts. More specifically, they are likely to worry that the emphasis on exaggerated moralism as a defining feature of populism makes it too easy to depict legitimate opposition to elite power as irrational mobs.</p> <p>Most objections to the thin-ideology definition owe a substantial debt to a duo of leftist political theorists: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/10/populists-rise-progressives-radical-right\" title=\"\">Chantal Mouffe</a>, a Belgian who teaches at the University of Westminster, and her late husband, the Argentine Ernesto Laclau. Both thinkers have directly informed the new European left populist movements, including Syriza, Podemos and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s La France Insoumise.</p> <p>Mouffe and Laclau\u2019s writings on Marxism and populism \u2013 some of which they produced together, and some separately \u2013 are famously dense and sometimes resistant to summary. But at their core is the idea that conflict is an inescapable and defining feature of political life. In other words, the realm of politics is one where antagonism is natural and unavoidable, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/20/the-death-of-consensus-how-conflict-came-back-to-politics\" title=\"\">consensus cannot ever be permanent</a>, and there is always a \u201cwe\u201d and a \u201cthey\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPolitical questions are not mere technical issues to be solved by experts,\u201d Mouffe insists. \u201cProperly political questions always involve decisions which require us to make a choice between conflicting alternatives.\u201d This emphasis on conflict produces a vision of democratic life that looks more radical than typical mainstream accounts of liberal democracy \u2013 but, Laclau and Mouffe would argue, one that more accurately describes the actual logic of politics.</p> <p>In this view, any existing socio-political order (or \u201chegemony\u201d in Mouffe and Laclau\u2019s preferred formation, borrowed from the Italian Marxist philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci) is subject to challenge. Every status quo \u2013 however sturdy \u2013 is only temporary, and can always be challenged by a movement that seeks to replace it with something new. Political change, in other words, is the result of demands against the existing order, which must be fused together in a movement to change it \u2013 a movement that may look a lot like populism.</p> <p>When my demands and your demands and our neighbours\u2019 demands are brought together in such a movement, they can become the basis for a new political \u201cwe\u201d: a \u201cpeople\u201d insisting that the current arrangement of power be altered in their name. To the extent that such a movement succeeds, it creates a new hegemony \u2013 a new baseline \u2013 which itself becomes open to challenge over time.</p> <p>From this perspective, populism is just another word for real politics: for people (\u201cus\u201d) creating together, live on the ground, a sense of how our dissatisfactions relate, who is to blame (\u201cthem\u201d), and how to force a change.</p> <p>But those who benefit from the status quo don\u2019t want it to change; to this end, they might champion toothless approaches to collective decision-making: bipartisan consensus as an end in itself; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/01/why-replacing-politicians-with-experts-is-a-reckless-idea\" title=\"\">the elevation of \u201crational\u201d experts</a> over hot-headed partisans; \u201cThird Way\u201d centrism that shuns ideological conflict in favour of \u201cwhat works\u201d or mediation by liberal institutions. These approaches (Mouffe calls them \u201cnon-politics\u201d) may for a time become dominant, as they did in the Anglo-American 1990s and early 2000s. But nothing lasts for ever, especially when the number of people who feel politicians are making their lives more precarious is rising. And then politics \u2013 real politics, which is to say populist politics \u2013 make a return.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"50ed6bb1a0ccefbd5f4060af172e18227f151cd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50ed6bb1a0ccefbd5f4060af172e18227f151cd3/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pablo Iglesias, leader of Spain\u2019s Podemos coalition, in June 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pablo Iglesias, leader of Spain\u2019s Podemos coalition, in June 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francisco Seco/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Mouffe and Laclau, the only inherent connection between rightwing and leftwing populist movements is that both embrace the same fundamental truth about democracy: that it is an ever-shifting contest over how the default \u201cwe\u201d of politics is defined and redefined, in which no one definition can be guaranteed to last. The goal, they argue, should not be placid consensus but \u201cagonistic pluralism\u201d: a state in which opposition and disagreement are accepted as the norm, and in which people maintain the capacity to disagree intensely without demonising each other, or descending into war.</p> <p>Mouffe, in particular, has in recent years argued that the political question of the immediate future is not how to fight populism, but rather which type of populist you want to be. It\u2019s about who you\u2019re with (who belongs in your \u201cchain of equivalence\u201d), who you\u2019re against (who is causing the problem, and how), and where to take your stand. Populism isn\u2019t the problem: instead, leftwing populism is the solution.</p> <p>Not all the academics who take inspiration from Mouffe and Laclau go quite this far, especially in the sober pages of peer-reviewed political science journals. But their work is palpably motivated by a sense that the real threat of \u201cpopulism\u201d is that our panic over the word will foreclose the possibility of new kinds of politics and new challenges to the status quo \u2013 and that fear of populism on the left could enable the victory of populism of the right.</p> <p>These scholars\u2019 preference is for definitions in which it has no ideological essence \u2013 not even the \u201cthin\u201d one posited by Cas Mudde. For them, even though the thin definition readily recognises populism\u2019s ideological portability, it is still irrevocably tainted by pejorative overtones that push participants in debates about populism to take a position \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cagainst\u201d all populisms. With no internal essence, populism is harder to categorise as inherently good or bad. Paris Aslanidis, a Yale political scientist, calls populism a \u201cdiscourse\u201d \u2013 a mode of talking about politics, rather than a set of beliefs \u2013 one that frames politics in terms of the \u201csupremacy of popular sovereignty\u201d.</p> <p>Benjamin Moffitt, a senior lecturer in politics at the Australian Catholic University, refers to populism as a \u201cpolitical style\u201d, the presence of which \u201ctells us very little about the substantive democratic content of any political project\u201d. Under definitions of this type, the central question is not whether a given political actor or group is or isn\u2019t populist. It is instead whether, from moment to moment, they are \u201cdoing populism\u201d, and how, and with what impact.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Of course, these disputes aren\u2019t really about the difference between a \u201cthin ideology\u201d and a \u201cdiscourse.\u201d They are about whether \u201cpopulist\u201d is always an insult, and if the project of defining populism can ever be disentangled from the concept\u2019s pejorative baggage. Ultimately, they are disputes about which types of politics make us suspicious, and why.</p> <p>The current discussion of populism in the west is strongly coloured by the populist far-right parties that emerged in Europe in the late 1980s and early 90s, such as the Austrian Freedom party, the Danish People\u2019s party and the French National Front. What most people knew about these parties, at first, was that they were openly nativist and racist. They talked about \u201creal\u201d citizens of their countries, and fixated on the issue of national and ethnic \u201cpurity,\u201d demonising immigrants and minorities. Many of their party leaders flirted winkingly with antisemitism, and their electoral victories coincided with a resurgence of extreme right-wing violence in Europe, such as the 1991 attack on immigrant workers and asylum seekers in the east German town of Hoyerswerda.</p> <p>When journalists and politicians started calling these parties and their supporters populist, the term was an expression of alarm at a problem and, simultaneously, a euphemism that made it possible to gloss over that problem\u2019s exact qualities. This was especially useful for journalists who feared being viewed as anything less than politically neutral. Populist was obviously not a compliment, but it sounded less alarming than \u201cextreme right\u201d or \u201cradical right\u201d. What the term seemed to communicate more than anything else was backwardness: a juvenile incapacity to bring your preferences to the political arena and engage in the complex give-and-take of rational compromise. The populist combination of immaturity, emotional resentment and intolerance was widely held to constitute a threat to postwar European democracy.</p> <p>In one respect, the thin-ideology definition popularised by Cas Mudde dismantled this view of things, freeing populism from its exclusively far-right connotations, and cautioning against the conflation of populism with the other -isms it was often paired to.</p> <p>Mudde and many other scholars who use the ideological definition have in fact repeatedly argued that neither Trump nor Brexit should be regarded primarily as populist phenomena. Of course both Trump and Brexiters used ample populist rhetoric; but in both cases, they argue, the majority of support was motivated not by passion for populism\u2019s core ideas, but by other ideological factors. After the Cambridge Dictionary declared populism 2017\u2019s \u201cword of the year\u201d, Mudde wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/cambridge-dictionary-nativism-populism-word-year\" title=\"\">a Guardian column</a> criticising the decision. (\u201cIt has become the buzzword of the year,\u201d he noted acidly, \u201cmostly because it is very often poorly defined and wrongly used.\u201d) For the radical-right parties whose electoral campaigns in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Austria raised alarms across Europe, \u201cpopulism comes secondary to nativism, and within contemporary European and US politics, populism functions at best as a fuzzy blanket to camouflage the nastier nativism\u201d, Mudde concluded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6dfdafe0b57723160b10e495979e9e1e0cbfdfa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dfdafe0b57723160b10e495979e9e1e0cbfdfa5/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pro-Brexit campaign bus in London, January 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pro-Brexit campaign bus in London, January 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Chattle/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, despite these caveats, the thin definition nonetheless positions populism as always posing at least something of a majoritarian threat to liberal democracy. It is this judgment, more than any other, that keeps the fight going between scholars who adopt the ideological definition, on one hand, and their Mouffe- and Laclau-inspired critics, on the other.</p> <p>Liberal democracy, in this context, has almost nothing to do with contemporary distinctions between left and right. It refers, instead, to the idea that government should facilitate pluralistic coexistence by balancing the never fully attainable ideal of popular sovereignty with institutions that enshrine the rule of law and civil rights, which cannot easily be overturned by a political majority. (In this regard, as Mudde writes in his original paper, liberal democracy is \u201ctherefore only partly democratic\u201d.) Today, liberal democracy is what most people mean when they talk about democracy \u2013 and therefore, to be deemed a threat to liberal democracy is, in the context of most political discussions, a devastatingly negative judgment.</p> <p>Because populism, as described by the ideological definition, involves a moralised conception of an absolutely sovereign \u201cpeople\u201d \u2013 whose verdicts are regarded as practically unanimous \u2013 it is inevitable that populist movements will come into conflict with the liberal aspects of liberal democracy.</p> <p>If all \u201creal\u201d people think the same way about the things that matter most in politics, then the idea of institutional protections for a dissenting minority are are at best superfluous and at worst nefarious. For the populists, they are just another wall that the corrupt elite has built to keep real power away from the people. The same is true for the independence of judges or regulators, or checks and balances between branches of government \u2013 especially when they appear to stymie the plans of a populist leader. In this account, the most basic elements of liberal democracy become both kindling and fuel for the populist fire.</p> <p>No one who studies populism seriously \u2013 and not even the most opportunistic participants in the cottage industry of anti-populist alarmism \u2013 denies that populist movements can raise valid critiques of the status quo, and of the very real anti-democratic power of elites. Many take a viewpoint similar to that of the Mexican political theorist Benjamin Arditi, who described populism as a drunken guest at democracy\u2019s dinner party, one who disrespects the rules of sociability and, along the way, brings up the failure and hypocrisies that everyone else in the room has agreed to ignore. In Populism: A Very Short Introduction, Mudde and his frequent co-author, the Chilean political scientist Crist\u00f3bal Kaltwasser, describe contemporary populism as an \u201cilliberal democratic response to an undemocratic liberalism\u201d \u2013 one that \u201casks the right questions but provides the wrong answers\u201d.</p> <p>Reading critics from the left, however, one often gets the sense that for them this adds up to so much lipstick on a pig: a sprinkling of nuance and restraint that still leaves populism, no matter its ideological stripe, with an undeserved taint of inherent danger. The unhappiness of these critics is magnified by the fact that populism rarely appears in mainstream discussion as anything but an insult \u2013 often in the mouth of pundits and politicians who regard the left and the right as an equal threat.</p> <p>The fear in these circles is that saying anything negative about \u201cpopulism\u201d<strong> </strong>\u2013 however qualified and analytical \u2013<strong> </strong>simply hands more ammunition to the very people who helped make politics such a hollow, undemocratic mess in the first place. Positioning any populism as fundamentally antithetical to liberal democracy, in this view, simply reinforces the association between populism and mob psychology, and stokes fears that individual rights will always be trampled by group identities.</p> <p>Some scholars in this camp now argue that we should be talking less about populism and more about the centrist \u201canti-populism\u201d that fears and demonises it. \u201cJust as the adulterous spouse is always the one most suspicious of their own partner,\u201d wrote the Italian sociologist Marco d\u2019Eramo in New Left Review in 2013, \u201cso those who eviscerate democracy are the most inclined to see threats to it everywhere. Hence all the to-do about populism betrays a sense of uneasiness, smacks of overkill.\u201d</p> <p>For each side in this debate, the obvious temptation is to simply dismiss the other \u2013 or to insist that what the other side calls \u201cpopulism\u201d isn\u2019t really populism at all, but just something populist-ish. But to conclude that the two camps are simply talking past each other would be to miss the extent to which they are in agreement \u2013and what, taken together, they tell us about the current political moment.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In 1967, when political theorists from around the world gathered at the London School of Economics for the first ever academic conference on populism, they had a hard time figuring out exactly what they were supposed to be talking about. The word came from the \u201cprairie populists\u201d, an 1890s movement of US farmers who supported more robust regulation of capitalism. But in the intervening decades it had been used for a wide and varied grab bag of phenomena from around the world, from McCarthyite anti-communist witch-hunts in the US to charismatic Latin American leaders.</p> <p>In the end, the conference proceedings failed to clarify the matter at hand. \u201cThere can at present be no doubt about the <em>importance</em> of populism,\u201d read a summary report. \u201cBut no one is clear what it is.\u201d</p> <p>Over half a century later, there has been some progress. Populism, specialists now agree, is an ideologically portable way of looking at politics as a forum for opposition between \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201celites\u201d. This definition creates more questions: is the conceptual \u201cpeople\u201d of populism inherently defined in a way that spells danger to pluralistic coexistence? Or, less menacingly, is the idea of \u201cthe people\u201d a necessary but always malleable concept \u2013 simply part of what it means to do politics?</p> <p>But populism, whatever it is, is not a chemical: no scientist will ever come along and reveal its exact, objective composition. Populism is a lens for looking at our politics, including \u2013 down a long hall of mirrors \u2013 the politics of what gets called populist, and with what implications.</p> <p>The questions of populism would have little urgency were it not for the widespread agreement about the shortcomings of the political status quo: about the abyss between the shining ideals of equality and responsive government implied by our talk about democracy and the tarnished reality of life on the ground. The notion that \u201cthe people\u201d are being poorly served by politics has vast resonance across the political spectrum, and for good reason.</p> <p>But what is the remedy? Among the proponents of the ideological definition, some decline to provide an answer, claiming that they are looking only to define and measure populism, not take a stance on it. Others admit that, in the case of populism, the options for producing a description without forming a judgment are basically nonexistent. The order of the day, in their view, is to convince citizens to recommit to liberal democracy and its institutions.</p> <p>There is, however, widespread recognition in this camp \u2013 more than they are credited with by their critics on the left \u2013 that it will no longer suffice to insist that there is no acceptable alternative to existing liberal democracy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/07/populism-dead-european-victories-centrists\" title=\"\">Writing in the Guardian</a> in 2017, Mudde argued that responding to populism required more than \u201cpurely anti-populist campaigns\u201d; it would take, he claimed, \u201ca return to ideological politics\u201d. Even liberals who want some issues to be \u201cdepoliticised\u201d \u2013 to be removed from the realm of democracy and handed over to experts \u2013 will have to, at a minimum, remake the case for those decisions. Nothing can stay depoliticised for ever; that\u2019s politics.</p> <p>If you squint just a little, this looks more than a bit like what you would expect from Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, with their insistence that there is no space \u201cbeyond left and right\u201d and no way to put political decisions \u2013 decisions about our collective fate \u2013 outside the reach of politics. Arguably, you might say that the defenders of liberal democracy are being suddenly reacquainted with the need to construct a democratic \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 a people \u2013 around their demand to protect liberal institutions and procedures, in opposition to radical rightwing parties who are happy to see them discarded.</p> <p>The corresponding challenge for anyone further on the left is to figure out the relationship between their long-term goals and the ideals of liberal democracy. There have always been critics for whom liberal democracy is sham democracy: a nice-sounding set of universal principles that, in practice, end up functioning as smokescreens that normalise the exploitations and inequities of capitalism.</p> <p>Other theorists, Mouffe included, view something like the European social democracy of the 60s and 70s as the precondition for whatever comes next \u2013 for \u201cradical democracy\u201d that forces liberal democracy to make good on its promises of equality. But even Mouffe is no longer optimistic about our ability to revive our democratic prospects. Two years ago she wrote: \u201cIn 1985 we said \u2018we need to radicalise democracy\u2019; now we first need to restore democracy, so we can then radicalise it; the task is far more difficult.\u201d What that task will look like on the ground is an open question.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/20/the-death-of-consensus-how-conflict-came-back-to-politics\">The death of consensus: how conflict came back to politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The media framing of populism almost always sounds like a discussion about the margins: about forces from outside \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201crational\u201d politics threatening to throw off the balance of the status quo. But the scholarly discourse makes clear that this is backward: that populism is inherent to democracy, and especially to democracy as we know it in the contemporary west. It finds life in the cracks \u2013 or more lately, the chasms \u2013 between democracy\u2019s promises and the impossibility of their full, permanent realisation.</p> <p>The question of populism, then, is always the question of what kind of democracy we want, and the fact that we will never stop arguing about this. Anxiety about populism can be a smokescreen for people who don\u2019t want the world as they know it to be disturbed. But it also flows from the core insight that we can never know exactly where democracy is going to take us \u2013 not this time, nor the next, nor the time after that.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When populism appears in the media, which it does more and more often now, it is typically presented without explanation, as if everyone can already define it. And everyone can, sort of \u2013 at least as long as they\u2019re allowed to simply cite the very developments that populism is supposed to explain: Brexit, Trump, Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s takeover of Hungary, the rise of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. The word evokes the long-simmering resentments of the everyman, brought to a boil by charismatic politicians hawking impossible promises. Often as not, populism sounds like something from a horror film: an alien bacteria that has somehow slipped through democracy\u2019s defences \u2013 aided, perhaps, by Steve Bannon or some other wily agent of mass manipulation \u2013 and is now poisoning political life, creating new ranks of populist voters among \u201cus\u201d. (Tellingly, most writing about populism presumes an audience unsympathetic to populism.) There is no shortage of prominent voices warning how dangerous populism is, and that we must take immediate steps to fight it. Tony Blair spends his days running the Institute for Global Change (IGC), an organisation founded, per its website, \u201cto push back against the destructive approach of populism\u201d. In its 2018 world report, Human Rights Watch warned democracies of the world against \u201ccapitulation\u201d to the \u201cpopulist challenge\u201d. The rise of \u201cpopulist movements\u201d, Barack Obama said in a speech last summer, had helped spark a global boom for the \u201cpolitics of fear and resentment and retrenchment\u201d that pave a path to authoritarianism. \u201cI am not being alarmist. I am just stating facts,\u201d Obama said. When populism is framed this way, the implication is clear. All responsible citizens have a responsibility to do their part in the battle \u2013 to know populism when they see it, understand its appeal (but not fall for it), and support politics that stop populism in its tracks, thereby saving democracy as we know it. \u201cBy fighting off the current infection,\u201d writes Yascha Mounk, until recently executive director of Blair\u2019s IGC and a prominent anti-populist writer, \u201cwe might just build up the necessary antibodies to remain immune against new bouts of the populist disease for decades to come.\u201d But as breathless op-eds and thinktank reports about the populist menace keep piling up, they have provoked a sceptical backlash from critics who wonder aloud if populism even exists. It is now relatively common to encounter the idea that, just as there were no real witches in Salem, there are no real populists in politics \u2013 just people, attitudes and movements that the political centre misunderstands and fears, and wants you, reader, to fear too, although without the burden of having to explain exactly why. Populism, in this framing, is a bogeyman: a nonentity invoked for the purpose of stirring up fear. This argument has even made its way to the centrist mainstream. \u201cLet\u2019s do away with the word \u2018populist,\u2019\u201d wrote the New York Times columnist Roger Cohen in July. \u201cIt\u2019s become sloppy to the point of meaninglessness, an overused epithet for multiple manifestations of political anger. Worse, it\u2019s freighted with contempt, applied to all voters who have decided that mainstream political parties have done nothing for their static incomes or disappearing jobs or sense of national decline these past two decades.\u201d It is hard to deny that much talk of populism obscures more than it illuminates, and tells us more about anti-populist crusaders than any real live populist parties or voters. But long before populism became an object of transatlantic media fascination \u2013 before it became a zeitgeisty one-word explanation for everything \u2013 a small group of academics was studying it, trying to figure out exactly what it is and what lessons it holds for democratic politics. The debate they have produced is, like many academic debates, knotty and self-referential \u2013 and will always live in the shadow of the muddled media and political discourse. But it helps us see that the idea of populism is something more than just a centrist fairytale. Thanks in large part to the persistent failure of governments across the west to enact anything resembling a credible vision of shared prosperity and security in the post-manufacturing era, we are now living through a time when familiar webs connecting citizens, ideologies and political parties are, if not falling apart, at least beginning to loosen and shift. As a result, the question of populism is not going away. The coming years are likely to include all of the following: more movements being labelled as populist, more movements calling themselves populist, more movements defensively insisting that they are not populist, and more conversations about the extent to which populism represents the problem or the solution. The academic debate on populism shows us that making sense of this landscape requires more than just a usable definition of the P-word. In short, it shows us that we can\u2019t really talk about populism without talking about our conflicting conceptions of democracy \u2013 and the question of what it truly means for citizens to be sovereign. It may be telling that very little of the public discussion of the alleged populist threat to democracy has been devoted to the workings of democracy itself. Perhaps we assume, without much thought, that democracy is such a self-explanatory idea that we already know all there is to know about the subject. Or perhaps we have come to regard democracy in its existing western form \u2013 basically liberal democracy \u2013 as the only possible endpoint for the evolution of politics. Populism, though it comes in many forms, always reminds us that nothing could be further from the truth. * * * In 2004 a young Dutch political scientist named Cas Mudde published The Populist Zeitgeist, a paper that proposed a new and concise definition of populism \u2013 one that would become the backbone of academic populism studies, a field that hardly existed at the time. Mudde was convinced that populism was a useful concept, which meant something more specific than \u201cdemocracy, but practised in a way that I find distasteful\u201d. He was especially keen to challenge two common intuitions about populism: that it is uniquely defined by \u201chighly emotional and simplistic\u201d rhetoric, and that it primarily consists of \u201copportunistic policies\u201d that aim to \u201cbuy\u201d the support of voters. Populism, Mudde argued, is more than just demagogy or opportunism. But it is not a fully formed political ideology like socialism or liberalism \u2013 it is instead a \u201cthin\u201d ideology, made up of just a few core beliefs. First: the most important division in society is an antagonistic one between \u201cthe people\u201d, understood to be fundamentally good, and \u201cthe elite\u201d, understood to be fundamentally corrupt and out of touch with everyday life. Second: all populists believe that politics should be an expression of the \u201cgeneral will\u201d \u2013 a set of desires presumed to be shared as common sense by all \u201cordinary people\u201d. (Implicit in this belief is another: that such a thing as this \u201cgeneral will\u201d exists.) A populist movement, then, is one that consistently promises to channel the unified will of the people, and by doing so undercut the self-serving schemes of the elite establishment. As the National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen put it in 2007: \u201cI will give voice to the people. Because in democracy only the people can be right, and none can be right against them.\u201d (Note how, in this formulation, there is no disagreement among \u201cthe people\u201d.) Or, in the more recent words of Donald Trump, speaking at his inauguration: \u201cWe are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people \u2026 The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.\u201d (Note how members of \u201cthe establishment\u201d are implicitly excluded from \u201cthe citizens\u201d.) For decades, attempts at clear-headed conversations about populism had been stymied by the question of how it could be attributed to parties and politicians that were so obviously different: how can Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, for example, both be called populist? In what way are Occupy Wall Street and Brexit both possible examples of populist phenomena? Mudde\u2019s simple definition caught on because it has no trouble answering this type of question. If populism is truly ideologically \u201cthin\u201d, then it has to attach itself to a more substantial host ideology in order to survive. But this ideology can lie anywhere along the left-right spectrum. Because, in Mudde\u2019s definition, populism is always piggybacking on other ideologies, the wide variety of populisms isn\u2019t a problem. It\u2019s exactly what you would expect. \u201cThe people\u201d and \u201cthe elite\u201d, Mudde wrote, are groupings with no static definition from one populist movement to another. These categories are, first and foremost, moral: people good, elites bad. The question of exactly who belongs in which group, though, depends on the character of the populist movement, and which \u201cthick\u201d ideology the populism ends up attached to. A populist \u201cpeople\u201d can define itself by an ethnic identity it feels is under threat, but just as easily by a shared sense of being victims of economic exploitation. What matters is that it blames a perceived class of corrupt elites; in the case of rightwing populisms, it may also heap scorn on some underclass, whether immigrants or racial minorities, whom the elites are accused of favouring with special treatment as part of their plot to keep power away from \u201creal people\u201d. When The Populist Zeitgeist was published, populism wasn\u2019t a hot topic: in all of 2005, Mudde\u2019s paper was cited only nine times. But as the field of populism studies has ballooned alongside mainstream interest in the subject, the paper has become widely recognised as a classic. By a wide margin, Mudde is now the populism scholar most likely to be cited or interviewed by journalists \u2013 as often as not, for articles in which his definition intermingles with the same old sloppy generalisations he set out to overturn. Today, no academic disputes the dominance of Mudde\u2019s definition, especially among the growing number of scholars hoping to be part of the conversation about populism as a global phenomenon. One major factor in its success, in fact, is the way that it anticipated events in world politics. The market crashes of 2008 led to the emergence of anti-austerity movements \u2013 such as Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, and Occupy worldwide \u2013 motivated by rage at financial institutions and the small class of people who benefited from their profits. These movements were obviously animated by a sense of opposition between \u201cthe people\u201d and \u201cthe elite\u201d \u2013 but old theories of populism that defined it specifically as rightwing, racist or anti-immigrant were insufficiently capacious to describe these new developments in populist politics. The thin-ideology definition is also extremely congenial to the landscape of contemporary academic political science, which places a considerable premium on broad frameworks that enable young scholars to do empirical, quantitative work. Many new scholars of populism no longer feel the need to argue over definitions. Instead, they perform textual analyses designed to detect how often populism\u2019s core ideas, as laid out in Mudde\u2019s 2004 article, pop up in party platforms, political speeches, manifestos and tweets. Or they administer surveys designed to track the prevalence of the core tenets of populism in different populations, searching for profiles of archetypal populist voters. Every time another paper relying on the ideological framework is published, it becomes a little more entrenched \u2013 a matter of some frustration to the minority of academics who still think it misses the point. * * * The rise of the thin-ideology definition, and its increasing influence in the still-ballooning public conversation about populism, has consistently provoked the objections of a small but persistent camp of dissenters within populism studies. These academics think defining populism in terms of core beliefs is a deep methodological error: many of them also think defining populism as an ideology runs the risk of making effective and worthwhile political strategies seem irresponsible, even dangerous. These academics are likely to stress the extent to which mainstream political parties in the US and Europe have converged in recent decades, narrowing the range of opinions that find real purchase in national decision-making. They take as a given that this has swelled the ranks of people who feel that what gets called democracy responds to their concerns much less than it caters to the whims of a small, wealthy, self-dealing class of elites \u2013 elites who vigorously deny their own complicity in this state of affairs, often by insisting that there is no alternative. As you might expect, these scholars tend to be most interested in challenges to the status quo that come from the left \u2013 from \u201cthe 99%\u201d of Occupy Wall Street and the Sanders campaign, to the \u201cmany not the few\u201d of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party \u2013 and foreground an insistence that politics is not yet serving the correct constituency. They are also instinctively alert to the possibility that the self-preserving centre will try to defang outsider challenges by making anyone who endorses them appear unreasonable, frightening and constitutionally unequipped for the sober task of governance. This makes them suspicious of any suggestion that there is an identifiable ideology called populism that has fundamental similarities no matter where on the political spectrum it appears. For this crowd, talk of an essence of populism \u2013 however thin \u2013 shades too easily into a charge of guilt by association, which inevitably has the effect of saddling leftwing populist movements (or even populist-looking movements) with the baggage of their xenophobic and racist rightwing counterparts. More specifically, they are likely to worry that the emphasis on exaggerated moralism as a defining feature of populism makes it too easy to depict legitimate opposition to elite power as irrational mobs. Most objections to the thin-ideology definition owe a substantial debt to a duo of leftist political theorists: Chantal Mouffe, a Belgian who teaches at the University of Westminster, and her late husband, the Argentine Ernesto Laclau. Both thinkers have directly informed the new European left populist movements, including Syriza, Podemos and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s La France Insoumise. Mouffe and Laclau\u2019s writings on Marxism and populism \u2013 some of which they produced together, and some separately \u2013 are famously dense and sometimes resistant to summary. But at their core is the idea that conflict is an inescapable and defining feature of political life. In other words, the realm of politics is one where antagonism is natural and unavoidable, in which consensus cannot ever be permanent, and there is always a \u201cwe\u201d and a \u201cthey\u201d. \u201cPolitical questions are not mere technical issues to be solved by experts,\u201d Mouffe insists. \u201cProperly political questions always involve decisions which require us to make a choice between conflicting alternatives.\u201d This emphasis on conflict produces a vision of democratic life that looks more radical than typical mainstream accounts of liberal democracy \u2013 but, Laclau and Mouffe would argue, one that more accurately describes the actual logic of politics. In this view, any existing socio-political order (or \u201chegemony\u201d in Mouffe and Laclau\u2019s preferred formation, borrowed from the Italian Marxist philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci) is subject to challenge. Every status quo \u2013 however sturdy \u2013 is only temporary, and can always be challenged by a movement that seeks to replace it with something new. Political change, in other words, is the result of demands against the existing order, which must be fused together in a movement to change it \u2013 a movement that may look a lot like populism. When my demands and your demands and our neighbours\u2019 demands are brought together in such a movement, they can become the basis for a new political \u201cwe\u201d: a \u201cpeople\u201d insisting that the current arrangement of power be altered in their name. To the extent that such a movement succeeds, it creates a new hegemony \u2013 a new baseline \u2013 which itself becomes open to challenge over time. From this perspective, populism is just another word for real politics: for people (\u201cus\u201d) creating together, live on the ground, a sense of how our dissatisfactions relate, who is to blame (\u201cthem\u201d), and how to force a change. But those who benefit from the status quo don\u2019t want it to change; to this end, they might champion toothless approaches to collective decision-making: bipartisan consensus as an end in itself; the elevation of \u201crational\u201d experts over hot-headed partisans; \u201cThird Way\u201d centrism that shuns ideological conflict in favour of \u201cwhat works\u201d or mediation by liberal institutions. These approaches (Mouffe calls them \u201cnon-politics\u201d) may for a time become dominant, as they did in the Anglo-American 1990s and early 2000s. But nothing lasts for ever, especially when the number of people who feel politicians are making their lives more precarious is rising. And then politics \u2013 real politics, which is to say populist politics \u2013 make a return. According to Mouffe and Laclau, the only inherent connection between rightwing and leftwing populist movements is that both embrace the same fundamental truth about democracy: that it is an ever-shifting contest over how the default \u201cwe\u201d of politics is defined and redefined, in which no one definition can be guaranteed to last. The goal, they argue, should not be placid consensus but \u201cagonistic pluralism\u201d: a state in which opposition and disagreement are accepted as the norm, and in which people maintain the capacity to disagree intensely without demonising each other, or descending into war. Mouffe, in particular, has in recent years argued that the political question of the immediate future is not how to fight populism, but rather which type of populist you want to be. It\u2019s about who you\u2019re with (who belongs in your \u201cchain of equivalence\u201d), who you\u2019re against (who is causing the problem, and how), and where to take your stand. Populism isn\u2019t the problem: instead, leftwing populism is the solution. Not all the academics who take inspiration from Mouffe and Laclau go quite this far, especially in the sober pages of peer-reviewed political science journals. But their work is palpably motivated by a sense that the real threat of \u201cpopulism\u201d is that our panic over the word will foreclose the possibility of new kinds of politics and new challenges to the status quo \u2013 and that fear of populism on the left could enable the victory of populism of the right. These scholars\u2019 preference is for definitions in which it has no ideological essence \u2013 not even the \u201cthin\u201d one posited by Cas Mudde. For them, even though the thin definition readily recognises populism\u2019s ideological portability, it is still irrevocably tainted by pejorative overtones that push participants in debates about populism to take a position \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cagainst\u201d all populisms. With no internal essence, populism is harder to categorise as inherently good or bad. Paris Aslanidis, a Yale political scientist, calls populism a \u201cdiscourse\u201d \u2013 a mode of talking about politics, rather than a set of beliefs \u2013 one that frames politics in terms of the \u201csupremacy of popular sovereignty\u201d. Benjamin Moffitt, a senior lecturer in politics at the Australian Catholic University, refers to populism as a \u201cpolitical style\u201d, the presence of which \u201ctells us very little about the substantive democratic content of any political project\u201d. Under definitions of this type, the central question is not whether a given political actor or group is or isn\u2019t populist. It is instead whether, from moment to moment, they are \u201cdoing populism\u201d, and how, and with what impact. * * * Of course, these disputes aren\u2019t really about the difference between a \u201cthin ideology\u201d and a \u201cdiscourse.\u201d They are about whether \u201cpopulist\u201d is always an insult, and if the project of defining populism can ever be disentangled from the concept\u2019s pejorative baggage. Ultimately, they are disputes about which types of politics make us suspicious, and why. The current discussion of populism in the west is strongly coloured by the populist far-right parties that emerged in Europe in the late 1980s and early 90s, such as the Austrian Freedom party, the Danish People\u2019s party and the French National Front. What most people knew about these parties, at first, was that they were openly nativist and racist. They talked about \u201creal\u201d citizens of their countries, and fixated on the issue of national and ethnic \u201cpurity,\u201d demonising immigrants and minorities. Many of their party leaders flirted winkingly with antisemitism, and their electoral victories coincided with a resurgence of extreme right-wing violence in Europe, such as the 1991 attack on immigrant workers and asylum seekers in the east German town of Hoyerswerda. When journalists and politicians started calling these parties and their supporters populist, the term was an expression of alarm at a problem and, simultaneously, a euphemism that made it possible to gloss over that problem\u2019s exact qualities. This was especially useful for journalists who feared being viewed as anything less than politically neutral. Populist was obviously not a compliment, but it sounded less alarming than \u201cextreme right\u201d or \u201cradical right\u201d. What the term seemed to communicate more than anything else was backwardness: a juvenile incapacity to bring your preferences to the political arena and engage in the complex give-and-take of rational compromise. The populist combination of immaturity, emotional resentment and intolerance was widely held to constitute a threat to postwar European democracy. In one respect, the thin-ideology definition popularised by Cas Mudde dismantled this view of things, freeing populism from its exclusively far-right connotations, and cautioning against the conflation of populism with the other -isms it was often paired to. Mudde and many other scholars who use the ideological definition have in fact repeatedly argued that neither Trump nor Brexit should be regarded primarily as populist phenomena. Of course both Trump and Brexiters used ample populist rhetoric; but in both cases, they argue, the majority of support was motivated not by passion for populism\u2019s core ideas, but by other ideological factors. After the Cambridge Dictionary declared populism 2017\u2019s \u201cword of the year\u201d, Mudde wrote a Guardian column criticising the decision. (\u201cIt has become the buzzword of the year,\u201d he noted acidly, \u201cmostly because it is very often poorly defined and wrongly used.\u201d) For the radical-right parties whose electoral campaigns in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Austria raised alarms across Europe, \u201cpopulism comes secondary to nativism, and within contemporary European and US politics, populism functions at best as a fuzzy blanket to camouflage the nastier nativism\u201d, Mudde concluded. And yet, despite these caveats, the thin definition nonetheless positions populism as always posing at least something of a majoritarian threat to liberal democracy. It is this judgment, more than any other, that keeps the fight going between scholars who adopt the ideological definition, on one hand, and their Mouffe- and Laclau-inspired critics, on the other. Liberal democracy, in this context, has almost nothing to do with contemporary distinctions between left and right. It refers, instead, to the idea that government should facilitate pluralistic coexistence by balancing the never fully attainable ideal of popular sovereignty with institutions that enshrine the rule of law and civil rights, which cannot easily be overturned by a political majority. (In this regard, as Mudde writes in his original paper, liberal democracy is \u201ctherefore only partly democratic\u201d.) Today, liberal democracy is what most people mean when they talk about democracy \u2013 and therefore, to be deemed a threat to liberal democracy is, in the context of most political discussions, a devastatingly negative judgment. Because populism, as described by the ideological definition, involves a moralised conception of an absolutely sovereign \u201cpeople\u201d \u2013 whose verdicts are regarded as practically unanimous \u2013 it is inevitable that populist movements will come into conflict with the liberal aspects of liberal democracy. If all \u201creal\u201d people think the same way about the things that matter most in politics, then the idea of institutional protections for a dissenting minority are are at best superfluous and at worst nefarious. For the populists, they are just another wall that the corrupt elite has built to keep real power away from the people. The same is true for the independence of judges or regulators, or checks and balances between branches of government \u2013 especially when they appear to stymie the plans of a populist leader. In this account, the most basic elements of liberal democracy become both kindling and fuel for the populist fire. No one who studies populism seriously \u2013 and not even the most opportunistic participants in the cottage industry of anti-populist alarmism \u2013 denies that populist movements can raise valid critiques of the status quo, and of the very real anti-democratic power of elites. Many take a viewpoint similar to that of the Mexican political theorist Benjamin Arditi, who described populism as a drunken guest at democracy\u2019s dinner party, one who disrespects the rules of sociability and, along the way, brings up the failure and hypocrisies that everyone else in the room has agreed to ignore. In Populism: A Very Short Introduction, Mudde and his frequent co-author, the Chilean political scientist Crist\u00f3bal Kaltwasser, describe contemporary populism as an \u201cilliberal democratic response to an undemocratic liberalism\u201d \u2013 one that \u201casks the right questions but provides the wrong answers\u201d. Reading critics from the left, however, one often gets the sense that for them this adds up to so much lipstick on a pig: a sprinkling of nuance and restraint that still leaves populism, no matter its ideological stripe, with an undeserved taint of inherent danger. The unhappiness of these critics is magnified by the fact that populism rarely appears in mainstream discussion as anything but an insult \u2013 often in the mouth of pundits and politicians who regard the left and the right as an equal threat. The fear in these circles is that saying anything negative about \u201cpopulism\u201d \u2013 however qualified and analytical \u2013 simply hands more ammunition to the very people who helped make politics such a hollow, undemocratic mess in the first place. Positioning any populism as fundamentally antithetical to liberal democracy, in this view, simply reinforces the association between populism and mob psychology, and stokes fears that individual rights will always be trampled by group identities. Some scholars in this camp now argue that we should be talking less about populism and more about the centrist \u201canti-populism\u201d that fears and demonises it. \u201cJust as the adulterous spouse is always the one most suspicious of their own partner,\u201d wrote the Italian sociologist Marco d\u2019Eramo in New Left Review in 2013, \u201cso those who eviscerate democracy are the most inclined to see threats to it everywhere. Hence all the to-do about populism betrays a sense of uneasiness, smacks of overkill.\u201d For each side in this debate, the obvious temptation is to simply dismiss the other \u2013 or to insist that what the other side calls \u201cpopulism\u201d isn\u2019t really populism at all, but just something populist-ish. But to conclude that the two camps are simply talking past each other would be to miss the extent to which they are in agreement \u2013and what, taken together, they tell us about the current political moment. * * * In 1967, when political theorists from around the world gathered at the London School of Economics for the first ever academic conference on populism, they had a hard time figuring out exactly what they were supposed to be talking about. The word came from the \u201cprairie populists\u201d, an 1890s movement of US farmers who supported more robust regulation of capitalism. But in the intervening decades it had been used for a wide and varied grab bag of phenomena from around the world, from McCarthyite anti-communist witch-hunts in the US to charismatic Latin American leaders. In the end, the conference proceedings failed to clarify the matter at hand. \u201cThere can at present be no doubt about the importance of populism,\u201d read a summary report. \u201cBut no one is clear what it is.\u201d Over half a century later, there has been some progress. Populism, specialists now agree, is an ideologically portable way of looking at politics as a forum for opposition between \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201celites\u201d. This definition creates more questions: is the conceptual \u201cpeople\u201d of populism inherently defined in a way that spells danger to pluralistic coexistence? Or, less menacingly, is the idea of \u201cthe people\u201d a necessary but always malleable concept \u2013 simply part of what it means to do politics? But populism, whatever it is, is not a chemical: no scientist will ever come along and reveal its exact, objective composition. Populism is a lens for looking at our politics, including \u2013 down a long hall of mirrors \u2013 the politics of what gets called populist, and with what implications. The questions of populism would have little urgency were it not for the widespread agreement about the shortcomings of the political status quo: about the abyss between the shining ideals of equality and responsive government implied by our talk about democracy and the tarnished reality of life on the ground. The notion that \u201cthe people\u201d are being poorly served by politics has vast resonance across the political spectrum, and for good reason. But what is the remedy? Among the proponents of the ideological definition, some decline to provide an answer, claiming that they are looking only to define and measure populism, not take a stance on it. Others admit that, in the case of populism, the options for producing a description without forming a judgment are basically nonexistent. The order of the day, in their view, is to convince citizens to recommit to liberal democracy and its institutions. There is, however, widespread recognition in this camp \u2013 more than they are credited with by their critics on the left \u2013 that it will no longer suffice to insist that there is no acceptable alternative to existing liberal democracy. Writing in the Guardian in 2017, Mudde argued that responding to populism required more than \u201cpurely anti-populist campaigns\u201d; it would take, he claimed, \u201ca return to ideological politics\u201d. Even liberals who want some issues to be \u201cdepoliticised\u201d \u2013 to be removed from the realm of democracy and handed over to experts \u2013 will have to, at a minimum, remake the case for those decisions. Nothing can stay depoliticised for ever; that\u2019s politics. If you squint just a little, this looks more than a bit like what you would expect from Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, with their insistence that there is no space \u201cbeyond left and right\u201d and no way to put political decisions \u2013 decisions about our collective fate \u2013 outside the reach of politics. Arguably, you might say that the defenders of liberal democracy are being suddenly reacquainted with the need to construct a democratic \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 a people \u2013 around their demand to protect liberal institutions and procedures, in opposition to radical rightwing parties who are happy to see them discarded. The corresponding challenge for anyone further on the left is to figure out the relationship between their long-term goals and the ideals of liberal democracy. There have always been critics for whom liberal democracy is sham democracy: a nice-sounding set of universal principles that, in practice, end up functioning as smokescreens that normalise the exploitations and inequities of capitalism. Other theorists, Mouffe included, view something like the European social democracy of the 60s and 70s as the precondition for whatever comes next \u2013 for \u201cradical democracy\u201d that forces liberal democracy to make good on its promises of equality. But even Mouffe is no longer optimistic about our ability to revive our democratic prospects. Two years ago she wrote: \u201cIn 1985 we said \u2018we need to radicalise democracy\u2019; now we first need to restore democracy, so we can then radicalise it; the task is far more difficult.\u201d What that task will look like on the ground is an open question. The media framing of populism almost always sounds like a discussion about the margins: about forces from outside \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201crational\u201d politics threatening to throw off the balance of the status quo. But the scholarly discourse makes clear that this is backward: that populism is inherent to democracy, and especially to democracy as we know it in the contemporary west. It finds life in the cracks \u2013 or more lately, the chasms \u2013 between democracy\u2019s promises and the impossibility of their full, permanent realisation. The question of populism, then, is always the question of what kind of democracy we want, and the fact that we will never stop arguing about this. Anxiety about populism can be a smokescreen for people who don\u2019t want the world as they know it to be disturbed. But it also flows from the core insight that we can never know exactly where democracy is going to take us \u2013 not this time, nor the next, nor the time after that. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "body": "<p>It is tempting, when your shiny New Year\u2019s resolutions start to crumble, to tell yourself that self-control simply isn\u2019t your strong point. \u201cOh well,\u201d you might say, surrendering to the desire for a large glass of red. \u201cNo willpower, that\u2019s my problem.\u201d</p> <p>But, according to a body of scientific research, willpower is not a talent that a lucky few are born with. It is a skill to be practised. \u201cWillpower is a dynamic, fluctuating resource,\u201d explains Frank Ryan, consultant clinical psychologist and author of Willpower for Dummies. \u201cOur level of willpower fluctuates according to our motivation in any given situation. Everybody can learn to use their willpower more effectively.\u201c</p> <p>Even if you are not trying to turn over a new leaf for the new year, cultivating willpower is a good idea, as the psychologist Walter Mischel demonstrated in the 1960s and 70s. In his <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower-gratification.pdf\">famous study</a>, a group of four-year-olds were offered the choice of one sweet treat now, or two if they could wait 15 minutes. Their performance was then monitored into adulthood. The \u201chigh delayers\u201d went on to achieve greater academic success, better health and lower divorce rates. So there is more at stake than whether or not you make it to the end of Dry January.</p> <p>Here are a few ways to increase your chances.</p> <h2><strong>Know yourself</strong></h2> <p>To maximise our chances of sticking to resolutions, Ryan says, we should identify our \u201cwillpower profile. For example: some people are more impulsive than others. That does come down to personality.\u201d</p> <p>Introverts tend to get energised by thoughts and ideas, so if that\u2019s you, you should find it easier to get motivated by an inner vision than extroverts, who get fired up by people and social approval. For introverts, scheduling time to reflect on your progress, such as keeping a diary, can be helpful. For extroverts, signing up for a group such as Parkrun or Weight Watchers where everyone has a common goal can help you to strengthen your resolve, as can sharing even small progress with others.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to learn the core skills to cope with triggers and cues that activate your reward-seeking response,\u201d Ryan adds. \u201cIt\u2019s about coping with temptation, which often comes from the environment: the people, places or things that act as motivational magnets to challenge your willpower.\u201d In other words: if you are trying to avoid cake, it is probably best to find a route home that swerves the artisanal doughnuts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ae907c17d8d1d43b713acc86d1a20763c871c95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ae907c17d8d1d43b713acc86d1a20763c871c95/0_5_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"new year resolutions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People who try to work on a number of intentions at once are less successful at sticking to their plans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Make a plan</strong></h2> <p>A study published by the British Journal of Health Psychology found that 91% of participants who <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8df0/bb429602dab29c54f42611dafa28c9d87a83.pdf\">wrote down a plan</a> of when and where to exercise successfully met their goals. \u201cPlanning is important because the brain builds a story. It also likes order and the feeling of being in control,\u201d explains the neuroscientist and coach Magdalena Bak-Maier of <a href=\"https://www.maketimecount.com/\">maketimecount.com</a>. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a cognitive map, a representation in the mind of how you are going to achieve it, then there is no way to sustain your goal.\u201d</p> <p>She points out that our brains are lazy and like to conserve energy, so regular reminders and visual clues can be helpful. \u201cI have a goal that I want to do 100 push-ups a day,\u201d she confides. \u201cIt sounds like a good goal but it\u2019s not enough to nudge me into action. In order to build it into my mind\u2019s priority list, I leave Post-It notes around my house. As I walk in the door, there\u2019s a cartoon of me doing push-ups. In the kitchen, there\u2019s another one. Whenever I see one, I stop and do the push-ups.\u201d</p> <p>We need to be more strategic in our planning, she says. \u201cYou might have announced: \u2018This year I\u2019m going to write a novel\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to run a half-marathon,\u2019 but that hasn\u2019t given the brain anything to work with. Those are just ideas, not plans.\u201d</p> <p>To clarify, a plan is: \u201cI\u2019m going to get up at 6.30am Monday to Friday and write 500 words of my screenplay before I leave for work.\u201d Or: \u201cI\u2019m going to sign up for 10 yoga classes and go every Monday at 6pm.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Pick one goal at a time</strong></h2> <p>One problem with the resolution fever that grips us at this time of year is the temptation to go for a total life overhaul. \u201cThis year I\u2019m going to give up alcohol, meet The One and get a promotion.\u201d You are doing really well on all fronts. But then one evening you bump into an attractive colleague at the bus stop. \u201cFancy a drink?\u201d Next morning, you have to deal with a blinding hangover and an unusually demanding boss.</p> <p>What can you do about such conflicts? Don\u2019t work on multiple resolutions. A psychological study published by the Journal of Consumer Research showed that intentions are most effective when you work on only one goal at a time. People who tried to work on a number of intentions at once were ultimately less successful at sticking to their plans.</p> <h2><strong>Face your fears</strong></h2> <p>\u201cPeople who are not moving towards their goal are often afraid of something they envisage happening as a result of achieving the goal,\u201d says Bak-Maier. \u201cI really struggled to finish my third book. Yes, it\u2019s a great thing to aim for; I really wanted to do it. Eventually, I realised that I was subconsciously afraid of the book failing and no one buying it. Worse, once it was written, I knew I\u2019d have to go out and market it. I dread marketing.\u201d If in any doubt, Bak-Maier recommends paying attention to \u201csomatic responses\u201d, such as feeling mysteriously tired, achey or queasy, when faced with taking action on your goal. Chances are good that you might be too anxious to pursue it.</p> <h2><strong>Spend willpower wisely</strong></h2> <p>Long-established <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Baumeister%20et%20al.%20%281998%29.pdf\">research</a> by the psychologist Roy Baumeister suggested that willpower is a finite resource that runs out after prolonged use. Although recent studies have challenged Baumeister\u2019s findings, the concept, known as ego depletion, is still a useful one to bear in mind. Imagine you have planned to go to the gym after work even though you have had a gruelling day at the office and a grim commute. Instead, you spend the evening slumped on the couch chomping crisps. You\u2019ve earned it, right? That is ego depletion in action.</p> <p>What this means is that you should be discerning about how you use your willpower reserves. Go to the gym or start writing that screenplay early in the day, even if you don\u2019t consider yourself to be a morning person. Why? Because, unfortunately, the brain does not compartmentalise tasks that require uncomfortable effort. There is no special brain area marked \u201cwillpower for writing\u201d. If you spend hours agreeing with your boss in a tedious meeting (it takes more willpower to suppress your views than to express them freely), don\u2019t be surprised that you mysteriously have no energy for your own goals later.</p> <p>The upside of all types of willpower stemming from the same mental reservoir appears to be that if you strengthen willpower in one area, it will also positively impact other, unrelated behaviour. Australian researchers assigned volunteers to a two-month exercise regime. Those who stuck to it also reported smoking and drinking less, curbing their spending and improving study habits.</p> <h2><strong>Find your motivation</strong></h2> <p>It seems we all hold some willpower back in reserve. Researcher <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7e62/d332cbdbbdafe0d69778dc92ca4868d7c7df.pdf\">Mark Muraven</a> found that study participants suddenly discovered extra self-control to do a task after they were told they would be paid for their effort, or that their effort would benefit others, such as helping to find a cure for a disease. So knowing your \u201cwhy\u201d can help you to get out of bed for a chilly morning run.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3178eefaf297eefddde4fa738dbddaac288fa698\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3178eefaf297eefddde4fa738dbddaac288fa698/0_0_4220_2532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"willpower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Working out your \u2018why\u2019 can help you find your willpower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: muharrem Aner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Meet your future self</strong></h2> <p>According to Kelly McGonigal, a psychologist at Stanford University and the author of The Willpower Instinct, one reason people fail is that they view their <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221793881_Self-defining_future_projections_Exploring_the_identity_function_of_thinking_about_the_future\">future self</a> as a stranger. That explains why it is so difficult to save for a pension; it feels like handing over your hard-earned cash to someone you\u2019ve never met.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who feel close to, caring toward, and similar to their future selves are more likely to invest in their wellbeing,\u201d says McGonigal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/10/psychology-england-football-team-change-your-life-pippa-grange\">How the psychology of the England football team could change your life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Psychologists at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium examined people\u2019s ability to generate vivid \u201cself-defining\u201d future memories. This involves reflecting upon the most important aspects of your life and contemplating how you would like them to turn out, regardless of what challenges you are dealing with in the present. It may sound like magical thinking but the researchers found that the ability to generate such \u201cmemories\u201d was crucial for experiencing a sense of self-continuity, a vital component in taking action on our goals.</p> <h2><strong>Learn from setbacks</strong></h2> <p>Set a distinction between a lapse and a relapse, says Ryan. \u201cSay you go back to smoking every day for a month; that\u2019s a relapse. But if you have an occasional cigarette, use that as a learning experience. Ask yourself: \u2018Why did I smoke that time? I went out with my mates, we had a bit to drink, then I had a cigarette outside the pub because they were all smoking.\u2019 Label that as a risk. \u2018What will I do next time? Next time I\u2019ll be more on my guard, I\u2019ll say I\u2019ve given up, so I\u2019m not going to join you, I\u2019ll just stay inside.\u2019 Very simple strategies for what\u2019s known as an implementation plan.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t be discouraged</strong></h2> <p>Finally, be kind to yourself. \u201cAnticipate lapses and plan for them,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. Be compassionate when you have a setback. Reward yourself for effort, not outcomes. Changing habits, or establishing new ones, is a motivational marathon, with inevitable trips along the way.\u201d Some of the more Calvinist-minded among us might balk at this. Surely we must suffer on the road to success? \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling negative and self-critical, that actually reduces your willpower,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cFeeling negative and emotionally charged drains your willpower battery. Negative moods are the enemy of willpower, and self-blame is the main culprit.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is tempting, when your shiny New Year\u2019s resolutions start to crumble, to tell yourself that self-control simply isn\u2019t your strong point. \u201cOh well,\u201d you might say, surrendering to the desire for a large glass of red. \u201cNo willpower, that\u2019s my problem.\u201d But, according to a body of scientific research, willpower is not a talent that a lucky few are born with. It is a skill to be practised. \u201cWillpower is a dynamic, fluctuating resource,\u201d explains Frank Ryan, consultant clinical psychologist and author of Willpower for Dummies. \u201cOur level of willpower fluctuates according to our motivation in any given situation. Everybody can learn to use their willpower more effectively.\u201c Even if you are not trying to turn over a new leaf for the new year, cultivating willpower is a good idea, as the psychologist Walter Mischel demonstrated in the 1960s and 70s. In his famous study, a group of four-year-olds were offered the choice of one sweet treat now, or two if they could wait 15 minutes. Their performance was then monitored into adulthood. The \u201chigh delayers\u201d went on to achieve greater academic success, better health and lower divorce rates. So there is more at stake than whether or not you make it to the end of Dry January. Here are a few ways to increase your chances. Know yourself To maximise our chances of sticking to resolutions, Ryan says, we should identify our \u201cwillpower profile. For example: some people are more impulsive than others. That does come down to personality.\u201d Introverts tend to get energised by thoughts and ideas, so if that\u2019s you, you should find it easier to get motivated by an inner vision than extroverts, who get fired up by people and social approval. For introverts, scheduling time to reflect on your progress, such as keeping a diary, can be helpful. For extroverts, signing up for a group such as Parkrun or Weight Watchers where everyone has a common goal can help you to strengthen your resolve, as can sharing even small progress with others. \u201cYou need to learn the core skills to cope with triggers and cues that activate your reward-seeking response,\u201d Ryan adds. \u201cIt\u2019s about coping with temptation, which often comes from the environment: the people, places or things that act as motivational magnets to challenge your willpower.\u201d In other words: if you are trying to avoid cake, it is probably best to find a route home that swerves the artisanal doughnuts. Make a plan A study published by the British Journal of Health Psychology found that 91% of participants who wrote down a plan of when and where to exercise successfully met their goals. \u201cPlanning is important because the brain builds a story. It also likes order and the feeling of being in control,\u201d explains the neuroscientist and coach Magdalena Bak-Maier of maketimecount.com. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a cognitive map, a representation in the mind of how you are going to achieve it, then there is no way to sustain your goal.\u201d She points out that our brains are lazy and like to conserve energy, so regular reminders and visual clues can be helpful. \u201cI have a goal that I want to do 100 push-ups a day,\u201d she confides. \u201cIt sounds like a good goal but it\u2019s not enough to nudge me into action. In order to build it into my mind\u2019s priority list, I leave Post-It notes around my house. As I walk in the door, there\u2019s a cartoon of me doing push-ups. In the kitchen, there\u2019s another one. Whenever I see one, I stop and do the push-ups.\u201d We need to be more strategic in our planning, she says. \u201cYou might have announced: \u2018This year I\u2019m going to write a novel\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to run a half-marathon,\u2019 but that hasn\u2019t given the brain anything to work with. Those are just ideas, not plans.\u201d To clarify, a plan is: \u201cI\u2019m going to get up at 6.30am Monday to Friday and write 500 words of my screenplay before I leave for work.\u201d Or: \u201cI\u2019m going to sign up for 10 yoga classes and go every Monday at 6pm.\u201d Pick one goal at a time One problem with the resolution fever that grips us at this time of year is the temptation to go for a total life overhaul. \u201cThis year I\u2019m going to give up alcohol, meet The One and get a promotion.\u201d You are doing really well on all fronts. But then one evening you bump into an attractive colleague at the bus stop. \u201cFancy a drink?\u201d Next morning, you have to deal with a blinding hangover and an unusually demanding boss. What can you do about such conflicts? Don\u2019t work on multiple resolutions. A psychological study published by the Journal of Consumer Research showed that intentions are most effective when you work on only one goal at a time. People who tried to work on a number of intentions at once were ultimately less successful at sticking to their plans. Face your fears \u201cPeople who are not moving towards their goal are often afraid of something they envisage happening as a result of achieving the goal,\u201d says Bak-Maier. \u201cI really struggled to finish my third book. Yes, it\u2019s a great thing to aim for; I really wanted to do it. Eventually, I realised that I was subconsciously afraid of the book failing and no one buying it. Worse, once it was written, I knew I\u2019d have to go out and market it. I dread marketing.\u201d If in any doubt, Bak-Maier recommends paying attention to \u201csomatic responses\u201d, such as feeling mysteriously tired, achey or queasy, when faced with taking action on your goal. Chances are good that you might be too anxious to pursue it. Spend willpower wisely Long-established research by the psychologist Roy Baumeister suggested that willpower is a finite resource that runs out after prolonged use. Although recent studies have challenged Baumeister\u2019s findings, the concept, known as ego depletion, is still a useful one to bear in mind. Imagine you have planned to go to the gym after work even though you have had a gruelling day at the office and a grim commute. Instead, you spend the evening slumped on the couch chomping crisps. You\u2019ve earned it, right? That is ego depletion in action. What this means is that you should be discerning about how you use your willpower reserves. Go to the gym or start writing that screenplay early in the day, even if you don\u2019t consider yourself to be a morning person. Why? Because, unfortunately, the brain does not compartmentalise tasks that require uncomfortable effort. There is no special brain area marked \u201cwillpower for writing\u201d. If you spend hours agreeing with your boss in a tedious meeting (it takes more willpower to suppress your views than to express them freely), don\u2019t be surprised that you mysteriously have no energy for your own goals later. The upside of all types of willpower stemming from the same mental reservoir appears to be that if you strengthen willpower in one area, it will also positively impact other, unrelated behaviour. Australian researchers assigned volunteers to a two-month exercise regime. Those who stuck to it also reported smoking and drinking less, curbing their spending and improving study habits. Find your motivation It seems we all hold some willpower back in reserve. Researcher Mark Muraven found that study participants suddenly discovered extra self-control to do a task after they were told they would be paid for their effort, or that their effort would benefit others, such as helping to find a cure for a disease. So knowing your \u201cwhy\u201d can help you to get out of bed for a chilly morning run. Meet your future self According to Kelly McGonigal, a psychologist at Stanford University and the author of The Willpower Instinct, one reason people fail is that they view their future self as a stranger. That explains why it is so difficult to save for a pension; it feels like handing over your hard-earned cash to someone you\u2019ve never met. \u201cPeople who feel close to, caring toward, and similar to their future selves are more likely to invest in their wellbeing,\u201d says McGonigal. Psychologists at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium examined people\u2019s ability to generate vivid \u201cself-defining\u201d future memories. This involves reflecting upon the most important aspects of your life and contemplating how you would like them to turn out, regardless of what challenges you are dealing with in the present. It may sound like magical thinking but the researchers found that the ability to generate such \u201cmemories\u201d was crucial for experiencing a sense of self-continuity, a vital component in taking action on our goals. Learn from setbacks Set a distinction between a lapse and a relapse, says Ryan. \u201cSay you go back to smoking every day for a month; that\u2019s a relapse. But if you have an occasional cigarette, use that as a learning experience. Ask yourself: \u2018Why did I smoke that time? I went out with my mates, we had a bit to drink, then I had a cigarette outside the pub because they were all smoking.\u2019 Label that as a risk. \u2018What will I do next time? Next time I\u2019ll be more on my guard, I\u2019ll say I\u2019ve given up, so I\u2019m not going to join you, I\u2019ll just stay inside.\u2019 Very simple strategies for what\u2019s known as an implementation plan.\u201d Don\u2019t be discouraged Finally, be kind to yourself. \u201cAnticipate lapses and plan for them,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. Be compassionate when you have a setback. Reward yourself for effort, not outcomes. Changing habits, or establishing new ones, is a motivational marathon, with inevitable trips along the way.\u201d Some of the more Calvinist-minded among us might balk at this. Surely we must suffer on the road to success? \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling negative and self-critical, that actually reduces your willpower,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cFeeling negative and emotionally charged drains your willpower battery. Negative moods are the enemy of willpower, and self-blame is the main culprit.\u201d",

Rates of anxiety disorders and depression are <a href=\"https://sites.psu.edu/ccmh/files/2018/02/2017_CCMH_Report-1r4m88x.pdf\">rising</a> rapidly among teenagers, and in the US <a href=\"http://time.com/5190291/anxiety-depression-college-university-students/\">universities can\u2019t hire therapists fast enough</a> to keep up with the demand. What are we doing wrong?</p> <p>Nassim Taleb invented the word \u201cantifragile\u201d and used it in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/21/antifragile-how-to-live-nassim-nicholas-taleb-review\">his book by the same name</a> to describe a small but very important class of systems that gain from shocks, challenges, and disorder. Bones and the banking system are two examples; both get weaker \u2013 and more prone to catastrophic failure \u2013 if they go for a long time without any stressors and then face a major challenge. The immune system is an even better example: it <em>requires</em> exposure to certain kinds of germs and potential allergens in childhood in order to develop to its full capacity. Parents who treat their children as if they are fragile (for example, by keeping them away from dirt and potential allergens, such as peanuts) are depriving their children\u2019s immature immune systems of the learning experiences those systems need to develop their maximum protective capacity.</p> <p>Children\u2019s social and emotional abilities are as antifragile as their immune systems. If we overprotect kids and keep them \u201csafe\u201d from unpleasant social situations and negative emotions, we deprive them of the challenges and opportunities for skill-building they need to grow strong. Such children are likely to suffer more when exposed later to other unpleasant but ordinary life events, such as teasing and social exclusion.</p> <p>Some caveats are needed: kids need friends and a loving and reliable attachment figure. Children raised with high levels of fear in unpredictable or violent environments experience elevated levels of stress hormones for extended periods of time. Such long-term exposure can permanently alter brain development and increase stress reactivity, with lifelong ramifications for mental and physical health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1b0d72cdeebc58db0dad752a8d7f31977a793ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1b0d72cdeebc58db0dad752a8d7f31977a793ca/0_82_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young people using social media\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Girls use social media more than boys, and they seem to be more sensitive to the focus on physical appearance, chronic social comparison and awareness of being left out.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Hero Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But brief periods of normal stress are not harmful; they are essential. A<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00010/full\"> 2013 review of stress research</a> titled \u201cUnderstanding resilience\u201d made the analogy to the immune system explicit: \u201cStress inoculation is a form of immunity against later stressors, much in the same way that vaccines induce immunity against disease.\u201d What, then, would happen if we suddenly stopped immunising children with this kind of stress?</p> <p>We recently co-wrote a book, with Greg Lukianoff, titled The Coddling of the American Mind, about the culture that erupted on American university campuses around 2014, and has spread to some campuses in the UK and Canada. In the book we describe how they began using the language of safety and danger to describe ideas and speakers, and to demand policies based on the premise that some students are fragile (or \u201cvulnerable\u201d). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/safe-spaces-free-speech-university-prevent-no-platforming-academic-freedom\">Terms such as \u201csafe space\u201d</a>, \u201ctrigger warning\u201d and \u201cmicroaggression\u201d entered the language. These, we believe, are requests made by a generation that was deprived of the necessary quantity of social immunisations. Students now react with a kind of emotional allergic response (often referred to as being \u201ctriggered\u201d) to things that previous generations would have either brushed off or argued against.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the kids\u2019 fault. In the UK, as in the US, parents became much more fearful in the 1980s and 1990s as cable TV and later the internet exposed everyone, more and more, to those rare occurrences of brutal crimes and freak accidents that, as we report in our book, now occur less and less. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2001.00295.x\">Outdoor play</a> and <a href=\"http://www.psi.org.uk/children_mobility\">independent mobility</a> went down; screen time and adult-supervised activities went up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73d84e43414c2eaf9ec6411b58d4bc62b5ed9901\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73d84e43414c2eaf9ec6411b58d4bc62b5ed9901/0_53_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children having a snowball fight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Free play, in which kids work out their own rules of engagement and learn to master small dangers (such as having a snowball fight) are crucial for the development of adult social competence.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ellen Ozier/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet free play in which kids work out their own rules of engagement, take small risks, and learn to master small dangers (such as having a snowball fight) <a href=\"http://www.journalofplay.org/issues/3/4/article/decline-play-and-rise-psychopathology-children-and-adolescents\">turns out to be crucial</a> for the development of adult social and even physical competence. Depriving them of free play stunts their social-emotional growth. Norwegian play researchers Ellen Sandseter and Leif Kennair wrote about the \u201c<a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491100900212\">anti-phobic effects of thrilling experiences</a>.\u201d They noted that children spontaneously seek to add risk to their play, which then extends their coping abilities, which then empowers them to take on even greater challenges. They warned: \u201cWe may observe an increased neuroticism or psychopathology in society if children are hindered from partaking in age adequate risky play.\u201d They wrote those words in 2011. Over the following few years, their prediction came true.</p> <p>Mental health statistics in the US and UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/12/sharp-rise-in-under-19s-being-treated-by-nhs-mental-health-services\">tell the same awful story</a>: kids born after 1994 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/21/generation-z-has-different-attitudes-says-a-new-report\">now known as \u201ciGen\u201d or \u201cGen-Z\u201d</a> \u2013 are suffering from much higher rates of anxiety disorders and depression than did the previous generation (millennials), born between 1982 and 1994. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-09T14:57:02/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Depression in young people, US 2017\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-09T14:57:02/embed.html\">Depression in young people, US 2017</a> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/2018/jul/12/sharp-rise-in-under-19s-being-treated-by-nhs-mental-health-services\">upward trends</a> for depression among teenage boys and girls are <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/599871/LSYPE2_w2-research_report.pdf\">happening in the UK too</a>. Yearly measures of major depression are not available in the UK, but the <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2017/2017\">NHS reports extensive mental health statistics</a> for England from 2004 and 2017 that allow us to make a direct comparison for the same time period. Using a stricter criterion, which finds lower overall rates, the pattern is similar: up slightly for boys, nearly double for girls.</p> <p>This alarming rise does not just reflect an increase in teenagers\u2019 willingness to talk about mental health; it is showing up in their behaviour too, particularly in the rising rates at which teenage girls are admitted to hospital for deliberately harming themselves, mostly by intentionally cutting themselves. Large studies <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2664031\">In the US</a> <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j4351\">and UK</a> using data through to 2014 show sharply rising curves in the years after 2009, with increases of more than 60% in both countries. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/23/stress-anxiety-fuel-mental-health-crisis-girls-young-women\">2017 Guardian study</a> of more recent NHS data found a 68% rise in hospital admissions for self-harm by English teenage girls, over the previous decade.</p> <p>Even more tragically, we also see this trend in the rate of teenage suicide, which is rising for both sexes <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/03/health/teen-suicide-cdc-study-bn/index.html\">in the US </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/04/suicide-rate-rises-among-young-people-in-england-and-wales\">the UK</a>. The suicide rate is up 34% for teenage boys in the US (in 2016, compared with the average rate from 2006-2010). For girls, it is up an astonishing 82%. In the UK, the corresponding increase for teenage boys through to 2017 is 17%, while the increase for girls is 46%. Nobody knows for certain why recent years have seen so much more of a change for girls than boys, but the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/\">leading explanation is the arrival of smartphones and social media</a>. Girls use social media more than boys, and they seem to be more affected by the chronic social comparison, focus on physical appearance, awareness of being left out, and social or relational aggression that social media facilitates.</p> <p>What can we do to reverse these trends? How can we raise kids strong enough to handle the ordinary and extraordinary challenges of life? There\u2019s a powerful piece of folk wisdom: prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. As soon as you grasp the concept of antifragility, you understand why that folk saying is true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"025d407589acde9df599cb8dd1898ff60be1ad8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/025d407589acde9df599cb8dd1898ff60be1ad8d/0_342_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"silhouette of little girl holding parent hand at sunset sky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018At first, it\u2019s scary for parents to let go.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nadezhda1906/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, we should work to make life safer by removing physical dangers from the environment, such as drunk drivers and paedophiles.

      "bodyText": "We talk incessantly about how to make children more \u201cresilient\u201d, but whatever we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not working. Rates of anxiety disorders and depression are rising rapidly among teenagers, and in the US universities can\u2019t hire therapists fast enough to keep up with the demand. What are we doing wrong? Nassim Taleb invented the word \u201cantifragile\u201d and used it in his book by the same name to describe a small but very important class of systems that gain from shocks, challenges, and disorder. Bones and the banking system are two examples; both get weaker \u2013 and more prone to catastrophic failure \u2013 if they go for a long time without any stressors and then face a major challenge. The immune system is an even better example: it requires exposure to certain kinds of germs and potential allergens in childhood in order to develop to its full capacity. Parents who treat their children as if they are fragile (for example, by keeping them away from dirt and potential allergens, such as peanuts) are depriving their children\u2019s immature immune systems of the learning experiences those systems need to develop their maximum protective capacity. Children\u2019s social and emotional abilities are as antifragile as their immune systems. If we overprotect kids and keep them \u201csafe\u201d from unpleasant social situations and negative emotions, we deprive them of the challenges and opportunities for skill-building they need to grow strong. Such children are likely to suffer more when exposed later to other unpleasant but ordinary life events, such as teasing and social exclusion. Some caveats are needed: kids need friends and a loving and reliable attachment figure. Children raised with high levels of fear in unpredictable or violent environments experience elevated levels of stress hormones for extended periods of time. Such long-term exposure can permanently alter brain development and increase stress reactivity, with lifelong ramifications for mental and physical health. But brief periods of normal stress are not harmful; they are essential. A 2013 review of stress research titled \u201cUnderstanding resilience\u201d made the analogy to the immune system explicit: \u201cStress inoculation is a form of immunity against later stressors, much in the same way that vaccines induce immunity against disease.\u201d What, then, would happen if we suddenly stopped immunising children with this kind of stress? We recently co-wrote a book, with Greg Lukianoff, titled The Coddling of the American Mind, about the culture that erupted on American university campuses around 2014, and has spread to some campuses in the UK and Canada. In the book we describe how they began using the language of safety and danger to describe ideas and speakers, and to demand policies based on the premise that some students are fragile (or \u201cvulnerable\u201d). Terms such as \u201csafe space\u201d, \u201ctrigger warning\u201d and \u201cmicroaggression\u201d entered the language. These, we believe, are requests made by a generation that was deprived of the necessary quantity of social immunisations. Students now react with a kind of emotional allergic response (often referred to as being \u201ctriggered\u201d) to things that previous generations would have either brushed off or argued against. It\u2019s not the kids\u2019 fault. In the UK, as in the US, parents became much more fearful in the 1980s and 1990s as cable TV and later the internet exposed everyone, more and more, to those rare occurrences of brutal crimes and freak accidents that, as we report in our book, now occur less and less. Outdoor play and independent mobility went down; screen time and adult-supervised activities went up. Yet free play in which kids work out their own rules of engagement, take small risks, and learn to master small dangers (such as having a snowball fight) turns out to be crucial for the development of adult social and even physical competence. Depriving them of free play stunts their social-emotional growth. Norwegian play researchers Ellen Sandseter and Leif Kennair wrote about the \u201canti-phobic effects of thrilling experiences.\u201d They noted that children spontaneously seek to add risk to their play, which then extends their coping abilities, which then empowers them to take on even greater challenges. They warned: \u201cWe may observe an increased neuroticism or psychopathology in society if children are hindered from partaking in age adequate risky play.\u201d They wrote those words in 2011. Over the following few years, their prediction came true. Mental health statistics in the US and UK tell the same awful story: kids born after 1994 \u2013 now known as \u201ciGen\u201d or \u201cGen-Z\u201d \u2013 are suffering from much higher rates of anxiety disorders and depression than did the previous generation (millennials), born between 1982 and 1994. The upward trends for depression among teenage boys and girls are happening in the UK too. Yearly measures of major depression are not available in the UK, but the NHS reports extensive mental health statistics for England from 2004 and 2017 that allow us to make a direct comparison for the same time period. Using a stricter criterion, which finds lower overall rates, the pattern is similar: up slightly for boys, nearly double for girls. This alarming rise does not just reflect an increase in teenagers\u2019 willingness to talk about mental health; it is showing up in their behaviour too, particularly in the rising rates at which teenage girls are admitted to hospital for deliberately harming themselves, mostly by intentionally cutting themselves. Large studies In the US and UK using data through to 2014 show sharply rising curves in the years after 2009, with increases of more than 60% in both countries. A 2017 Guardian study of more recent NHS data found a 68% rise in hospital admissions for self-harm by English teenage girls, over the previous decade. Even more tragically, we also see this trend in the rate of teenage suicide, which is rising for both sexes in the US and the UK. The suicide rate is up 34% for teenage boys in the US (in 2016, compared with the average rate from 2006-2010). For girls, it is up an astonishing 82%. In the UK, the corresponding increase for teenage boys through to 2017 is 17%, while the increase for girls is 46%. Nobody knows for certain why recent years have seen so much more of a change for girls than boys, but the leading explanation is the arrival of smartphones and social media. Girls use social media more than boys, and they seem to be more affected by the chronic social comparison, focus on physical appearance, awareness of being left out, and social or relational aggression that social media facilitates. What can we do to reverse these trends? How can we raise kids strong enough to handle the ordinary and extraordinary challenges of life? There\u2019s a powerful piece of folk wisdom: prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. As soon as you grasp the concept of antifragility, you understand why that folk saying is true. Of course, we should work to make life safer by removing physical dangers from the environment, such as drunk drivers and paedophiles. And of course we should teach children to treat each other with kindness and respect. But we also have to let our kids out to roam the road without us. It\u2019s what most of us over the age of 40 did (even in much more crime-prone decades) and it\u2019s what most kids want to do. At first, it\u2019s scary for parents to let go. But when a seven-year-old jumps up and down with excitement and pride after running an errand on her own, it gets easier to let her go and play in a nearby park with her friends \u2013 where they all learn to look out for each other and settle their own disputes. We can\u2019t guarantee that giving primary school children more independence today will bring down the rate of teenage suicide tomorrow. The links between childhood overprotection and teenage mental illness are suggestive but not definitive, and there are other likely causal threads. Yet there are good reasons to suspect that by depriving our innately antifragile kids of the wide range of experiences they need to become strong, we are systematically stunting their growth.

This country is who I am. And for that to be taken away from me.\u201d Fonseca, a Portuguese 18-year-old who moved to the UK six years ago, is upset about Brexit. Since the 2016 referendum, she and her mother have applied for British residency seven times and have been rejected each time, she says.

      "body": "<p>The sister of a prisoner who took his own life when being held under a now-abolished sentencing regime has called for urgent action to deal with thousands of inmates still jailed under the widely derided system.</p> <p>Tommy Nicol was jailed under an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/30/absurd-defunct-prison-scheme-ken-clarke-james-ward-jail-mental-health\">imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence</a> \u2013 a form of indeterminate sentence that he described as the \u201cpsychological torture of a person who is doing 99 years\u201d.</p> <p>He made the comment in a handwritten formal complaint at Erlestoke prison around five years into his IPP sentence for robbery and about nine months before he killed himself.</p> <p>The horror inflicted by the perceived neverending nature of IPP was acknowledged by the government\u2019s decision to scrap their use in 2011. The scheme was applied far more widely than intended, with some IPP sentences issued to offenders who committed low-level crimes.</p> <p>But despite the use of the sentencing power being scrapped, nearly 2,600 prisoners still remain locked up under the defunct regime, which saw offenders given a minimum jail tariff but no maximum for a range of crimes.</p> <p>Since his death in September 2015, his sister Donna Mooney has discovered more about Tommy\u2019s experience in the prison estate than she is sometimes able to bear.</p> <p>Now she is calling for the remaining IPP prisoners on minimum tariffs of four years or less to be immediately switched to determinate sentences. She wants to meet with the justice secretary, David Gauke, to discuss what happened to her brother. The proportion of the IPP population who have gone beyond their minimum tariff continues to increase \u2013 89% of IPP prisoners were post-tariff as of 30 September.</p> <p>\u201cIn all of this I\u2019m not justifying what he did,\u201d she says at her home in south-west London. \u201cHe did something and there should have been consequences for that but he is still a human being.\u201d</p> <p>She explains that her brother was the eldest of six children \u2013 three boys, three girls \u2013 and struggled with a \u201ctraumatic\u201d childhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"378350b37ab5ca0ca154e7cc46730d7cc947cb20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/378350b37ab5ca0ca154e7cc46730d7cc947cb20/0_0_357_594/301.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy Nicol, who took his own life at HMP The Mount\" width=\"301\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tommy Nicol, who took his own life at HMP The Mount.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donna Mooney/Family Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe had a difficult childhood and I guess consequently he went off the rails a bit,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Nicol was in and out of young offenders\u2019 institutions and prison from his teenage years \u2013 but Mooney always felt as if his emotional and rehabilitative needs were ignored. Of all the six siblings, Nicol remains the only one who ended up in trouble with the law.</p> <p>\u201cHe was very institutionalised,\u201d she says. \u201cOutside of that, he was happy, friendly, a kind person. He would rather have had a family and a job. He just wasn\u2019t able to do that.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009, he committed his most serious offence \u2013 he stole a car from a mechanic\u2019s garage. The owner caught him in the act, a tussle broke out and the man\u2019s arm was injured. Nicol was jailed at St Albans Crown Court in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cAt that point he didn\u2019t really know what an IPP was,\u201d Mooney says. \u201cWhen he told me I thought, \u2018it can\u2019t be true\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Nicol started his prison sentence at HMP Rye Hill in Warwickshire. His understanding was that it would benefit his prospects for release to access a therapeutic community, only available in a small number of prisons, and to do this he would need to undergo a psychological assessment. He requested this early on but it never took place.</p> <p>In 2013, his tariff completed, he received his first knock back from the Parole Board for release \u2013 who informed him he should access a therapeutic community. This frustrated him but he persevered and requested a jail transfer. He applied to two therapeutic communities, but was unsuccessful.</p> <p>In June 2014 he was transferred to HMP Coldingley in Surrey where there were no relevant courses for him to complete. While there he filed a formal complaint that he had been transferred to a prison that could not offer him the relevant mental health support.</p> <p>It was in Coldingley where serious difficulties began to emerge, but which Mooney says were ignored. Nicol moved himself into solitary confinement \u2013 known as the care and separation unit (CSU) \u2013 in protest. He spent 48 days alone and went on hunger strike for four days. No mental health support was provided.</p> <p>In November 2014 he was transferred to Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire, where he made another formal complaint in which he labelled IPP sentences \u201cpsychological torture\u201d.</p> <p>In February 2015, a psychological assessment was conducted that concluded he would benefit from accessing a therapeutic community. </p> <p>In June 2015, six years into his sentence, he received another knockback from the Parole Board and was told the next review would be in 2017 \u2013 eight years after he was jailed on a minimum four-year tariff.</p> <p>A month later he returned to the CSU where he languished for 80 days. He went on hunger strike for seven days. His behaviour started to become increasingly unusual.</p> <p>Mooney breaks down in tears as she continues her brother\u2019s story. \u201cThat\u2019s for me where you see it really starting to affect him,\u201d she says.</p> <p>He was transferred once again on 15 September 2015 to HMP The Mount, in Hertfordshire. His behaviour became increasingly erratic. He self-harmed, setting a fire in his cell. He was moved to the CSU in the Mount, where he was observed rocking on his knees, groaning. He wrapped himself in sheets and made a paper plate mask. But no mental health support was provided.</p> <p>On 19 September 2015 he was moved to an unfurnished cell \u2013 the harshest prison environment available \u2013 for 24 hours. A video of guards restraining Nicol as they moved him was recently played at his inquest in front of Mooney and other horrified family members.</p> <p>He was heard chanting and talking to imaginary people while in the cell. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was having this mental health episode, and four guys go in and restrain him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72a723c3ab55c452f9d0c31ac80ff5a244e363e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72a723c3ab55c452f9d0c31ac80ff5a244e363e4/430_549_3938_2363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donna Mooney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donna Mooney: \u2018He had a complete loss of hope.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, on Monday 21 September 2015, the governor requested mental health support to see Nicol. The mental health team attempted to access him but were denied due to safety concerns on three occasions.

      "bodyText": "The sister of a prisoner who took his own life when being held under a now-abolished sentencing regime has called for urgent action to deal with thousands of inmates still jailed under the widely derided system. Tommy Nicol was jailed under an imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence \u2013 a form of indeterminate sentence that he described as the \u201cpsychological torture of a person who is doing 99 years\u201d. He made the comment in a handwritten formal complaint at Erlestoke prison around five years into his IPP sentence for robbery and about nine months before he killed himself. The horror inflicted by the perceived neverending nature of IPP was acknowledged by the government\u2019s decision to scrap their use in 2011. The scheme was applied far more widely than intended, with some IPP sentences issued to offenders who committed low-level crimes. But despite the use of the sentencing power being scrapped, nearly 2,600 prisoners still remain locked up under the defunct regime, which saw offenders given a minimum jail tariff but no maximum for a range of crimes. Since his death in September 2015, his sister Donna Mooney has discovered more about Tommy\u2019s experience in the prison estate than she is sometimes able to bear. Now she is calling for the remaining IPP prisoners on minimum tariffs of four years or less to be immediately switched to determinate sentences. She wants to meet with the justice secretary, David Gauke, to discuss what happened to her brother. The proportion of the IPP population who have gone beyond their minimum tariff continues to increase \u2013 89% of IPP prisoners were post-tariff as of 30 September. \u201cIn all of this I\u2019m not justifying what he did,\u201d she says at her home in south-west London. \u201cHe did something and there should have been consequences for that but he is still a human being.\u201d She explains that her brother was the eldest of six children \u2013 three boys, three girls \u2013 and struggled with a \u201ctraumatic\u201d childhood. \u201cWe had a difficult childhood and I guess consequently he went off the rails a bit,\u201d she says. Nicol was in and out of young offenders\u2019 institutions and prison from his teenage years \u2013 but Mooney always felt as if his emotional and rehabilitative needs were ignored. Of all the six siblings, Nicol remains the only one who ended up in trouble with the law. \u201cHe was very institutionalised,\u201d she says. \u201cOutside of that, he was happy, friendly, a kind person. He would rather have had a family and a job. He just wasn\u2019t able to do that.\u201d In 2009, he committed his most serious offence \u2013 he stole a car from a mechanic\u2019s garage. The owner caught him in the act, a tussle broke out and the man\u2019s arm was injured. Nicol was jailed at St Albans Crown Court in 2009. \u201cAt that point he didn\u2019t really know what an IPP was,\u201d Mooney says. \u201cWhen he told me I thought, \u2018it can\u2019t be true\u2019.\u201d Nicol started his prison sentence at HMP Rye Hill in Warwickshire. His understanding was that it would benefit his prospects for release to access a therapeutic community, only available in a small number of prisons, and to do this he would need to undergo a psychological assessment. He requested this early on but it never took place. In 2013, his tariff completed, he received his first knock back from the Parole Board for release \u2013 who informed him he should access a therapeutic community. This frustrated him but he persevered and requested a jail transfer. He applied to two therapeutic communities, but was unsuccessful. In June 2014 he was transferred to HMP Coldingley in Surrey where there were no relevant courses for him to complete. While there he filed a formal complaint that he had been transferred to a prison that could not offer him the relevant mental health support. It was in Coldingley where serious difficulties began to emerge, but which Mooney says were ignored. Nicol moved himself into solitary confinement \u2013 known as the care and separation unit (CSU) \u2013 in protest. He spent 48 days alone and went on hunger strike for four days. No mental health support was provided. In November 2014 he was transferred to Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire, where he made another formal complaint in which he labelled IPP sentences \u201cpsychological torture\u201d. In February 2015, a psychological assessment was conducted that concluded he would benefit from accessing a therapeutic community. In June 2015, six years into his sentence, he received another knockback from the Parole Board and was told the next review would be in 2017 \u2013 eight years after he was jailed on a minimum four-year tariff. A month later he returned to the CSU where he languished for 80 days. He went on hunger strike for seven days. His behaviour started to become increasingly unusual. Mooney breaks down in tears as she continues her brother\u2019s story. \u201cThat\u2019s for me where you see it really starting to affect him,\u201d she says. He was transferred once again on 15 September 2015 to HMP The Mount, in Hertfordshire. His behaviour became increasingly erratic. He self-harmed, setting a fire in his cell. He was moved to the CSU in the Mount, where he was observed rocking on his knees, groaning. He wrapped himself in sheets and made a paper plate mask. But no mental health support was provided. On 19 September 2015 he was moved to an unfurnished cell \u2013 the harshest prison environment available \u2013 for 24 hours. A video of guards restraining Nicol as they moved him was recently played at his inquest in front of Mooney and other horrified family members. He was heard chanting and talking to imaginary people while in the cell. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was having this mental health episode, and four guys go in and restrain him.\u201d Finally, on Monday 21 September 2015, the governor requested mental health support to see Nicol. The mental health team attempted to access him but were denied due to safety concerns on three occasions. After a seven-hour stint in an unfurnished cell he was returned to the CSU and three hours later was found unresponsive. Four days later he was pronounced dead in Watford general hospital. Despite being unresponsive, he had been held in restraints in his hospital bed. His family were not informed until he had died. He was 37. \u201cI can just see how much this sentence has impacted him \u2013 it\u2019s made my brother take his life,\u201d Mooney says. \u201cHe had a complete loss of hope.\u201d She also believes had Nicol known he had a fixed release date \u2013 even if it was longer than the period he ultimately spent in jail \u2013 he would still be alive. Dr Dinesh Maganty, a consultant forensic psychiatrist who gave evidence to the Harris review into deaths in custody, gave evidence at Nicol\u2019s inquest. Explaining the issues around the impact of the IPP sentence, he said that one crucial element in any self-inflicted death is loss of hope. \u201cI would hope that if I say something it will stop other families having to go through this \u2013 this is traumatising,\u201d Mooney says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the person in prison it affects \u2013 it has affected every single one of us.\u201d \u2022 In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

      "bodyText": "Radclyffe Hall\u2019s 1928 novel The Well of Loneliness was subjected to a vicious campaign of attack led by the Sunday Express for its depiction of lesbian relationships, eventually being suppressed and censored in the UK as a piece of \u201cobscene libel\u201d. But the author\u2019s own papers, which are set to be digitised, reveal the outpouring of support Hall received from members of the public around the world, who wrote to thank her for creating, in her heroine Stephen Gordon, a character with whom they could identify. Seen today as a seminal work of gay literature, The Well of Loneliness tells of the \u201cinvert\u201d Stephen Gordon, who realises from a young age that she is attracted to women, dresses in masculine clothes, and falls in love. Hall, a lesbian herself, wrote it to \u201cput my pen at the service of some of the most misunderstood people in the world\u201d. At its raciest, it goes no further than \u201cshe kissed her full on the lips, as a lover\u201d, with a night of passion described as \u201cthat night they were not divided\u201d. It ends with Stephen\u2019s plea: \u201cGive us also the right to our existence!\u201d Sunday Express editor James Douglas led a campaign against the novel, writing in his paper: \u201cIn order to prevent the contamination and corruption of English fiction it is the duty of the critic to make it impossible for any other novelist to repeat this outrage. I say deliberately that this novel is not fit to be sold by any bookseller or to be borrowed from any library.\u201d Despite support from writers including Virginia Woolf and EM Forster, it was banned in the UK until 1949, after Hall\u2019s death. But newly revealed papers from the author\u2019s archive, which are set to be digitised by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas alongside those of her partner, the artist Una Vincenzo, Lady Troubridge, show that the novel was also supported by thousands of readers, who wrote to Hall in outrage at the ban. \u201cThe picture you paint of the poor invert should make everyone more charitable \u2026 No one could finish your book, Miss Hall, without donning a sword and shield forever in the cause of inverts,\u201d wrote one reader from the US, where the novel was not withdrawn despite a challenge, a court declaring it not obscene. \u201cIt has made me want to live and to go on \u2026 I discovered myself in Paris and I dreaded this thing which I thought abnormal,\u201d wrote another. In the UK, an 18-year-old man told Hall he had \u201cexperienced many of the terrors of the invert\u201d, hailing her \u201ctruly marvellous but searing book\u201d. Others offered to send money to help Hall in an appeal against the judgment, or wrote of how the book changed their perspectives. \u201cAt first it repulsed and disgusted, and then the pathos and beauty of it got me, and if I had it in my power to help those poor souls I would have offered my services,\u201d wrote a London correspondent. Dr Steven Macnamara, who has researched Hall\u2019s papers, said she received \u201cthousands of letters of support\u201d. \u201cThe letters demonstrate the public\u2019s awareness that The Well of Loneliness was not an obscene novel, and that Hall had been unfairly and unjustly treated by the government and the media. Access to these letters, through the future digitalisation project, will enhance the importance and understanding of this groundbreaking novel for Hall\u2019s contemporary readers,\u201d he said.

In a telegram, physician Dr Logan Clendening writes that \u201cit is incredible to the scientific mind that an honest and sensitive presentation in literary form of a subject familiar and tragic to every physician should be threatened due to the pornographic imagination of a censor.\u201d Ransom Center director Stephen Enniss said: \u201cThe richness and depth of this material goes well beyond the subsequent censorship and cultural controversies sparked by The Well of Loneliness.\u201d Jana Funke, senior lecturer at the University of Exeter and author of The World and Other Unpublished Works by Radclyffe Hall, said the archive also includes early drafts of The Well of Loneliness, which are \u201cmore explicit in their depiction of lesbian desire and more affirmative regarding the protagonist\u2019s gender non-conforming identity\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Kim Jong-un has told Xi Jinping he wants a second meeting with Donald Trump and is committed to \u201cachieving results\u201d amid an impasse over denuclearisation, according to state media reports of their meeting in Beijing this week. Kim told Xi that North Korea would \u201ccontinue sticking to the stance of denuclearisation\u201d and \u201cmake efforts for the second summit between the [North Korean] and US leaders to achieve results\u201d, Chinese state media reported. The comments by Kim, who has just ended his fourth visit to China in the past 10 months, echo those he made in his New Year\u2019s Day address, when he said he was ready to meet Trump \u201cat any time\u201d, but warned that the North could be forced to take a \u201cnew path\u201d unless the US eased sanctions and made security guarantees. China\u2019s Xinhua news agency quoted Xi as saying that he supported further dialogue and hoped Pyongyang and Washington would \u201cmeet each other halfway\u201d. The report did not elaborate, but North Korea-US talks have stalled over disagreements about which side should be the first to make concessions. Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on the Koreas, said Kim\u2019s visit to Beijing \u201cwas one of a few recent signs that progress toward a second US-North Korea summit is getting serious. \u201cIt clearly leaves both leaders, but especially Kim, in a stronger position.

Details of Kim\u2019s trip to China emerged as the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, predicted that a second summit between Kim and Trump would take place \u201csoon\u201d.

As the temperature plunges, Alam Ansari\u2019s twin daughters, born prematurely, have only their parents\u2019 body heat to keep them warm while they huddle in a crowded tent on the road outside the capital\u2019s top hospital.</p> <p>They are not alone. Each day, about 8,000 people from across the country queue outside the outpatients department for treatment. Mainly from poorer backgrounds, they sleep in tents or on the ground.</p> <p>Ansari is rocking one of his three-month-old daughters. Something is wrong with both girls\u2019 eyes, but he doesn\u2019t know what. The family travelled to the All India Institute of Medical Science \u2013 known simply as AIIMS \u2013 after doctors in Bihar told them they were unable to offer treatment.</p> <p>The train from their remote village to India\u2019s capital took two days. A construction worker, Ansari borrowed 40,000 rupees. \u201cThat\u2019s down to 5,000 rupees after being here two months. Every day we\u2019re sent here and there, from one doctor to another. I don\u2019t know what to do when my money runs out but I have to get my daughters well,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Amid the turmoil, the girls have yet to be named.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95ae4227fd1e6515b5182b053ef1d311fc9f01a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95ae4227fd1e6515b5182b053ef1d311fc9f01a5/0_0_4128_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alam Ansari and his wife, Seema, with their infant twin daughters outside the main hospital in New Delhi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alam Ansari and his wife, Seema, with their infant twin daughters outside the main hospital in New Delhi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amrit Dhillon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>AIIMS runs a shelter for patients from out of town, but it is packed. Ansari and his family are lucky to have found space in one of the temporary tents erected outside by the Delhi government at the start of winter to give sick patients a place to wait for appointments, test results, and treatment.</p> <p>Inside, more than 100 people are wrapped in multi-coloured blankets in the gloom. They are mostly two to a bed; many are very sick and weak, having inhabited tents or lived on pavements outside the hospital for weeks, if not months.</p> <p>Millions of Indians find state hospitals are unable to help when they are seriously ill, leaving them no choice but to travel to New Delhi. AIIMS now operates in seven other states, but doctors at the hospitals outside New Delhi often lack specialist expertise. Patients are almost invariably referred to the capital.</p> <p>The institute offers free consultations and some tests, although payment is still required for drugs.</p> <p>Often, people who come for treatment cannot afford to rent a room. Waiting for an appointment or follow-up consultation is too expensive, travelling to and fro too exhausting.</p> <p>So they stay on, sleeping, eating and living on the pavement, under trees and flyovers, in the metro subway, under bus shelters, and on the floor of public toilets.</p> <p>Chandi Devi, who spent three weeks sleeping in the metro subway before finding space in a tent, looks exhausted and downcast. \u201cMy father needs both his knee joints replaced. He can\u2019t walk. I have to ask others to help me take him to the toilet,\u201d says Devi, who has left behind her three young children to bring her father to AIIMs. He remains silent throughout, his single nylon blanket offering scant protection from the daytime chill, much less the night.</p> <p>Patients like Devi\u2019s father get hot meals provided by NGOs. They use public toilets and buy bottled water. Clothes are washed and hung out to dry on the iron railings lining the busy road outside the hospital.</p> <p>Space under a footbridge is much sought after. The more fortunate manage to get a bed in shelters run by charities and religious trusts, but need far exceeds supply.</p> <p>\u201cOne day it\u2019s go to this doctor, another day it\u2019s go to another doctor. It\u2019s endless. It\u2019s been a month and they haven\u2019t even started treatment because they say they haven\u2019t got any beds,\u201d says Devi.</p> <p>In the next bed is a mother with her son.

We came four days ago from Madhya Pradesh and are still waiting to see a doctor.\u201d</p> <p>Nearby, three-year-old Neelu, from a remote village in Jharkhand, is playing on the pavement by the government tents. Her \u201caccommodation\u201d is a makeshift bed erected on the road by her mother, Chunni Birhor. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep alongside so many people. The tent makes me feel claustrophobic, so I prefer to stay on the path with my daughter,\u201d says Birhor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bef1ffef0f233dd1f0edfe96aff94ef1ebea3869\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bef1ffef0f233dd1f0edfe96aff94ef1ebea3869/0_0_4128_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Three-year-old Neelu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Three-year-old Neelu, who has blood cancer, sleeps on a makeshift bed on the pavement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amrit Dhillon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neelu smiles and scampers around. She looks healthy but Birhor says her daughter has blood cancer and will need to start treatment the moment a bed becomes available. Today is a good day. Often, Neelu doesn\u2019t even feel like getting up.</p> <p>Mother and daughter have been on the pavement for a fortnight. Neelu\u2019s father, a mason from Madhopur in Uttar Pradesh, has gone to the chemist to buy his daughter some drugs. \u201cWe\u2019re spending without earning. Every day is a day\u2019s wages lost,\u201d says Birhor, whose daughter is one of many children suffering from cancer who can be found outside AIIMS. </p> <p>By 6pm it is dark and the temperature dips. It\u2019s the rush hour and road next to the hospital is humming with traffic. The air is thick with smelly pollutants that sting the eyes.</p> <p>Back at the tent, one of Ansari\u2019s girls starts to cry. His wife takes her and starts to breastfeed. Even now, after two months living in a tent in the freezing cold trying to save the lives of his two infants,Ansari looks puzzled at his circumstances. \u201cI thought that AIIMS, being the top hospital, would have made some \u2018bandobast\u2019 [arrangements]\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Then he trailis off, sensing the futility of saying anything more.</p>",

Atul Sethi is here with her father. \u201cHis kidneys have failed,\u201d she says, pointing to an emaciated figure on the ground, shrouded from head to toe in a white sheet. \u201cHe can\u2019t stand. We came four days ago from Madhya Pradesh and are still waiting to see a doctor.\u201d Nearby, three-year-old Neelu, from a remote village in Jharkhand, is playing on the pavement by the government tents. Her \u201caccommodation\u201d is a makeshift bed erected on the road by her mother, Chunni Birhor. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep alongside so many people. The tent makes me feel claustrophobic, so I prefer to stay on the path with my daughter,\u201d says Birhor. Neelu smiles and scampers around. She looks healthy but Birhor says her daughter has blood cancer and will need to start treatment the moment a bed becomes available. Today is a good day. Often, Neelu doesn\u2019t even feel like getting up. Mother and daughter have been on the pavement for a fortnight. Neelu\u2019s father, a mason from Madhopur in Uttar Pradesh, has gone to the chemist to buy his daughter some drugs. \u201cWe\u2019re spending without earning. Every day is a day\u2019s wages lost,\u201d says Birhor, whose daughter is one of many children suffering from cancer who can be found outside AIIMS. By 6pm it is dark and the temperature dips. It\u2019s the rush hour and road next to the hospital is humming with traffic. The air is thick with smelly pollutants that sting the eyes. Back at the tent, one of Ansari\u2019s girls starts to cry. His wife takes her and starts to breastfeed. Even now, after two months living in a tent in the freezing cold trying to save the lives of his two infants,Ansari looks puzzled at his circumstances. \u201cI thought that AIIMS, being the top hospital, would have made some \u2018bandobast\u2019 [arrangements]\u2026\u201d Then he trailis off, sensing the futility of saying anything more.",

      "bodyText": "Australia, Thailand and the Gulf states have been inextricably linked in two global news stories lately, when two young people faced being forcibly returned to the places and people they fled simply because they happened to step foot in Bangkok. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, an 18-year-old Saudi woman, was on her way to Australia seeking its protection. Twenty-five-year-old Hakeem al-Araibi, heading to Thailand with his wife for their honeymoon, already had it. Both Al-Araibi and Qunun have captured international headlines \u2013 far more than many others in similarly dire situations. But there is no denying Qunun\u2019s case has drawn more support, including, crucially, from the government of Thailand. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u2018I\u2019m sure, 100%, they will kill me\u2019 Qunun obtained a tourist visa for Australia, where she intended to claim asylum. She fled her family when they went on a trip to Kuwait and flew to Bangkok, but says she was met on arrival by a Saudi diplomat and was tricked into handing over her passport. The teenager fears her family will kill her for renouncing Islam \u2013 a crime punishable by death under Saudi Arabia\u2019s sharia law \u2013 and barricaded herself in the airport hotel room, demanding to speak to the United Nations high commission for refugees (UNHCR). \u201cI am Rahaf \u2026 I am in the hotel, I need a country to protect me as soon as possible. I am seeking asylum,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family is strict and locked me in a room for six months just for cutting my hair. \u201cI\u2019m sure, 100%, they will kill me as soon as I get out of the Saudi jail.\u201d Thai authorities initially said she was a runaway and was unsafe without a guardian, but eventually bowed to pressure, allowing the UNHCR to visit. \u201cShe is now under the sovereignty of Thailand,\u201d said the head of Thai immigration, General Surachate Hakparn. \u201cNo one and no embassy can force her to go anywhere.

The UNHCR assessed her to be a refugee in need of protection and Australia has said it will consider resettling her. \u2018My life will end if I go to Bahrain\u2019 Bahraini national, now Australian resident, Hakeem al-Araibi, was a member of the Bahrain national football team. Al-Araibi claims he was imprisoned and tortured by Bahraini authorities amid a crackdown on athletes taking part in pro-democracy rallies during the Arab Spring, and he fled to Australia and sought asylum in 2011. In 2014 he was sentenced in absentia to 10 years\u2019 jail at a Bahraini trial beset by claims of coerced confessions, ignored evidence and bias. The conviction related to an act of vandalism which occurred at the same time \u2013 or at least not long after \u2013 al-Araibi was playing in a televised football match. In 2017 he was given formal refugee status by Australia. The previous year he had spoken out publicly against Bahraini royal and president of the Asian Football Confederation, Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa, for his lack of action defending the athletes in 2011 when he was head of the Bahrain Football Association. In late November Al-Araibi and his wife went to Thailand on a delayed honeymoon. He was arrested on arrival by Thai authorities who said they were acting on a red notice from Interpol. Despite the withdrawal of the red notice \u2013 which should never have been issued \u2013 Thai authorities said Bahrain had separately requested his detention prior to his arrival anyway, and Al-Araibi remains in a Thai prison. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here,\u201d Al-Araibi told Guardian Australia from detention. \u201cI\u2019m a refugee in Australia. I\u2019m scared of the Bahraini government \u2026 They will kill me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen there. My life will end if I go to Bahrain.\u201d Stark questions remain about the actions or potential mistakes of Interpol, the Australian federal police, its immigration department and communications between Thailand and Bahrain. Al-Araibi has applied for Australian citizenship but Australia\u2019s immigration department has not yet granted it and the immigration minister will not comment on it. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has publicly called for Al-Araibi\u2019s release and was due to meet Thai officials on Thursday, but Thailand continues to process Bahrain\u2019s extradition request. Human Rights Watch has worked closely with both cases, and the UNHCR and Amnesty International are among international human rights groups to publicly lobby for both. Qunun is not yet out of danger, but her situation, just days after she was stopped at Bangkok airport, is markedly more positive than that of Al-Araibi, who has been locked up for 45 days and counting. So why the difference? \u2018I wish you had taken her phone\u2019 The reasons are varied but likely include the age-old non-science of what makes news and what doesn\u2019t. Al-Araibi\u2019s case is also much more complicated based on the known facts, and being subject to an Interpol red notice might have suggested Al-Araibi\u2019s arrest was legitimate. Qunun was able to get on social media with videos and urgent personal pleas immediately and prolifically. An army of loud and committed online supporters rose up after Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy translated and shared her posts. In a meeting with Thai immigration, a Saudi official noted the 45,000 followers she quickly gained, and remarked in Arabic: \u201cI wish you had taken her phone, it would have been better than [taking] her passport.\u201d Al-Araibi, while he also had a phone and was able to speak directly to journalists and send photos in the first days of his detention, did not attract the instant focus. Some media was far slower \u2013 particularly in Australia \u2013 to pick up on it, despite the story\u2019s stronger links to the country than Qunun. Supporters rallied and international media reported the situation, but the chatter didn\u2019t break through to mainstream audiences to the same degree, even when panicked phone calls reported he had been bundled away by Thai authorities and his wife told she would not see him again. Small protests were held outside Thai consulates in Australia, and the Victorian football community and global players associations rallied. Football Federation Australia, Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation were deafeningly silent for weeks, and even now direct their messages at governments instead of the influential Bahrainis among their own executives. \u2018They didn\u2019t forget what he did\u2019 There is perhaps a greater awareness of the horrendous danger to people \u2013 particularly women \u2013 in Saudi Arabia than of what Al-Araibi faces in Bahrain. The Saudi regime was cast further into the spotlight when journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in October. Women face extraordinary oppression. Under the Saudi guardianship system almost every aspect of a Saudi woman\u2019s life is controlled by a male guardian. They are forbidden from travelling without a male relative as escort, cannot apply for a passport, get medical treatment or seek an education without permission. Eltahawy said Qunun represented a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d who had showed Saudi women they could demand freedom and dignity. In April 2017, Dina Ali Lasloom, a 24-year-old Saudi woman, was forcibly returned by the Philippines, despite social media pleas, and hasn\u2019t been heard from since. Fatima Yazbek of the Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights (GIDHR) notes the death penalty is still carried out on political opponents in Bahrain, citing three executions in 2017, including one sports teacher. Human rights organisations have documented countless cases of abuse, torture and arbitrary imprisonment of dissidents, including those who sought to flee only to be deported by cooperative governments where they landed. Bangkok is implicated in more than one instance of a dissident returned to a Bahraini prison cell, where they were beaten and tortured. Government announcements and local news in recent weeks have reported tax deals and large-scale property developments between Thailand and Bahrain. \u201cHakeem is now the icon for the suffering of political detainees in Bahrain,\u201d said GIDHR\u2019s Yahya Alhadid. A royal family rules Bahrain and populates about half of the cabinet positions, as well as other important roles including the ambassadorship to the UK. The current Bahraini ambassador to the UK is Shaikh Fawaz bin Mohammed al-Khalifa, who was also chair of the information authority in 2011, when state television broadcast pictures and footage of protesting athletes, labelling them as traitors. The London embassy issued the only public statement from Bahrain, in the days after Al-Araibi\u2019s arrest, defending the red notice. Alhadid questioned why the London embassy was commenting on a Bahraini who now lived in Australia and was detained in Thailand. \u201cAfter Hakeem spoke out they didn\u2019t forget what he did,\u201d he suggested.",

      "bodyText": "A day after this story was published, the National Park Service announced that it had averted the closure by tapping revenues from recreation fees, and that campgrounds and entrance stations would be reopened on Thursday. In a press release, the NPS expressed thanks to volunteers \u201cwho provided basic sanitation at campgrounds and other closed areas during the lapse in appropriations\u201d. For 17 days, a host of volunteers and a skeleton staff kept the trash cans and toilets from overflowing at Joshua Tree national park. But on Tuesday, 18 days after the federal government shutdown furloughed the vast majority of national park staff, officials announced that vandalism of the park\u2019s distinctive namesake plants and other maintenance and sanitation problems will require closure starting Thursday. \u201cWhile the vast majority of those who visit Joshua Tree do so in a responsible manner, there have been incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days that have precipitated the closure,\u201d spokesman George Land said in a news release. Land told the Los Angeles Times that, with only eight rangers currently overseeing the nearly 800,000 acre park, the gates would likely remain closed until the shutdown ends. But a different spokesman for the National Parks Service, Mike Litterst, subsequently told the Times that the park may not close after all if staff are able to complete cleanup work before Thursday. National Park Service officials did not immediately respond to requests for clarification. The potential closure of Joshua Tree was met with mixed emotions by those whose livelihoods depend on the more than 2.8 million visitors the park attracts annually. \u201cI have 11 employees who are effectively going to be laid off as of Thursday,\u201d said Seth Zaharias, co-owner of a company that leads rock climbing trips in the park. \u201cThey are not going to work for the remainder of the shutdown.\u201d Still, Zaharias said that reports of vandalism to the park made him support the closure. \u201cEconomically, that\u2019s disastrous for our community,\u201d he said of the prospect of serious environmental damage to the park. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad.\u201d His company was beginning to send out cancellation notices for customers who had booked trips after Thursday, he said. David Lamfrom, director of the California desert and national wildlife programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, warned that the damage to Joshua Tree\u2019s desert landscape could be catastrophic. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly fragile landscape that takes generations and generations to grow, and generations and generations to heal,\u201d Lamfrom said. \u201cThe amount of time it takes to heal can be on the geological scale.\u201d Lamfrom expressed frustration that community members had been placed in the position of trying to keep the park operating during the shutdown. \u201cFor business owners and community members to have to take up the mantle and the burden of running our national parks makes no sense,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have professionals who are dedicated to doing that work, and they\u2019re sitting at home.\u201d Lamfrom also warned that because most of the park\u2019s rangers are furloughed, the extent of environmental damage is likely still unknown. \u201cThe main story has been about poop, but I think there\u2019s a much bigger story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe resource impacts could be really dangerous.

The independent senator\u2019s use of taxpayer funds for travel has been under scrutiny since he announced he would bill the public to travel from Queensland to a far-right rally in St Kilda on Saturday. Last year, Anning billed taxpayers for two overnight stays in the town of Babinda, south of Cairns, on 6 March and 19 July, claiming $542 in travel allowances for unspecified \u201celectorate duties\u201d, according to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority. The travel allowances claimed by Anning are a flat-rate payment to MPs designed to cover accommodation, meals and incidentals during overnight stays related to parliamentary business. Babinda only has two hotels: the Babinda State hotel and the Babinda Quarters. The historic Babinda State hotel is owned by Anning\u2019s brother, Harry. A spokesman for Fraser Anning said it had been the \u201cmost appropriate venue to host events\u201d on both occasions. Asked what the \u201celectorate duties\u201d in Babinda were, Anning\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cSenator Anning\u2019s travel falls within Parliamentary entitlement requirements.\u201d \u201cHe does not sit idle and through a combination of travel within Queensland and interstate, he represents the interests of his constituents.

IPEA data also shows a claim for $51.60 in unscheduled travel on 19 July. Anning also claimed a $775.89 fare between Brisbane and Cairns on 6 March. In October or November Anning used the Babinda State hotel for a speech to local constituents, praising the venue for its \u201cgreat hospitality and excellent service\u201d. It is unclear whether Anning will bill taxpayers for the event and IPEA data is not yet available for that period.

He claimed more than $19,000 to have his family travel with him on trips between July and September 2018. Anning also plans to claim more than $2,800 for travel to Saturday\u2019s far-right rally, covering flights and car travel, according to the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. Anning has previously claimed expenses to attend a Sydney rally attended by far-right activist Lauren Southern. The senator held a press conference on Wednesday and said he had no intention of paying the money back for the St Kilda rally. \u201cNo I won\u2019t.

The union\u2019s ABC section secretary Sinddy Ealy said she believed the total unpaid wage amount would be \u201csubstantial\u201d at a time \u201cwhen the ABC can ill afford it\u201d. \u201cThe scale of this mistake over so many years would be unacceptable in any workplace, let alone at our national broadcaster,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had concerns about the ABC\u2019s over-reliance on and payment of casual workers for years. As recently as 2016 the CPSU was assured by the ABC that it was paying casual employers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ABC staff agreement \u2013 clearly that is not the case. \u201cThe people responsible for a mistake of this scale must be held accountable, particularly given their previous denials of any problem. All workers affected by this disgraceful situation should be provided with backpay, and many of these workers should also be given permanent jobs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Welsh town of Harlech is challenging New Zealand\u2019s claim to the steepest street in the world, forcing the city of Dunedin to contemplate losing one of its most famous and lucrative tourist attractions. Baldwin Street in Dunedin draws in thousands of tourists a year since being crowned the steepest street in the world by Guinness World Records, with an exhausting 1:3 gradient. Located in an otherwise quiet valley of the South Island city, Baldwin Street has attracted daredevils and adventure sports enthusiasts, prompting the local council to upgrade infrastructure and local residents to launch cottage industries selling food, drinks and souvenirs. The street has also become a hit on Instagram and social media. Now, the residents of Harlech in Wales are laying down a challenge, claiming Ffordd Pen Llech is one degree steeper than Baldwin Street, with a gradient of 36% to Baldwin\u2019s 35%. Measurements are being taken on Ffordd Pen Llech and will be submitted to Guinness World Records, with a decision expected later this month. On social media Dunedin\u2019s residents were contemplating a life without their treasured title. \u201cWe would have to change signage around the street and reprint a lot of brochures around town,\u201d wrote Joseph on Facebook. \u201cI have a great solution though, we just redo the signs and reprint the brochures with the title \u2018the world\u2019s first steepest street\u2019 tourists wouldn\u2019t know the difference.\u201d Another suggested Baldwin Street reinvent itself as the world\u2019s steepest cycle lane, while another mooted idea was to resurface the top of the street to increase the gradient and retain the title. Dunedin mayor Dave Cull said the street had faced challenges before and had promptly \u201cseen them off\u201d. \u201cIf Wales turns out to have a steeper one we will just have to arrange one of our periodic earthquakes and tilt Baldwin a bit more\u201d said Cull. It takes about 10 minutes to walk up the 350-metre long Baldwin Street, but residents often do it in seven. \u201cI have angina and climbing 276 steps is cheaper than going to the gym,\u201d said Bindi Bezar, who operates a gift shop at the bottom of the street. The increasing popularity of Baldwin Street has been a mixed blessing for residents, with some enjoying the novelty of popularity, and others fed-up with tourists going to the toilet in their gardens and peering into their houses. \u201cI think a lot of tourists don\u2019t know this is a real street, that people actually live here,\u201d said Beverley McClay, a resident for nine years. \u201cIt\u2019s very social, very busy. I often come out in my dressing gown to meet people, and the tourists like to watch me stacking wood, they ask me what I am doing.\u201d Dunedin City Council is undertaking a series of upgrades to strengthen the street and help residents cope with the thousands of tourists who visit every year. In the past two years Baldwin Street has also become a sought-after destination in an unusual social media trend to snap pictures at odd angles, which create the optical illusion of the houses being severely lopsided. The trend has significantly increased visitor numbers \u2013 especially during the winter season when tourists usually avoided the area because of frost, ice and occasional snow.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re ending our live coverage for the day, thanks for following along. A recap of the major developments: There was no end to the shutdown in sight after Donald Trump abruptly ended a meeting with Democratic leaders, calling it a \u201ctotal waste of time\u201d. Some Republicans have said they would support reopening the government without wall funding, but Trump urged Senate Republicans to \u201cstick together\u201d. Trump also claimed he had the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to declare an emergency, saying the \u201cthreshold\u201d for the declaration is if he can\u2019t broker a deal with Congress. House Democrats are planning to start passing individual spending bills that would reopen closed departments in hopes of ratcheting up pressure on Republicans. Democrats have also pushed legislation that would prohibit creditors and landlords from taking actions against federal workers hurt by the shutdown. New details emerged about how the shutdown was affecting the EPA and the FDA. News broke that deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein is expected to step down. Billionaire Tom Steyer announced he would not be running for president, but that he plans to spend at least $40m on impeachment efforts. The New Hampshire Democratic party announced that Elizabeth Warren would be the keynote speaker at the party\u2019s major fundraising dinner. The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino is following Senator Kamala Harris this evening at a book event that has drawn a large crowd in Washington DC: Some Democrats have also pushed a measure today that would prohibit creditors and landlords from taking actions against federal workers hurt by the shutdown: Legislation could potentially protect employees from foreclosures, evictions and loan defaults: Trump last week encouraged landlords to be \u201cbe nice and easy\u201d to tenants hurt by the shutdown and struggling to pay rent. The White House is reportedly discussing a scenario to reopen the government that would involve Trump declaring a national emergency, the courts intervening, and Congress and the president ending the shutdown while the case is going through litigation, according to the Wall Street Journal: It\u2019s unclear if the president is interested in this option: The federal government has halted some routine food inspections due to the shutdown. The AP has some details on the impact on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): The US government isn\u2019t doing routine food inspections because of the partial federal shutdown, but checks of the riskiest foods are expected to resume next week. The Food and Drug Administration says it\u2019s working to bring back about 150 employees to inspect riskier foods such as cheese, infant formula and produce. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency can\u2019t make the case that \u201ca routine inspection of a Nabisco cracker facility\u201d is necessary during the shutdown, however. The FDA conducts about 8,400 inspections a year, or an average of 160 a week. Gottlieb said riskier foods account for about a third of the food covered by the agency\u2019s domestic inspections. Some more information here: The shutdown has had a severe impact on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with cuts that could put Americans\u2019 health at risk moving forward. Guardian environment reporter Oliver Milman reports: More than 13,000 employees at the EPA are not at work, with just 794 people deemed essential staff currently undertaking the agency\u2019s duties. Routine activities such as checks on regulated businesses, clean-ups of toxic superfund sites and the pursuit of criminal polluters have been paused since 28 December. Disaster relief payments to people harmed by hurricanes Michael and Florence have been delayed. Preparations to battle wildfires in Alaska have been hampered. Testing to ensure toxic chemicals aren\u2019t leaking into the lower Cape Fear river in North Carolina has been halted. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami have suspended work on predicting the next storm season, in the wake of a punishing series of hurricanes in 2018. Read more here: An estimated 35.3 million people watched Trump speak live on Tuesday night in his televised address that used falsehoods and misleading statistics to claim there was a crisis at the US-Mexico border. Here are some stats on viewers from Nielsen, via the AP: Fox News Channel with 8.044 million viewers and CBS with 8.043 million were in a virtual dead heat as the top destination. NBC was third with 7 million, followed by ABC, MSNBC, CNN and Fox broadcasting. The total, which came from 11 separate networks that decided to air the speech live, was about 10m fewer viewers than Trump had for his 2018 State of the Union address. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is facing some backlash for a joke he made about the #MeToo movement while telling reporters to move back earlier today: Trump has repeatedly mocked the #MeToo movement, and so have some Democrats: Here\u2019s what we know about the Situation Room meeting Trump called a \u201cwaste of time\u201d. There was candy. Butterfingers, Babe Ruth\u2019s, M&amp;Ms and possibly skittles. It resolved nothing. The Democratic leaders tried to humanize the shutdown by talking about its impacts, according to a congressional aide. They emphasized that Democrats do want borders security \u2013 but that a wall wouldn\u2019t stop the flow of drugs or illegal border crossings. Trump, according to the aide, talked about \u201cthousands\u201d storming the border and claimed without evidence that large numbers of women being trafficked over the border \u201cwith tape over their mouths\u201d. At one point during the discussion, the Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: \u201cYou are using people as leverage. Why won\u2019t you open the government and stop hurting people? According to the aide, Trump replied: \u201cBecause then you won\u2019t give me what I want.\u201d Trump then asked Pelosi if he \u201cquickly\u201d re-opened the government would she support a wall in 30 days. The speaker said she would not. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Trump responded. In a disputed account, he slammed his hands on table. But all agreed that it ended with him saying: \u201cBye bye\u201d US Coast Guard employees impacted by the government shutdown were given tips on how to make up for lost wages: consider babysitting, dog-walking or holding a garage sale, according to a new report in the Washington Post. Those suggestions apparently came in a five-page tip sheet that also said: \u201cBankruptcy is a last option.\u201d The Coast Guard gets funding from homeland security and currently has roughly 6,400 employees on indefinite furlough, along with 2,100 working without pay, the paper reported. A spokesperson told the Post that the suggestions in the tip sheet did not \u201creflect the Coast Guard\u2019s current efforts to support our workforce during this lapse in appropriations\u201d, and that the \u201cguidance\u201d had now been removed from its website. Sam Levin here, taking over our live coverage of the government shutdown as negotiations have once again failed. A quick summary of key highlights from the day: Donald Trump abruptly ended a meeting with Democratic leaders, calling it a \u201ctotal waste of time\u201d. The president met with Senate Republicans in a closed-door meeting earlier, urging them to \u201cstick together\u201d. Some Republicans have said they would support reopening the government without wall funding, but Trump has claimed the GOP is \u201cunified\u201d. Trump also claimed he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to declare an emergency, saying the \u201cthreshold\u201d for the declaration is if he can\u2019t broker a deal with Congress. House Democrats are planning to start passing individual spending bills that would reopen closed departments in hopes of ratcheting up pressure on Republicans. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said the the president was using federal workers as \u201chostages through a temper tantrum\u201d. News broke that deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein is expected to step down. Billionaire Tom Steyer announced he would not be running for president, but that he plans to spend at least $40m on impeachment efforts. The House just voted to pass the individual Financial Services appropriations bill as part of effort by Democrats to pass government funding bills for each aspect of government in hopes of forcing a Senate vote. Only 8 Republicans joined with all Democrats in voting to fund this aspect of the government. There is a new report that Rod Rosenstein will not leave the administration until special counsel Robert Mueller has finished his work rather than after Bill Barr is confirmed to be attorney general. In a new interview with Buzzfeed, John Kasich, the outgoing Republican governor of Ohio, declined to say if he still considered himself a Republican. Well I\u2019m certainly a conservative. A creative conservative, on the order of a guy like Jack Kemp, or my newest big fad is Teddy Roosevelt\u201d the progressive Republican president who later left his party and waged an unsuccessful third-party campaign. Kasich was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 2016. The Guardian can confirm as well that Tom Steyer will not run for the presidency. The New York Times reports that the progressive billionaire will announce that he will not run for the White House but will step up his efforts to promote Trump\u2019s impeachment instead. Mr Steyer began informing aides early this week that he would not be a candidate after all, after concluding that he could have a greater political impact through his impeachment activism, several advisers to Mr Steyer said. Mr Steyer intends to spend at least $40m on impeachment efforts in the coming year \u2013 money that might otherwise have been directed toward a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cMost people come to Iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president,\u201d Mr Steyer said in prepared remarks, which were obtained by the New York Times. \u201cBut I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.\u201d Mike Pence says Trump \u201cmade clear today there will be no deal without a wall\u201d. Mike Pence now attacks Democrats who \u201cdemanded that before any negotiations could begin we would have to reopen the government\u201d. Trump backs up Schumer\u2019s account, saying: \u201cI said bye-bye\u201d after saying the meeting was \u201ca total waste of time\u201d. Chuck Schumer told reporters that Trump slammed the table and walked out of the meeting at the White House this afternoon Donald Trump implored Republicans to \u201cstick together\u201d as they come under pressure from Democrats, federal workers and the American public to reopen the government. During a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans, the president remained resolute in his negotiating position and made clear that he was not prepared to back away from his demand for a border wall, according to several members who attended the meeting. \u201cHe gave no indication of any willingness to budge an inch,\u201d said John Kennedy, a Republican of Louisiana. \u201cThe president\u2013 and I happen to agree with him \u2013believes that his only sin is that for the first time in 15 or 20 years he is actually enforcing America\u2019s immigration laws.\u201d In a sign of how far off a resolution was, Kennedy outlined four possible outcomes \u2013 none of which included a compromise. In his view, either Trump blinks, Pelosi blinks, Trump declares a national emergency or the government remains partially closed. Senator Lisa Murkowski, one of a handful of Senate Republicans who is uneasy with the prolonged shutdown, said she reminded the president that \u201cwhen the government is shut down there are consequences and people are starting to feel those consequences\u201d. In response, she said, Trump urged the party to stay unified. Murkowski has indicated support for the Democrats\u2019 plan to pass a stopgap spending bill that funds border security at current levels while the debate continues and a separate package that would fully fund the rest of the government until the end of the fiscal year. Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, wouldn\u2019t guess how many more days \u2013 or possibly weeks \u2013 the shut down would last but he isn\u2019t counting on a swift conclusion. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be here for a little while,\u201d he said. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who is firmly behind the president, said Trump told members that declaring a national emergency \u201cremained an option\u201d but that he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to do it right away\u201d. Congressional leaders have arrived at the White House again for yet another meeting about resolving the partial shutdown. Donald Trump spoke briefly to reporters on Capitol Hill this afternoon about the shutdown. He insisted that Republicans were \u201cvery very united\u201d and continued to leave open the possibility of declaring a national emergency, \u201cI may do that\u201d. Trump spoke at the Senate Republican lunch today. However, those leaving the lunch are not optimistic about the partial shutdown being resolved anytime soon. Doug LaMalfa, the Republican congressman who represents Paradise, California, which was almost completely destroyed by wildfires last year has responded to Trump\u2019s tweet about withdrawing Fema funds from California this morning in a statement. He describes Trump\u2019s threat as \u201cnot helpful\u201d. A continued shutdown poses risks to the US\u2019s credit rating according to a report from CNN. Federal employees are not getting paid during the shutdown. However, as the Atlantic reports, they can\u2019t go on strike in response either. Since the enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, federal employees have been legally prohibited from striking. That law was intended to prevent public-sector workers from leveraging a work stoppage that could cripple the U.S. government or major industries in negotiations for better pay, working conditions, and benefits. But it likely did not envision a scenario where the government would require its employees to work without paying them, as is the case now. The Washington Post reports that the shutdown has led to a significant reduction in food inspections. [The Food and Drug Administration] which oversees 80 percent of the food supply, has suspended all routine inspections of domestic food-processing facilities, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview. He said he\u2019s working on a plan to bring back inspectors as early as next week to resume inspections of high-risk facilities, which handle foods such as soft cheese or seafood, or have a history of problems. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas says that he is getting some very strong praise for his new beard. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to declare an emergency. The \u201cthreshold\u201d for declaring one is if he can\u2019t make a deal with Congress. The Democratic leaders on Wednesday joined affected federal workers at a press conference on Capitol Hill to urge Donald Trump to end the partial government shutdown. Echoing language they used in their rebuttal to Trump\u2019s Tuesday night address, they accused the president of misrepresenting their negotiating position and called it a \u201cdark time\u201d for American workers. \u201cTo use them as hostages through a temper tantrum by the president is just so wrong, so unfair, so mean-spirited,\u201d said Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, pointing the workers standing behind him. \u201cIt ought to end and it ought to end now.\u201d House Democrats are planning to start passing individual spending bills that would reopen closed departments in hopes of ratcheting up pressure on Republicans. But the Senate majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to bring legislation to the floor that Trump has not explicitly said he would support. \u201cLast night the president spouted more malice and misinformation, appealing to fear instead of facts,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. \u201cThe reality is the president could end the Trump shutdown and reopen the government today - and he should.\u201d Jeffery David Cox, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, stressed the economic toll the shutdown \u2013 which he called a \u201clockout\u201d \u2013 was having on workers, noting that his members\u2019 average take-home pay is $500 a week. \u201cThey need their jobs. They need their paydays. They want to service the American people and it\u2019s time for this lockout to end,\u201d Cox said. Clifton Buchanan, a cook supervisor with the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Houston, is among the hundreds of thousands of federal employees who have been furloughed since 21 December, when parts of the government shut down. Buchanan, who participated in the conference in Washington, turned 50 years old on Friday but instead of celebrating the milestone, he sat around the kitchen table with his wife discussing which bills they could afford to pay without his income. \u201cI\u2019ve served this country for 29 years so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m against protecting our country\u201d he said, referring to his service in the US army and his work for the Federal Bureau of Prisons. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, directing his comments to Congress and the president, \u201copen up the government and then do your political thing. Free the hostages.\u201d Right now I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to pay my bills and feed my family. I\u2019m not working. I\u2019m not getting paid. I can\u2019t pick and choose who to blame. I just know I have no income.\u201d The New Hampshire Democratic party has just announced that Elizabeth Warren will be the keynote speaker at the party\u2019s major fundraising dinner in February. The speech marks Warren\u2019s first announced trip to Granite State since forming an exploratory committee for a presidential bid on New Year\u2019s Eve. Warren travelled to Iowa last weekend. The retirement of longtime Kansas senator Pat Roberts has sparked one statewide elected official to throw his hat in the ring already. Jake LaTurner, the 30-year-old Republican state treasurer of the Sunflower State, announced yesterday that he run for the seat being vacated by Roberts in 2020. Roberts narrowly won re-election in 2014 against Democratic backed independent Greg Orman. Former HUD secretary Julian Castro, who is expected to announced a presidential bid this weekend, has committed to not taking support from political action committees and similar outside groups. NBC News reports: Castro also echoed a promise made by another fellow Democrat exploring a 2020 run, Senator Elizabeth Warren: not to take money from political action committees \u2014 and challenging other would-be candidates to do the same. That promise was met with some consternation from one man in the crowd, afraid that Castro would be \u2014 as the candidate re-phrased it \u2014 \u201cbringing a knife to a gun fight.\u201d \u201cThe people are more powerful than the PAC,\u201d Castro rebutted, eliciting cheers. Controversial Iowa Republican Steve King will face a primary challenge from Randy Feenstra, a state senator from the north-west corner of the state. In a statement, Feenstra said: \u201cToday, Iowa\u2019s 4th District doesn\u2019t have a voice in Washington, because our current representative\u2019s caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table,\u201d Senator Feenstra concluded. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more sideshows or distractions, we need to start winning for Iowa\u2019s families.\u201d Feenstra though emphasizes his conservative credentials including support for President Trump and the second amendment and his opposition to abortion. In an interview with Fox and Friends on Fox News Channel this morning, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders acknowledged that she was incorrect when she wrongly claimed that 4,000 terrorists had been stopped at the southern border of the United States. The correct number was six. \u201cI should have said 4,000 at all points of entry, not just at the southern border. But the bottom line is whether it\u2019s one, whether it\u2019s four, whether it\u2019s fourteen or four thousand - one terrorists coming into our country in illegal fashion to do us harm is one too many and we have to take every step possible to prevent that from happening, including protecting our most vulnerable points of entry, and we know that to be the southern border. We have to do what is necessary to protect our border, to protect the people, and that\u2019s exactly what President Trump has done, and that\u2019s exactly what he laid out in his speech last night.\u201d Chuck Grassley, the outgoing chair of the Senate judiciary committee, met with Bill Barr, Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee on Capitol Hill this morning. Confirmation hearings on Barr\u2019s nomination will be held next week. The morning after his Oval Office address, Donald Trump has thoughts on forest management or \u201cForrest Management\u201d in California and says he has directed FEMA to cut off aid to the state. Former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke is leaning towards a presidential bid reports Politico. O\u2019Rourke who lost a bid to represent Texas in the Senate in 2018 has been reportedly making positive noises about running for the White House and recently met with former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley who went on to endorse O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy in an editorial in the Des Moines Register. However, the Texas Democrat has still been playing coy with activists in early states. As first reported by ABC News, deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein is expected to step down in the coming weeks provided Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general, Bill Barr is confirmed by the Senate. Rosenstein has overseen Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian collusion in the 2016 election for over a year and a half. As ABC reports: Rosenstein has communicated to President Donald Trump and White House officials his plan to depart the administration around the time William Barr, Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, would take office following a Senate confirmation. Sources told ABC News Rosenstein wants to ensure a smooth transition to his successor and would accommodate the needs of Barr, should he be confirmed. Rosenstein apparently had long been thinking he would serve about two years, and there was no indication that he was being forced out at this moment by the president. Good morning, it is the 19th day of the partial government shutdown, Rod Rosenstein is expected to leave the Justice Department soon and Donald Trump is appearing on Capitol Hill. It is Wednesday in American politics.",

      "bodyText": "Retailers experienced their worst Christmas for 10 years last month as shops were hit by Brexit worries and a dramatic fall in consumer confidence. Total sales growth dropped to zero in December for the first time since 2008, with all areas of the high street hit by a fall in sales except food, which benefited from intense competition among the major supermarket chains. Total like-for-like UK retail sales dropped by 0.7% in the Christmas month, compared with a rise of 0.6% in December 2017. Over the three months to December, food sales were 0.6% higher on a like-for-like basis and 1.8% on a total basis. However, even this increase was modest compared with the average trend for annual food sales growth, which is nearer 3%. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the slump brought to an end a difficult year in which there were thousands of shop closures and tens of thousands of job losses across the industry. Earlier in 2018 there were hopes that rising incomes and falling inflation would boost household disposable incomes and encourage an increase in spending, especially on big ticket items such as furniture. However, while wage growth has pushed up to 3% and inflation has fallen, the economy has slowed and consumers have continued to keep their wallets and purses shut. Consumers have seen their incomes squeezed by rising petrol and utilities prices in recent months while households on lower incomes, who tend to spend a higher proportion of their wages on goods in shops, have missed out on the better pay rises. A string of warnings from large employers in the car industry and across the commercial sector as the economy slowed during 2018 have also spooked shoppers and sent figures for consumer confidence plummeting. Barclaycard said growth in sales of essentials dipped to its lowest level since 2016, while clothing had a third consecutive month of falling sales. The BRC warned that already struggling high streets were likely to be blighted by further shop closures during 2019 as rising costs, including increases in business rates, forced more owners into bankruptcy. Helen Dickinson, the lobby group\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe worst December sales performance in 10 years means a challenging start to 2019 for retailers, with business rates set to rise once again this year and the threat of a no-deal Brexit looming ever larger. \u201cThe retail landscape is changing dramatically in the UK, while the trading environment remains tough. \u201cRetailers are facing up this challenge but are having to wrestle with mounting costs from a succession of government policies \u2013 from the apprenticeship levy, to higher wage costs, to rising business rates.\u201d Dickinson complained that retailers pay 10% of business taxes and 25% of business rates while only making up 5% of the economy. Online sales growth declined along with bricks and mortar sales but at a slower rate. It meant that the slice of sales going to online retailers edged above 31% \u2013 increasing from 29.1% of total sales in December 2017 to 31.2% last month. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at the survey compilers KPMG, said retailers had slashed prices to attract shoppers but had seen only modest returns for their efforts. Without an improvement in sales margins over the coming months, shopowners will need to consider cutting outlets and staff, he said. Jon Woolven, the strategy and innovation director at the analysts IGD, said that despite the challenges elsewhere in the retail sector, food and grocery sales enjoyed a boost in December, with an increase in sales on the previous year broadly in line with inflation. \u201cThe desire to indulge over Christmas prevailed once more and seven in 10 shoppers said they spent extra on higher quality food last month,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, that mood appears fragile, with only 20% of shoppers expecting to be better off financially over the next 12 months \u2013 the lowest level of confidence by this measure since June 2017.\u201d",

The National Audit Office has examined the financial statements from nearly 937 local health authorities, councils, police and local fire bodies which are responsible for about \u00a3154bn of net revenue spending every year. Auditors conclude in a report published on Wednesday that the number of local bodies with significant weaknesses increased from 170 (18%) in 2015-16 to 208 (22%) in 2017-18. It follows the publication of an International Monetary Fund report in October which found that the UK\u2019s public finances were among the weakest in the world after the 2008 financial crash. Sir Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said he was shocked by the persistent high level of qualified audit reports at local public bodies. \u201cA qualification is a judgment that something is seriously wrong, but despite these continued warnings, the number of bodies receiving qualifications is trending upwards,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us hear no cries of: \u2018Where were the auditors?\u2019 when things go wrong.

The agenda applies to developed and developing countries alike. MPs say the government is failing to meet its international commitments.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.thewi.org.uk/\">National Federation of Women\u2019s Institutes</a> (NFWI) has added its voice to the call for government action to tackle food insecurity. A survey of more than 4,000 women\u2019s institute volunteers said more than two-thirds had donated to food banks and community food aid projects in the past month.</p> <p>Ann Jones, the vice-chair of the NFWI and chair of its public affairs committee, said: \u201cHistorically, the WI was at the frontline of supplying food to a country ravaged by war; but today it is clear that WI members are battling to tackle food insecurity on a very different front \u2013 via donations to food banks and soup kitchens.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/24/food-banks-fear-winter-crisis-universal-credit-rolled-out\">Food poverty is a very real issue</a>, and we have found from our survey that WI members are taking the initiative and donating to food banks and other organisations in their communities. Whilst it is heartening to see the public stepping in like this, this is really just a sticking plaster and there is only so much that can be expected from civil society.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>\u201cHousehold incomes have never been higher and the number of children living in workless households is at a record low, but we know there\u2019s more to do to ensure that every family has access to nutritious, healthy food.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/16/child-poverty-in-uk-at-highest-level-since-2010-official-figures-show\">Child Poverty Action Group\u2019s</a> chief executive, Alison Garnham, said: \u201cWe already have a minister responsible for our social security system which, on any basic understanding of its role, is meant to prevent poverty, destitution and hunger in this country. That we should need reminding of the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals in such a rich country is a scandalous development.\u201d</p> <p>Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cThe EAC is right to state the urgency of a comprehensive national response to household food insecurity in the UK. We need an approach that considers the shared causes and consequences of food insecurity, hunger, malnutrition and obesity.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "MPs are urging the government to appoint a minister for hunger in the UK to tackle the growing problem of food insecurity, which is affecting one in five children. The Commons environmental audit committee has accused the government of \u201cturning a blind eye\u201d to hunger and criticised ministers for treating hunger as an \u201coverseas\u201d issue, despite evidence that the UK has among the worst levels of food insecurity in Europe. The committee heard evidence that more than 2 million people in the UK were food insecure \u2013 meaning they struggled to eat regularly and healthily \u2013 with an estimated 19% of all under-15\u2019s living with moderately or severely food insecure adults. Nearly 2 million people in the UK may be undernourished, including up to a third of people admitted to hospital, up to 42% admitted to care homes and a fifth of those received into mental health units, the committee says. It calls on the government to appoint a minister with accountability for tackling hunger in the UK. \u201cDespite the need for joined-up cross-government action, hunger and food insecurity has fallen between the cracks in government plans,\u201d it says. \u201cWe are concerned at the government\u2019s turning a blind eye to UK hunger and its lack of progress in measuring and acting upon hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in the UK.\u201d Benefit delays and sanctions related to universal credit are highlighted by the committee as key drivers of hunger alongside cuts to social care. Food bank use has increased by 52% in areas where universal credit has been rolled out for longer than 12 months, its report says. The report cites a defence of universal credit by the junior work and pensions minister Justin Tomlinson, who says the new benefit offers \u201cpersonalised, tailored support, helping get the money to the most vulnerable people in society, which then leads into tackling the issue of food insecurity\u201d. The report is withering in its response: \u201cWe find the minister\u2019s optimism about the universal credit system to be misguided and ill-judged.\u201d The UK is a signatory to the UN Sustainable Development Goals agenda, adopted in 2015, which aims to end hunger and ensure access to safe and nutritious food. The agenda applies to developed and developing countries alike. MPs say the government is failing to meet its international commitments. Meanwhile, the National Federation of Women\u2019s Institutes (NFWI) has added its voice to the call for government action to tackle food insecurity. A survey of more than 4,000 women\u2019s institute volunteers said more than two-thirds had donated to food banks and community food aid projects in the past month. Ann Jones, the vice-chair of the NFWI and chair of its public affairs committee, said: \u201cHistorically, the WI was at the frontline of supplying food to a country ravaged by war; but today it is clear that WI members are battling to tackle food insecurity on a very different front \u2013 via donations to food banks and soup kitchens. \u201cFood poverty is a very real issue, and we have found from our survey that WI members are taking the initiative and donating to food banks and other organisations in their communities. Whilst it is heartening to see the public stepping in like this, this is really just a sticking plaster and there is only so much that can be expected from civil society.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cHousehold incomes have never been higher and the number of children living in workless households is at a record low, but we know there\u2019s more to do to ensure that every family has access to nutritious, healthy food.\u201d Child Poverty Action Group\u2019s chief executive, Alison Garnham, said: \u201cWe already have a minister responsible for our social security system which, on any basic understanding of its role, is meant to prevent poverty, destitution and hunger in this country. That we should need reminding of the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals in such a rich country is a scandalous development.\u201d Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cThe EAC is right to state the urgency of a comprehensive national response to household food insecurity in the UK. We need an approach that considers the shared causes and consequences of food insecurity, hunger, malnutrition and obesity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A radical proposal by the former education minister Andrew Adonis for a new breed of Oxbridge colleges designed to improve access for under-represented students has been greeted with little enthusiasm by the two universities. Under the plan Oxford and Cambridge universities could speed up their efforts to widen participation by opening new colleges focusing exclusively on \u201caccess with excellence\u201d, according to Adonis, the man credited as being the architect of Tony Blair\u2019s education reforms. His scheme, outlined in an article published in the Guardian, would see the colleges recruit undergraduates from what he called the \u201cmissing 3,000\u201d UK schools that supply few or no successful Oxbridge applicants. But the two universities said they would prefer to concentrate on their existing long-term efforts to widen participation, which they argued have been an unheralded success in improving the numbers of state school and ethnic minority students enrolling. Adonis likened the new colleges to those created for women in the 19th century, including Somerville College, Oxford, and Girton College, Cambridge, and halls for religious dissenters outside the Church of England, such as Mansfield College, Oxford. \u201cThese colleges would significantly increase the number of places available for students from schools and families without an Oxbridge tradition. Over time, they might also transform the culture of the two universities,\u201d Adonis said. \u201cOxbridge vice-chancellors and admissions tutors prattle on about \u2018widening access\u2019. But it doesn\u2019t happen, beyond a marginal shift over decades, driven by the constant focus on statistics on the overall private and state school share of places, which favours teenagers from the remaining 160 state grammar schools and the most successful state schools.\u201d But senior figures at both universities fear that creating colleges with a remit to improve access could provoke accusations of \u201cghettoisation\u201d and social division. Prof Martin Williams, Oxford\u2019s pro-vice-chancellor for education, said: \u201cWe know that our undergraduates value the chance to mix with and learn from fellow students of all backgrounds, including our international students. \u201cOxford colleges were once segregated on the basis of gender and we don\u2019t want to create new divisions on any grounds. We share Lord Adonis\u2019s aspiration to ensure the opportunities of an Oxford education are open to all talented students but his plan does not offer the across-the-board change we are looking for.\u201d The university has taken radical steps in recent years, including the launch of a foundation year for talented but disadvantaged young people at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, led by the former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, while a further group of colleges are looking at starting a joint foundation year programme. Prof Williams said Oxford worked \u201cincredibly hard\u201d in its access efforts, contacting and visiting more than 3,000 schools across the UK each year. \u201cWe know this works \u2013 we have just made our highest-ever level of offers to state school students, at 63% of the total. Since 2013 we have also seen a rise of nearly 4% in offers to the two most socially disadvantaged groups in the UK,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat said, we know we have more work to do. We are actively developing new policies to deliver step-change in the students who consider and successfully apply for an Oxford education.\u201d A spokesperson for Cambridge said the university was aiming to raise \u00a3500m to fund additional access and outreach work, which would see it spend far more than any other UK university. \u201cCambridge is making consistent progress in reaching students from under-represented groups. In the 2017 intake, we admitted more state school pupils than ever previously recorded,\u201d the university said. \u201cWe know we can do better still but we cannot do it in isolation. As a country, we must focus on raising ambitions and attainment levels in schools and on changing perceptions among parents and teachers.\u201d In a similar proposal, a paper published by the Higher Education Policy Institute called for grammar schools in England to be allowed to expand into areas of disadvantage to boost the numbers of pupils from those areas entering Oxbridge and similar universities. \u201cCompared to other countries, we have a hyper-selective university system. Given so many people benefit from attending a grammar school, it seems what works for universities may also sometimes work for schools,\u201d said Nick Hillman, HEPI\u2019s director. But the paper\u2019s analysis was criticised as naive and misleading by academics who have studied education and social mobility. \u201cAs the vast majority of disadvantaged children do not attend the grammar schools, the negative impact is likely to dominate any positive impact for those that do such that overall social mobility it harmed by grammar schools,\u201d said Lindsey Macmillan of UCL and Matt Dickson of the University of Bath.",
