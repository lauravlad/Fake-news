      "body": "<p>The outcome of the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s membership of the European Union remains provisional. Brexit is coming about not because government or MPs want it but because the people chose it and are said still to want it. What they chose and what they are now offered is less clear than ever. May\u2019s local council, mayoral and European elections offer a window for politicians to re-engage the population about Brexit, listening to their concerns and priorities.</p> <p>Depressingly, neither the governing party nor the official opposition has grasped the opportunity. Brexit was supposed to force Westminster to venture out of its bubble and rediscover the rest of the country. Yet the political class is more navel-gazing than ever. This is bad for democracy on many levels. Mainstream politicians have to hear what people are saying; they need to test \u2013 and if necessary reshape \u2013 their arguments; they must balance the people\u2019s wishes with the security of the nation. Instead, the Labour party is split over Brexit and has its work cut out <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48099901\" title=\"\">covering</a> the ever-widening cracks in its fragile coalition. The Conservatives\u2019 poll numbers are in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/28/tories-should-expect-to-lose-800-seats-in-local-elections-says-analyst\" title=\"\">freefall</a>; they have resigned themselves to devastating losses in the local elections and are running scared at the thought of European elections. So low are expectations for the Liberal Democrats that the party\u2019s leader <a href=\"https://www.markpack.org.uk/157939/vince-cable-announces-he-will-stand-down-as-party-leader-after-the-may-elections/\" title=\"\">announced</a> his departure before the vote.</p> <p>MPs have been unable to craft a deal, and yet there is only limited engagement with both Brexit\u2019s defenders and its detractors. It is voters who could decide to put an end to the process, to speed it up or reverse the 2016 decision. It has only been a month since hundreds of thousands marched through London in support of a second referendum and six million signatures were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/31/article-50-petition-to-cancel-brexit-passes-6m-signatures\" title=\"\">amassed</a> on an online petition to revoke the UK\u2019s withdrawal notification. Unless there is compromise, the options look like narrowing to a no-deal Brexit, a parliamentary revocation of article 50 or another vote.

      "bodyText": "The outcome of the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s membership of the European Union remains provisional. Brexit is coming about not because government or MPs want it but because the people chose it and are said still to want it. What they chose and what they are now offered is less clear than ever. May\u2019s local council, mayoral and European elections offer a window for politicians to re-engage the population about Brexit, listening to their concerns and priorities. Depressingly, neither the governing party nor the official opposition has grasped the opportunity. Brexit was supposed to force Westminster to venture out of its bubble and rediscover the rest of the country. Yet the political class is more navel-gazing than ever. This is bad for democracy on many levels. Mainstream politicians have to hear what people are saying; they need to test \u2013 and if necessary reshape \u2013 their arguments; they must balance the people\u2019s wishes with the security of the nation. Instead, the Labour party is split over Brexit and has its work cut out covering the ever-widening cracks in its fragile coalition. The Conservatives\u2019 poll numbers are in freefall; they have resigned themselves to devastating losses in the local elections and are running scared at the thought of European elections. So low are expectations for the Liberal Democrats that the party\u2019s leader announced his departure before the vote. MPs have been unable to craft a deal, and yet there is only limited engagement with both Brexit\u2019s defenders and its detractors. It is voters who could decide to put an end to the process, to speed it up or reverse the 2016 decision. It has only been a month since hundreds of thousands marched through London in support of a second referendum and six million signatures were amassed on an online petition to revoke the UK\u2019s withdrawal notification. Unless there is compromise, the options look like narrowing to a no-deal Brexit, a parliamentary revocation of article 50 or another vote. This is a dangerous moment in which arch-nationalist politics can flourish. The absence of debate creates the conditions for rightwing populists, and for their racism and authoritarianism. Nigel Farage absurdly poses as the champion of democracy, arguing that his new Brexit party is listening while the establishment does not. Mr Farage is, worryingly, topping some opinion polls . Even worse lurks in the local elections, where the narrative of betrayal sees voters drifting back to the UK Independence party, which now retails hate speech alongside batty ideas about the purifying effect of a clean Brexit.

Instead, amid indifference and confusion, politicians have dodged the problem of Brexit. They ought to instead re-engage in these polls, by first organising the millions of EU citizens who have most to lose from Brexit and need to be registered to vote in a week\u2019s time for European elections.

      "bodyText": "\u201cLet\u2019s have a big shout out for the man in the fifth row who has come all the way from Barrow,\u201d said Anna Soubry excitedly, as she and Chris Leslie took the stage. A few people whooped politely. \u201cHas anyone come further than Barrow?\u201d Silence. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got the juices flowing, I want you all to have a fantastic event when it gets under way. We\u2019ve got some great speeches coming up.\u201d Leslie merely looked a bit awkward. \u201cI just want to say how wonderful Anna is,\u201d he said eventually. Having worked the crowd into if not a frenzy, then at least the faintest signs of life, Soubry and Leslie quickly legged it. Change UK, aka the Tiggers, certainly like to do things differently. Not every political party chooses to send out two of its MPs disguised as warmup acts for a daytime TV chat show. And not every political party would describe a gathering of 150 activists in an overheated room of Church House in Westminster as a major national rally. But anything to break the mould. Ten minutes later, Soubry, along with a selection of Change UK MPs and MEP candidates, reappeared and the event proper started. Chuka Umunna declared he was overwhelmed that the party had already received 15,000 donations. Though as a recent opinion poll has revealed that only 38% of voters know that Change UK wants to remain in the EU, it is possible some donors will be asking for their money back once they realise how it is being spent. Umunna went on to announce that Change UK was now in third place, ahead of the Tories, in London. He somehow forgot that the Brexit party was in second place. Inconvenient truths and all that. The only way to make sure that Labour eventually supported a people\u2019s vote, he continued, was by voting for Change UK. If enough people were to back the Tiggers, then Labour would be forced to come off the fence. After that, the rally morphed into a very polite episode of The Apprentice, with every contestant given five minutes to make their pitch. The interim leader, Heidi Allen, reclaimed patriotism for remainers, the former Polish deputy prime minister Jan Rostowski catalogued the leavers\u2019 lies and Jessica Simor QC pleaded on behalf of the young.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/apr/30/brexit-latest-news-labour-nec-tory-mps-wont-accept-cross-party-compromise-involving-customs-union-says-hunt-live-news?page=with:block-5cc82cb18f08c89bd906b18c#block-5cc82cb18f08c89bd906b18c\"> 2.18pm </a>for a full analysis.) Twice the party ordered its MPs to vote for a motion saying any Brexit deal passed this parliament should be subject to a confirmatory vote (although at the time it also said it did not fully agree with this position). And on 27 February, after Labour\u2019s plan was defeated in the Commons, Corbyn released a statement saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will back a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no deal outcome.</p> <p>We will also continue to push for the other available options to prevent those outcomes, including a close economic relationship based on our credible alternative plan or a general election.</p> </blockquote> <p>This implies the party would definitely support a second referendum in the event of no-deal or a \u201cdamaging Tory Brexit\u201d. Backing the \u201coption of a public vote\u201d makes this more conditional because if this is just an option, there is no absolute commitment to implementing it.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Labour says it is party for people who both supported leave and remain.</strong></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-30T16:53:59.489Z\">at 5.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cc86ac68f08c89bd906b4f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-30T15:34:54.040Z\">4.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Commons has risen for the day.

It is not unusual for political parties to resort to fudge when articulating policy so as to ensure that, on issues where opinion is divided, people can unite behind a compromise. A compromise does not have to be a fudge, but it does get fudgy if it involves key issues being left unresolved.</p> <p>An extreme version of this is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_ambiguity\">\u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d</a> (a term used by the Blairites to describe some of the ploys required during the Northern Ireland peace process, but a phrase originally attributed to Henry Kissinger). Labour\u2019s second referendum policy has, at times, been a textbook example of this, although more recently it has started to shift down the ambiguity/clarity axis towards something more specific.</p> <p>Here are the key three phases the policy has been through.</p> <p><strong><em>1) From the referendum until the 2017 election and beyond: Accepting the result</em></strong></p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn made it clear as soon as the referendum result was announced that Labour would accept it (which is partly why he made the much-criticised comment the morning after calling for article 50 to be triggered) and this was the party\u2019s position in <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/labour-manifesto-2017.pdf\">its 2017 manifesto (pdf).</a> \u201cLabour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first,\u201d the manifesto said. The only vague nudge in the direction of a second referendum was a call for parliament to get \u201ca truly meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal\u201d. </p> <p><strong><em>2) Labour conference 2018: \u201cAll options on the table, including a public vote\u201d</em></strong></p> <p>At the Labour conference in Liverpool the party overwhelmingly backed a long composite motion on Brexit agreed at an evening meeting where delegates representing different factions from the party contested the text for hours. The full motion is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/24/labour-conference-liverpool-brexit-no-deal-papers-cbi-claims-investment-would-flee-country-under-labours-plan-to-make-firms-give-shares-to-workers-politics-live?page=with:block-5ba8c183e4b0a9b970678761#block-5ba8c183e4b0a9b970678761\">here</a>, but this is the key paragraph.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote. If the government is confident in negotiating a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.</p> </blockquote> <p>For supporters of a second referendum, this was an important advance; Labour was now accepting a public vote (ie, a referendum) as an option.</p> <p>But for opponents of a second referendum, nothing of substance had been conceded. The motion did not even mention a referendum (at one point \u201cpublic vote\u201d was taken in this debate to include a possible general election, although in the context of the motion it means referendum, because it refers to what might happen if a general election does not happen). And keeping \u201call options on the table\u201d effectively means not having any actual policy at all - although the phrase had the advantage of sounding plausible when deployed in interviews.</p> <p>The full extent of the ambiguity in play became apparent at the conference when different Labour figures gave different versions of what a \u201cpublic vote\u201d might involve. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, received wild applause during his speech when he ad-libbed a line not cleared by Corbyn\u2019s office saying: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/25/labour-conference-brexit-debate-starmer-increasingly-likely-to-vote-down-mays-brexit-deal-starmer-says-politics-live?page=with:block-5baa2770e4b0a9b9706792e0#block-5baa2770e4b0a9b9706792e0\">\u201cNobody is ruling out remain as an option.\u201d</a></p> <p>But that was not true. Two days earlier Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, said that if there were to be a second referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/23/labour-conference-liverpool-jeremy-corbyn-say-he-will-accept-any-labour-conference-decision-on-second-brexit-referendum-politics-live?page=with:block-5ba76ebce4b0a71b5946aff8#block-5ba76ebce4b0a71b5946aff8\">remain should not be an option. </a>After conference some Corbynites occasionally argued that this would be a plausible reading of the \u201cpublic vote\u201d pledge, but the Starmer interpretation was more widely accepted.</p> <p><strong><em>3) Early 2019: Qualified support for second referendum</em></strong><br></p> <p>Since January there have been more than a dozen Commons votes on either Theresa May\u2019s deal, or on motions relating to the Brexit process. As these debates have progressed, Labour has firmed up its support for a second referendum, although with considerable qualifications.</p> <p>Broadly the party has arrived at a position where it backs a second referendum, but only to avoid a \u201cdamaging\u201d Tory Brexit or no-deal, although sometimes it has voted for motions that go beyond this.</p> <p>The first big shift came on 29 January when Labour tabled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/29/brexit-vote-commons-latest-news-developments-liam-fox-says-may-now-saying-withdrawal-deal-text-must-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with:block-5c50a432e4b084eaaff7fb09#block-5c50a432e4b084eaaff7fb09\">a motion </a>saying the government should allow MPs to vote on Brexit options, and that those options should include \u201clegislating to hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition that has commanded the support of the majority of the House of Commons.\u201d The party did not specifically say it would support such a public vote, although this was implied.</p> <p>A further shift came in February when the party said, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/25/labour-to-back-moves-for-second-brexit-referendum\">if MPs voted down Labour\u2019s Brexit plan, the party would default to backing a second referendum.</a> On 27 February<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/27/brexit-debate-latest-news-developments-pmqs-chair-jacob-rees-mogg-drops-his-calls-for-wholesale-removal-of-backstop-politics-live?page=with:block-5c76e242e4b02ea1bd8e54ff#block-5c76e242e4b02ea1bd8e54ff\"> Labour\u2019s plan was rejected by MPs</a>, and Corbyn then responded by saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will back a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no deal outcome.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, at the end of March, came the first of two indicative votes debates that saw MPs voting on motions tabled by Dame Margaret Beckett and Peter Kyle saying any Brexit deal passed during this parliament should be subject to a confirmatory referendum. The motions were identical, and they said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That this House will not allow in this parliament the implementation and ratification of any withdrawal agreement and any framework for the future relationship unless and until they have been approved by the people of the United Kingdom in a confirmatory public vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>Labour whipped its MPs to support them both. But, before the first vote, Corbyn sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/27/brexit-latest-news-live-debate-indicative-votes--to-vote-on-alternative-votes-as-speculation-mounts-may-could-announce-plans-to-quit-live-news?page=with:block-5c9bafcce4b08334583631af#block-5c9bafcce4b08334583631af\">a letter to MPs</a> saying the party was supporting the motion even though it did not fully support it. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our conference agreed that if we cannot get a general election we would support all options remaining on the table, including a public vote. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> is supporting the Beckett-Kyle-Wilson amendment (even where it can be read as going beyond our policy) to keep the option of a public vote on the table in order to stop a disastrous no deal or May\u2019s unacceptable deal.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s priority is to deliver our credible Brexit plan which respects our commitment to accept the result of the referendum. Today we are are supporting all options that enable us to prevent a damaging Tory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> or no-deal being forced on the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>Today\u2019s NEC meeting is expected to agree a new version of this.</p> <p>But, as Tom Watson\u2019s intervention earlier made clear, Corbyn is under pressure to expand the commitment. The main demand is for the party to commit to putting any Brexit deal to a referendum, not just a \u201cdamaging\u201d Tory one, or no-deal. But implicit in this is also a demand for the party to agree that, even after a general election, it would remain committed to a second referendum. The Beckett/Kyle amendment just covers \u201cthis parliament\u201d, ie before a general election.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-30T13:26:47.001Z\">at 2.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cc83d488f08c89bd906b297\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-30T12:28:25.162Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Extinction Rebellion says Labour needs to be more ambitious in its climate change policy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Extinction Rebellion</strong> has released a statement following its meeting with John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, this morning.

He has also committed to presentations from us to the shadow environment committee and the shadow Treasury team.</p> <p>However, John McDonnell did not commit to changing the proposed date in the Labour party motion which currently aims to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, although he said will consider a new target of 2030. We also raised this with Jeremy Corbyn ahead of the debate tomorrow in the House of Commons.</p> <p>We\u2019re glad that John McDonnell listened to the urgency of our demands but we need our politicians to be more ambitious. Our children\u2019s future is on the line. The international rebellion will continue until politicians prove they are willing to act on all three of our demands.</p> <p>We wait to see if the Labour party will act with the courage and determination needed in this moment.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b3694632d36f33e12901dc63ee29d5025651009\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b3694632d36f33e12901dc63ee29d5025651009/0_224_4764_2859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Savannah Lovelock, from Extinction Rebellion, poses with shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman after their meeting at the Houses of Parliament this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Savannah Lovelock, from Extinction Rebellion, poses with shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman after their meeting at the Houses of Parliament this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Dray/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cc839c68f085bb0e0deb2ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-30T12:07:38.396Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Conservatives are heading for fourth place in the European elections in London, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tories-slump-to-fourth-place-behind-labour-nigel-farage-and-change-uk-in-new-euro-elections-poll-a4130211.html\">a poll for the Evening Standard suggests.</a> In their story <strong>J</strong><strong>oe Murphy </strong>and <strong>Nicholas Cecil </strong>report:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A shock YouGov poll found <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/theresa-may-1\">Theresa May</a>\u2019s party limping on just 11% in the capital \u2014 half of the 22% share they enjoyed in 2014 when they came a respectable second.</p> <p>Embarrassingly, they are six points behind Change UK, which is on 17% despite only being launched as a party a few weeks ago.

I don\u2019t think it would settle it to have another referendum ...</p> <p>Or do we resolve this by delivering Brexit, and then bringing the country together by showing the 48% who voted remain that this is not the Brexit of their worst nightmares, this is actually a Brexit where we don\u2019t pull up the drawbridge, pull down the shutters, say \u2018Foreigners not welcome\u2019, this is a positive, outward-looking, optimistic Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hunt said he thought a deal would be passed in the end because only a \u201cvery small number of MPs\u201d actually wanted to reverse Brexit.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Conservatives should pass a Brexit deal before electing a new leader. </strong>Hunt, of course, is one of the leading candidates to succeed May.

What it would do is create delay in the process and mean that we will have another period of time through which we have Brexit paralysis.</p> <p>So I think much the best outcome is to try and find a way to resolve this so that we can leave, leave cleanly and leave quickly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is Sky\u2019s <strong>Lewis Goodall</strong>\u2019s take on the interview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1123125479844786176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">With the best will in the world, Jeremy Hunt, like the rest of the government, clearly hasn\u2019t got a clue how the withdrawal agreement can be passed. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/R4Today?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#R4Today</a></p>&mdash; Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1123125479844786176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1123128591699578881\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Humphrys asks Hunt what changes would obtain enough Labour votes to secure the WA (and be enough to compensate for lost Tories).<br><br>Hunt replies a cust union would lose too many Tories.<br><br>Humphrys asks what might work.<br><br>\u201cA different deal\u201d Hunt says.<br><br>There is *no* plan.</p>&mdash; Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1123128591699578881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9.30am: </em>Theresa May chairs cabinet.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> The Commons home affairs committee takes evidence on serious violence from the chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, Mark Burns-Williamson, the former government troubled families adviser Dame Louise Casey, and the children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield. </p> <p><em>10.30am: </em>The Social Mobility Commission publishes its annual state of the nation report.</p> <p><em>11am: </em>Labour\u2019s national executive committee meets to decide the party\u2019s manifesto pledge for the European elections on a second referendum. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/29/brexit-labour-urged-to-resolve-second-referendum-crisis\">As my colleagues <strong>Jessica Elgot </strong>and <strong>Rajeev Syal</strong> report, </a>it is likely to agree a compromise option where it would support a referendum in order to prevent Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> deal or leaving without a deal, describing that wording as \u201cthe path of least resistance\u201d.</p> <p><em>11.30am: </em>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives a speech to GPs and digital leaders.</p> <p><em>11.30am: </em>Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is meeting activists from Extinction Rebellion.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee has agreed that its manifesto for the European elections will back a second Brexit referendum \u2013 but only in specific circumstances. Theresa May has set a one-week deadline for cross-party Brexit talks to make progress or be brought \u201ctowards a conclusion\u201d, with a crunch meeting likely to be scheduled with key players early next week. Donald Trump is unlikely to address parliament when he visits the UK next month over fears that the Commons Speaker\u2019s opposition to the idea could cause an embarrassing row. A fresh row has broken out over Labour\u2019s complaints process after Anas Sarwar, a former Scottish deputy leader, claimed he was barred from speaking about alleged Islamophobia against him. Change UK has called on Labour supporters to \u201clend us your vote\u201d in order to put pressure on the Labour leadership to fully support a second Brexit referendum. Extinction Rebellion activists have met leading politicians including the environment secretary, Michael Gove, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, in an attempt to persuade the UK government to declare a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d. After the meeting with Gove, Clare Farrell, one of the XR activists who attended, released a statement saying: It was less shit than I thought it would be, but only mildly. I was surprised to hear a radical reflection on our economic paradigm from Michael Gove when he talked about how our model is extractive and destructive - and that we need to move to a circular model. And that similarly a debt based economy doesn\u2019t do right by young people, that it is creating a huge debt for them and that it has to change. Unfortunately what failed to emerge was an actual way forward. I\u2019d like to remind him that we have a 1 percent chance of hitting 1.5 degrees - that urgency wasn\u2019t in the room. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Change UK has also criticised Labour\u2019s stance. This is from its foreign affairs spokesman, the former Labour MP Mike Gapes. Whatever contortions or forms of words Labour may come up with today, it is clear that large, influential parts of the leadership will not oppose Brexit. Every single one of our 70 Change UK candidates supports a people\u2019s vote. Every single one of our Change UK candidates are enthusiastic supporters of the UK remaining in the EU. It\u2019s time to change our country and end the divisions and damage of this Brexit disaster. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has released a statement from the Labour MP Bridget Phillipson, one of its supporters, describing the Labour NEC decision as \u201cthe bare minimum\u201d required. She explained: Today Labour has done the bare minimum needed and I can only hope it will be enough to secure the support of all those millions of our voters demanding the final say on Brexit. There is no deal on the table other than the one negotiated by the government and there is no majority for it in parliament without a confirmatory referendum to show there is a majority for it the country too. The decision of the NEC today reaffirms conference policy and means Labour will have little choice except to back a new public vote on the most likely outcome of this vexed process. That\u2019s because more and more of us are recognising it would be unfair to force this deal on the British people now that we know so much more about Brexit. But the manifesto\u2019s mealy-mouthed wording still maintains the fiction that there is a deal out there that can satisfy all the promises made three years ago, avoid real costs to jobs and living standards, or end the endless crisis around Brexit. This means Labour risks demoralising activists, depressing turnout among supporters and decreasing the share of the vote for candidates who - like the overwhelming majority of our party - are fighting for a people\u2019s vote on any Brexit deal. Sarah Boyack, the former Scottish government minister, is to return to Holyrood to take up the seat left vacant after Kezia Dugdale resigned on Monday. Currently head of public affairs at the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and a Labour moderate, Boyack had previously been a transport minister who introduced free bus travel for the over 60s. She lost her seat at the 2016 Holyrood elections, after 17 years as an MSP. Under the Scottish parliament\u2019s additional member system, she inherits Dugdale\u2019s seat as the next available Labour candidate on the Lothian region list; her return helps Labour maintain its high gender balance at Holyrood. Boyack said she had enjoyed her two year stint at the SFHA but, in a reference to her long-standing involvement in environment campaigning in the labour movement, said: However, there is unfinished business for me. In the last three years the case for concerted action on climate change and the need to redouble our efforts to tackle poverty has accelerated. In Edinburgh, the affordable, accessible housing people need has become harder and harder to secure. And then there\u2019s the uncertainty and division caused by Brexit. The next potential candidate for Dugdale\u2019s vacant seat was Lesley Hinds, a veteran Labour councillor in Edinburgh who retired at the last local government election And Mary Honeyball, who is standing down as a Labour MEP, thinks the NEC position does not go far enough. But Gloria De Piero, one of the Labour MPs who is sceptical about a second referendum, and insistent on the importance of the referendum result being honoured, has also welcomed the NEC\u2019s decision. Rather than quibbling, pro-European Labour MPs who support a second referendum have welcomed the party\u2019s decision today. Even though Wes Streeting and Meg Hillier say Labour is the party for remain, the party\u2019s actual statement says Labour \u201crepresents both people who supported leave and remain\u201d. (See 5pm.) This is from Adam Price, leader of Plaid Cymru. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, claims the Labour statement (see 5pm) shows Labour is a pro-Brexit party. This is from Ben Bradshaw, the Labour former cabinet minister and one of the party\u2019s leading pro-Europeans. He thinks the party will end up having to back a second referendum because the alternatives will fall away. Labour\u2019s national executive committee has agreed what the party will say about a second referendum in its manifesto for the European elections. A party spokesperson said: Labour\u2019s European elections manifesto was agreed at the NEC today and it will be published soon. Labour is the only party which represents both people who supported leave and remain. We are working to bring the country together after the chaos and crisis created by the Tories. The NEC meeting was described as respectful, constructive and comradely. Afterwards a source said: The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour\u2019s existing policy; to support Labour\u2019s alternative plan, and if we can\u2019t get the necessary changes to the government\u2019s deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote. And here is what this means. Labour pro-Europeans, led by the deputy leader Tom Watson, have failed in their bid to get the party to firm up its commitment to a second referendum on Brexit. The party\u2019s national executive committee has rejected a call for the party to commit to putting any Brexit deal to a second referendum. Labour has largely reaffirmed the policy agreed at last year\u2019s conference, saying that it is committed to \u201cthe option of a public vote\u201d if it cannot pass its own Brexit deal, or trigger a general election. But, arguably, this represents a retreat from positions the party has adopted earlier this year. (See 2.18pm for a full analysis.) Twice the party ordered its MPs to vote for a motion saying any Brexit deal passed this parliament should be subject to a confirmatory vote (although at the time it also said it did not fully agree with this position). And on 27 February, after Labour\u2019s plan was defeated in the Commons, Corbyn released a statement saying: We will back a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no deal outcome. We will also continue to push for the other available options to prevent those outcomes, including a close economic relationship based on our credible alternative plan or a general election. This implies the party would definitely support a second referendum in the event of no-deal or a \u201cdamaging Tory Brexit\u201d. Backing the \u201coption of a public vote\u201d makes this more conditional because if this is just an option, there is no absolute commitment to implementing it. Labour says it is party for people who both supported leave and remain. The Commons has risen for the day. These are from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. And this is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. This is from ITV\u2019s Shehab Khan. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP and chair of the European Research Group, which is pushing for a harder Brexit, has issued a statement saying the ERG has cancelled its regular meeting tonight so that ERG members can do local elections campaigning instead. He said: It would be grossly unfair for local Conservative councillors, who are doing a good job the length and breadth of the country, to suffer because of the national party\u2019s reputation. I am therefore urging all the ERG\u2019s supporters to canvass on behalf of Conservative councillors. Talking to ourselves, indeed, talking to Jeremy Corbyn should take a back seat to getting good local Conservatives elected. Effectively he is admitting that the Tories are likely to do badly on Thursday. This is from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. A police force leader has criticised middle-class drug users who are more worried about the supply line of the coffee they drink than the cocaine they use. As the Press Association reports, David Lloyd, police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Hertfordshire, flagged up the issue as he gave evidence this morning to a House of Commons inquiry on serious violence. He told the home affairs committee: One of the real issues we\u2019ve got at the moment is around use of drugs. Frankly, the middle classes who are really concerned about their fair trade coffee, and what the supply line of that is, don\u2019t seem to have the same concern around the cocaine that they take. Taking cocaine was \u201cnot victimless\u201d, Lloyd said, adding: \u201cOrganised crime groups are using violence to enforce an unlawful market.\u201d These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. This is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. There is no sign of the meeting of Labour\u2019s national executive committee winding up anytime soon, according to my colleague Heather Stewart and ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. The video games industry in the UK could be negatively impacted by post-Brexit immigration policy, it has been suggested. As the Press Association reports, the Commons culture committee travelled to Dundee, a world-leading city for games development, to evaluate what more the UK Government can do to support the industry. Concerns were raised that a proposal to introduce a \u00a330,000 salary threshold for workers from outside of the UK could make it more difficult to recruit and retain staff. Colin Anderson, Earthbound Games commercial director, told MPs that while the video games industry in the UK had been incredibly successful, it was not something it \u201cinherently deserves\u201d and was coveted by many other countries around the world. He said: I\u2019ve certainly had problems in the past with staff who were on lower salaries but performing what are integral parts of the operation. Generally, it\u2019s the people who are in the operational parts so it\u2019s the people who are running the office, it\u2019s people who are running the infrastructure around game development. Those salaries can be below those thresholds that have been set and that can certainly cause issues ... It\u2019s a political decision that has to be taken and we have to run with whatever is decided and obviously we would do that but given the choice, we would like to be able to choose from the widest talent pool, with the least friction possible, which is what we believe we have now. Attendees at Labour\u2019s national executive committee do seem to have regained access to their phones, because Tom Watson has posted a tweet, responding to a joke my colleague Heather Stewart made about this: The joke is inspired by the fact that the Mirror has illustrated its article with an old picture of Watson, taken before his remarkably successful recent diet. At the Change UK rally at lunchtime, Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP, urged Labour members to vote for his new party because that might encourage Jeremy Corbyn to endorse remain. Accusing Labour of prevarication over Brexit, he said: Don\u2019t endorse that prevarication. Vote for Change UK. Or at the very least, if you haven\u2019t made up your mind what you will do at the next general election, lend us your vote in these European elections. The better we do, the more likely you are to see the Labour leadership adopt a people\u2019s vote and remain position. But Change UK clearly did not coordinate their message very effectively because Mike Gapes, the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman and another former Labour MP, said his old party would never back remain. He explained: Jeremy Corbyn and those he has appointed around him like [strategy and communications director Seumas Milne have never wanted to stop Brexit. Corbyn whipped Labour MPs to vote for article 50, he whipped Labour MPs not to support a people\u2019s vote. Whatever contortions and forms of words they come up with today, it is clear that large, influential parts of the Labour leadership will not oppose Brexit. From my colleague Heather Stewart John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said that Jeremy Hunt\u2019s comment this morning about Tory MPs not accepting a customs union (see 9.21am) makes it harder for Labour to have confidence in the cross-party talks process. It is hard to know how much to read into this, but it is the sort of argument that you would expect one side to start making if they were looking for an excuse to wind up cross-party talks. With the Labour party due to issue a new statement about its position on Brexit and a second referendum, it is worth summarising how this policy has evolved over the last two years. This is not as straightforward as it sounds. It is not unusual for political parties to resort to fudge when articulating policy so as to ensure that, on issues where opinion is divided, people can unite behind a compromise. A compromise does not have to be a fudge, but it does get fudgy if it involves key issues being left unresolved. An extreme version of this is \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d (a term used by the Blairites to describe some of the ploys required during the Northern Ireland peace process, but a phrase originally attributed to Henry Kissinger). Labour\u2019s second referendum policy has, at times, been a textbook example of this, although more recently it has started to shift down the ambiguity/clarity axis towards something more specific. Here are the key three phases the policy has been through. 1) From the referendum until the 2017 election and beyond: Accepting the result Jeremy Corbyn made it clear as soon as the referendum result was announced that Labour would accept it (which is partly why he made the much-criticised comment the morning after calling for article 50 to be triggered) and this was the party\u2019s position in its 2017 manifesto (pdf). \u201cLabour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first,\u201d the manifesto said. The only vague nudge in the direction of a second referendum was a call for parliament to get \u201ca truly meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal\u201d. 2) Labour conference 2018: \u201cAll options on the table, including a public vote\u201d At the Labour conference in Liverpool the party overwhelmingly backed a long composite motion on Brexit agreed at an evening meeting where delegates representing different factions from the party contested the text for hours. The full motion is here, but this is the key paragraph. If we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote. If the government is confident in negotiating a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public. For supporters of a second referendum, this was an important advance; Labour was now accepting a public vote (ie, a referendum) as an option. But for opponents of a second referendum, nothing of substance had been conceded. The motion did not even mention a referendum (at one point \u201cpublic vote\u201d was taken in this debate to include a possible general election, although in the context of the motion it means referendum, because it refers to what might happen if a general election does not happen). And keeping \u201call options on the table\u201d effectively means not having any actual policy at all - although the phrase had the advantage of sounding plausible when deployed in interviews. The full extent of the ambiguity in play became apparent at the conference when different Labour figures gave different versions of what a \u201cpublic vote\u201d might involve. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, received wild applause during his speech when he ad-libbed a line not cleared by Corbyn\u2019s office saying: \u201cNobody is ruling out remain as an option.\u201d But that was not true. Two days earlier Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, said that if there were to be a second referendum, remain should not be an option. After conference some Corbynites occasionally argued that this would be a plausible reading of the \u201cpublic vote\u201d pledge, but the Starmer interpretation was more widely accepted. 3) Early 2019: Qualified support for second referendum Since January there have been more than a dozen Commons votes on either Theresa May\u2019s deal, or on motions relating to the Brexit process. As these debates have progressed, Labour has firmed up its support for a second referendum, although with considerable qualifications. Broadly the party has arrived at a position where it backs a second referendum, but only to avoid a \u201cdamaging\u201d Tory Brexit or no-deal, although sometimes it has voted for motions that go beyond this. The first big shift came on 29 January when Labour tabled a motion saying the government should allow MPs to vote on Brexit options, and that those options should include \u201clegislating to hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition that has commanded the support of the majority of the House of Commons.\u201d The party did not specifically say it would support such a public vote, although this was implied. A further shift came in February when the party said, if MPs voted down Labour\u2019s Brexit plan, the party would default to backing a second referendum. On 27 February Labour\u2019s plan was rejected by MPs, and Corbyn then responded by saying: We will back a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no deal outcome. Then, at the end of March, came the first of two indicative votes debates that saw MPs voting on motions tabled by Dame Margaret Beckett and Peter Kyle saying any Brexit deal passed during this parliament should be subject to a confirmatory referendum. The motions were identical, and they said: That this House will not allow in this parliament the implementation and ratification of any withdrawal agreement and any framework for the future relationship unless and until they have been approved by the people of the United Kingdom in a confirmatory public vote. Labour whipped its MPs to support them both. But, before the first vote, Corbyn sent a letter to MPs saying the party was supporting the motion even though it did not fully support it. He said: Our conference agreed that if we cannot get a general election we would support all options remaining on the table, including a public vote. Labour is supporting the Beckett-Kyle-Wilson amendment (even where it can be read as going beyond our policy) to keep the option of a public vote on the table in order to stop a disastrous no deal or May\u2019s unacceptable deal. Labour\u2019s priority is to deliver our credible Brexit plan which respects our commitment to accept the result of the referendum. Today we are are supporting all options that enable us to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or no-deal being forced on the country. Today\u2019s NEC meeting is expected to agree a new version of this. But, as Tom Watson\u2019s intervention earlier made clear, Corbyn is under pressure to expand the commitment. The main demand is for the party to commit to putting any Brexit deal to a referendum, not just a \u201cdamaging\u201d Tory one, or no-deal. But implicit in this is also a demand for the party to agree that, even after a general election, it would remain committed to a second referendum. The Beckett/Kyle amendment just covers \u201cthis parliament\u201d, ie before a general election. Extinction Rebellion has released a statement following its meeting with John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, this morning. Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, was also there, and the XR team also briefly met Jeremy Corbyn. Tomorrow Labour is using one of its opposition days to call for climate change to be declared a national emergency. In it statement XR said: Crucially, [the Labour politicians] acknowledged the failure of previous Labour party policies to meeting the challenges we face, and have committed to the following: John McDonnell will request that Extinction Rebellion present its case to the entire shadow cabinet on the climate and ecological emergency. He has also committed to presentations from us to the shadow environment committee and the shadow Treasury team. However, John McDonnell did not commit to changing the proposed date in the Labour party motion which currently aims to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, although he said will consider a new target of 2030. We also raised this with Jeremy Corbyn ahead of the debate tomorrow in the House of Commons. We\u2019re glad that John McDonnell listened to the urgency of our demands but we need our politicians to be more ambitious. Our children\u2019s future is on the line. The international rebellion will continue until politicians prove they are willing to act on all three of our demands. We wait to see if the Labour party will act with the courage and determination needed in this moment. The Conservatives are heading for fourth place in the European elections in London, a poll for the Evening Standard suggests. In their story Joe Murphy and Nicholas Cecil report: A shock YouGov poll found Theresa May\u2019s party limping on just 11% in the capital \u2014 half of the 22% share they enjoyed in 2014 when they came a respectable second. Embarrassingly, they are six points behind Change UK, which is on 17% despite only being launched as a party a few weeks ago. And Mr Farage\u2019s newly formed anti-EU party is further ahead on 19. A drubbing on that scale would increase the likelihood that Tories will try to oust Mrs May after the results of the election on May 23 ... Labour is in first place in London, but its 28% share is drastically down from the 36.6% they took in 2014. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman gave Downing Street\u2019s latest assessment of progress in the cross-party Brexit talks at today\u2019s morning lobby briefing. He said: Cabinet received an update on the Brexit talks with the opposition, including the negotiations last night, which were serious and constructive. Further talks will now be scheduled in order to bring the process toward a conclusion. Cabinet also discussed the need to secure safe passage for the withdrawal agreement bill, or WAB, as soon as possible, in order to deliver upon the result of the referendum. David Lidington gave an update on the talks; while the chief whip, Julian Smith, talked about the prospects for the WAB. Several members of the cabinet are known to be sceptical about the value of discussions with Labour, and government sources are now making clear that they will make a judgement by the middle of next week about whether the process is worth continuing with. Any cross-party deal would be aimed at securing a majority for the WAB. If that fails, alternatives include seeking agreement on some parliamentary process that could yield a decisive outcome - unlike the two rounds of indicative votes already held. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart, who has just come out of the Downing Street lobby briefing. Jeremy Corbyn is at the meeting of Labour\u2019s NEC. But, according to the Press Association, he did not enter the building through the main entrance where media and demonstrators had gathered, and so he was not photographed going in. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, renewed his call for the party to back a referendum on any Brexit deal as he arrived at the Labour national executive committee meeting. He said: In the last few days most of my colleagues on the NEC have been inundated with thousands of emails from Labour members who are saying that Labour voters recognise the parliamentary failure and they think that the only way to break this impasse is a people\u2019s vote on any deal that parliament can agree. We have to listen to members, we have to listen to our European parliamentary candidates who support this, but there will be a debate at the shadow cabinet and the NEC - we\u2019ll see what comes out of it. More from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh on Labour\u2019s NEC meeting. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, has denied \u201cstorming out\u201d of shadow cabinet this morning after hearing that shadow ministers would not be given the text of the party\u2019s European elections manifesto. (See 10.57am.) But he does not deny being disappointed about not seeing the document and leaving the meeting early. Labour is opposed to what it describes as a damaging Tory Brexit. But it is not opposed to Brexit in principle, and it would vote for its own version of Brexit (\u201cgood Brexit\u201d, as opposed to \u201cbad Brexit, you could call it.) Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure because many in his party are unhappy with this, and want Labour to oppose Brexit in principle. But, according to some YouGov polling out today, members of the public are much more likely to describe Labour as anti-Brexit than pro-Brexit, by a margin of three to one. The polling is quite a useful reminder that there is an enormous gulf between the way politicians and parties are perceived by those who follow it all closely (ie, you and me) and those who perhaps have better things to do with their lives. Even though at Westminster the Conservative party is seen as being under the control of hardline Brexiters, 24% of people describe it as an anti-Brexit party - and only 37% see it as pro-Brexit. These are from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. While we\u2019re on the NEC, this is from the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. And the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith has some footage of Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, arriving at the meeting - although the chanting from protestors in the background is so loud that you cannot hear what he is saying. It looks as if Labour\u2019s national executive committee will have to debate the manifesto for the European elections with Steve Bray, aka Mr Stop Brexit, bellowing outside the window, according to the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith. The Social Mobility Commission has just published its annual state of the nation report. Here is the Press Association write-up. Presumably the full report will go up on the commission\u2019s website soon, but it is not there yet. Today the IPPR thinktank is launching an environmental justice commission to investigate how the UK can transition to a zero-carbon economies. It is jointly chaired by Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, Caroline Lucas, the former Green party co-leader, and Laura Sandys, a former Conservative MP. In a statement marking the launch, Miliband said the UK needed to be put on a \u201cwar footing\u201d to address the problem of climate change. He said: We face a climate emergency. Climate change is the biggest threat to our economic and social wellbeing, and to our national security. Politics needs to be on a war footing to deal with this enemy but too often it sends the message that business as usual will do. \u201cWe need a revolution in political leadership; the problem we face is not just climate denial but climate appeasement. This commission brings together people from all walks of life, generations and political parties to bring about the solutions we need. \u201cIt is time to put economic and social justice at the heart of the environmental cause. Our work will show how we should deploy all the resources of government to deliver a Green New Deal for the UK, putting our country to work on tackling this threat. Miliband, Lucas and Sandys have also written a joint article for the Guardian about the initiative. Here is the article. And here is an extract. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of the serious consequences if global average temperatures rise by more than 1.5C. We now have only 11 years to take decisive action. We already see 1C of warming and accompanying extreme weather events, including heatwaves and droughts, while sea levels rise. Later this week, the Committee on Climate Change will publish its advice on when we need to meet net-zero emissions. It is imperative to meet our international responsibilities for implementing the Paris agreement on climate change and pursue an accelerated path to limit warming to no more than 1.5C. Doing so will require a commitment, and a plan. We need to mobilise a carbon army of workers to retrofit and insulate homes, cutting bills, reducing emissions and making people\u2019s lives better. We need to move to sustainable forms of transport and zero-carbon vehicles as quickly as possible, saving thousands of lives from air pollution. We need to end the opposition to onshore wind power and position ourselves as a global centre of excellence for renewable manufacturing. And we need to protect and restore threatened habitats, and to secure major transitions in agriculture and diets that are essential if we are to meet our obligations. Just in these areas of policy we already see an answer to the immediate economic concerns people have: jobs and hope. Green jobs must be secure and decently paid, with a central role for trade unions in a just transition for all workers and communities affected. According to IPPR, the new commission will use \u201cdeliberative democracy\u201d (ie, citizens\u2019 assembly-type initiatives) to investigate solutions. And it says the commission will focus on four issues. 1) How in practice the UK can deliver its contribution to limiting global warming and cutting emissions to net zero in an economically and socially just way. 2) Ensuring a rapid and just transition for all through what is being called a Green New Deal \u2013 a green transformation of the entire economy, creating hundreds of thousands of good quality jobs and giving people real ownership of their futures in the process. 3) It will consider the economic and social injustices associated with the issue including the disproportionate impact by, for example, gender, class and ethnicity. 4) It will also examine the UK\u2019s international responsibilities in tackling the accelerating climate crisis. Miliband was also on the Today programme this morning explaining the need for the commission. An additional 12 Labour MEP candidates have signed up to a pledge to campaign for a second Brexit referendum and to campaign for Remain if a public vote is called, the Press Association reports. They bring the total number of signatories to 34 out of the party\u2019s 70 candidates across Britain. The new signatories are: Claude Moraes MEP (London), Alvin Shum (East of England), Clare Penny-Evans (North East), Erica Lewis (North West), Claire Cozler (North West), Emma Turnball (South East), Lubna Arshad (South East), Simon Burgess (South East), Rachael Ward (South East), Eloise Todd (Yorkshire &amp; the Humber), Martin Mayer (Yorkshire &amp; the Humber) and Alison Hume (Yorkshire &amp; the Humber). Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was speaking to the Today programme from Africa, where he is currently on a five-day, five-nation tour. This is what he said about his main goal. There is a central purpose [to the visit] which is to change the motor of our relationship with African countries from one based on aid to one based on enterprise and prosperity. I\u2019m a big supporter of the 0.7% [aid] target and there are many African countries where that is desperately needed, like the DRC with its Ebola outbreak. But there are other countries, like Senegal, where I was yesterday, where the UK is about to overtake France and become the biggest international investor, Ghana, where I am today, where they have a national strategy which they call the \u201cBeyond aid\u201d strategy. And I think sometimes China, with its big infrastructure projects, is better in the eyes of African countries, in tapping into the future, and their excitement about the opportunities of the future. It is worth registering Hunt\u2019s comment about being a \u201cbig supporter\u201d of the 0.7% aid target (spending 0.7% of gross national income on aid). This is government policy, but it is not popular with Conservative party members and in the forthcoming Tory leadership contest it would be surprising if some candidates don\u2019t float the idea of shelving it, or at least expanding the government\u2019s definition of aid. (Using this money to fund some military spending is a popular idea in Tory circles.) Yesterday, after the latest Labour/government talks on a possible Brexit compromise, the participants emerged more optimistic than they have been in the past about the chances of a deal being struck. But Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, this morning injected a strong dose of realism into the process by telling the Today programme that, if Theresa May were to agree to the UK remaining in a customs union (Labour\u2019s key demand), her party would not accept that. Here are the main Brexit points from his interview. Hunt says Conservative MPs would not accept a cross-party Brexit compromise involving the UK staying in the customs union. He said: If we were proposing, which I very much hope we don\u2019t, to sign up to the customs union, then I think there is a risk that you would lose more Conservative MPs than you would gain Labour MPs. If, on the other hand, it was something different, then the result could be different as well. He said he favoured a \u201cpositive, outward-looking, optimistic Brexit\u201d. He said: The central argument is do we resolve this issue by having a rerun, as some in the Labour party, like Keir Starmer would like, which I happen to think would be disastrous. I don\u2019t think it would settle it to have another referendum ... Or do we resolve this by delivering Brexit, and then bringing the country together by showing the 48% who voted remain that this is not the Brexit of their worst nightmares, this is actually a Brexit where we don\u2019t pull up the drawbridge, pull down the shutters, say \u2018Foreigners not welcome\u2019, this is a positive, outward-looking, optimistic Brexit. Hunt said he thought a deal would be passed in the end because only a \u201cvery small number of MPs\u201d actually wanted to reverse Brexit. He said the Conservatives should pass a Brexit deal before electing a new leader. Hunt, of course, is one of the leading candidates to succeed May. But when it was put to him that the decision to hold an extraordinary meeting of Conservative activists, probably in early June, to consider calls for May to resign meant she would have to go in the early summer, Hunt replied: The difficulty that Theresa May has is far more a function of the fact that it is a hung parliament than any decisions that she has taken. And because of that, just changing the leader doesn\u2019t actually change the parliamentary arithmetic. What it would do is create delay in the process and mean that we will have another period of time through which we have Brexit paralysis. So I think much the best outcome is to try and find a way to resolve this so that we can leave, leave cleanly and leave quickly. Here is Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall\u2019s take on the interview. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 10am: The Commons home affairs committee takes evidence on serious violence from the chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, Mark Burns-Williamson, the former government troubled families adviser Dame Louise Casey, and the children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield. 10.30am: The Social Mobility Commission publishes its annual state of the nation report. 11am: Labour\u2019s national executive committee meets to decide the party\u2019s manifesto pledge for the European elections on a second referendum. As my colleagues Jessica Elgot and Rajeev Syal report, it is likely to agree a compromise option where it would support a referendum in order to prevent Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal or leaving without a deal, describing that wording as \u201cthe path of least resistance\u201d. 11.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives a speech to GPs and digital leaders. 11.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is meeting activists from Extinction Rebellion. XR was also due to meet John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, at 8.45am, and it is holding a protest at the Treasury at 4.30pm. 1pm: Heidi Allen, the Change UK interim leader, Mike Gapes, its foreign affairs spokesperson, and Gavin Esler, one of its MEP candidates for London, speak at a European elections rally. 3.35pm: Hancock gives evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee on social care funding. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here.

If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>If it is possible to see events through rose-coloured spectacles with a tartan tint, John Harris achieves it in his inability to see the truth of Scottish so-called independence (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/28/england-mess-scotland-splitting-away\" title=\"\">Scotland\u2019s case for splitting away is easier to make than ever</a>, 29 April). Harris laments Brexit, but the arguments used by Scottish nationalists for breaking up the UK are the exact mirror of those employed by English nationalist Brexiters for leaving the EU. It is the same poisonous mixture of grudge and grievance, economic illiteracy, inflated rhetoric, outright lies, empty promises and deliberate \u201cothering\u201d, with added flags and appeals to emotion over reason. In one case the EU is the ogre, and in the other the UK.</p> <p>The Scottish people rejected \u201cindependence\u201d five years ago. Whatever Harris may believe and SNP politicians might say, they are not about to change their minds. Harris also fails to recognise that the economic damage to Scotland of leaving the UK would be much worse than that to the UK of leaving the EU, not mention the cultural and other consequences of destroying a 300-year-old union with our fellow islanders. Whatever it might become, an \u201cindependent\u201d Scotland would not be a land flowing with the milk and honey, nor indeed human kindness.</p> <p>As for Brexit, the solution to threat is not to meekly kowtow to the forces of nationalism, whether English or Scottish. It is to counter and defeat the falsities and the weaknesses in the case made by Brexiters, just as the falsities and weaknesses in the case for Scottish independence were exposed and defeated in 2014.<br><strong>Alex Gallagher</strong><br><em>Largs, North Ayrshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am always slightly bemused when journalists make occasional and fleeting visits to Scotland and then tell us Scots how lucky we are to live in such a progressive and liberal country, courtesy of the SNP, when the reality is much different. Our once proud Scottish education system is failing, teacher shortages are causing real concerns, and Scottish students are, as a result of roll-capping in our universities, losing out to foreign students who pay fees. People are waiting much longer for hospital appointments, some rural areas have no GPs, and local authority budgets have been decimated, resulting in a dramatic decline in local services.</p> <p>Scotland, as a result of the Barnett formula, receives \u00a31,600 more than England for every man, woman and child, a fact Nicola Sturgeon never acknowledges when she makes her rallying call for independence to her Trumpian-like base. Sadly, Ms Sturgeon has set Scotland once again on a path where the language of division, conflict and discord will dominate the national conversation.<br><strong>Maureen Henry</strong><br><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is right to say that Scotland should \u201cleave behind the current wretchedness\u201d of Brexit \u201cand find something better\u201d. But in saying that there\u2019s \u201ca great mess of unresolved disagreements within England\u201d, if anything he underestimates the problems facing his homeland. The future global economy will be dominated by three superpowers: the US, China and, potentially strongest of all, the EU. To some extent, a post-Brexit UK will inevitably be cut off from and shunned by the European economic colossus.</p> <p>Tory home counties post-imperial fantasies will add to England\u2019s economic woes. Like Ireland, an independent Scotland would suffer greatly from its nearest neighbours\u2019 reduced circumstances. Scots should seize the moment, cut themselves free from English complacency and seek to stay at the heart of the EU.<br><strong>Joe McCarthy</strong><br><em>Dublin, Ireland</em></p> <p>\u2022 The usually perceptive John Harris has a blind spot about the question of Scottish independence. He does not consider the SNP\u2019s failure to properly address the difficulties of breaking up the UK, including the near-permanent austerity that would result. He does not grapple with the fact that in 10 years in power, the SNP have presided over declines in health and education without remotely threatening to use the devolved powers they already have. He advocates for a Scottish exceptionalism as untethered from reality as the English exceptionalism that has fuelled Brexit. Our current politics gives a clear example of the dangers of major constitutional change undertaken on the basis of incomplete facts and driven by jingoistic expressions of national superiority. Scottish independence at this time would be an order of magnitude more destructive and destabilising than even our current predicament.<br><strong>Gerard Scott</strong><br><em>Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "If it is possible to see events through rose-coloured spectacles with a tartan tint, John Harris achieves it in his inability to see the truth of Scottish so-called independence (Scotland\u2019s case for splitting away is easier to make than ever, 29 April). Harris laments Brexit, but the arguments used by Scottish nationalists for breaking up the UK are the exact mirror of those employed by English nationalist Brexiters for leaving the EU. It is the same poisonous mixture of grudge and grievance, economic illiteracy, inflated rhetoric, outright lies, empty promises and deliberate \u201cothering\u201d, with added flags and appeals to emotion over reason. In one case the EU is the ogre, and in the other the UK. The Scottish people rejected \u201cindependence\u201d five years ago. Whatever Harris may believe and SNP politicians might say, they are not about to change their minds. Harris also fails to recognise that the economic damage to Scotland of leaving the UK would be much worse than that to the UK of leaving the EU, not mention the cultural and other consequences of destroying a 300-year-old union with our fellow islanders. Whatever it might become, an \u201cindependent\u201d Scotland would not be a land flowing with the milk and honey, nor indeed human kindness. As for Brexit, the solution to threat is not to meekly kowtow to the forces of nationalism, whether English or Scottish. It is to counter and defeat the falsities and the weaknesses in the case made by Brexiters, just as the falsities and weaknesses in the case for Scottish independence were exposed and defeated in 2014. Alex Gallagher Largs, North Ayrshire \u2022 I am always slightly bemused when journalists make occasional and fleeting visits to Scotland and then tell us Scots how lucky we are to live in such a progressive and liberal country, courtesy of the SNP, when the reality is much different. Our once proud Scottish education system is failing, teacher shortages are causing real concerns, and Scottish students are, as a result of roll-capping in our universities, losing out to foreign students who pay fees. People are waiting much longer for hospital appointments, some rural areas have no GPs, and local authority budgets have been decimated, resulting in a dramatic decline in local services. Scotland, as a result of the Barnett formula, receives \u00a31,600 more than England for every man, woman and child, a fact Nicola Sturgeon never acknowledges when she makes her rallying call for independence to her Trumpian-like base. Sadly, Ms Sturgeon has set Scotland once again on a path where the language of division, conflict and discord will dominate the national conversation. Maureen Henry Glasgow \u2022 John Harris is right to say that Scotland should \u201cleave behind the current wretchedness\u201d of Brexit \u201cand find something better\u201d. But in saying that there\u2019s \u201ca great mess of unresolved disagreements within England\u201d, if anything he underestimates the problems facing his homeland. The future global economy will be dominated by three superpowers: the US, China and, potentially strongest of all, the EU. To some extent, a post-Brexit UK will inevitably be cut off from and shunned by the European economic colossus. Tory home counties post-imperial fantasies will add to England\u2019s economic woes. Like Ireland, an independent Scotland would suffer greatly from its nearest neighbours\u2019 reduced circumstances. Scots should seize the moment, cut themselves free from English complacency and seek to stay at the heart of the EU. Joe McCarthy Dublin, Ireland \u2022 The usually perceptive John Harris has a blind spot about the question of Scottish independence. He does not consider the SNP\u2019s failure to properly address the difficulties of breaking up the UK, including the near-permanent austerity that would result. He does not grapple with the fact that in 10 years in power, the SNP have presided over declines in health and education without remotely threatening to use the devolved powers they already have. He advocates for a Scottish exceptionalism as untethered from reality as the English exceptionalism that has fuelled Brexit. Our current politics gives a clear example of the dangers of major constitutional change undertaken on the basis of incomplete facts and driven by jingoistic expressions of national superiority. Scottish independence at this time would be an order of magnitude more destructive and destabilising than even our current predicament.

      "bodyText": "Janice Bailey, 72, is tending her neat front garden when a Labour councillor arrives. \u201cUrgh,\u201d she groaned, unable to hide her dismay. Bailey, a retired healthcare assistant, normally votes Labour but is weary with the endless Brexit saga. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s a big flipping con. I thought it would be sorted by now.\u201d Sue Jeffrey, the energetic leader of Redcar and Cleveland borough council, tries gamely to steer the conversation away from the B-word but Bailey is fed up. \u201cI just haven\u2019t got confidence any more,\u201d she said. Brexit might not have topped the news agenda over Easter, but there is no doubt it has continued to dominate the debate on doorsteps across this corner of north-east England. \u201cWhen things were at their height a couple of weeks ago, you just couldn\u2019t talk to anybody without that being the first thing they said,\u201d said Jeffrey. \u201cMost often you\u2019re met with \u2018I\u2019m not voting for any of you\u2019 because of the disillusionment in politicians \u2013 nationally, generally. People just think they\u2019ve been betrayed.\u201d Labour is battling to save its precarious grip on power at the council. It leads a minority administration of 28 seats against an opposition of 31 councillors, made up of 11 Conservatives, 11 Liberal Democrats and nine independents. All the seats are up for grabs, each one potentially shifting the balance of power. In an election dominated by Brexit, Labour is on shaky ground. The area voted a hefty 66% to leave the EU, against the wishes of the Redcar MP, Anna Turley, a vocal supporter of a second referendum. There have been protests outside Turley\u2019s constituency office and the word \u201cOUT!\u201d was daubed on its steel shutters this month. More than 1,400 people have joined a #TurleyOut group on Facebook set up by disgruntled former Labour councillors, including an ex-ceremonial mayor of Redcar and Cleveland. The group has distributed more than 2,000 anti-Turley leaflets in recent weeks, accusing the MP of betraying the area\u2019s wishes, while its members have drawn up a tactical voting plan aimed at ousting Labour from all of its council seats. The online campaign has been \u201creally toxic,\u201d said Turley, adding that out on the doorstep the reception is less hostile. The Kent-born MP, who was re-elected with a marginally smaller majority in 2017, has been out canvassing with Labour activists and her picture appears on campaign literature. The focus on Brexit means it is \u201cnot going to be an easy election\u201d, Turley admits, but insists she has not seen a significant shift in support: \u201cBrexit is an issue but it\u2019s mostly coming up from people who aren\u2019t Labour supporters anyway.\u201d Labour is fighting on several fronts across the 94-sq mile borough, a diverse mix of coastal resorts, industrial estates, market towns and rural villages bordering the North York Moors. In east Cleveland, where voters complain of missing out on investment focused on Redcar, the Conservatives are hopeful of making gains. In 2017, the Tory MP Simon Clarke ended Labour\u2019s 20-year grip on Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland and is popular locally. Steve Turner, a Tory councillor who also works in Clarke\u2019s constituency office, said the party had been expecting to double its number of council seats to more than 20, taking it to potential coalition territory, until Theresa May failed to secure a Brexit deal. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t think we will be hit as badly as some areas, we have to roll back on our expectations a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people just won\u2019t vote and some are so disgusted they will vote independent.\u201d Turner, who ran the Vote Leave campaign in the north-east, admits \u201cnobody likes\u201d May but said that Jeremy Corbyn was also a huge turnoff for traditional Labour voters locally, many of whom are ex-military. \u201cNobody liking Theresa May is a massive problem if you\u2019re in Kent but in the north-east no one has ever liked the Tories,\u201d he said. The Lib Dems \u2013 who were elected to parliament with Ian Swales in Redcar in 2010 before he stepped down and Labour retook the seat in 2015 \u2013 believe they can add four or five council seats on the back of a Labour-Tory backlash. Boundary changes have meant a newly-created ward which they are targeting. The town of Skelton was a three-councillor ward, with Labour holding two of the seats. It is now being split into two wards, each with two councillors, and some think the move will be at the expense of the Labour party. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a safe seat in Redcar and Cleveland now, including my seat,\u201d said Neil Baldwin, who was elected for Labour in 2015 but is standing this time as an independent. \u201cEven removing the Brexit argument Labour will have struggled, but I think the boundary changes and the Brexit mess is just going to scupper anything. But who knows?\u201d Back in Normanby, a quiet neighbourhood of 1970s homes on the outskirts of Redcar, a 28-year-old man opens his door. \u201cI probably won\u2019t vote,\u201d he tells Jeffrey. \u201cWatching everything that\u2019s going on, none of them are capable of doing anything.\u201d The former naval officer is against a second referendum, to which Jeffrey replies that Labour is \u201cnot talking about a second referendum\u201d but is focused on a Brexit that works for local people. He appears unconvinced as he closes the door, without a discussion of local issues. \u201cThat\u2019s probably it, in a nutshell,\u201d says Jeffrey. Redcar and Cleveland at a glance Labour runs the council as a minority administration but the precarious balance of power makes it very vulnerable. As things stand, Labour is the biggest party with 28 councillors. There are 31 opposition seats, made up of 11 Conservatives, 11 Lib Dems and nine independents. All seats are up for grabs. It recorded the second-highest leave vote in the north-east of England, with a 66.2% vote for Brexit. Its local MPs could not be more divided on Brexit. Labour\u2019s Anna Turley (Redcar) backed remain and is a vocal supporter of a second referendum. Tory Simon Clarke (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) is a member of the party\u2019s hard-Brexit European Research Group and has been critical of Theresa May\u2019s deal.",

As the borough\u2019s first ever Labour leader and with no overall majority, he knew he was not likely to be in post for life \u2013 unlike over the border in Labour-dominated Manchester, where Sir Richard Leese has had the top job since 1996. In his eight years as a councillor, Ganotis, 39, has become a father and wants to spend more time with his two sons, aged one and four. \u201cI just think the next four years will be quite important in terms of where they are in life and I want to be around more for them.\u201d Ganotis, who earned \u00a330,676.80 last year as leader, believes remuneration is less of a problem than the hours councillors have to put in. \u201cI don\u2019t think the allowances are the issue. For me, it\u2019s the time commitment needed to do the role.\u201d He said he usually devoted 40 hours a week to politics and a further 20 to his day job. White has been ground down by the binary nature of politics, post-EU referendum. \u201cWe were given a yes or no decision and everything now is right or wrong. There\u2019s nothing in the middle now \u2026 I think that\u2019s what\u2019s made the whole atmosphere of politics horrific, actually.\u201d Politicians have stopped treating each other with courtesy or respect, he said. At his last council meeting, White said he was told he should be in prison. \u201cHe just said it because he can now. If he had said it eight years ago there would have been an uproar, it would have been in the paper, he would have been reported to standards. Eight years ago if you called someone a liar in the council chamber it would have been \u2018off with your head\u2019. Now it\u2019s the usual standard of debate. It\u2019s not a debate anymore and that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s just a slanging match.\u201d Despite it all, White hasn\u2019t ruled out a return to politics: \u201cSurely at some point this atmosphere has to pass and maybe then it will be enjoyable again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has walked out of a shadow cabinet meeting after demanding to see the text of the party\u2019s draft manifesto for the European parliamentary elections. The shadow cabinet met before Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC) gathered to sign off the manifesto for the elections next month. Watson said he had asked whether the shadow cabinet would be shown a draft of the manifesto, but when none materialised, he \u201cpolitely\u201d walked out. The manifesto for the elections, which has been drafted by the party\u2019s policy chief, Andrew Fisher, is expected to reiterate the policy announced in February. That policy said Labour would support a referendum to avoid a damaging Conservative Brexit or no-deal depature, but Watson wants the party to go further. A Labour source said the manifesto was due to be presented verbally, and the text then shown on a screen. Watson is one of those planning to use the NEC meeting to push for Labour to advocate a confirmatory referendum on any deal agreed in the cross-party Brexit talks with the government. That view is supported by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, but several members of the shadow cabinet, including Rebecca Long-Bailey and Jon Trickett, are sceptical, believing Labour should not become solely a party of remain. As well as Watson and Trickett, the 41-member NEC includes representatives of Labour-affiliated trade unions and grassroots constituency Labour parties. The majority are strong supporters of Corbyn\u2019s leftwing social and economic policies, but the Brexit issue cuts across the left-right divide in the party. Watson has become an increasingly vocal advocate of a referendum since Labour MPs led by Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna quit the party to form the breakaway Independent Group. Before the meeting, Watson had told reporters: \u201cIn the last few days, most of my colleagues on the NEC have been inundated with thousands of emails from Labour members who are saying that Labour voters recognise the parliamentary failure and they think that the only way to break this impasse is a people\u2019s vote on any deal that parliament can agree. \u201cWe have to listen to members, we have to listen to our European parliamentary candidates who support this, but there will be a debate at the shadow cabinet and the NEC \u2013 we\u2019ll see what comes out of it.\u201d More than 100 Labour MPs have written to NEC members to argue the party should use the election to campaign for a second referendum in any circumstances, and more than 20 Labour MEP candidates have pledged to back a referendum and then campaign to remain in the EU. Theresa May had hoped to cancel the European parliamentary elections by striking a Brexit deal with Labour, but Downing Street has been reluctantly forced to concede they will have to take place. An Opinium poll for the Observer on Sunday put Labour level with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party on 28%, with the Tories on half that.",

The findings, in a poll commissioned by Greenpeace, come as the group unveiled a detailed \u201cclimate manifesto\u201d, listing 134 key actions they say the government should take immediately to ensure the UK hits zero carbon emissions as soon as possible. The manifesto \u2013 which will be sent to MPs, policymakers, thinktanks and other experts for feedback \u2013 was released on Tuesday, a day before a parliamentary vote on whether to declare a national climate emergency. This month, the UK experienced the biggest civil disobedience protests for generations as Extinction Rebellion activists blocked roads, bridges and transport systems in London to highlight the escalating climate crisis. Millions of schoolchildren around the world have also taken to the streets to voice their growing alarm. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the debate around environmentalism had been fundamentally altered by the protests. \u201cClimate activists, young and old, have put the UK government under enormous pressure to officially recognise the climate emergency we are facing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a real feeling of hope in the air that after several decades of climate campaigning the message is beginning to sink in.

Then the government will have even less of an excuse not to act.\u201d The measures outlined in the manifesto include: A tripling of wind and solar power from current levels to ensure 80% of electricity comes from renewables by 2030. Ambitious targets to phase out the internal combustion engine in cars and vans with all new vehicles to be electric by 2030. Huge insulation drive on all existing and new buildings, and the installation of renewable generation on site as far as possible. A commitment to protect all high-carbon natural habitats and bold targets for habitat restoration/rewilding on land and at sea \u2013 including planting at least 700m trees over the next decade. The manifesto was released alongside polling carried out by Opinium in the midst of the Extinction Rebellion protests. It found: 63% of British public think they are in a climate emergency. 76% say they would vote differently to protect the planet and climate. 64% say government is responsible for taking action on climate change.
