      "bodyText": "The Brexit process is at an impasse because Boris Johnson is refusing to proceed with his withdrawal agreement bill until parliament agrees to an election on 12 December. Jeremy Corbyn is refusing to do so until the prime minister rules out a no deal Brexit and the EU grants the UK an extension. The EU appears to be waiting until Monday\u2019s vote on an election before deciding what length of Brexit extension to grant. Jeremy Corbyn told ITV\u2019s This Morning that an election on 12 December would be \u201creally odd so near Christmas\u201d. The Labour leader insisted he was ready for another election, but said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get no deal taken off the table first.\u201d He said Johnson should make a statement to parliament on Monday, taking no deal off the table. Speaking on a visit to a hospital, Boris Johnson refused to rule out the UK leaving the EU on 31 October, contradicting statements made by the chancellor this morning. He said that Corbyn should \u201cman up\u201d and back an election. No 10 suggested yesterday that the government could go \u201con strike\u201d and refuse to do anything until an election took place but the threat appeared to soften today. After previously insisting they would \u201cdo the bare minimum to keep the country running\u201d, Johnson said this afternoon: We are going to be governing in the interests of the country. We are going to be continuing with our dynamic one-nation Conservative agenda ... What we won\u2019t do is engage in pointless \u2018Brexitology\u2019 in parliament when parliament is simply committed to a delay. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU27 had not yet been able to make a decision on the length of the next Brexit delay, though it is understood there is full agreement on the need for an extension. The government is continuing to run adverts warning the public to prepare for Brexit on 31 October, the Guardian\u2019s media editor Jim Waterson reports. The Get Ready for Brexit marketing campaign was launched last month, with adverts running across television, radio, newspapers, online and on billboards around the UK. Almost all of the adverts, paid for using public funds, prominently state that the UK will definitely be leaving at the end of October and many feature a calendar counting down to the end of the month. Despite the expectation that Brexit will once again be delayed by up to three months, a government spokesperson confirmed that the \u201ccampaign is still live\u201d and spending will continue. The Labour MP David Lammy has responded to that story about the London mayoral candidate Rory Stewart describing some men he met while on a walkabout as \u201cminor gangsters\u201d. Here\u2019s the story: This, from Election Maps UK, is interesting. It looks at the results of the 85 council byelections since the 2019 local elections. This is from the BBC\u2019s Europe editor: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would back an election if the prime minister came to parliament on Monday and made a commitment to take the threat of a no deal Brexit off the table. He told ITV\u2019s This Morning that Labour would support a parliamentary vote to hold an election ... providing the prime minister comes to Parliament on Monday and makes it absolutely clear he is going to make sure that there is no crash out - because his deal includes the possibility of a no-deal exit. Asked if he thought Boris Johnson would do that, Corbyn said: He\u2019s going to have to do that because that\u2019s how Parliament works: we\u2019ve got to hold him to account. I think a no-deal exit is very dangerous. If he comes on Monday and says that, OK. Speaking this morning, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott also repeated that her party would not vote for an election on Monday (when the prime minister plans to put it to a vote in parliament) until they had seen what kind of extension offer the EU would make to the UK. But that was before the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU27 had not yet been able to make a decision on the length of the next Brexit delay, though it is thought there is full agreement on the need for an extension. Barnier said this was due to the ongoing debate in the UK over Boris Johnson\u2019s demand for a general election. The EU decision is now not expected until early next week (it was previously expected today), making it even more unlikely that the vote on a general election will pass. Boris Johnson has repeatedly refused to rule out the UK leaving the EU on 31 October, contradicting statements made by the chancellor this morning. \u201cOf course 31 October is still possible,\u201d Johnson said. Unfortunately it depends on what the EU says. We\u2019re in a situation in which, under the terms of the surrender act, which was passed by parliament, it is up to the EU to decide whether or not we stay in the EU and it is up to the EU how long that extension would be. Johnson also denied that the government could go \u201con strike\u201d if the opposition refused to support an election, despite comments from a spokesman that the government would only put the \u201cbare minimum\u201d amount of legislation before parliament if they lost the vote. Chancellor Sajid Javid told broadcasters this morning that the government would repeatedly push for a general election if parliament rejected Boris Johnson\u2019s motion on Monday. He said that if the opposition opposed an election \u201cwe will keep bringing back to parliament a motion to have an election. And we will keep doing that again and again\u201d. Boris Johnson has refused to say that the UK will not leave the EU on 31 October, saying we are still waiting on the extension decision from the EU. \u201cAs things stand we can leave on October 31st,\u201d he said. (The chancellor said this morning that the UK couldn\u2019t leave on 31 October.) He said Jeremy Corbyn should \u201cman up\u201d and support an election. Johnson said: Of course 31 October is still possible. Unfortunately it depends on what the EU says. We\u2019re in a situation in which, under the terms of the surrender act, which was passed by parliament, it is up to the EU to decide whether or not we stay in the EU and it is up to the EU how long that extension would be. He appeared to row back on the idea that the government would go \u201con strike\u201d if MPs did not back an election. (A spokesman for the prime minister previously said: \u201cNothing will come before parliament but the bare minimum. We will pursue a general election every day from then onwards and do everything we can to get it.\u201d) The PM said: I think you\u2019re totally confused here. We are going to be governing in the interests of the country. We are going to be continuing with our dynamic one-nation Conservative agenda, investing in our NHS, levelling up funding of education across the country, doing everything we can to take this country forward. What we won\u2019t do is engage in pointless \u2018Brexitology\u2019 in parliament when parliament is simply committed to a delay. Downing Street has rejected suggestions Boris Johnson could force through a no-deal Brexit in the middle of an election campaign, PA Media reports. Some MPs have expressed concern that once parliament has been dissolved, the prime minister could postpone the election date until after the end of the Brexit extension period, at which point the UK would leave the EU and MPs could do nothing to prevent it. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: It is the official position of the Cabinet Office that this would be impossible. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, parliament dissolves 25 working days before the date of the election. At the moment of dissolution the date of the election is locked. Once parliament is dissolved the PM cannot change the date of the election. The Brexit party has renewed its calls for a leave alliance with the Conservative party in the general election, our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. The party\u2019s chairman Richard Tice said latest blockages in parliament showed that \u201cthe Tories alone are powerless to deliver Brexit on 31 October\u201d. The Tory party is struggling to get anything past parliament and the remain establishment, partly because so many within their own ranks are in the remain establishment. The Brexit party has offered to put country before party and work with fellow, committed Brexiteers to secure a proper Brexit. Only a \u2018clean-break Brexit\u2019 will fully protect the independence of Britain\u2019s fishing, defence, and trade, and the integrity of our precious union, which the current treaty sells out. Tice repeated his claim, made on Newsnight earlier this week, that Michel Barnier had said there would be \u201cat least three years of the so-called transition\u201d under the Johnson deal. The Brexit negotiator\u2019s words in reality referred to the range of time negotiations for a free trade deal would take, something which it is widely assumed could take up to three years. But others have rejected this saying it would be possible to complete a deal within a year as the starting position was full alignment of trading regulations. What Barnier said was: \u201cWe will have to renegotiate for one year, two years, three years, maybe more in some areas, to rebuild all that will have been pulled apart by the desire of those backing Brexit\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has been speaking to ITV\u2019s This Morning again, this time about the prime minister\u2019s push for an election. He said that Boris Johnson needed to come to parliament on Monday and rule out a no-deal Brexit. Asked if he thought the prime minister would do that, Corbyn said: He has got to understand that the protection of jobs and the protection of the Good Friday agreement and peace process in northern Ireland are very, very important. His proposals don\u2019t do any of that. Asked if he thought he\u2019d win an election, Corbyn said yes. \u201cIn the last election in 2017 we were written off by everybody and look what happened,\u201d he said. Corbyn said the 12 December election date was \u201codd for many reasons \u2013 it\u2019s so near Christmas, it\u2019s after universities finish their terms\u201d. He said Labour might want an election before 12 December, but there would be discussions about that. Richard Madeley asked Corbyn how it would work having a chancellor who wants the downfall of capitalism in Downing St. The Labour leader said that when they have meetings with business groups there was a lot of agreement on how to manage things. Here\u2019s a bit more from Daniel Boffey about those Michel Barnier comments: Michel Barnier has said the EU27 has not yet been able to make a decision on the length of the next Brexit delay due to the ongoing debate in the UK over Boris Johnson\u2019s demand for a general election. Speaking after a two-hour meeting of ambassadors in Brussels, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator said an \u201cexcellent\u201d discussion had not concluded with any clear way forward. \u201cNo decision,\u201d he said. It may not take until Monday for the EU to make public its offer on an extension after parliament votes on whether there will be a general election. A majority of member states want to accept the terms of an extension reluctantly requested by Johnson in a letter sent last Saturday under which Brexit could be delayed up until 31 January. The UK would leave earlier if the withdrawal agreement was ratified in Westminster and by the European parliament. Read the full story here: Jeremy Corbyn is on ITV\u2019s This Morning with eight-year-old Luis Walker, who has cystic fibrosis, to talk about the deal agreed between the NHS and US manufacturers to provide the drug Orkambi to sufferers. Corbyn said that the NHS should have the ability to be able to manufacture its own generic medicines so that everybody has access to the best medicines. At its party conference last month Labour pledged to create a publicly-owned company to make cheap versions of medicines the NHS needs but cannot afford. From our Brussels bureau chief, Daniel Boffey: Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has said the EU27 has not yet been able to make a decision on the length of the next Brexit delay because of the ongoing debate in the UK over Boris Johnson\u2019s election demand. Some light relief ... If you\u2019re finding it hard to absorb everything that\u2019s happened this week (you\u2019d be forgiven) then you might find this summary from our Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, useful. The Liberal Democrats have launched a new poster campaign that parodies the \u201cCareless Talk Costs Lives\u201d second world war poster. Their \u201cCareless Votes Cost Lives\u201d poster replaces the two gossiping diners in the original with Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. The quote reads: \u201c\u2026thanks for your help comrade, we finally got Brexit over the line!\u201d Irish premier Leo Varadkar has said he would like to see a united Ireland in his lifetime, but only in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, the Press Association reports. Asked if he would like to see a united Ireland on Irish radio station Today FM, he said: I would, but only in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement so that is only in consent of the majority of people in Northern Ireland. That is really important stuff. Nobody should be forced into anything. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has tweeted to say that if Sajid Javid doesn\u2019t bring a budget forward, he will. Javid confirmed earlier this morning that the the budget scheduled for 6 November would be cancelled. Conservative MP, Seema Kennedy, has announced she is standing down to focus on \u201cother priorities in her life\u201d. More on the SNP\u2019s position from the Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent Libby Brooks: The SNP is calling for a general election on 5 December, telling Boris Johnson to \u201cstop playing games\u201d. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford this morning repeated his party\u2019s position that it wants an extension from the EU in place before any election is agreed, to rule out the threat of leaving with no deal, but added that he believed Johnson was manoeuvring to railroad his withdrawal bill through parliament and attempting to delay the EU\u2019s decision-making on an extension by raising the prospect of an election. Blackford told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme: What we should not be doing is calling an election and then sitting, debating and voting on the withdrawal agreement bill. We should put this back to the people through that general election and we should be dissolving parliament as soon as we can. The way to resolve this is a general election without precondition. Meanwhile, Scotland\u2019s independence-supporting newspaper The National has announced that first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will address its first rally for independence in George Square, next Saturday 2 Nov. The publicity states this is the first time that Sturgeon has addressed a Yes rally since 2014, and from memory this is correct, making it a pretty significant moment. Sturgeon received some criticism for not attending a large pro-independence march in Edinburgh at the beginning of October, the day before her party\u2019s annual conference began. Speaking to the BBC earlier this morning, Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, outlined potential problems with a 12 December\u201d We have issues getting polling stations generally. There\u2019s less and less public buildings available for people to use, but one of the key challenges that we have in December is that the polling stations already have bookings. For May polls they\u2019re expecting us on the first Thursday in May. Here, we\u2019re not even convinced all of the time that the election will take place on a Thursday. So, this morning I\u2019m sure that our 2,000 members will be getting on the phones trying to book polling stations provisionally for December 12. But again, we don\u2019t know whether the legislation will pass. We might be ending up doing it again for a different date very shortly. Ian Murray, the centrist Labour MP with Scotland\u2019s largest Commons majority, has comfortably survived an attempt by the trade union Unite to trigger a reselection contest, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor Severin Carrell reports. Unite was the only affiliate to seek a reselection contest when Labour party members and union affiliates in Edinburgh South voted last night, which Murray held in 2017 with a greatest increasing majority of 15,514 votes. The GMB, Unison, Unison, Usdaw, Community and Coop voted to retain Murray as the party\u2019s candidate. Party members at a constituency meeting voted by 158 to 13 in his favour. Reselection decisions are automatic in Labour-held seats but are normally a formality. Murray was the only one of the Labour seven MPs in Scotland to face a full vote after Unite sought revenge for his repeated and vocal criticism of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, and of the policies and conduct of Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary. Scottish leader of the pro-second referendum People\u2019s Vote campaign, Murray was close to many of the MPs who defected from Labour earlier this year to set up Change UK, and mulled joining them. After first holding the seat for Labour in 2010 with a slender 316 vote (0.7%) majority, he increased it to 2,637 votes (5.4%) in 2015 and then by six-fold to 15,514 (32.4%) in 2017. After the result was confirmed, he tweeted thanks to the constituency for reselecting him: We\u2019ll hear more on Labour\u2019s position later this morning when Jeremy Corbyn appears on ITV\u2019s This Morning show. The programme starts at 10.30am and will be presented by Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan for the first time in 18 years. The SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that his party wanted to see an extension granted by the EU to ensure there would not be a no-deal exit at the end of October. As soon as that has happened, they would support a general election, he said. \u201cLet\u2019s have the election as early as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us want an election too close to Christmas.\u201d He said he would like as long an extension as possible and that it was regrettable that we may not have a decision from the EU today. Chancellor Sajid Javid has been on the BBC\u2019s Today programme. He said that it was very likely that the EU would give into \u201cparliament\u2019s request for a three month delay\u201d. Javid said the government had done everything they could to get Brexit done and, without a majority, they needed cooperation from the opposition. The chancellor accused Labour of a constant moving of the goalposts. \u201cJust a few days ago we saw light at the end of the table and [Corbyn] voted for more tunnel,\u201d he said. \u201cFor anyone who wants to get Brexit done, the only choice is the Conservative party\u201d, he said. Expect this to be repeated over and over again in any pre-Brexit general election. Here\u2019s a story from Guardian political correspondent Kate Proctor. Former Tory-MP and London mayoral candidate Rory Stewart has been accused of \u201cbeing out of touch with Londoners\u201d after he described three men he met on a walkabout as \u201cminor gangsters\u201d. Increasing suggestion that the EU\u2019s decision on the extension could come early next week, not today. This is from the BBC\u2019s Europe editor last night: Here\u2019s Diane Abbott again, this time speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme. She said that Labour \u201cwas definitely up for an election\u201d, but that they would need \u201can explicit commitment\u201d to rule out a no-deal Brexit \u2013 which could include legislation in parliament \u2013 if it were to back an election. Speaking to BBC breakfast, chancellor Sajid Javid said the government has done \u201ceverything possible\u201d to leave by October 31st, but because of the opposition the deadline \u201ccan\u2019t be met\u201d. \u201cAnd that is exactly why we have turned round to Jeremy Corbyn and said let\u2019s get Brexit done,\u201d he said. Asked about the idea that the government would go on strike if the opposition refused to back an election, Javid said \u201cparliament is dysfunctional\u201d. He refused to be drawn on what a \u201cgovernment on strike\u201d looks like. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a majority in parliament and so to get certain things done it does depend on what the opposition does,\u201d he said. For the first time in the history of our country we have an opposition that is refusing to face the electorate. That cannot continue. The British people should decide who should govern them. Sam Gyimah, the MP for East Surrey \u2013 who had the Tory whip removed over his opposition to a no-deal Brexit and subsequently joined the Liberal Democrats \u2013 has been speaking to Sky News. He says that the way to break the deadlock on Brexit is to have a confirmatory referendum to give people a say on any deal. Gyimah says he personally thinks the deal is lousy, but that he would support it if it were to be put to a confirmatory referendum. He says that the Lib Dems will \u201cseriously consider\u201d voting for an election if an extension is secured and no-deal is off the table. \u201cThe prime minister is busy lobbying the EU to not give an extension until January,\u201d he says, so they need to wait and see what the EU says. It\u2019s Frances Perraudin here, taking over from Kate Lyons. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has been speaking to BBC breakfast. She started by saying that the house of commons had been united in their horror at the Essex lorry deaths. \u201cWe need to have safer and legal routes for refugees,\u201d she said. Abbott said Johnson\u2019s was a \u201cbogus call for an election\u201d. She said Labour needed a commitment that a no-deal Brexit was off the table, and to know what sort of extension the EU was offering, before they would back an election. She stressed that Labour wanted an election. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Boris Johnson in power a minute longer than necessary,\u201d said Abbott. Asked what the prime minister could do to reassure her that there wouldn\u2019t be a no-deal Brexit, she said, \u201cit would help if he actually said it, that [they] are committing to taking a no-deal Brexit off the table\u201d, though she added that was a problem because \u201che doesn\u2019t always tell the truth\u201d. Abbott described 12 December \u2013 Johnson\u2019s proposed date for an election \u2013 as a ridiculous date, and said \u201cthere is a reason why we\u2019ve not had a Christmas election for over a century\u201d. Adam Jackson, director of public affairs and Brexit advisory services at Grant Thornton UK on the challenges for the business community presented by Brexit uncertainty. What do the polls say? The prospect of an election leads many of the front pages today. Here are Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn explaining how they\u2019d feel about an early election. Another thing on the agenda today is that the EU will meet to discuss what length of Brexit extension to offer during a closed-door meeting in Brussels this morning. This comes after Boris Johnson was compelled to send a letter requesting a delay, which he did, very begrudgingly. Good morning everyone and welcome to Politics Live as we ponder whether or not the country will be thrown into election campaign mode. Boris Johnson is set to plead with MPs to grant him a pre-Christmas election. The prime minister wrote to Jeremy Corbyn last night to say he would give parliament one last chance to look at his withdrawal agreement bill and \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 6 November. He would also table a motion on Monday asking for an early general election, which would require the backing of two-thirds of MPs to succeed. Johnson\u2019s letter said: \u201cAn election on 12 December will allow a new parliament and government to be in place by Christmas. If I win a majority in this election, we will then ratify the great new deal that I have negotiated, get Brexit done in January, and the country will move on.\u201d Labour appeared poised to reject the government\u2019s request but Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC on Thursday night that no final decision would be made until the EU27 had agreed a Brexit delay. \u201cWe\u2019ll know tomorrow what the extension will be and I can answer that question tomorrow. What I\u2019m saying now is: take no deal off the table.\u201d After reaching a fresh deal with the EU27, the prime minister had hoped to fast-track it through parliament in time to leave by Halloween. But while MPs supported the principle of the bill on Tuesday, they rejected Johnson\u2019s timetable. Thanks for joining us early this Friday morning.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has said an election on 12 December would be \u201creally odd so near Christmas\u201d as he made it clear Labour would not vote to go to the polls until Boris Johnson ruled out a no-deal Brexit. The Labour leader insisted he was ready for another election, but told ITV\u2019s This Morning: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get no deal taken off the table first.\u201d The Brexit process is at an impasse because Johnson is refusing to proceed with his withdrawal agreement bill until parliament agrees to an election. Corbyn is refusing to do so until no deal is removed as an option, and the EU appears to be waiting until Monday\u2019s vote on an election before deciding what length of Brexit extension to grant. The Labour leader said his preference would be for Johnson to \u201ccome to parliament on Monday and make it absolutely clear there is no crash out\u201d because his deal leaves open the possibility of moving to World Trade Organization terms at the end of 2020. \u201cHe has got to take it out to my satisfaction,\u201d he said. Corbyn\u2019s statement suggests Labour would want some sort of amendment to the Brexit bill to prevent a no-deal departure before it would vote for a general election. But Johnson has shelved his Brexit legislation until an election is granted. Corbyn said a no-deal exit was \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and could lead to the closure of Ford in Bridgend, Nissan in Sunderland and Airbus in mid Wales. He denied that Labour\u2019s reluctance to go for an election was to do with his standing in the opinion polls and argued that Johnson\u2019s preferred date \u2013 12 December \u2013 was \u201creally very odd\u201d being so close to Christmas and after the end of university terms. Corbyn said an election could still take place before that time and that he wanted an election so the country could debate domestic issues and have a chance to end austerity. However, many within his shadow cabinet and parliamentary party are opposed to holding an election while Brexit remains unresolved and the party is trailing behind the Conservatives in the polls. Speaking later on Friday, Johnson struggled to explain why he was pushing so hard for an election when he had managed to reach a Brexit deal with the EU that he was refusing to let parliament debate. His main argument was that he did not want MPs to get into \u201cBrexitology\u201d without the deadline of an election hanging over them. But he has little hope of persuading Labour, the Scottish National party, the Liberal Democrats and other parties to agree to one before Christmas, meaning he will have to make a choice about what else to do with the three-month extension likely to be offered by the EU. On a visit to a hospital, Johnson said: \u201cWe can bring back the withdrawal bill, we can discuss it again in parliament, we can have more debates on Brexit, if that\u2019s what [Corbyn] really wants, but they\u2019ve got to agree a deadline, because nobody will believe that the Labour party is really going to allow Brexit to happen unless there is a deadline of an election on December 12. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be clear, this parliament has been sitting now doing absolutely nothing but delay Brexit, pushing it out with delay after delay for three-and-a-half years. \u201cAnd I think for MPs across the house to have any credibility about delivering Brexit they now have to commit to an election on December 12. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re pushing for.\u201d Johnson finished by saying Corbyn should \u201cman up\u201d and vote for his proposal for an election. No 10 had suggested on Thursday that the government could go \u201con strike\u201d and refuse to do anything until an election took place but the threat appeared to soften on Friday. After insisting they would \u201cdo the bare minimum to keep the country running\u201d on Thursday night, it emerged on Friday that the government will try to push its domestic legislation through parliament as laid out in the Queen\u2019s speech, as well as continuing to push for an early election. \u201cHe has a domestic agenda. We want to deliver for the British public,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said.",

Parliament was ready to vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/brexit-means-brexit-theresa-may-jonathan-lynn-yes-minister\">Brexit means Brexit</a>, but has not agreed what Brexit means.</p> <h2>What is Boris Johnson\u2019s deal?</h2> <p>After a summer of brinkmanship and bad-tempered exchanges between Brussels and London, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/boris-johnson-gets-deal-backslapping-brussels-eu-summit-brexit\">struck a deal with the EU on 17 October</a>. The prime minister made three key concessions.</p> <p>First, to solve the long-running dispute over the Irish border, he agreed to customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and an all-Ireland regulatory zone for goods. In other words, he agreed to a border in the Irish Sea, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/24/dup-prepared-to-bring-down-government-may-brexit-deal\">line he said in 2018 he would not accept</a>.</p> <p>Secondly, he dropped his insistence that the Conservative\u2019s coalition partners, the Democratic Unionist party, should be able to veto those arrangements. The EU also gave way, by allowing the Northern Ireland assembly to vote to quit the economic arrangements by a simple majority, although no one expects it to do so. The original plan to create a temporary insurance policy to avoid a hard border mutated into a permanent arrangement separating Northern Ireland economically from Great Britain. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/01/what-is-johnsons-leaked-solution-to-the-irish-backstop-problem\">backstop</a> became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/the-irish-sea-border-what-does-it-mean-for-businesses-brexit\">a full stop</a>.</p> <p>The final piece of the jigsaw was the non-binding political declaration that charts a course for future relations between the EU and UK. Abandoning May\u2019s hopes for close economic ties, the two sides will now work towards a looser free-trade agreement. The prime minister was not successful in trying to drop a link between a free-trade deal and commitments to maintain existing EU standards on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. But these guarantees were moved from the legal text to the non-binding declaration and the UK will not seek to match any raising of EU standards.</p> <h2><strong>Five days is a long time in politics</strong></h2> <p>MPs convening in the Commons for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/18/brexit-super-saturday-will-the-deal-pass\">the first Saturday sitting since the Falklands war</a> had been expected to deliver a decisive verdict on Johnson\u2019s deal. Instead, they asked for more time. A majority of MPs supported an amendment from the former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/what-does-the-letwin-amendment-mean-for-brexit-timetable-boris-johnson\">designed to prevent an accidental no-deal before</a> 31 October.</p> <p>The prime minister was forced to request an extension, obeying the law as the government had always said he would, despite a stream of off-record briefings that No 10 had a secret plan to evade extension. But Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/eu-will-grant-brexit-extension-if-johnson-sends-letter-says-brussels\">sent the EU three letters</a>, including an unsigned one requesting the extension and a second arguing against a delay.</p> <p>Europe reacted with exasperation that MPs had passed on the chance to make a choice. Meeting on a drizzly Sunday morning in Brussels, EU diplomats decided to press on with the EU\u2019s own ratification. The extension letter was left in the inbox.</p> <p>By Tuesday, the EU\u2019s hopes of quick resolution were dashed. The House of Commons voted to back Johnson\u2019s deal by 30 votes but rejected the timetable that would have seen parliament consider the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/21/what-does-boris-johnsons-withdrawal-bill-actually-say\">115-page withdrawal agreement bill</a> in just three days \u2013 an accelerated process described as \u201cinsulting\u201d in the Commons and \u201cabsurd\u201d by an EU diplomat.</p> <p>Even the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had not mastered all the details. He told MPs (wrongly) that there would be no customs declarations required to send goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. He later <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/barclay-northern-irish-firms-to-complete-declarations-when-trading-with-britain/\">corrected himself</a>.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s wait-and-see policy could no longer hold. Tusk, an anglophile who hopes the UK will one day rejoin, recommended the EU accept the British request to extend Brexit until 31 January, as requested by the Commons. In sticking to parliament\u2019s request, he hoped the EU could avoid accusations of siding with Brexiters (by offering a short extension) or remainers (by offering a longer one).</p> <p>By Wednesday, EU member states had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/brexit-european-leaders-back-call-for-delay-end-january-extension\">unanimously accepted the prime minister\u2019s request for an extension</a>. While most were ready to support a delay until 31 January, France was holding up a decision. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, hopes that a shorter delay might force a decision at Westminster. It was Macron\u2019s earlier insistence on forcing the pace that created the countdown to 31 October when the EU debated the second Brexit extension in April.</p> <h2>What happens next?</h2> <p>The EU is likely to grant a Brexit extension while continuing to complain about the disruptive neighbour that won\u2019t leave. But the next steps from Westminster are less sure. The prime minister <strong>could pass the withdrawal agreement bill within a few weeks, possibly days</strong>. The pro-EU former Conservative chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/ken-clarke-interview-andrew-rawnsley-lost-tory-whip\">Ken Clarke</a> said the prime minister needed only \u201ca modest adjustment\u201d of the timetable.</p> <p>But as Labour and the Conservatives have been unable to agree a revised timetable for the bill, <strong>it could take weeks, even months.</strong> As time passes, different factions could mobilise behind their preferred Brexit. Labour MPs will press for a customs union and stronger protection for workers and the environment. Hardline Eurosceptics have signalled they want more oversight over payments to the EU.</p> <p>As details emerge from dense legal text, the government\u2019s fragile coalition of Eurosceptic \u201cSpartans\u201d, former Tories and 19 Labour MPs risks fracturing. It cannot be ruled out that the <strong>government could lose the majority for Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal</strong> in the final vote.</p> <p>All three options are likely to be accompanied by <strong>a general election</strong>, with the prime minister urging MPs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/boris-johnson-to-ask-mps-to-back-pre-christmas-election\">agree to go to the polls on 12 December</a>. <strong>Another EU</strong> <strong>referendum looks a remote possibility</strong> but cannot be excluded until Brexit happens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1bf746b1-27c2-48bd-b882-a21140069121\"         data-atom-type=\"guide\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>Whether it is an election or a referendum campaign, the prime minister will champion himself as the man who wants to or has succeeded in his efforts to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. The slogan might as well be written on the side of a bus. </p> <p>The day after departure, talks will enter a new phase as the UK seeks to strike a free-trade deal with the EU, as well as numerous other agreements on crime-fighting, foreign policy and data protection, to name a few. Almost immediately after the political trauma of exit, the UK will be plunged into a new cycle of deadlines and demands, countdowns and cliff-edges as it seeks to find a new place in the world.</p>",

Instead, they asked for more time. A majority of MPs supported an amendment from the former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin designed to prevent an accidental no-deal before 31 October. The prime minister was forced to request an extension, obeying the law as the government had always said he would, despite a stream of off-record briefings that No 10 had a secret plan to evade extension. But Johnson sent the EU three letters, including an unsigned one requesting the extension and a second arguing against a delay. Europe reacted with exasperation that MPs had passed on the chance to make a choice. Meeting on a drizzly Sunday morning in Brussels, EU diplomats decided to press on with the EU\u2019s own ratification. The extension letter was left in the inbox. By Tuesday, the EU\u2019s hopes of quick resolution were dashed. The House of Commons voted to back Johnson\u2019s deal by 30 votes but rejected the timetable that would have seen parliament consider the 115-page withdrawal agreement bill in just three days \u2013 an accelerated process described as \u201cinsulting\u201d in the Commons and \u201cabsurd\u201d by an EU diplomat. Even the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had not mastered all the details. He told MPs (wrongly) that there would be no customs declarations required to send goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. He later corrected himself. The EU\u2019s wait-and-see policy could no longer hold. Tusk, an anglophile who hopes the UK will one day rejoin, recommended the EU accept the British request to extend Brexit until 31 January, as requested by the Commons. In sticking to parliament\u2019s request, he hoped the EU could avoid accusations of siding with Brexiters (by offering a short extension) or remainers (by offering a longer one). By Wednesday, EU member states had unanimously accepted the prime minister\u2019s request for an extension. While most were ready to support a delay until 31 January, France was holding up a decision. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, hopes that a shorter delay might force a decision at Westminster. It was Macron\u2019s earlier insistence on forcing the pace that created the countdown to 31 October when the EU debated the second Brexit extension in April. What happens next? The EU is likely to grant a Brexit extension while continuing to complain about the disruptive neighbour that won\u2019t leave. But the next steps from Westminster are less sure. The prime minister could pass the withdrawal agreement bill within a few weeks, possibly days. The pro-EU former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke said the prime minister needed only \u201ca modest adjustment\u201d of the timetable. But as Labour and the Conservatives have been unable to agree a revised timetable for the bill, it could take weeks, even months. As time passes, different factions could mobilise behind their preferred Brexit. Labour MPs will press for a customs union and stronger protection for workers and the environment. Hardline Eurosceptics have signalled they want more oversight over payments to the EU. As details emerge from dense legal text, the government\u2019s fragile coalition of Eurosceptic \u201cSpartans\u201d, former Tories and 19 Labour MPs risks fracturing. It cannot be ruled out that the government could lose the majority for Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal in the final vote. All three options are likely to be accompanied by a general election, with the prime minister urging MPs to agree to go to the polls on 12 December. Another EU referendum looks a remote possibility but cannot be excluded until Brexit happens. Whether it is an election or a referendum campaign, the prime minister will champion himself as the man who wants to or has succeeded in his efforts to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. The slogan might as well be written on the side of a bus. The day after departure, talks will enter a new phase as the UK seeks to strike a free-trade deal with the EU, as well as numerous other agreements on crime-fighting, foreign policy and data protection, to name a few. Almost immediately after the political trauma of exit, the UK will be plunged into a new cycle of deadlines and demands, countdowns and cliff-edges as it seeks to find a new place in the world.",

Airy promises of shedloads more money from a man not even Tories regard as trustworthy may carry less conviction than the evidence of everyone\u2019s eyes in their own neighbourhoods. As ever, the NHS is the standard bearer for public perceptions of much else. Two particular NHS items stand out as political emblems of this Tory era: the record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/26/nhs-short-of-70000-nurses-bursaries-abolished\" title=\"\">shortage of nurses</a>, and a particularly bad case of privatisation.</p> <p>Start with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/18/bain-capital-plasma-resources-uk\" title=\"\">shocking privatisation</a> in 2013 of the NHS blood plasma supplier, on which thousands of patients depend. To protect the quality of the blood product, David Owen, as health secretary in 1975, took blood plasma collection into public ownership as Plasma Resources UK. But Jeremy Hunt, as health secretary, sold that off for \u00a3200m to a US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/25/uk-blood-plasma-company-sale-nhs-supplies\" title=\"\">private equity firm, Bain Capital</a>, while Britain kept a 20% stake. Co-founded by Mitt Romney in 1984, Bain has over the years acquired such well known health products as Burger King, Dunkin Donuts, Dominos Pizza and much else. Protesters, David Owen among them, warned that the company had a predatory reputation for asset stripping, but Bain promised it would develop the company into a \u201clife sciences champion\u201d in Hertfordshire. Instead, it <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-bio-products-our-blood-plasma-supplier-ended-up-with-china-zg00fthqn\" title=\"\">sold it on</a> to a Chinese company in 2016 for \u00a3820m. Was there any protest from our government, losing its last remnant of control? Not a word. Instead, an irony, the US government is expressing concern at China taking over a vital US-owned health asset.</p> <p>Privatisation threats were raised in the debate on the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday, as Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, pointed to the doubling of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/832765/dhsc-annual-report-and-accounts-2018-to-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">NHS expenditure</a> on private health providers since 2010, to \u00a39bn. That\u2019s still not a vast sum out of the NHS budget, but only because the extreme shortage of funds has made core NHS services less tempting for takeover by private companies than the 2012 Health and Social Care Act was designed for. Though NHS England wants its competition elements repealed, the act continues to let companies like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/29/richard-branson-virgin-scoops-1bn-pounds-of-nhs-contracts\" title=\"\">Virgin Care sue the NHS</a> when they are denied the chance to tender for profitable contracts. Exhibit number two in the Tories\u2019 destruction of our health service: the NHS has just published its highest ever rate of vacant posts for nurses, at more than <a href=\"https://www.nursingtimes.net/news/workforce/nhs-nurse-vacancies-in-england-rise-to-more-than-43000-08-10-2019/\" title=\"\">43,000 missing roles</a>.

Later came the 2017 abolition of bursaries for trainee nurses, which cut the number of subsequent applicants. That made training unaffordable for women with children, who are often healthcare assistants wanting to upgrade. The attrition of nurses leaving the profession has worsened, with one in five quitting as soon as they train, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/08/nhs-nursing-crisis-worsened-by-brexit-exodus\" title=\"\">and 5,000</a> going back to other EU countries as a result of the Brexit vote. Particular specialisms have been hit hardest. Between 2010 and 2018 there was a <a href=\"http://www.independentnurse.co.uk/news/learning-disability-care-facing-a-crisis-following-40-drop-in-nurses/180928/\" title=\"\">40% drop in learning disability nurses</a>. The Royal College of Nursing points to voluminous <a href=\"https://www.nursingtimes.net/news/workforce/nurse-leaders-call-public-fight-nurses-17-09-2019/\" title=\"\">research</a> showing not just the fast-rising numbers of patients, but also the increasing complexity and severity of their conditions. Statistically, for every extra nurse who joins the wards, 157 new patients have been admitted over the last five years. The greater the pressure on them, the more prone nurses are to quitting. At the same time many trusts have been downgrading nurses to save money, re-evaluating them from a top pay band 7 to a band 6, doing the same work for a lot less pay, causing many to leave in anger. <a href=\"https://ihm.org.uk/roy-lilley-nhsmanagers/\" title=\"\">The health commentator Roy Lilley</a> has been pointing to their loss of some \u00a36,000. Prof Alison Leary of London South Bank University warns district nurses are nearing extinction. A nurse loses \u00a310,000 in pay to take a three-year district nurse course: none will qualify in 2021. Both Lilley and Leary suggest that nurturing nurses, supporting them when they start and encouraging them in promotions, could stop their flight from the NHS.</p> <p>Are these tales of privatisation, neglect and cost-cutting the kind of thing Johnson wishes we would all focus on intently once Brexit is \u201cdone\u201d? (Not that it ever will be.) If he thinks close coverage of the state of public services is his winning ticket in an imminent election, he may be in for a shock.</p> <p>Promising jam tomorrow will cut no mustard with voters who can see the nine-year plight of services they use today; Johnson\u2019s vague offers are nothing like the money needed to repair them. He might prefer we returned to scrutinising his exceedingly bad Brexit deal.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The grindstones of Brexit pound everything else into the ground. Boris Johnson claims day after day that if only parliament would \u201cget it done\u201d, the country would be free to focus again on the NHS, police and schools. But when the searchlight eventually does fall again on public services, as it likely will in a general election, that may do Johnson and his party no favours. Take Brexit out of the immediate battleground and what\u2019s left? Only the true state of the country and its services after nine long years of funding starvation perpetrated by Conservative governments. Airy promises of shedloads more money from a man not even Tories regard as trustworthy may carry less conviction than the evidence of everyone\u2019s eyes in their own neighbourhoods. As ever, the NHS is the standard bearer for public perceptions of much else. Two particular NHS items stand out as political emblems of this Tory era: the record shortage of nurses, and a particularly bad case of privatisation. Start with the shocking privatisation in 2013 of the NHS blood plasma supplier, on which thousands of patients depend. To protect the quality of the blood product, David Owen, as health secretary in 1975, took blood plasma collection into public ownership as Plasma Resources UK. But Jeremy Hunt, as health secretary, sold that off for \u00a3200m to a US private equity firm, Bain Capital, while Britain kept a 20% stake. Co-founded by Mitt Romney in 1984, Bain has over the years acquired such well known health products as Burger King, Dunkin Donuts, Dominos Pizza and much else. Protesters, David Owen among them, warned that the company had a predatory reputation for asset stripping, but Bain promised it would develop the company into a \u201clife sciences champion\u201d in Hertfordshire. Instead, it sold it on to a Chinese company in 2016 for \u00a3820m. Was there any protest from our government, losing its last remnant of control? Not a word. Instead, an irony, the US government is expressing concern at China taking over a vital US-owned health asset. Privatisation threats were raised in the debate on the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday, as Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, pointed to the doubling of NHS expenditure on private health providers since 2010, to \u00a39bn. That\u2019s still not a vast sum out of the NHS budget, but only because the extreme shortage of funds has made core NHS services less tempting for takeover by private companies than the 2012 Health and Social Care Act was designed for. Though NHS England wants its competition elements repealed, the act continues to let companies like Virgin Care sue the NHS when they are denied the chance to tender for profitable contracts. Exhibit number two in the Tories\u2019 destruction of our health service: the NHS has just published its highest ever rate of vacant posts for nurses, at more than 43,000 missing roles. A survey by the Health Service Journal, working from its own FoI requests, finds 93% of NHS trusts are falling short, with nearly half lacking 10% of the nurses they need: that\u2019s three times more than five years ago. Nurses are being substituted with untrained assistants. Nurse training places fell victim to George Osborne\u2019s first budget: a conveniently commissioned McKinsey report said there would be less need for nurses in future. Later came the 2017 abolition of bursaries for trainee nurses, which cut the number of subsequent applicants. That made training unaffordable for women with children, who are often healthcare assistants wanting to upgrade. The attrition of nurses leaving the profession has worsened, with one in five quitting as soon as they train, and 5,000 going back to other EU countries as a result of the Brexit vote. Particular specialisms have been hit hardest. Between 2010 and 2018 there was a 40% drop in learning disability nurses. The Royal College of Nursing points to voluminous research showing not just the fast-rising numbers of patients, but also the increasing complexity and severity of their conditions. Statistically, for every extra nurse who joins the wards, 157 new patients have been admitted over the last five years. The greater the pressure on them, the more prone nurses are to quitting. At the same time many trusts have been downgrading nurses to save money, re-evaluating them from a top pay band 7 to a band 6, doing the same work for a lot less pay, causing many to leave in anger. The health commentator Roy Lilley has been pointing to their loss of some \u00a36,000. Prof Alison Leary of London South Bank University warns district nurses are nearing extinction. A nurse loses \u00a310,000 in pay to take a three-year district nurse course: none will qualify in 2021. Both Lilley and Leary suggest that nurturing nurses, supporting them when they start and encouraging them in promotions, could stop their flight from the NHS. Are these tales of privatisation, neglect and cost-cutting the kind of thing Johnson wishes we would all focus on intently once Brexit is \u201cdone\u201d? (Not that it ever will be.) If he thinks close coverage of the state of public services is his winning ticket in an imminent election, he may be in for a shock. Promising jam tomorrow will cut no mustard with voters who can see the nine-year plight of services they use today; Johnson\u2019s vague offers are nothing like the money needed to repair them. He might prefer we returned to scrutinising his exceedingly bad Brexit deal. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",
