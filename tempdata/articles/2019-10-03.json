      "body": "<p>It is one thing to point out that in any society there exists a large number of discrete individuals, each with his or her own values and interests. The fact is so obvious that it\u2019s hardly worth stating. It is quite another to claim that, over and above those individuals, there exists a supra-person, \u201cthe people\u201d \u2013 something with values and interests of its own.</p> <p>As Zoe Williams points out (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/01/sajid-javid-brexit-the-people\" title=\"\">Be very wary when leaders claim to speak for \u2018the people\u2019</a>, Journal, 2 October), to imagine that the latter, entirely fictitious claim bears any logical relationship to the former obvious fact is to fall prey to a fallacy. It\u2019s a fallacy that ought to be familiar to any undergraduate taking a course in political philosophy, if only thanks to Rousseau\u2019s notorious argument that a majority vote can settle the question of what \u201cthe general will\u201d or \u201cthe will of the people\u201d might be, the latter being (supposedly) a straightforward question of fact.</p> <p>Since Rousseau\u2019s time, the idea that there is a \u201cpeople\u201d with a will of its own has been subjected to much criticism, not only for its logical sloppiness but also for its totalitarian implication that it can be right to sacrifice some for the sake of others. Such criticisms have come from across the political spectrum \u2013 from liberal philosophers with conservative leanings (Isaiah Berlin, Karl Popper) as much as from thinkers of the left such as Stuart Hall (Williams\u2019s example).</p> <p>It is, therefore, all the more depressing that the pro-Brexit faction has managed to get away for so long with parroting the mendacious platitude that, with the 2016 referendum, \u201cthe people spoke\u201d. Since \u201cthe people\u201d is a non-existent entity, that can\u2019t be true. <br><strong>Alan Haworth </strong><br><em>Hornsey, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Drawing on Professor Stuart Hall\u2019s brilliant deconstruction of hegemonic rightwing narratives about \u201cthe people\u201d and \u201ccommon sense\u201d, Zoe Williams demonstrates how damaging and misleading the current blitz of vox pops about Brexit are.</p> <p>The continual refrain of \u201cjust get on with it\u201d, usually from white over-60s citizens in market towns, is doing ideological work for the Tories and the Brexit party which distorts demographic reality. The BBC in particular failed to challenge the baseless claims by Boris Johnson et al during the referendum about the huge benefits of leaving the EU in a spurious pursuit of \u201cbalance\u201d, just as they did with the climate change issue. Even the referendum-winning claim of \u201ctake back control\u201d was never evaluated. Control in what sense? Certainly not parliamentary sovereignty or corporate capitalism. Now even the comprehensive catastrophe of \u201cno deal\u201d is being spun as delivering the \u201cwill of the people\u201d (37% of the electorate). I hope journalists report the anger of people when they realise that leaving without a deal on 31 October has opened the Pandora\u2019s box of years of strife, inflation, rising unemployment, transport chaos etc. Certainly not the risible \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal of Andrea Leadsom.<br><strong>Philip Wood</strong><br><em>Kidlington, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 One of the many stunning ironies, or should I say contradictions, over Brexit was highlighted by your report on the plans for the island of Ireland (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/boris-johnson-unveils-brexit-plan-for-alternative-to-backstop\" title=\"\">Dismay in Brussels as Johnson finally reveals his Brexit plan</a>, 3 October).</p> <p>Boris Johnson and Brexiteers damn the majority of MPs for blocking moves and ignoring the wishes of \u201cthe people\u201d \u2013 the UK-wide majority in the referendum.

      "bodyText": "It is one thing to point out that in any society there exists a large number of discrete individuals, each with his or her own values and interests. The fact is so obvious that it\u2019s hardly worth stating. It is quite another to claim that, over and above those individuals, there exists a supra-person, \u201cthe people\u201d \u2013 something with values and interests of its own. As Zoe Williams points out (Be very wary when leaders claim to speak for \u2018the people\u2019, Journal, 2 October), to imagine that the latter, entirely fictitious claim bears any logical relationship to the former obvious fact is to fall prey to a fallacy. It\u2019s a fallacy that ought to be familiar to any undergraduate taking a course in political philosophy, if only thanks to Rousseau\u2019s notorious argument that a majority vote can settle the question of what \u201cthe general will\u201d or \u201cthe will of the people\u201d might be, the latter being (supposedly) a straightforward question of fact. Since Rousseau\u2019s time, the idea that there is a \u201cpeople\u201d with a will of its own has been subjected to much criticism, not only for its logical sloppiness but also for its totalitarian implication that it can be right to sacrifice some for the sake of others. Such criticisms have come from across the political spectrum \u2013 from liberal philosophers with conservative leanings (Isaiah Berlin, Karl Popper) as much as from thinkers of the left such as Stuart Hall (Williams\u2019s example). It is, therefore, all the more depressing that the pro-Brexit faction has managed to get away for so long with parroting the mendacious platitude that, with the 2016 referendum, \u201cthe people spoke\u201d. Since \u201cthe people\u201d is a non-existent entity, that can\u2019t be true. Alan Haworth Hornsey, London \u2022 Drawing on Professor Stuart Hall\u2019s brilliant deconstruction of hegemonic rightwing narratives about \u201cthe people\u201d and \u201ccommon sense\u201d, Zoe Williams demonstrates how damaging and misleading the current blitz of vox pops about Brexit are. The continual refrain of \u201cjust get on with it\u201d, usually from white over-60s citizens in market towns, is doing ideological work for the Tories and the Brexit party which distorts demographic reality. The BBC in particular failed to challenge the baseless claims by Boris Johnson et al during the referendum about the huge benefits of leaving the EU in a spurious pursuit of \u201cbalance\u201d, just as they did with the climate change issue. Even the referendum-winning claim of \u201ctake back control\u201d was never evaluated. Control in what sense? Certainly not parliamentary sovereignty or corporate capitalism. Now even the comprehensive catastrophe of \u201cno deal\u201d is being spun as delivering the \u201cwill of the people\u201d (37% of the electorate). I hope journalists report the anger of people when they realise that leaving without a deal on 31 October has opened the Pandora\u2019s box of years of strife, inflation, rising unemployment, transport chaos etc. Certainly not the risible \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal of Andrea Leadsom. Philip Wood Kidlington, Oxfordshire \u2022 One of the many stunning ironies, or should I say contradictions, over Brexit was highlighted by your report on the plans for the island of Ireland (Dismay in Brussels as Johnson finally reveals his Brexit plan, 3 October). Boris Johnson and Brexiteers damn the majority of MPs for blocking moves and ignoring the wishes of \u201cthe people\u201d \u2013 the UK-wide majority in the referendum. At the same time, they imply that DUP members of the Commons, but not a majority in the Commons, have a veto over the plans. A majority in Northern Ireland voted remain in the referendum. Meanwhile, the plans supported by the DUP are described (Irish reaction, 3 October) by \u201cNI parties\u201d \u2013 meaning business and other political leaders \u2013 as \u201csabotage\u201d and \u201ca disaster\u201d. Richard Norton-Taylor London \u2022 The Guardian is known for its occasional misprints. Your report of Johnson\u2019s conference speech contains one, referring to his \u201cpopulist rhetoric pure and simple\u201d (The closing speech: Fish puns and testicles in a peculiar metaphorical mix, 3 October). Simple certainly, but pure?
