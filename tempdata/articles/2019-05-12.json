The shadow Brexit secretary said he feared the party risked losing its remain voters after worse than expected losses in the local elections, but he warned Labour remainers tempted to vote for the Liberal Democrats or Change UK that only Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party could deliver a fresh referendum. In his first major interview since talks with the government began almost five weeks ago, Starmer: Suggested a referendum must be part of any package agreed with the government. Said Labour could call time on the cross-party talks within days if it became clear no new offer was forthcoming. Warned Theresa May would further damage the prospect of any deal if she set an imminent departure date from No 10. Said the option was \u201con the table\u201d to face Nigel Farage or Tommy Robinson in an EU elections debate. Starmer, a human rights lawyer for 20 years, is to be the key face of Labour\u2019s EU elections campaign, which will be framed as a battle of values. He said the poll on 23 May would be a fight Labour \u201ccannot sit out\u201d for tolerance and internationalism against populists such as Farage and Robinson. \u201cIf the vote that is progressive is split then all that does is open up the path for the Brexit party and allow it to pretend it represents the majority view in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the critical issues, like a close economic relationship with the EU, and a confirmatory vote, only Labour can deliver on those.\u201d He said he feared the lesson of Labour\u2019s net loss of more than 84 seats in the local elections was that it could shed remain voters as well as leavers. \u201cThere is concern in leave areas about whether some of our voters might vote for other parties, but I think there is an increasing concern that some of the Labour remain voters might not vote Labour,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very important that we learn those lessons.\u201d An Opinium/Observer survey of voting intentions in the European elections released at the weekend gave Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party 34% of the vote, 13 points ahead of Labour on 21%.

He says that for Labour to adopt a remain position \u201cwould mean abandoning not just radical leftism, but potentially millions of leave voters\u201d. But what Labour has so far said it wants to do can be accommodated within the EU\u2019s rules.</p> <p>His worries hark back to the misguided belief that the EU is a capitalist conspiracy. Capitalist, yes, but guided largely over the years by Christian democratic and social democratic philosophies. And with Labour\u2019s newfound enthusiasm for fighting climate change, where better to do it than as part of the EU, which has a good record in this regard? As Timothy Garton Ash points out in the same edition (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/09/why-we-must-not-let-europe-break-apart\" title=\"\">Why we must not let Europe break apart</a>), Europe has a serious problem with rightwing factions in several EU countries. It will not help to combat this growing menace if we cut ourselves off from the rest of the EU.</p> <p>There clearly are many Labour supporters who back leaving the EU, mainly in the deprived areas of the north. But who has done more to create the deprivation these regions face: is it the EU, which has supported many a regenerative project in these areas, or the Tory government, which has brought devastation through its crippling welfare policies? And will leaving the EU make the problem better or worse?<br><strong>Michael Franklin</strong><br><em>Barnet, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is plain wrong on Brexit. I came from a working-class background and made it to university, went to Greenham Common, marched against Thatcher, supported the miners\u2019 strike, voted and campaigned for Labour. But I shall no longer support them purely because of their stance on Europe. To support remain is not to abandon radical leftism: there are far more left-leaning countries than us in the EU.</p> <p>It is clear that many leave voters came from poor, neglected communities. They are right to be angry, but leaving the EU will make their lives worse. Labour should have the moral courage to fight for remaining in the EU. This is where the insurgency should come from. There are millions of us just gasping for such a move.<br><strong>Kath Gray</strong><br><em>Nottingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 Why does Owen Jones think that, if Labour adopted a pro-EU position, that would mean abandoning radical leftism? Isn\u2019t internationalism more leftwing than nationalism?<br><strong>Michael Bulley</strong><br><em>Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, France</em></p> <p>\u2022 Did Owen Jones miss the memo from Corbyn when he signed the Party of European Socialists manifesto in Lisbon in 2018?</p> <p>If he\u2019d read it he would know that Labour MEPs have signed up to working with European socialist and social democratic colleagues for: a Europe of \u201cequality and fairness\u201d; of \u201csolidarity for the many, not the few\u201d; a \u201csustainable Europe that protects our planet\u201d; \u201ca free and democratic Europe\u201d; \u201ca feminist Europe with equal rights for all\u201d; \u201ca progressive Europe with a youth plan\u201d; and \u201ca strong and united Europe that promotes a better world\u201d.</p> <p>If we leave the EU, Labour will play no part in delivering the PES manifesto. This is why Labour MPs, members and voters overwhelmingly support a bold remain position.<br><strong>Magi Young</strong><br><em>Exeter</em></p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones\u2019s dismissal of the Blair government\u2019s record ignores a wide range of achievements, from introducing the minimum wage and Sure Start, to increasing child benefit and providing winter fuel payments and bus passes for pensioners, lifting 600,000 children and a million pensioners out of poverty, securing free nursery places for every three-and four-year-old and much more besides. No government is perfect, but denigrating the last Labour government\u2019s record will not help secure the election of a new Labour government.<br><strong>Jeremy Beecham</strong><br><em>Labour, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 I would add scrapping Trident to Owen Jones\u2019s list of proposals to demonstrate Labour\u2019s insurgent credentials.

      "bodyText": "Owen Jones still doesn\u2019t get it (Labour must reclaim its insurgent spirit, 9 May). He says that for Labour to adopt a remain position \u201cwould mean abandoning not just radical leftism, but potentially millions of leave voters\u201d. But what Labour has so far said it wants to do can be accommodated within the EU\u2019s rules. His worries hark back to the misguided belief that the EU is a capitalist conspiracy. Capitalist, yes, but guided largely over the years by Christian democratic and social democratic philosophies. And with Labour\u2019s newfound enthusiasm for fighting climate change, where better to do it than as part of the EU, which has a good record in this regard? As Timothy Garton Ash points out in the same edition (Why we must not let Europe break apart), Europe has a serious problem with rightwing factions in several EU countries. It will not help to combat this growing menace if we cut ourselves off from the rest of the EU. There clearly are many Labour supporters who back leaving the EU, mainly in the deprived areas of the north. But who has done more to create the deprivation these regions face: is it the EU, which has supported many a regenerative project in these areas, or the Tory government, which has brought devastation through its crippling welfare policies? And will leaving the EU make the problem better or worse? Michael Franklin Barnet, London \u2022 Owen Jones is plain wrong on Brexit. I came from a working-class background and made it to university, went to Greenham Common, marched against Thatcher, supported the miners\u2019 strike, voted and campaigned for Labour. But I shall no longer support them purely because of their stance on Europe. To support remain is not to abandon radical leftism: there are far more left-leaning countries than us in the EU. It is clear that many leave voters came from poor, neglected communities. They are right to be angry, but leaving the EU will make their lives worse. Labour should have the moral courage to fight for remaining in the EU. This is where the insurgency should come from. There are millions of us just gasping for such a move. Kath Gray Nottingham \u2022 Why does Owen Jones think that, if Labour adopted a pro-EU position, that would mean abandoning radical leftism? Isn\u2019t internationalism more leftwing than nationalism? Michael Bulley Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, France \u2022 Did Owen Jones miss the memo from Corbyn when he signed the Party of European Socialists manifesto in Lisbon in 2018? If he\u2019d read it he would know that Labour MEPs have signed up to working with European socialist and social democratic colleagues for: a Europe of \u201cequality and fairness\u201d; of \u201csolidarity for the many, not the few\u201d; a \u201csustainable Europe that protects our planet\u201d; \u201ca free and democratic Europe\u201d; \u201ca feminist Europe with equal rights for all\u201d; \u201ca progressive Europe with a youth plan\u201d; and \u201ca strong and united Europe that promotes a better world\u201d. If we leave the EU, Labour will play no part in delivering the PES manifesto. This is why Labour MPs, members and voters overwhelmingly support a bold remain position. Magi Young Exeter \u2022 Owen Jones\u2019s dismissal of the Blair government\u2019s record ignores a wide range of achievements, from introducing the minimum wage and Sure Start, to increasing child benefit and providing winter fuel payments and bus passes for pensioners, lifting 600,000 children and a million pensioners out of poverty, securing free nursery places for every three-and four-year-old and much more besides. No government is perfect, but denigrating the last Labour government\u2019s record will not help secure the election of a new Labour government. Jeremy Beecham Labour, House of Lords \u2022 I would add scrapping Trident to Owen Jones\u2019s list of proposals to demonstrate Labour\u2019s insurgent credentials. This should be clearly linked to a pledge to reinvest much of the money saved in our conventional forces, which are at their lowest ebb for decades. That in turn would reflect the need for capacity-building for the climate change crises we will inevitably face. That would indeed be an insurgent and, shall we say, patriotic gesture. Colin Challen Scarborough, North Yorkshire \u2022 Owen Jones exhorts Labour to reclaim its insurgent spirit by recommending that we all take our eye off the ball. Labour\u2019s sense of radicalism would be best served by picking a fight with the \u201calt right\u201d \u2013 the 21st century\u2019s version of fascism. There is no bigger fight around, and losing it isn\u2019t an option. Brexit is part of the far-right project. Labour would serve its voters best by understanding Brexit for what it is, stopping colluding with it, and leading the insurgency against it. Chris Scarlett Sheffield \u2022 On 7 May you carried the headline \u201cHumanity facing \u2018urgent threat\u2019 from loss of Earth\u2019s natural life\u201d above a story described by George Monbiot as \u201cthe most important news humanity has ever received, the general collapse of life on Earth\u201d. So it was somewhat disappointing to read that the best Owen Jones can do is to suggest that Labour regain its \u201cinsurgent spirit\u201d by committing to scrapping knighthoods, private dentistry and estate agents. If this is to be the rallying cry of the radical left, then God help us. Really.

      "body": "<p>There are broadly three ways to react to the shifting of the Overton window \u2013 the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse. The first and most common is to move along with it, accepting new parameters and adapting to them. The second is to stay put but look through the window, acknowledging that things have changed while attempting to grapple with that. The third is to resist the movement altogether, to refuse to engage with any previously beyond-the pale-ideas, and reject any arguments to do so.</p> \n<p>I tend to fall into the third camp, an Overton window refusenik. This is not fashionable and it\u2019s not easy \u2013 by the very nature of the problem, people who agree with you become more desensitised with each passing day. There comes a point when seeing Nigel Farage on TV becomes no longer appalling but almost comforting. It\u2019s old Nigel again with his familiar voice and manner, and bluster and cackle \u2013 an offence of white noise.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/12/andrew-neil-questions-to-ben-shapiro-were-legitimate\">Andrew Neil: questions to Ben Shapiro were legitimate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It\u2019s like watching the weather report and listening to the predictable chatter. Familiarity doesn\u2019t only breed contempt, sometimes it just breeds more familiarity. I used to turn off Farage\u2019s LBC radio show the moment it started, in a spasm of irritation. I don\u2019t any more. Not because I\u2019m interested in anything he has to say, but out of sheer conditioning. I let him witter on in the background, like The Archers or the Shipping Forecast.</p> \n<p>This is the danger of ubiquity, it just erodes an ability to be discerning. No matter how much those with regressive, prejudiced or simply dishonest views are challenged, it is pointless if they are constantly provided a venue. It is the platform that legitimises them, not how they perform when they are on that platform.</p> \n<p>And so forgive me if I do not join in the celebration of Andrew Neil vanquishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/11/us-pundit-ben-shapiro-apologises-bbc-andrew-neil-interview\" title=\"\">the American conservative personality Ben Shapiro</a>on the BBC\u2019s Politics Live. It was certainly fun to watch Shapiro flounder outside the comfort of the US political interview echo chamber. The video gave us such gems as Shapiro accusing Neil of being a biased leftwing journalist, which tickled even Neil who laughed in genuine (and telling) mirth at the allegation. Unable to cope with Neil simply stating his own words back to him, Shapiro riposted: \u201cI\u2019m popular, and no one\u2019s ever heard of you,\u201d before terminating the interview.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e4ef131d-aba7-4dc7-ac59-9a4d5ea2a64e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PRF3r3zUGqk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His statement might sound childish, but he does have more than 2 million Twitter followers and 600,000 YouTube subscribers, and his videos rack up millions of views. According to the editor of Politics Live, Shapiro \u2013 who has said that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-48230588/andrew-neil-and-ben-shapiro-on-abortion-obama-and-middle-east\" title=\"\">Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage</a>\u201d, whose Twitter account was checked by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/18/quebec-city-mosque-shooter-scoured-twitter-for-trump-right-wing-figures-before-attack/?utm_term=.dda9be79b62f\" title=\"\">Quebec mosque gunman</a> 93 times in the month preceding the shooting, and who says that <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-worlds-muslims-radicalised\" title=\"\">the majority of Muslims are radicals</a> \u2013 was hosted on the BBC because \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobBurl/status/1126796771865370625\" title=\"\">he has millions of followers</a> on social media and is hugely influential, particularly among young people worldwide\u201d.</p> \n<p>Shapiro\u2019s currency isn\u2019t his ability to debate or his intellectual credentials, it is merely to be around so much that his very ubiquity becomes ersatz success. It is the tactic of others in his tribe, to build such a profile online that mainstream news organisations fall for the optical illusion and eventually give them passage to respectability. Interviews in which they are challenged, successfully or not, are part of their roadshow. They either, according to them, prove the media\u2019s bad faith or bias, or present their exchanges as entertaining sports events after which there are losers and winners and rematches. The content of their message becomes secondary, its seriousness trivialised. After the interview, Shapiro tweeted that it was \u201cNeil 1, Shapiro 0\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the post-match analysis, even when we celebrate if interviews go well and people such as Shapiro are not merely indulged but pressed, we are somehow soiled by becoming a part of the whole seedy spectacle.

      "bodyText": "There are broadly three ways to react to the shifting of the Overton window \u2013 the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse. The first and most common is to move along with it, accepting new parameters and adapting to them. The second is to stay put but look through the window, acknowledging that things have changed while attempting to grapple with that. The third is to resist the movement altogether, to refuse to engage with any previously beyond-the pale-ideas, and reject any arguments to do so. I tend to fall into the third camp, an Overton window refusenik. This is not fashionable and it\u2019s not easy \u2013 by the very nature of the problem, people who agree with you become more desensitised with each passing day. There comes a point when seeing Nigel Farage on TV becomes no longer appalling but almost comforting. It\u2019s old Nigel again with his familiar voice and manner, and bluster and cackle \u2013 an offence of white noise. It\u2019s like watching the weather report and listening to the predictable chatter. Familiarity doesn\u2019t only breed contempt, sometimes it just breeds more familiarity. I used to turn off Farage\u2019s LBC radio show the moment it started, in a spasm of irritation. I don\u2019t any more. Not because I\u2019m interested in anything he has to say, but out of sheer conditioning. I let him witter on in the background, like The Archers or the Shipping Forecast. This is the danger of ubiquity, it just erodes an ability to be discerning. No matter how much those with regressive, prejudiced or simply dishonest views are challenged, it is pointless if they are constantly provided a venue. It is the platform that legitimises them, not how they perform when they are on that platform. And so forgive me if I do not join in the celebration of Andrew Neil vanquishing the American conservative personality Ben Shapiroon the BBC\u2019s Politics Live. It was certainly fun to watch Shapiro flounder outside the comfort of the US political interview echo chamber. The video gave us such gems as Shapiro accusing Neil of being a biased leftwing journalist, which tickled even Neil who laughed in genuine (and telling) mirth at the allegation. Unable to cope with Neil simply stating his own words back to him, Shapiro riposted: \u201cI\u2019m popular, and no one\u2019s ever heard of you,\u201d before terminating the interview. His statement might sound childish, but he does have more than 2 million Twitter followers and 600,000 YouTube subscribers, and his videos rack up millions of views. According to the editor of Politics Live, Shapiro \u2013 who has said that \u201cArabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage\u201d, whose Twitter account was checked by the Quebec mosque gunman 93 times in the month preceding the shooting, and who says that the majority of Muslims are radicals \u2013 was hosted on the BBC because \u201che has millions of followers on social media and is hugely influential, particularly among young people worldwide\u201d. Shapiro\u2019s currency isn\u2019t his ability to debate or his intellectual credentials, it is merely to be around so much that his very ubiquity becomes ersatz success. It is the tactic of others in his tribe, to build such a profile online that mainstream news organisations fall for the optical illusion and eventually give them passage to respectability. Interviews in which they are challenged, successfully or not, are part of their roadshow. They either, according to them, prove the media\u2019s bad faith or bias, or present their exchanges as entertaining sports events after which there are losers and winners and rematches. The content of their message becomes secondary, its seriousness trivialised. After the interview, Shapiro tweeted that it was \u201cNeil 1, Shapiro 0\u201d. In the post-match analysis, even when we celebrate if interviews go well and people such as Shapiro are not merely indulged but pressed, we are somehow soiled by becoming a part of the whole seedy spectacle. Exhilarated by the performance, mocking Shapiro\u2019s voice or cartoonish demeanour, laughing as he storms off. It\u2019s not funny. Shapiro was minimised and made to look a fool, but he managed not to substantively answer any of they questions he was asked, about his stance on abortion, Arabs or Palestinians. This is not because Neil is a bad interviewer, but because there is no way to effectively nail someone like Shapiro whose argumentative tactics are about aggression, evasion, rhetorical bluster and dissimulation. Farage is the same. He has been skewered on his lies several times, often by his own radio phone-in callers, and most recently on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, but it\u2019s not relevant to his profile. The belief that somehow giving more airtime to people will expose and vanquish them makes no sense. The whole \u201csunlight is the best disinfectant\u201d argument no longer works. Sunlight simply provides exposure and nourishment. There is no middle ground with bigots, no matter how popular they are.

      "bodyText": "The divisions in the UK are so deep and pervasive that reconciliation could take a generation, Gordon Brown has said. The country was facing competing visions of its future: isolated, inward-looking and disengaged, or open, outward-facing and internationalist, the former prime minister said. Speaking at the launch of Christian Aid Week in Westminster on Sunday morning, Brown set out a passionate defence of the international aid budget and the importance of the fight against global poverty before addressing the themes behind the Brexit debate. The UK had endured three years of \u201calmost internecine division\u201d, he said. The debate triggered by the Brexit referendum raised a fundamental disagreement about what it means to be British. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be honest, my worry is that the divisions in our country are now so deep and so pervasive that it could take a generation for us to reconcile these differences, bring people together and find a unifying vision of our country and a sense of purpose and direction that takes us forward into the modern world,\u201d Brown said. \u201cLet us be honest \u2013 there are two visions of Britain that are competing with each other \u2026 There is one vision of Britain that derives from people\u2019s misunderstanding of the Dunkirk spirit, this idea that we are better off when we stand alone, aloof and apart, sufficient unto ourselves, isolated if necessary, supposedly this independent spirit that means we are better off when we are disengaged from the world.\u201d He continued: \u201cThere is a second vision of Britain \u2013 a Britain that is open, outward-looking, engaged and not disengaged with the rest of the world, a Britain that is internationalist in its outlook, a Britain that sees it has responsibilities not just to itself, but that its national interest is served and also its moral standing is served by being engaged and part of the rest of the world. \u201cI believe this is a choice we have to make as a country. And I cannot see how the issue of our future can be resolved unless we understand that in a modern interdependent, interconnected world that to be outward-looking and not inward-looking, to be engaged and not disengaged, to be internationalist and not narrowly nationalist, is the only way forward.\u201d Brown described himself as \u201cunapologetically in favour of being part of the EU\u201d, but declined to be drawn on whether he favoured another referendum on Brexit. The debate, he said, was \u201cessentially between globalists and nationalists\u201d. There needed to be a more effective counter-argument to the rise of nationalism, protectionism and populism. \u201cIf you have America first, India first, Japan first, Russia first, Turkey first, Britain first, then you have a world where it\u2019s impossible to get agreements to do the things we need to do. \u201cWe have to find a way of defeating the argument that the best way of running the world is every nation for themselves.\u201d Brown, who has a long record of tackling global poverty, dismissed arguments that the UK should cut back on its international aid budget. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to argue back against people who say that aid is unproductive, aid is wasteful, aid is money going to the wrong people, aid is somehow inefficient, when all the evidence is that aid is well used and even more necessary if we\u2019re going to deal with fundamental problems that no decent citizen in Britain would tolerate if they saw what was happening first-hand.\u201d He described Christian Aid as a \u201cgreat British national institution\u201d, recalling as a child being sent by his mother to distribute the charity\u2019s red collection envelopes.
