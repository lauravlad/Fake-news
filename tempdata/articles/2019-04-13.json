Some, in their idle moments, may even look back further and wonder how the Bennite left might have been neutralised much earlier. With its meticulous review of four decades of intra-party struggles, David Kogan\u2019s <em>Protest and Power</em> will provide them with plenty of material for anguish.

The movement to elect Corbyn as leader is hard to imagine in the absence of social media, as is the grassroots vitality and reach of Momentum. Kogan shows us Labour\u2019s original analogue version of such mobilisation, in the form of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy (CLPD), founded in 1973 by the little-known activist Vladimir Derer, which would soon be joined by the young Lansman. The CLPD was influential for a while, but when Tony Benn narrowly lost the deputy leadership election to Denis Healey in 1981, it appeared to be the high watermark for the Bennite vision of Labour as a \u201cmovement\u201d. And so it remained for the next 34 years.</p> <p>The tale of the Labour left\u2019s return from the dead is an extraordinary one, which still has an air of unreality about it. It provides the pivotal moment in <em>Protest and Power</em>, appearing halfway through this 400-page book. Kogan traces the details of why exactly Ed Miliband decided to alter the leadership election rules, retelling the story of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/07/falkirk-row-clear-legal-evidence-ed-miliband\" title=\"\">Falkirk election scanda</a>l, in which the Unite union was accused of signing up its members to the Labour party without their consent. The move to primary-style leadership elections, in which trade union control was circumvented, was part of an effort to cleanse the internal democracy of the party.</p> <p>Then there is the remarkable detail of how Corbyn\u2019s name made it on to the ballot in June 2015 at all. He was not immediately enthused by the prospect of running, but Lansman was convinced he should stand, helping to secure the support of the parliamentary Labour party\u2019s \u201ccampaign group\u201d. Thirty-five MPs were needed to endorse Corbyn, and Lansman \u2013 again \u2013 was instrumental in collecting the names, against considerable odds. \u201cThirty-five years of being in the wilderness, of failing to be noticed and still ploughing on gave a level of resilience,\u201d Kogan notes.</p> <p>Many of the MPs who agreed to nominate him, such as Frank Field, Margaret Beckett and Jon Cruddas, did so in order to support vigorous debate within the party. Very few did so because they supported Corbyn\u2019s politics and none, surely, because they thought he\u2019d win. The final two names of Gordon Marsden and Andrew Smith were added a mere 10 seconds before the nominations were closed. If ever there was a moment for Blairites to go back to and \u201ckill baby Corbynism\u201d, that was surely it.These contingencies and near-misses are interesting up to a point. But Kogan is rather too fond of hindsight, sometimes to the point of obscuring how things seemed at the time. Occasionally he uses his vantage point to no effect whatsoever. On Labour\u2019s disastrous 1983 election result, he observes wryly that the new intake of MPs included \u201cthree future Labour leaders, of whom two became prime minister and one a three-time general election winner. Not bad for a crushing defeat\u201d. On Miliband\u2019s 2015 defeat, he tells us \u201cit is difficult not to feel sorry for Ed Miliband. He could not have predicted the variety of elements that would lead to this result.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c2c37af3ff68f39f3d14fee7d05710daeb646eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c2c37af3ff68f39f3d14fee7d05710daeb646eb/0_92_4124_2474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Many MPs who agreed to nominate Jeremy Corbyn did so in order to support vigorous debate within the party.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many MPs who agreed to nominate Jeremy Corbyn did so in order to support vigorous debate within the party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In its attention to historical detail, <em>Protest and Power</em> cannot be faulted. But Kogan largely relies on sheer quantity of facts. Every vote, every poll is reported with such fidelity that it occasionally feels like reliving an interminable and intricate democratic procedure. And in the absence of any effort to explain events (rather than simply report them), he offers little sense of who and what really mattered amid this deluge of evidence. Every so often, an event arises that we already recognise as crucial; yet Kogan puts no more emphasis on the fall of the Berlin Wall, the rewriting of Clause 4 or the Iraq war than on internecine tussles within the NEC. On occasions, he seems just lost for words: \u201cIn 1981 riots took place in Brixton in London and Toxteth in Liverpool. It was incredibly grim.\u201d</p> <p>The book\u2019s originality lies largely in its access to the key players of the past 40 years, who are quoted at length, making it a piece of oral history as much as anything else. Kogan is building on an earlier work he published with his uncle, Maurice Kogan, in 1981, and the roster of interviewees makes for impressive reading. The difficulty is that, all being on the record and each interviewee having a highly polished version of history they\u2019re delighted to share, the interview material is neither surprising nor scurrilous. Whatever one thinks of the Westminster lobby approach to political history, journalists such as Tim Shipman and Andrew Rawnsley can at least be depended on to dig up a little dirt. Not so when every voice is named.</p> <p>At a time of rampant distrust in politics and rising polarisation, there is certainly some value in committing events to the record in as consensual a fashion as possible. Labour\u2019s recent antisemitism controversies are a case in point, where Kogan\u2019s cautious attention to the record provides a welcome route through such fraught territory. He is obviously fascinated by the Labour party, while giving few glimpses of his own sympathies within the arguments he chronicles \u2013 an unusual combination. It is an odd sensation when reading the final chapters, which get as far as February 2019, to have the recent febrile political news confirmed in the style of a court reporter documenting who said what. But then who\u2019s to say that such an empirical, balanced and exhaustive account of political conflicts won\u2019t one day be invaluable to those looking back from some yet more divided future?</p> <p>\u2022<em> Protest and Power: The Battle for the Labour Party is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a320).

Very few did so because they supported Corbyn\u2019s politics and none, surely, because they thought he\u2019d win. The final two names of Gordon Marsden and Andrew Smith were added a mere 10 seconds before the nominations were closed. If ever there was a moment for Blairites to go back to and \u201ckill baby Corbynism\u201d, that was surely it.These contingencies and near-misses are interesting up to a point. But Kogan is rather too fond of hindsight, sometimes to the point of obscuring how things seemed at the time. Occasionally he uses his vantage point to no effect whatsoever. On Labour\u2019s disastrous 1983 election result, he observes wryly that the new intake of MPs included \u201cthree future Labour leaders, of whom two became prime minister and one a three-time general election winner. Not bad for a crushing defeat\u201d. On Miliband\u2019s 2015 defeat, he tells us \u201cit is difficult not to feel sorry for Ed Miliband. He could not have predicted the variety of elements that would lead to this result.\u201d In its attention to historical detail, Protest and Power cannot be faulted. But Kogan largely relies on sheer quantity of facts. Every vote, every poll is reported with such fidelity that it occasionally feels like reliving an interminable and intricate democratic procedure. And in the absence of any effort to explain events (rather than simply report them), he offers little sense of who and what really mattered amid this deluge of evidence. Every so often, an event arises that we already recognise as crucial; yet Kogan puts no more emphasis on the fall of the Berlin Wall, the rewriting of Clause 4 or the Iraq war than on internecine tussles within the NEC. On occasions, he seems just lost for words: \u201cIn 1981 riots took place in Brixton in London and Toxteth in Liverpool. It was incredibly grim.\u201d The book\u2019s originality lies largely in its access to the key players of the past 40 years, who are quoted at length, making it a piece of oral history as much as anything else. Kogan is building on an earlier work he published with his uncle, Maurice Kogan, in 1981, and the roster of interviewees makes for impressive reading. The difficulty is that, all being on the record and each interviewee having a highly polished version of history they\u2019re delighted to share, the interview material is neither surprising nor scurrilous. Whatever one thinks of the Westminster lobby approach to political history, journalists such as Tim Shipman and Andrew Rawnsley can at least be depended on to dig up a little dirt. Not so when every voice is named. At a time of rampant distrust in politics and rising polarisation, there is certainly some value in committing events to the record in as consensual a fashion as possible. Labour\u2019s recent antisemitism controversies are a case in point, where Kogan\u2019s cautious attention to the record provides a welcome route through such fraught territory. He is obviously fascinated by the Labour party, while giving few glimpses of his own sympathies within the arguments he chronicles \u2013 an unusual combination. It is an odd sensation when reading the final chapters, which get as far as February 2019, to have the recent febrile political news confirmed in the style of a court reporter documenting who said what. But then who\u2019s to say that such an empirical, balanced and exhaustive account of political conflicts won\u2019t one day be invaluable to those looking back from some yet more divided future? \u2022 Protest and Power: The Battle for the Labour Party is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a320).
