And his \u201cconscientious objector\u201d solution to the problem of offensive titles, such as Order of the (now non-existent) British Empire (OBE), is to be welcomed. As one among many who has had to agonise, under a vow of secrecy, between respecting the wishes of anonymous colleagues putting forward the nomination and maintaining solidarity with fellow citizens, whose ancestors suffered under the yoke of the British empire, rejecting the honour is no mean feat. But issues of concern go further than this.</p> <p>Such class-based structures as the monarchical honours system, combining achievement with deference, are at the heart of the British establishment\u2019s resistance to socioeconomic change and to the principles of democratic accountability. New Labour when in office had the chance to reform the system but in many respects, through the profligate use of life peerages, helped re-enforce it.</p> <p>Enabling nominees to accept the honour, free of the title, would be a step in the right direction. But it would be better to cancel the patronage of empire altogether in favour of \u201con behalf of the British people\u201d.<br><strong>John Bynner</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s not just the giving of honours through a system based on a \u201clong-passed empire\u201d that is offensive.

      "bodyText": "Hugh Muir\u2019s questioning of the bizarre honours system from an ethnic minority standpoint is long overdue (An honours system rooted in empire is not fit for purpose, 29 July). And his \u201cconscientious objector\u201d solution to the problem of offensive titles, such as Order of the (now non-existent) British Empire (OBE), is to be welcomed. As one among many who has had to agonise, under a vow of secrecy, between respecting the wishes of anonymous colleagues putting forward the nomination and maintaining solidarity with fellow citizens, whose ancestors suffered under the yoke of the British empire, rejecting the honour is no mean feat. But issues of concern go further than this. Such class-based structures as the monarchical honours system, combining achievement with deference, are at the heart of the British establishment\u2019s resistance to socioeconomic change and to the principles of democratic accountability. New Labour when in office had the chance to reform the system but in many respects, through the profligate use of life peerages, helped re-enforce it. Enabling nominees to accept the honour, free of the title, would be a step in the right direction. But it would be better to cancel the patronage of empire altogether in favour of \u201con behalf of the British people\u201d. John Bynner London \u2022 It\u2019s not just the giving of honours through a system based on a \u201clong-passed empire\u201d that is offensive. The awards differentiate by social rank, from worker (BEM) to tradesman (MBE), and professional (OBE) to celebrity (CBE) and beyond (KBE). Add to that the tawdry corruption of awards to politicians, which in general devalue the same awards given to distinguished achievers in specialist fields, and it\u2019s not surprising that the whole system (apart from the Order of Merit) is no longer fit for purpose.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a July 2016 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/borisjohnson/posts/you-know-when-someone-is-losing-an-argument-because-they-suddenly-get-all-rattle/10153755801946317/\">Facebook post</a> backing comments made by billionaire Brexit-backer James Dyson, who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/22/dyson-to-move-company-hq-to-singapore\">moved his company to Singapore</a>, Johnson wrote: \u201cAs Dyson points out, tariffs would mean the Germans would be cutting their own throats.

BMW\u2019s intervention in the Brexit debate makes the German powerhouse the latest in a long line of carmakers to issue warnings about the impact of Brexit on the UK automotive industry, which employs around 850,000 people. Kr\u00fcger was speaking as the carmaker reported a 1.5% rise in sales to 647,500 vehicles during the second quarter of the year, although net profit fell 29% to \u20ac1.48bn (\u00a31.35bn) as the company invested heavily in electric cars. Figures released earlier this week showed that investment in Britain\u2019s car industry has ground to a halt amid fears over Brexit, with a \u201cpitiful\u201d \u00a390m pledged for new developments in the first six months of this year. Before Brexit clouded the horizon, the automotive industry was investing between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a32.7bn a year in R&amp;D. The Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders said a Brexit deal was imperative to help the embattled industry to bounce back, otherwise the government will face demands for the same type of tax breaks farmers need to stay afloat.",

Simon Bottery, a senior fellow at the King\u2019s Fund thinktank, recalls: \u201cThe Conservatives proposed a \u2018cap and floor\u2019 model. That would have capped the amount someone might have had to pay during their lifetime for care and the floor would have raised the amount of assets that someone could have had \u2013 from \u00a323,250 to \u00a3100,000 in cash and property.

However, it is regressive, with additional resources primarily focused on protecting the wealth of homeowners.\u201d</p> <p>Buckingham adds: \u201cOne option on the table could be a compulsory insurance scheme, as seen in Germany.

      "bodyText": "The justice secretary has suggested that the anonymity of suspected sex offenders and others accused of serious crimes should be respected until they are charged if they have a reputation to protect. Robert Buckland QC was asked if he supported a campaign to ban the naming of those arrested on suspicion of rape and other sexual offences, which has been led by Sir Cliff Richard and the radio presenter Paul Gambaccini, both falsely accused of historical sex offences. The qualified barrister told the Times there was \u201cmerit\u201d in extending this principle to all serious crimes. No 10 distanced itself from Buckland\u2019s remarks on Wednesday evening and said they did not reflect government policy.Buckland told the Times (paywall): \u201cLet\u2019s say you are a reputable local businessperson who is accused of fraud. Your good name is going to be really undermined by this mere accusation. You are a person of good character. That might be a meritorious case for anonymity. \u201cLet\u2019s say you are a person with a list of previous convictions. You\u2019ve committed offences. There is intelligence out there that suggests that other victims might come forward. Is that a case where anonymity should be automatic?\u201d Official guidance over whether arrested suspects\u2019 names should be published ahead of charge is mixed, but the names are often disclosed by other means \u2013 particularly in high-profile cases. Buckland\u2019s suggestion comes after the trial and conviction of Carl Beech, who anonymously falsely accused senior political figures of sexual abuse and murder. The case has reignited the debate over whether those accused of sexual offences should be named before they are charged. Police took almost a year to announce that Gambaccini would not face charges as there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him, despite the fact he was named directly after he was arrested in 2013. Similarly, Richard was named after his Berkshire flat was raided in 2014 and he was forced to publicly deny the widely circulated false allegations before police confirmed he would not be charged in 2016. Chris Henley QC, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), said open justice was a fundamental and valuable cornerstone of the British system and that secret arrests were \u201cthe hallmark of oppressive regimes\u201d. \u201cWhilst the police behaved lamentably in the Cliff Richard and Paul Gambaccini cases, it would be profoundly wrong to divide suspects into \u2018people like us\u2019 who are allowed anonymity, and the rest of society who are not,\u201d he said. The CBA said authorities should focus on investing in police resources to allow investigations to be conducted thoroughly and in a timely manner, while warning of possible future scenarios in which politicians could evade scrutiny in the event of their arrest. \u201cThe public should be concerned about the unforeseen consequences of allowing anonymity to creep into the system,\u201d a spokesperson said.",
