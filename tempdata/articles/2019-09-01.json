Brenda Edwards Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria \u2022 As a student in the 60s I worked at Fletcher\u2019s Bakery in Sheffield during the holidays, a nine-mile cycle ride away. During my short break I was able to check the delivery vans and on most occasions they did have cakes and pies left over from the previous deliveries. I confess to not being able to resist the temptation (Letters, 29 August). Their custard tarts made the long ride a little more acceptable. Michael White Tillington, Herefordshire \u2022 Cleaning company van seen in Kidderminster stating, \u201cNo dusters are left in this vehicle overnight\u201d. David Collins Kidderminster, Worcestershire \u2022 As G2\u2019s Pet corner (30 August) identified Jean-Jacques Rousseau as the owner of a dog named Sultan, was he not dissimulating when he identified himself as a solitary walker? Ed Lilley Bristol \u2022 Our border collie, Jess, is not vegan (Give your dog a plant-based bone, 31 August), but is very happy scrumping under our apple and pear trees.

      "body": "<p>This week is set to be a historic one in Westminster, as MPs attempt to legislate to stop a no-deal Brexit and government whips go into overdrive to stem a rebellion in the House of Commons. A spending review and possible attempts to stop the prorogation of parliament are in the mix as well. Here\u2019s how the week is expected to play out:</p> \n<h2>Monday</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A meeting due to take place between Boris Johnson and former Conservative cabinet ministers including Philip Hammond and David Gauke, was cancelled on Sunday night. Hammond declined a one-to-one meeting, calling it \u201cdiscourteous\u201d to cancel on the group. Parliament still in recess.</p> \n<h2>Tuesday</h2> \n<p>MPs officially return to Westminster, though in practice many are likely to arrive on Monday.</p> \n<p>It will be the first opportunity for the Speaker, John Bercow, to give his response from the chair on the decision to prorogue parliament, a move he has described as a constitutional outrage.</p> \n<p>The first step for rebel MPs in trying to stop a no-deal Brexit is likely to be a request for an emergency debate under standing order 24, which Bercow is likely to grant. In order for MPs to seize control of the Commons order paper \u2013 the parliamentary timetable for the week ahead \u2013 they will need to use the time to table a business motion and be permitted to do so by the Speaker.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8155cfc9-4f92-4da0-8485-66257baf0e4f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen\u2019s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills that have been passed during that session and summarises what has been achieved.</p>\n    <p>It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting.

      "bodyText": "This week is set to be a historic one in Westminster, as MPs attempt to legislate to stop a no-deal Brexit and government whips go into overdrive to stem a rebellion in the House of Commons. A spending review and possible attempts to stop the prorogation of parliament are in the mix as well. Here\u2019s how the week is expected to play out: Monday A meeting due to take place between Boris Johnson and former Conservative cabinet ministers including Philip Hammond and David Gauke, was cancelled on Sunday night. Hammond declined a one-to-one meeting, calling it \u201cdiscourteous\u201d to cancel on the group. Parliament still in recess. Tuesday MPs officially return to Westminster, though in practice many are likely to arrive on Monday. It will be the first opportunity for the Speaker, John Bercow, to give his response from the chair on the decision to prorogue parliament, a move he has described as a constitutional outrage. The first step for rebel MPs in trying to stop a no-deal Brexit is likely to be a request for an emergency debate under standing order 24, which Bercow is likely to grant. In order for MPs to seize control of the Commons order paper \u2013 the parliamentary timetable for the week ahead \u2013 they will need to use the time to table a business motion and be permitted to do so by the Speaker. If rebels can win the vote on the business motion, they can use the time to table a new short bill which will order the prime minister to seek an extension to article 50 to prevent no deal. It is still unclear how long that extension will be and how MPs can ensure Johnson will actually request a meaningful extension. Legal efforts to stop the prorogation of parliament will also get under way in Edinburgh, where the court will consider one of three legal challenges. Wednesday The chancellor, Sajid Javid, is set to present his spending review to parliament \u2013 though this will very much depend on how radically MPs have changed the order paper. It will also be Johnson\u2019s first prime minister\u2019s questions. The day is likely to be used to clear all the Commons stages for a bill mandating an extension of article 50. Thursday The high court in London is due to consider another judicial review of Johnson\u2019s plans to prorogue parliament, led by the anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller with other litigants including the former prime minister John Major and the Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson. It is unclear if the rebels\u2019 bill will have cleared the Commons by Thursday but there is a belief that it would be better to ensure it has reached the House of Lords as soon as possible because unlike in the House of Commons, peers can attempt to filibuster the bill with a huge number of wrecking amendments which must all be heard. Friday\u2013Monday Parliament is not due to sit on Friday or at the weekend but peers could table a motion to sit through the weekend and get through all of the potentially disruptive amendments. Johnson has reserved the right to prorogue parliament as early as Monday and if the bill fails to pass before parliament is suspended, the bill will fall. If the bill passes, rebels believe that the government cannot obstruct the Queen from giving royal assent so it becomes law. The situation if the bill passes is then highly volatile \u2013 it is possible Johnson could opt to call an early general election.",

You cannot find it in a bookshop or read it online. It has no manual or handbook. Instead, it is a delicate assemblage of laws, practices and institutions, built over centuries and held together by a fragile tissue of customs, conventions and understandings. It relies on trust and on a common commitment to its unwritten rules. That has allowed it to adapt and evolve, but leaves it dangerously vulnerable to the abuse of power.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s predecessors were often careless with the constitution, but none showed such contempt for its core principles. The United Kingdom is a parliamentary democracy, in which \u201cthe will of the people\u201d flows through our elected representatives. Our claim to be democratically governed rests on this slender foundation: that a government must command the confidence of the elected chamber. By wielding the royal prerogative to silence parliament, Johnson has struck at the foundations of our democracy.</p> <p>Johnson is perhaps the first prime minister in British history who does not recognise parliament, or a parliamentary election, as the source of his authority. He was placed in No 10 by 90,000 party activists \u2013 not much larger than a single constituency \u2013 whom he courted through his column in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>. He appointed Dominic Cummings to the heart of government: a man who months earlier had been found to be in contempt of parliament. Once, that would have disbarred him from office. Today, it is a programme for government.</p> <p>He will claim a higher mandate than parliament: \u201cthe will of the people\u201d, expressed in the referendum. Yet it gave no instruction on the terms of Brexit, a fact Johnson exploited to vote down a previous withdrawal agreement. Once we decide that someone other than parliament should interpret the referendum \u2013 that some heroic leader knows more truly what was in the mind of voters \u2013 we are walking a very dangerous road.</p> <p>In the short term, prorogation may succeed. If Johnson goes for no deal, it makes it harder for MPs to stop him. If he wrings some kind of package from the EU, it may frighten some into backing it. If all else fails, it clears the way for a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election.</p> <p>But at what cost? Like loggers torching the Brazilian rainforest, Johnson and adviser Dominic Cummings have traded short-term profit for devastating structural harm. They have set precedents that others will follow and scorched the fragile ecosystem of our democracy. \u201cConservatives\u201d once saw it as their responsibility to protect the constitution. How times change.</p> <h2>Peter Bone</h2> <p><em>Conservative MP and adviser to Leave Means Leave </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fc125c048a59836dd81c3e8fc9613e0e23ca890d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc125c048a59836dd81c3e8fc9613e0e23ca890d/424_255_1143_1428/800.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Bone.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Bone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, there is a coup being attempted, but it\u2019s not by the government. It is by a group of hardline Remainers who refuse to accept the will of the British people.</p> <p>These non-democrats are trying to seize power from the legitimate government of Boris Johnson, and install a so-called government of national unity headed by Jeremy Corbyn, and stuffed full of uber-Remainers, with not a single Leaver in sight!</p> <p>The prorogation of parliament by Boris Johnson is a long-overdue restoration of parliamentary democracy. In fact, the shadow leader of the house and other opposition MPs have been demanding this for months. The current session of parliament covers three calendar years and is by far the longest since the civil war. Each session of parliament normally lasts a year. It starts with the Queen\u2019s speech, where the government outlines the bills it wants to get through in the next 12 months, and if it doesn\u2019t get them through in that time, it risks losing them.</p> <p>The opposition then have a number of days to debate and scrutinise , in detail, the government\u2019s programme. At the end of the debate it can try to amend the Queen\u2019s speech or defeat it. If the Queen\u2019s speech is defeated, it inevitably leads to a general election. It also resets the parliamentary calendar, which, under parliament\u2019s standing orders, allows opposition parties 20 days where they choose the motions to be debated, 35 days when the backbench business committee chooses the subjects to be debated, and 13 days when MPs can introduce legislation.</p> <p>Proroguing parliament clearly restores parliamentary democracy and is constitutionally standard. This is not an attempt to stop parliament blocking a no-deal Brexit. Had the prime minister prorogued parliament until 1 November, that would have been a constitutional outrage, and I would have been the first to call it out.</p> <p>If Jeremy Corbyn wants to stop a no-deal Brexit, he has to follow a simple course of action. On Tuesday, he calls a vote of no confidence in the government, and on Wednesday he tries to win that vote. He won\u2019t do that because he knows that he doesn\u2019t have the votes in the House of Commons and, more importantly, he doesn\u2019t have the votes in the country to win a general election. </p> <p>My message to Jeremy Corbyn is simple \u2013 put up, or shut up!</p> <h2><strong>Margaret Beckett</strong></h2> <p><em>Labour MP for Derby South</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d3b3c8bf70eb1ebc4c37fcb43c00a3550ec205e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3b3c8bf70eb1ebc4c37fcb43c00a3550ec205e2/3156_525_711_889/400.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Beckett.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Beckett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes. It\u2019s clever \u2013 which is the reputation of the PM\u2019s advisers. It\u2019s also ruthless and improper \u2013 which is also their reputation.</p> <p>Supporters claim having an autumn recess or prorogation and a new Queen\u2019s speech is \u201cnormal\u201d. Autumn 2019 finds us on the brink of the biggest constitutional change for more than 40 years. Yet a government without a working majority, led by a PM without a public mandate, seeks the longest adjournment for 70 years. This is not \u201cnormal\u201d.</p> <p>To me this is the latest, most dangerous, manifestation of a rolling coup parliamentarians have been battling since 2016. From the outset, Theresa May sought for powers to be returned to and exercised by the executive, not parliament.</p> <p>She had to be forced by the courts to accept that MPs should have any voice in the decision to trigger article 50. When detailed legislative changes were required, sweeping and unfettered powers for ministers were proposed. Almost every request for papers to be published or information shared was rejected and fought.</p> <p>The suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/20/theresa-may-indicates-mps-parliament-not-vote-final-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">MPs should be allowed a \u201cmeaningful\u201d vote</a> on her proposals was strongly resisted.</p> <p>The approach to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-loses-brexit-deal-vote-by-majority-of-230\" title=\"\">government defeats in the Commons</a> \u2013 once a matter of concern or at least embarrassment \u2013 became quite cavalier.</p> <p>In Opposition day debates the government stopped voting to defend their policies on any but rare occasions - usually when they thought that they might win.</p> <p>Concern was expressed even in the Conservative party, at this unprecedented but ingenious way of making the expressed view of the House of Commons nugatory, or meaningless, in its effect.</p> <p>For almost three years, government used and abused its considerable powers to control what MPs were allowed to debate and when, often hindering or even preventing the House of Commons from expressing its view on the government\u2019s handling of Brexit.</p> <p>When final proposals were known, debate and decision on them was delayed, week on week, month on month, blaming those who it was feared might not support the government. Then, when the government could delay no longer and it went down to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-loses-brexit-deal-vote-by-majority-of-230\" title=\"\">the biggest defeat in our parliamentary history</a> on its flagship policy, even this defeat was just ignored, and the government pressed on regardless.</p> <p>The parliament to which we were told sovereignty was being restored has been steadily sidelined, ignored and has now been silenced.</p> <p>So it is a coup \u2013 but it\u2019s just the latest step in the incremental trashing of our unwritten constitution, as longstanding conventions are disregarded and discarded. Dangerous precedents are being set.</p> <h2><strong>Michael Chessum</strong></h2> <p><em>National organiser for Another Europe Is Possible</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2eca9d8429e7b9681b72eb1ca9e4822c138ea7bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eca9d8429e7b9681b72eb1ca9e4822c138ea7bf/1844_343_1851_2314/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Chessum.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Chessum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vickie Flores/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An unelected prime minister is attempting to prevent parliament from meeting because it might disagree with him. His aim is to drive through Brexit \u2013 deal or no deal \u2013 by an arbitrary date in late October. In doing so, he hopes to solidify a huge parliamentary majority in a snap election marked by a rightwing populist campaign demonising foreigners and what he will decry as the political elite. He is, as Britain\u2019s 20th Etonian prime minister, apparently not a member of this elite himself.</p> <p>The longer-term aim of Johnson\u2019s plan goes much deeper. Brexit Britain is to be a deregulated country, brought closer into the orbit of Trump\u2019s America. Workers\u2019 rights, food standards and environmental protections are to be undermined. Public services and the NHS will, as made clear by the US government, be up for sale. Naturally, there is little to no public support for this agenda, and no majority for it in parliament. So Johnson does not want to allow either the public or MPs to vote on it until it is too late.</p> <p>Parliament has not been completely shut down. The press is still free. But not all coups come with tanks and internet shutdowns. Yes, we have our civil rights \u2013 but try telling that to the millions of migrants who face a future of uncertainty, and even deportation, if the government goes ahead with abruptly ending free movement. The executive is waging war on the legislature, and it might win if we do not mobilise to stop it.</p> <p>This government is not going to be persuaded by strength of argument. It must be forced to reverse course. Hopefully, the opposition parties will win this week in the Commons, but as citizens we must understand that we cannot rely on parliamentary process, or the judiciary. The little democracy we have was fought for, bled for, by mass movements which stretched the boundaries of legitimate dissent. If protest movements are not willing to disrupt, they are toothless.</p> <p>The suspension of parliament is not some maverick act of hubris. The shutting down of democracy, the attacks on rights, the absurd claim to represent the people while denying them agency \u2013 these are the essence of the Brexit project. Brexit is not the end \u2013 it is a tool to entrench power and privilege, to divide working people against each other, and aggrandise the sociopaths who fronted the Leave campaign and now occupy No 10. This absurd, dangerous moment is the natural conclusion of Brexit. This is its true meaning.</p> <p>We are witnessing the growth of a huge movement in defence of democracy. From Monday, we\u2019ll be protesting daily at 5.30pm across the country.

But is this outrage justified?</p> <p>Make no mistake, to prorogue like this is far from normal. Yes, a short prorogation (usually a few days) happens routinely between one annual parliamentary session and the next. But this five-week prorogation is the longest since 1930. It has also been triggered in the midst of a political crisis, with the clock ticking down to 31 October. It immediately follows a five-week summer break, during which MPs could not scrutinise the government\u2019s Brexit policy. Indeed, Johnson has faced just one day of parliamentary scrutiny since becoming PM. Should the prorogation go ahead, that would become one week\u2019s scrutiny over almost three months. By 14 October, when MPs are set to return, fewer than three weeks would remain until the Brexit deadline.</p> <p>No 10 insists that parliament was already due to break up for weeks for the party conferences. But this is disingenuous, for two reasons. First, it had not yet been decided. And second, MPs were the ones who got to choose \u2013 and looked increasingly likely to reject this. Prorogation denies them the choice. He has also largely scuppered the chances of a no-confidence vote. We knew the opposition parties were discussing this, but had not yet agreed on their alternative prime minister. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act provides 14 days to appoint an alternative government. But the prorogation cuts across this \u2013 and would leave as little as 24 hours to get organised after such a vote.</p> <p>So Johnson\u2019s actions are unprecedented, and appear designed to undermine MPs\u2019 desire to scrutinise his government, or even to remove it from office. In a parliamentary democracy, where the government is accountable to parliament, and exists only because it enjoys parliament\u2019s confidence, this is deeply problematic. Hence the various court cases challenging prorogation.</p> <p>Does this amount to a constitutional coup? In short, it\u2019s hard to define what\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in a system with an unwritten constitution.</p> <p>Proponents would argue that Johnson has not broken the letter of the law. But our constitution relies on conventions and precedents, not just law, and those very clearly have been broken. A \u201cpolitical\u201d constitution such as ours is a fragile thing, which depends on key players respecting norms and traditions. If they fail to do so they undermine it gravely.</p> <p>The dangerous precedents that would be set by prorogation apply around the world. Governments must not be able to shut down democratic legislatures just in order to dodge inconvenient scrutiny. This is an executive power grab, and when MPs return on Tuesday they should reject it loud and clear.</p>",

How times change. Peter Bone Conservative MP and adviser to Leave Means Leave Yes, there is a coup being attempted, but it\u2019s not by the government. It is by a group of hardline Remainers who refuse to accept the will of the British people. These non-democrats are trying to seize power from the legitimate government of Boris Johnson, and install a so-called government of national unity headed by Jeremy Corbyn, and stuffed full of uber-Remainers, with not a single Leaver in sight! The prorogation of parliament by Boris Johnson is a long-overdue restoration of parliamentary democracy. In fact, the shadow leader of the house and other opposition MPs have been demanding this for months. The current session of parliament covers three calendar years and is by far the longest since the civil war. Each session of parliament normally lasts a year. It starts with the Queen\u2019s speech, where the government outlines the bills it wants to get through in the next 12 months, and if it doesn\u2019t get them through in that time, it risks losing them. The opposition then have a number of days to debate and scrutinise , in detail, the government\u2019s programme. At the end of the debate it can try to amend the Queen\u2019s speech or defeat it. If the Queen\u2019s speech is defeated, it inevitably leads to a general election. It also resets the parliamentary calendar, which, under parliament\u2019s standing orders, allows opposition parties 20 days where they choose the motions to be debated, 35 days when the backbench business committee chooses the subjects to be debated, and 13 days when MPs can introduce legislation. Proroguing parliament clearly restores parliamentary democracy and is constitutionally standard. This is not an attempt to stop parliament blocking a no-deal Brexit. Had the prime minister prorogued parliament until 1 November, that would have been a constitutional outrage, and I would have been the first to call it out. If Jeremy Corbyn wants to stop a no-deal Brexit, he has to follow a simple course of action. On Tuesday, he calls a vote of no confidence in the government, and on Wednesday he tries to win that vote. He won\u2019t do that because he knows that he doesn\u2019t have the votes in the House of Commons and, more importantly, he doesn\u2019t have the votes in the country to win a general election. My message to Jeremy Corbyn is simple \u2013 put up, or shut up! Margaret Beckett Labour MP for Derby South Yes. It\u2019s clever \u2013 which is the reputation of the PM\u2019s advisers. It\u2019s also ruthless and improper \u2013 which is also their reputation. Supporters claim having an autumn recess or prorogation and a new Queen\u2019s speech is \u201cnormal\u201d. Autumn 2019 finds us on the brink of the biggest constitutional change for more than 40 years. Yet a government without a working majority, led by a PM without a public mandate, seeks the longest adjournment for 70 years. This is not \u201cnormal\u201d. To me this is the latest, most dangerous, manifestation of a rolling coup parliamentarians have been battling since 2016. From the outset, Theresa May sought for powers to be returned to and exercised by the executive, not parliament. She had to be forced by the courts to accept that MPs should have any voice in the decision to trigger article 50. When detailed legislative changes were required, sweeping and unfettered powers for ministers were proposed. Almost every request for papers to be published or information shared was rejected and fought. The suggestion that MPs should be allowed a \u201cmeaningful\u201d vote on her proposals was strongly resisted. The approach to government defeats in the Commons \u2013 once a matter of concern or at least embarrassment \u2013 became quite cavalier. In Opposition day debates the government stopped voting to defend their policies on any but rare occasions - usually when they thought that they might win. Concern was expressed even in the Conservative party, at this unprecedented but ingenious way of making the expressed view of the House of Commons nugatory, or meaningless, in its effect. For almost three years, government used and abused its considerable powers to control what MPs were allowed to debate and when, often hindering or even preventing the House of Commons from expressing its view on the government\u2019s handling of Brexit. When final proposals were known, debate and decision on them was delayed, week on week, month on month, blaming those who it was feared might not support the government. Then, when the government could delay no longer and it went down to the biggest defeat in our parliamentary history on its flagship policy, even this defeat was just ignored, and the government pressed on regardless. The parliament to which we were told sovereignty was being restored has been steadily sidelined, ignored and has now been silenced. So it is a coup \u2013 but it\u2019s just the latest step in the incremental trashing of our unwritten constitution, as longstanding conventions are disregarded and discarded. Dangerous precedents are being set. Michael Chessum National organiser for Another Europe Is Possible An unelected prime minister is attempting to prevent parliament from meeting because it might disagree with him. His aim is to drive through Brexit \u2013 deal or no deal \u2013 by an arbitrary date in late October. In doing so, he hopes to solidify a huge parliamentary majority in a snap election marked by a rightwing populist campaign demonising foreigners and what he will decry as the political elite. He is, as Britain\u2019s 20th Etonian prime minister, apparently not a member of this elite himself. The longer-term aim of Johnson\u2019s plan goes much deeper. Brexit Britain is to be a deregulated country, brought closer into the orbit of Trump\u2019s America. Workers\u2019 rights, food standards and environmental protections are to be undermined. Public services and the NHS will, as made clear by the US government, be up for sale. Naturally, there is little to no public support for this agenda, and no majority for it in parliament. So Johnson does not want to allow either the public or MPs to vote on it until it is too late. Parliament has not been completely shut down. The press is still free. But not all coups come with tanks and internet shutdowns. Yes, we have our civil rights \u2013 but try telling that to the millions of migrants who face a future of uncertainty, and even deportation, if the government goes ahead with abruptly ending free movement. The executive is waging war on the legislature, and it might win if we do not mobilise to stop it. This government is not going to be persuaded by strength of argument. It must be forced to reverse course. Hopefully, the opposition parties will win this week in the Commons, but as citizens we must understand that we cannot rely on parliamentary process, or the judiciary. The little democracy we have was fought for, bled for, by mass movements which stretched the boundaries of legitimate dissent. If protest movements are not willing to disrupt, they are toothless. The suspension of parliament is not some maverick act of hubris. The shutting down of democracy, the attacks on rights, the absurd claim to represent the people while denying them agency \u2013 these are the essence of the Brexit project. Brexit is not the end \u2013 it is a tool to entrench power and privilege, to divide working people against each other, and aggrandise the sociopaths who fronted the Leave campaign and now occupy No 10. This absurd, dangerous moment is the natural conclusion of Brexit. This is its true meaning. We are witnessing the growth of a huge movement in defence of democracy. From Monday, we\u2019ll be protesting daily at 5.30pm across the country. Join us at stopthecoup.org.uk. Meg Russell Director of the Constitution Unit, University College London Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament has sparked demonstrations under the banner #StopTheCoup. But is this outrage justified? Make no mistake, to prorogue like this is far from normal. Yes, a short prorogation (usually a few days) happens routinely between one annual parliamentary session and the next. But this five-week prorogation is the longest since 1930. It has also been triggered in the midst of a political crisis, with the clock ticking down to 31 October. It immediately follows a five-week summer break, during which MPs could not scrutinise the government\u2019s Brexit policy. Indeed, Johnson has faced just one day of parliamentary scrutiny since becoming PM. Should the prorogation go ahead, that would become one week\u2019s scrutiny over almost three months. By 14 October, when MPs are set to return, fewer than three weeks would remain until the Brexit deadline. No 10 insists that parliament was already due to break up for weeks for the party conferences. But this is disingenuous, for two reasons. First, it had not yet been decided. And second, MPs were the ones who got to choose \u2013 and looked increasingly likely to reject this. Prorogation denies them the choice. He has also largely scuppered the chances of a no-confidence vote. We knew the opposition parties were discussing this, but had not yet agreed on their alternative prime minister. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act provides 14 days to appoint an alternative government. But the prorogation cuts across this \u2013 and would leave as little as 24 hours to get organised after such a vote. So Johnson\u2019s actions are unprecedented, and appear designed to undermine MPs\u2019 desire to scrutinise his government, or even to remove it from office. In a parliamentary democracy, where the government is accountable to parliament, and exists only because it enjoys parliament\u2019s confidence, this is deeply problematic. Hence the various court cases challenging prorogation. Does this amount to a constitutional coup? In short, it\u2019s hard to define what\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in a system with an unwritten constitution. Proponents would argue that Johnson has not broken the letter of the law. But our constitution relies on conventions and precedents, not just law, and those very clearly have been broken. A \u201cpolitical\u201d constitution such as ours is a fragile thing, which depends on key players respecting norms and traditions. If they fail to do so they undermine it gravely. The dangerous precedents that would be set by prorogation apply around the world. Governments must not be able to shut down democratic legislatures just in order to dodge inconvenient scrutiny. This is an executive power grab, and when MPs return on Tuesday they should reject it loud and clear.",
