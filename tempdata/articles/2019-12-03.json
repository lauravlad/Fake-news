But they have also been anxious for him to respond to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s much-repeated allegation (which clearly has some traction with the public) that a Trump trade deal would pose a threat to the NHS, particularly via possible higher drugs prices. As a result, in an extended press briefing this morning, Trump staged an intervention in the election - while claiming to be doing the opposite. The intervention came when he was asked if the NHS should be included in trade negotiations. He replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ...</p> \n   <p>I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was, of course, disingenuous because one person who started the rumour was Trump himself, when he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/04/donald-trump-president-visit-uk-press-conference-may-visit-labour-calls-us-president-sexual-predator-and-racist-live-news?page=with:block-5cf68c758f08d4e6b70ddf37#block-5cf68c758f08d4e6b70ddf37\">in a press conference in the UK in June</a> that \u201ceverything is on the table ... NHS or anything else\u201d. Given Trump\u2019s reputation when it comes to honesty, his assurance may have little or no impact on public opinion, and it ignores the granular detail of how a trade deal could impact negatively on British healthcare (which almost certainly would not involve US companies buying NHS hospitals). But, for the Conservatives, it is at least a quote they can use.</p> \n  <p>On broader electoral issues, Trump ostensibly avoided the temptation to take sides.

I am not responsible for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s actions or lack of action, but my position on antisemitism is clear and I think for people who are worried about Corbyn on any issue, far better to have strong, progressive SNP influence on a Labour government, if there is to be a Labour government after this election, than not.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95c12bf18ea09d92dcbb26df16fe24edc9844d7a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95c12bf18ea09d92dcbb26df16fe24edc9844d7a/0_338_6971_4182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon posing for a selfie with a supporter in Perth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon posing for a selfie with a supporter in Perth.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T16:21:52.684Z\">at 4.21pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de67e238f0829bc521b5b6a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T15:59:41.746Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson is only PM because of me, says Farage</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Speaking at a rally in Bassetlaw earlier <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the Brexit party leader, claimed that his decision to stand down candidates in Tory-held constituencies might have cost up to 24 seats.

After the launch of the Brexit party in Coventry in April ... we managed to get rid of the worst prime minister we have ever seen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Interesting, this analysis is one that Johnson shares himself. In their excellent new book about the Theresa May premiership, <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/may-at-10\">May at 10,</a> <strong>Anthony Seldon </strong>and<strong> Raymond Newell</strong> quote what Johnson said to his supporter Conor Burns on the day of the final ballot of MPs in the summer leadership contest.

When it was put to him that those papers did not contain evidence of British officials agreeing that the US would get access to the NHS in a trade deal, Corbyn replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Clearly [the officials] were working under authority. And clearly there was a serious discussion about the relationship with access to public services and investor state protection, which is a very bad thing, in my view, because it gives multinational companies the power to sue national governments in an international legal process. That\u2019s already happened with Philip Morris tobacco and various governments around the world. I don\u2019t think we want any of that written into any trade agreement we have with another country. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn dismissed the significance of the claim in the Conservative election manifesto that \u201cwhen we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table.\u201d </strong>Asked about this assurance, Corbyn replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, it absolutely is on the table because they\u2019ve discussed patent extensions. And patents are the things that give us the very high prices for specialist medicines. And if we reduce the length of patents or, if there has been a public investment in those patent researches, we buy that patent, then we get cheaper medicines. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is what the Tory manifesto says in full on this point:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Corbyn said, if he became prime minister, he would be respectful towards Trump in their dealings. Asked how he would treat the US president, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will treat him with respect, as I would everybody else.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. If you\u2019d like to read more on today\u2019s Nato reception, my colleague Caroline Davies has the full story: And Andrew Sparrow has put together this detailed summary of the day\u2019s politics news: The faking of an email that was used to back up the Lib Dems\u2019 claims in a row with a news website over an embarrassing story was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d, the party\u2019s leader has said. A senior member of the party\u2019s campaign team was suspended over the debacle last week. This evening, the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has said: Clearly, as has been reported, that there was an email that was sent ... which was inaccurate, which was faked and that is not acceptable. There is an investigation. The member of staff has been suspended, and I am not going to comment further on staffing matters. There is an investigation. That particular incident is absolutely unacceptable and that\u2019s why we have taken the swift action and are investigating. We reported earlier that the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had said he was planning to confront Donald Trump over the plausibility of his assurances on the NHS during a reception at Buckingham Palace this evening (see: 2.44pm). There was some skepticism about whether or not Corbyn would be able to address the subject with Trump and the Guardian now understands he did not get the opportunity to do so. Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, were left out in the cold outside No 10 as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, were invited to go inside ahead of them. The world leaders arrived at the Downing Street reception together in the US president\u2019s car, the Beast, this evening. A choir ran through Christmas songs as guests began arriving, including Hark the Herald Angel, Walking in a Winter Wonderland and We Wish You a Merry Christmas. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, had arrived about 20 minutes earlier, followed shortly after by Justin Trudeau, then Angela Merkel, who stopped to admire the choir. The US president and first lady paused on the steps of No 10 for photographs but did not speak before entering. The prime minister has met the German chancellor and the French and Turkish presidents this evening to discuss Syria, Libya and counter-terrorism. A Downing Street spokesman said: The leaders discussed the broad strategic, economic and defence partnerships between their countries and agreed the importance of further deepening these, including through Nato. On Syria, the leaders agreed that humanitarian access, including cross-border, must be ensured and that a UN needs assessment should form the basis for getting aid to those who require it in the north-east. The leaders said they would work to create the conditions for the safe, voluntary and sustainable return of refugees and that the fight must be continued against terrorism in all its forms. They also agreed that all attacks against civilians in Syria, including those in Idlib, must stop. They noted their support to the constitutional committee process and the importance of UNSCR 2254. On Libya, the leaders reiterated their support for SRSG Salame [special envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salam\u00e9] to move forward a Libyan-owned political process, facilitated by the United Nations and supported by the Berlin Format. The leaders agreed that meetings in this format should continue. This is Kevin Rawlinson taking over the liveblog for the evening. My colleague Vikram Dodd has this report on the damning comments of the former head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, Robert Quick, who attacks the prime minister for peddling \u201ccliches\u201d about sentencing laws after last Friday\u2019s terror attack. Quick says cuts to police numbers have played the greater role in jeopardising public safety. Donald Trump has sought to counter Labour claims that the NHS would be at risk under a UK-US trade deal by saying he would not want it even \u201con a silver platter\u201d. With the election just over a week away, the Tories have been worried that any overt endorsement of Boris Johnson by the US president could backfire. But they have also been anxious for him to respond to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s much-repeated allegation (which clearly has some traction with the public) that a Trump trade deal would pose a threat to the NHS, particularly via possible higher drugs prices. As a result, in an extended press briefing this morning, Trump staged an intervention in the election - while claiming to be doing the opposite. The intervention came when he was asked if the NHS should be included in trade negotiations. He replied: No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ... I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it. This was, of course, disingenuous because one person who started the rumour was Trump himself, when he said in a press conference in the UK in June that \u201ceverything is on the table ... NHS or anything else\u201d. Given Trump\u2019s reputation when it comes to honesty, his assurance may have little or no impact on public opinion, and it ignores the granular detail of how a trade deal could impact negatively on British healthcare (which almost certainly would not involve US companies buying NHS hospitals). But, for the Conservatives, it is at least a quote they can use. On broader electoral issues, Trump ostensibly avoided the temptation to take sides. He claimed that he had \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election and, although he said he thought Johnson was \u201cvery capable\u201d, he also said he could work with Corbyn if he became prime minister. Asked about this, he replied: I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. This was also disingenuous because, only a few weeks ago, Trump had very clear thoughts on the election: he thought Corbyn would be \u201cbad\u201d for the UK, and he wanted Johnson to align with Nigel Farage. In a rare display of self-awareness that helped to explain his relative reticence, Trump also told the press conference today that intervening in the election would not be helpful because in Britain \u201cthey may not like me\u201d. During his day in London Trump also managed to send share prices falling around the world, by saying a trade deal with China might be more than a year away, and to traduce the French president, Emmanuel Macron (for being rude about Nato, of all things - even Trump himself once called it \u201cobsolete\u201d). So, on the Trump mayhem front, the UK got off quite lightly. Corbyn has cast doubt on the plausibility of Trump\u2019s NHS assurances and said he intends to take the matter up with the president at a reception at Buckingham Palace early this evening. As I write, it is not clear yet whether the two men will be able to have a proper conversation \u2013 or whether their encounter (if it happens at all) will not get beyond pleasantries. Channel 4 has been cleared of bias by the media regulator after replacing Johnson with a melting block of ice during last week\u2019s leadership debate on the climate crisis. Nigel Farage has claimed that Johnson only became prime minister because he launched the Brexit party this year out of anger about Theresa May\u2019s handling of Brexit. He may be right. A new biography of May claims Johnson has said something similar in private. Corbyn has apologised for antisemitic incidents involving Labour party members and said he was dealing with the issue. A host of leading cultural figures, including the actors Steve Coogan, Mark Rylance and Julie Christie, the grime artist Kano and the writer and environmentalist Naomi Klein, have united to back Corbyn and praised Labour for prioritising \u201cpeople and planet over profit\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for this evening. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. The BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil has said the Tories are still refusing to suggest a date for his proposed interview with Boris Johnson. These are from my colleague Damien Gayle, who is covering the anti-Trump protest in London this afternoon. And Sky\u2019s Sam Coates has the latest YouGov polling. Here are three polling-related stories/blogs that are worth reading. The Evening Standard says polling in London shows that Labour is increasing support. It says: In a big squeeze on smaller parties as polling day draws closer, Labour appears to be taking votes from the Liberal Democrats and Brexit party, which have both lost support. Labour\u2019s lead in the capital has improved to 17 points, according to the YouGov survey commissioned by Queen Mary University of London\u2019s Mile End Institute, and its leader\u2019s image has improved. But the poll marks a significant decline compared with its 22-point lead in the capital at the 2017 general election, putting at least two Labour marginal seats in danger. This table has the figures. Stephen Bush at the New Statesman says Labour is gaining generally at the Lib Dems\u2019 expense. He says: After weeks of what looked like noise within the margin of error \u2013 thanks in part to the fact that very few pollsters are now doing polls more than once a week, which makes it difficult to draw out trends \u2013 we can now say with certainty that Labour are gaining ground in the polls. They are not doing so at the rate they did at the last election yet, and the Conservatives remain ahead in the polls, but there is a clear trend: of Labour gaining ground thanks to defections from the Liberal Democrats and Greens. As I\u2019ve written repeatedly, you should pay very little attention to the headline figures, because they might be wildly wrong in either direction. As it stands, we are a normal-sized polling error \u2013 that is to say, if either or both of the parties are being systematically under- or over-estimated by three percentage points \u2013 from either a Labour minority government or a Conservative landslide. Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative deputy chairman who is now a polling specialist, says the latest polling he has commissioned shows Boris Johnson extending his lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the best PM measure. He says: Johnson\u2019s lead over Jeremy Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister has widened slightly to 17 points (44% to 27%) from 15 points last week. The proportion of Labour leavers naming Johnson is up slightly from last week at 40%, though still lower than when the campaign began. 84% of 2017 Conservatives name Johnson as the better of the two, while just 55% of 2017 Labour voters name Corbyn. The changes marked in the chart are from last week. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn Boris Johnson floated the idea of introducing charges for the NHS, including for ambulance visits, in a Spectator column in 1995, Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov has revealed. In his story Bienkov reports: \u201cIf NHS services continue to be free in this way, they will continue to be abused, like any free service,\u201d [Johnson] wrote in the Spectator magazine in 1995. \u201cIf people have to pay for them, they will value them more.\u201d He added that those who say \u201cthe future NHS should be for those who are genuinely sick, and for the elderly,\u201d are \u201cbang on the nail.\u201d Writing about his own experience of calling for an ambulance for one of his children, who then turned out not to be seriously ill, he asked: \u201cWhy should I not be charged, say, \u00a350 for that inglorious episode, a fraction of its real cost?\u201d Johnson added that \u201cit seems reasonable that the middle classes should be required to stump up for non-essential services they can well afford.\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has claimed that this proves Johnson has \u201cextremist views on the NHS\u201d and that he does not support the NHS being free at the point of use. At the time Johnson wrote the Spectator article he was not an MP. He has not expressed views like this recently, and the Conservative manifesto describes the NHS as representing \u201cthe best of this country\u201d, particularly because it is free at the point of use. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said that she does not trust Donald Trump when he says that he does not want the NHS to be included in a UK-US trade deal. (See 10.15am.) Responding to what Trump said this morning, and referring to what the president said in a press conference in Britain in the summer, she said: [Trump] said something different earlier in the year when he said it would certainly be on the table. So, I think he is hardly somebody who is known for you being able to trust what they say. Swinson also suggested that Trump\u2019s comments this morning had been coordinated with No 10. Asked if she thought they had been agreed with Downing Street, she replied: We can just remember what it was like when Trump went on Nigel Farage\u2019s radio show and said that he wanted Farage and Johnson to do a deal, and a few days after that that\u2019s exactly what happened ... I\u2019m sure they have had conversations whether he will be helpful or not during the time that he is here. At a campaign event in Perth, where the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart is hoping to increase his majority of 23 votes over the Tories, I witnessed a phenomenon that it\u2019s important to register is still ongoing: someone bursting into tears as they get a selfie with Nicola Sturgeon. \u201cHow can you not love her?\u201d asked a tearful June Abbott, 69, a long-time independence supporter after the first minister had apologised for making her cry. \u201cShe just feels like she\u2019s one of us.\u201d As cheering activists congregated around Wishart and Sturgeon at the city street stall, many reported what they believe is a change in mood towards their party since the last election campaign. The presence of a Brexit party candidate, who locals say has not been particularly visible, certainly helps in terms of hoovering up some former Tory voters, but Wishart himself was in buoyant mood, telling journalists that the two words doing best on the doorstep were \u201cBoris\u201d and \u201cJohnson\u201d in terms of winning SNP votes. Speaking to reporters during the visit, Sturgeon repeated concerns that Scotland\u2019s NHS was \u201con the line\u201d if a Tory-Trump post-Brexit trade deal were to take place. Asked about continuing concerns from the Scottish Jewish community about the SNP propping up a Corbyn minority administration, she said that she had yet to watch Corbyn\u2019s earlier remarks on antisemitism (see 11.32am), but added: My position is clear. We take action, as we did last week with a candidate [suspending Neale Hanvey, the SNP candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, after allegedly antisemitic social media posts came to light] where there is a need to do that. I am not responsible for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s actions or lack of action, but my position on antisemitism is clear and I think for people who are worried about Corbyn on any issue, far better to have strong, progressive SNP influence on a Labour government, if there is to be a Labour government after this election, than not. Speaking at a rally in Bassetlaw earlier Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claimed that his decision to stand down candidates in Tory-held constituencies might have cost up to 24 seats. He said: If we had stood against the Conservatives in those seats, I think you\u2019d have seen two dozen more Liberal Democrats led by Jo Swinson. Farage also claimed that he deserved the credit for Johnson becoming prime minister. He said: The only reason Boris is prime minister is because, earlier this year, I had had enough. After the launch of the Brexit party in Coventry in April ... we managed to get rid of the worst prime minister we have ever seen. Interesting, this analysis is one that Johnson shares himself. In their excellent new book about the Theresa May premiership, May at 10, Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell quote what Johnson said to his supporter Conor Burns on the day of the final ballot of MPs in the summer leadership contest. Johnson said: There are two people I credit for my emergence as frontrunner: Theresa May for her failure to deliver, and Nigel Farage, who exploited the position left by her failure to deliver. If you can bear reliving the last three years, May at 10 is well worth reading. Some of the revelations are extraordinary. Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, has posted a very good thread on Twitter explaining the extent to which drug prices would be an issue in a UK-US trade deal. It starts here. And here are his conclusions. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford Here are the main points from what Jeremy Corbyn said in his interview with Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 earlier about President Trump and the NHS. Corbyn said he hoped to be able to tell President Trump tonight that the NHS would not be for sale in UK-US trade talks. The two men are both attending a Buckingham Palace reception for the Nato summit. Corbyn said, if he got the chance, he would deliver a message to Trump. Asked what he would say, he replied: I will say: \u2018Welcome to this country. I hope you\u2019ll understand how precious our national health service is, and in any future trade relationship with the USA, none of our public services are on the table, none of our public services are for sale and investor state protection is not acceptable to our government when we\u2019ve won this election.\u2019 Corbyn also stressed that he would be polite. He was \u201calways polite\u201d, he said. Corbyn said he would ask Trump to change the guidelines issued to his trade negotiators to reflect the fact that the NHS was not on the table. Asked what he would say to Trump if Trump told him that he did not want access to the NHS, Corbyn replied: I will say: \u2018Thank you very much. I assume that will now be the basis of your administration\u2019s talks with our Department of [International] Trade.\u201d But Corbyn also expressed scepticism about the assurances that Trump has given on this subject today. Asked about Trump saying this morning that the US would not want access to the NHS, even if that were offered \u201con a silver platter\u201d (see 10.15am), Corbyn replied: I\u2019m pleased that he said that. But if that\u2019s the case, why have these talks gone on for two years. Why have they been kept secret? Why was, on a freedom of information request, the document only produced in redacted form? And eventually the full text has been released. And I think there [are] very, very legitimate grounds for very, very serious concerns. Corbyn was referring to the talks between UK and US officials described in detail in confidential government papers that were leaked and released by Labour last week. When it was put to him that those papers did not contain evidence of British officials agreeing that the US would get access to the NHS in a trade deal, Corbyn replied: Clearly [the officials] were working under authority. And clearly there was a serious discussion about the relationship with access to public services and investor state protection, which is a very bad thing, in my view, because it gives multinational companies the power to sue national governments in an international legal process. That\u2019s already happened with Philip Morris tobacco and various governments around the world. I don\u2019t think we want any of that written into any trade agreement we have with another country. Corbyn dismissed the significance of the claim in the Conservative election manifesto that \u201cwhen we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table.\u201d Asked about this assurance, Corbyn replied: Well, it absolutely is on the table because they\u2019ve discussed patent extensions. And patents are the things that give us the very high prices for specialist medicines. And if we reduce the length of patents or, if there has been a public investment in those patent researches, we buy that patent, then we get cheaper medicines. This is what the Tory manifesto says in full on this point: When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. Corbyn said, if he became prime minister, he would be respectful towards Trump in their dealings. Asked how he would treat the US president, he replied: I will treat him with respect, as I would everybody else. And also make very clear that any trade relationship with the USA will not involve investor protection for US companies and will absolutely not involve access to our public services, and crucially, of course, our national health service. And this is from my colleague Rowena Mason, who was with Boris Johnson in Salisbury this morning. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale From BuzzFeed\u2019s Mark Di Stefano Q: You have the lowest popularity ratings for a leader since records began. Does that worry you? Corbyn says he does not comment on polls. He will not start now. This is not just about him, he says. He says he has a lot of highly motivated candidates who want to win the election. The interview is over. Vine says they asked if there was a record Corbyn wanted to play. He says he was told Get Ready, by the Temptations. Corbyn says he would be an \u201chonest broker\u201d in a second referendum campaign. Q: What happens if your team negotiates a fantastic Brexit deal, and you can hardly contain your excitement? Corbyn says he can contain his excitement in all circumstances. Q: But what happens if it is so good that you should campaign for it? Corbyn says he wants the public to take the decision. Q: In your heart of hearts you are a Brexiter, aren\u2019t you? Corbyn says he has been accused of many things. He wants a prosperous economy, and for the people to make the final decision. Q: You are promising lots of free stuff. Can you afford this? Referring to broadband, Corbyn says this is an essential service. Q: The IFS says it is unlikely Labour will be able to raise the sums it needs for its plans. Corbyn says that is what the IFS says. He says Labour thinks it can raise the money. There is a debate to be had about this, he says. He says the Labour party has spoken to the IFS about this. Q: And, after the manifesto came out, you announced plans to spend \u00a358bn compensating the Waspi women. Where does that money come from? Corbyn says Labour would use the \u201cheadroom\u201d available. Is it right to break a contract with these women, he asks. He says these women paid into the system expecting a pension. Q: Shouldn\u2019t Labour have pointed out in the 1990s what the government was doing on this? Corbyn says Labour has said it will address this, and it will. And here are some lines from earlier in the interview. Jeremy Corbyn is being interviewed by Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 now. Q: Dave Merritt, whose father Jack was killed in the London Bridge attack, said he did not want politicians to exploit his son\u2019s death. But hasn\u2019t Labour done some of this as well as the Conservatives, by talking about spending cuts? Corbyn says he met Dave Merritt at the vigil yesterday. He says resources for prisons and the Probation Service are an issue. Q: But won\u2019t lots of people support the Tory \u2018lock them up and throw away the key\u2019 approach? Corbyn says this would require many more prison places. And eventually prisoners come out. Q: Doesn\u2019t this case suggest deradicalisation does not work? Corbyn says the government should not allow prisons to become a breeding ground for extremism. Here is more from what President Trump said in his press briefing earlier. Asked if he could work with a possible Prime Minister [Jeremy] Corbyn, Trump replied: I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. Trump also seemed to acknowledge that he might not be popular in the UK. This sounded new; on previous visits, he has been keen to boast about how popular he is in the UK. (He isn\u2019t.) In response to a question about the UK election, Trump said in the US, when he endorsed candidates, he helped them win elections. But Britain was different, he said. I\u2019ve won virtually every race that I\u2019ve participated in [in the US, where he has endorsed candidates.]. But this is a different country. I say often, in Germany they like Obama. The reason they like Obama is because Obama gave the ship away. He allowed them to take everything. He gave them things that I wouldn\u2019t do. I love Germany, I love this country, I love other countries. But I\u2019m representing the US. So they may not like me because I\u2019m representing us, and I represent us strong. President Obama did not represent us [strongly]; he gave everything away, and he shouldn\u2019t have done that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re still paying a price for what he did. So, I\u2019ll stay out of the election. Channel 4 has been cleared over its use of an ice sculpture to stand in for Boris Johnson during a debate on climate change, Ofcom has said. As PA Media reports, Ofcom said the prop \u201cwas not a representation of the prime minister personally\u201d, and that \u201clittle editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants\u201d. The Conservatives complained that the broadcaster failed to allow the former environment secretary Michael Gove to be its representative for the debate, during which party leaders faced questions over how they would tackle climate change. Rejecting the complaint, Ofcom said: Broadcasters have editorial freedom in determining the format of any election debate. Depending on the circumstances, they may choose to proceed without having agreed the participation of a particular political party or politician, providing they take steps to ensure the programme complies with our due impartiality and elections rules. In this case, the election committee concluded that, across the one-hour debate and a subsequent news programme, Channel 4\u2019s use of editorial techniques ensured that the Conservative\u2019s viewpoint on climate and environmental issues was adequately reflected and given due weight. The committee also took into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the prime minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants. The committee therefore considered that this programme, including the use of the ice sculpture, did not raise issues warranting further investigation under our due impartiality and elections rules. Boris Johnson said he could \u201ccategorically rule out\u201d that \u201cany part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiations\u201d, including pharmaceuticals, when he spoke to reporters during a campaign visit to Salisbury this morning. He described Labour claims that the NHS was under threat (see 9.19am) as \u201cpure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff\u201d. Asked if Donald Trump\u2019s support was an embarrassment to him, Johnson said: On the contrary and I have good relations with Washington, the president, with President Macron, Chancellor Merkel and that\u2019s vital for the UK and we\u2019ll be having a series of meetings \u2013 bilateral, trilateral of all kinds \u2013 in the course of the next couple of days. Any readers requiring an explanation of the \u201cBermuda Triangle\u201d jibe will find one on Wikipedia here. Like many of Johnson\u2019s cultural references, this one relates to something prominent in the media in the 1970s. Almost a third of voters now say they will vote tactically in the election, according to polling carried out for the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), with the proportion rising rapidly. The polling by BMG found 30% of people said they would be \u201cvoting for the best-positioned party/candidate to keep out another party/candidate that I dislike\u201d on 12 December. This is up from 22% saying this at the start of the election campaign, and 24% in a parallel poll last week. Only 51% of people said they would pick \u201cthe candidate/party I most prefer, regardless of how likely they are to win\u201d. The ERS, which has long campaigned for a move from the first-past-the-post electoral system to a proportional method, said the polling \u201cshould sound alarm bells for our democracy\u201d, adding that given the sometimes contradictory advice on who to vote for tactically in different seats, the election could become \u201ca lottery\u201d. In his ITV This Morning interview Jeremy Corbyn also said that he was \u201cvery sorry\u201d for \u201ceverything that has happened\u201d in his party regarding antisemitism. This came when he came under repeated pressure to say sorry from the presenter, Phillip Schofield. (See 10.56am.) Corbyn said: Our party and me do not accept antisemitism in any form ... Obviously I\u2019m very sorry for everything that has happened. But I want to make this very clear: I am dealing with it, I have dealt with it, other parties are also affected by antisemitism. Candidates have been withdrawn by the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives and by us because of it. We just do not accept it in any form whatsoever. Corbyn has apologised to the Jewish community several times in the past for his party\u2019s handling of antisemitism, but he caused controversy when he refused to apologise last week when challenged to do so in his interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. That interview was mostly rather bland, but at the end Jeremy Corbyn said something that at face value sounded very interesting. Phillip Schofield asked: Would you still be Labour leader at the end of, if you were prime minister, or whatever happens on 12 [December], would you still be Labour leader at the end of the next term? Corbyn replied: I hope so, yes, because I feel I\u2019m fit, I feel I\u2019m quite young enough to do the job ... and I\u2019m very determined to carry out what we\u2019ve got there, because we\u2019ve got [to] change our country, we\u2019ve got to change our society, we cannot go on with this massive division between the richest and the poorest, and call ourselves a decent, civilised country. So, I want to help people all across the country. And that\u2019s what I want our government to do. And, do you know what? I\u2019m absolutely looking forward to doing it, starting in Christmas week. Taken literally, Corbyn seems to be saying he intends to stay on as Labour leader for a full parliamentary term regardless of whether or not he wins the election. But, taking into account the context (ie, the reference to carrying out the Labour manifesto, and being in government) it seems much more likely that Corbyn was addressing the point about whether he intended to serve a full term as prime minister if he wins the election. (He does - or at least, he always says he does when asked this question.) There are very few people at the top of the Labour party who would expect him to stay on for another five years as leader if the party loses, and that does not seem to be what he meant to say. But I will ask the party for clarification. UPDATE: I have amended the paragraph above to say there are very few people at the top of the Labour party who think Jeremy Corbyn could stay on for five years if he loses. The original sentence said that was the view in the party as a whole. It might be, but we don\u2019t know that the membership as a whole thinks on this point, and some members would want Corbyn to stay on for as long as he wanted. Q: Aren\u2019t you exhausted by the campaigning? No, says Corbyn. He says he believes in public service. He believes in representing people. And he wants to have a society where we don\u2019t have food banks, or child poverty. He says he is inspired by the wisdom he encounters. He says he goes around with a note book. He writes notes everywhere he goes. He says everyone you meet knows something you don\u2019t. Q: What happens if you don\u2019t win? Corbyn says he intends to win. Q: But if you don\u2019t? Corbyn says his principles and life will be the same. Corbyn says, when he became Labour leader, there were no processes for dealing with antisemitism. He introduced those, plus a fast-track disciplinary system. And a system of education. He says a rabbi was attacked in north London this week. That was disgusting. He has discussed this with other rabbis, he says. Q: Will you apologise to the Jewish community for any antisemitism committed by Labour members? Corbyn starts an explanation. Schofield intervenes: \u201cJust say sorry.\u201d Corbyn says he is sorry for what has happened. He says antisemitism is a poison. You know what happens, from 20th century history, if it is allowed to continue. Q: Many people will fear that, if you tax big business more, prices will go up for everyone. Corbyn says people need higher wages. And we need to so something about child poverty. Raising wages is good, he says. He says he wants to invest in infrastructure and training. Q: President Trump said today he wants nothing to do with the NHS. And it has been claimed that you obtained a dossier about UK-US trade talks that the Russians might have helped to publicise. Corbyn says no one has suggested that that dossier was not accurate. Trump himself has said in the past that everything would be on the table in trade talks. Q: Diane Abbott has called for the abolition of groups like MI5. And you have called for similar things? Corbyn says he is not calling for the abolition of MI5. But he wants these organisations to be accountable. UPDATE: This question relates to an early day motion that Abbott signed in 1989. Abbott does not back the abolition of MI5 now. Jeremy Corbyn is being interview now by Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield. Q: Boris Johnson says in the Sun today that the country would not be safe with you as PM. Is that true? Corbyn says his first job as PM would be to keep people safe. That requires more spending on the police. And, internationally, we should not allow there to be vast areas of ungoverned space. Q: Should terrorists serve life sentences? Corbyn says it depends what they did. Sentences should be decided by courts. But the Prison Service is woefully underfunded, he says. He says the lesson from the London Bridge attack is that we need to improve this. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give an interview to ITV\u2019s This Morning. At his press briefing President Trump was asked about Prince Andrew. Trump claimed he did not know him. As BuzzFeed\u2019s Mark Di Stafano points out, the picture archive suggests otherwise. At his press briefing President Trump was most critical of his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, who recently said that Nato was suffering \u201cbrain death\u201d. Trump said Macron\u2019s comments were \u201cvery insulting\u201d. He also said has \u201cvery surprised\u201d at Macron\u2019s analysis. He said: Turkey responded by saying that he was brain dead which was interesting ... I heard that President Macron said that Nato was brain dead. I think that is very insulting to a lot of different forces. It has a great purpose. Trump said Macron was being \u201cvery disrespectful\u201d to other members of the Nato alliance members, and he attacked Macron\u2019s own domestic record. It is a very, very nasty statement. I think they have a very high unemployment rate in France. France is not doing well economically at all. It is a very tough statement to make when you have such difficulty in France when you look at what is going on with the yellow vests. They have had a very rough year. You just can\u2019t go around making statements like that about Nato. It is very disrespectful. Trump is not necessarily the best person to complain about people being rude about Nato. Before he became president, he called the alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d in an interview in 2016. Only this week he also called some of its members \u201cdelinquent\u201d. The Trump press briefing is over. According to Sky, he was only expected to say a few words at what had been billed as essentially a photo opportunity. Instead he took questions for around 50 minutes. I will be post more from what he said shortly. This is what President Trump said when he was asked if he thought the NHS should be on the table in trade deals. He replied: No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ... I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it. Trump has just been asked if he thinks Jeremy Corbyn needs to do more to tackle the problem of antisemitism in his party. He says he does not know anything about this issue. This is what President Trump said about the UK election. I have no thoughts on it. It\u2019s going to be a very important election for this great country, but I have no thoughts on it. But Trump also said he would be meeting Boris Johnson while he is in the UK for the Nato meeting. Asked if there would be a meeting, he said: I will be meeting with him, yes ... I have many meetings. I have meetings set up with lots of different countries. Asked why he was staying out of the election, Trump said: Because I don\u2019t want to complicate it. I\u2019ll stay out of the election. You know that I was a fan of Brexit. I called it the day before. I think Boris is very capable and I think he\u2019ll do a good job. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he predicted the result of the Brexit referendum in advance, when he was visiting his golf course in Scotland. As explained here, this is not true. Trump defends his policy towards North Korea. He has a good relationship with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, he says. He says if President Obama were still in the White House, the two countries would be at war. Trump claims he has become \u201ca bigger fan\u201d of Nato because Nato members have been flexible. He also says Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, is doing a great job. Stoltenberg is with him at this press briefing at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London, but Stoltenberg is not getting the chance to say very much because Trump is rambling on at length. Here is the NHS quote. Here are more lines from the Trump press briefing. Donald Trump is speaking to reporters at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence, now. He has also claimed he could work with Jeremy Corbyn. He could work with anyone, he said. This is from CNN\u2019s White House correspondent, Kaitlan Collins. As Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart report in their overnight story, No 10 has been very anxious for Trump to avoid doing or saying anything that would be seen as an endorsement of Boris Johnson because, given Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the UK, that would not be helpful. Trump seems to have got the message (although whether he can maintain his self-restraint for two days remains to be seen). Obviously, the claim that Trump has \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election is not true. He told LBC in an interview last month that Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cbad\u201d for the country and that Johnson was a \u201cfantastic man\u201d. These are from my colleague Kate Proctor, who has been covering a Jeremy Corbyn event in London this morning. Last night Jeremy Corbyn released the text of an open letter he has written to Donald Trump asking for assurances that the NHS, and drug prices in particular, will not be included in the proposed UK-US trade deal. It is one of those letters from politicians clearly not drafted in the expectation that it might receive a reply, but it is interesting nonetheless, particularly for the amount of detail it contains about the eight changes Corbyn wants to the American negotiating objectives for a UK-US trade deal. Here is the key extract. To assure the British public that the NHS and other UK public services will not be opened up to \u201ctotal market access\u201d and irreversible privatisation, and that all aspects of NHS pharmaceuticals procurement will truly be taken off the table in a US-UK trade agreement, I am writing to you today to ask you to request US negotiating objectives are revised as a matter of urgency so that they: Exclude any reference to pharmaceuticals. Accept the role of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to set the threshold for the cost-effectiveness of drugs for the NHS. Drop the demand for \u201ctotal market access\u201d to UK public services. Explicitly rule out any investor-state dispute settlement mechanism by which the UK government could be sued for protecting public services. Exclude any provision on regulatory exclusivities such as data exclusivity, marketing exclusivity, therapeutic exclusivity and other non-patent monopolies. Exclude any provision that could remove caps on the amount the NHS spends on branded medicines each year, including anything that might enable the US to take legal action against the UK\u2019s voluntary price access scheme. Ensure NHS patient data are fully exempted from digital trade and data sharing provisions in the agreement. Exclude any provision that would prevent the NHS from negotiating deals for the health service as a whole. A revision of the US negotiating objectives along these lines would go a long way to reassuring the British public that the US government will not be seeking total market access to the UK public services; that the NHS will not be on the table in US-UK trade negotiations; that a US-UK trade deal will not open up NHS services to irreversible privatisation; and that the US government accepts that our NHS is not for sale in any form. Corbyn also released this video making the same point. This video features a quote from Trump at a press conference with Theresa May in June saying the NHS would be included in trade talks. But when Trump was asked specifically about the NHS, he did not seem to know what the acronym referred to and later, after his comment provoked a major row, he gave an interview saying he did not want the NHS to be included in trade talks. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Simon Murphy. As reported earlier, in his Today interview Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was asked by the presenter Nick Robinson about his involvement in a book that advocated privatisation of health services. (See 8.21am) Raab said he has never personally advocated NHS privatisation. Robinson was referring to After the Coalition, a book published in 2011 and written jointly by Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Chris Skidmore, Liz Truss and Raab. At the time they were all Conservative backbenchers. Now three of them are cabinet ministers (Raab, Patel and Truss), Kwarteng attends cabinet as a minister of state and Skidmore is also a minister of state. The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has posted an extract from the book on Twitter. Some would argue that allowing private providers to supply NHS services (which happens quite extensively at the moment) does amount to \u201cprivatisation of the NHS\u201d, which is what Raab said this morning that he opposed. But others would argue that phrase implies the wholesale sell-off of the NHS, which is something quite different. More from Dominic Raab\u2019s interview earlier on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme as the foreign secretary also claimed the Conservatives have no plans to privatise the NHS. It comes after Jeremy Corbyn last week produced leaked papers detailed US trade talks which he claimed proved the NHS was \u201cup for sale\u201d \u2013 an allegation denied by the Tories. \u201c[We\u2019re] absolutely clear there\u2019s going to be no privatisation of the NHS under the Conservatives\u2019 watch or this prime minister\u2019s watch,\u201d Raab said. In relation to drugs, there\u2019s going to be no dilution of our protection of consumers in this country. Obviously we want the cheapest and highest quality medicines coming into the NHS, there\u2019s going to be no dilution of our position on that whatsoever. Asked about his involvement in writing a paper advocating privatisation, he said: You\u2019ve picked probably a snippet from a pamphlet written a long time ago, but I can tell you categorically I\u2019ve never advocated privatisation of the NHS. The Labour shadow minister Laura Piddock has dodged questions on reports suggesting Russia had a role planting a leaked NHS document that Jeremy Corbyn presented last week as proof the country\u2019s health service was on the table in US trade talks. Reuters reported last night that experts at Oxford and Cardiff universities, as well as the Atlantic Council thinktank, said the document\u2019s release on Reddit before it was seized on by Labour \u201cresembles a disinformation campaign uncovered this year that originated in Russia\u201d. \u201cWhoever did this \u2026 was absolutely trying to keep it a secret,\u201d Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told Reuters. \u201cIt carries the spectre of foreign influence.\u201d The story, which the Daily Telegraph splashed on today, led to questioning of Piddock by Sky\u2019s Kay Burley this morning but she dismissed it as a \u201cmassive distraction\u201d. Footage has emerged of Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade apparently arriving in north London to shouts of abuse last night after he touched down on UK soil in Air Force One. The US president\u2019s motorcade was given a frosty welcome as it passed through Camden, with yells of \u201cget out of here\u201d \u2013 and some ruder cries \u2013 from passersby caught on camera. The foreign secretary also said he sympathised with the father of Jack Merritt, whose son was murdered during the London Bridge terror attack on Friday, after he said the tragedy had been used to \u201cfurther an agenda of hate\u201d. Dave Merritt wrote an impassioned piece in the Guardian saying that his son would have been seething at how his death was being used. \u201cWhat Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge.\u201d Dominic Raab refused to accept that he had a fundamentally different worldview to that of Jack Merritt. \u201cI sympathise with the anguish of the family and can\u2019t imagine what they must be going through. The first duty that we\u2019ve got as a government is to take every measure we can to make sure that we don\u2019t see further families going through that same suffering and anguish,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Our duty is to protect the public and that\u2019s why, and you mentioned prison places, our manifesto is clear, we don\u2019t want to cut those, we want to increase them by 10,000. Of course, we want to reform and rehabilitate criminal offenders where that\u2019s possible but I think, in this case and in the level of very serious dangerous, criminal offenders, it\u2019s clear that some of those we will struggle to be sure that we can reform, that they will rehabilitate. We are absolutely clear, we will not allow the release of people onto the streets who present a danger. He added: \u201cAnd that separates us from Jeremy Corbyn, who has made clear he would be willing to see those sorts of dangerous offenders released.\u201d The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, claims he does not know whether Boris Johnson will be meeting the US president, Donald Trump, for one-on-one talks during his visit to the UK for the Nato summit. Amid claims that the prime minister is dodging bilateral talks with Trump, fearing it would hamper his campaigning efforts in the general election, Raab was evasive on the issue. \u201cI don\u2019t know the full range of bilaterals, those things are always very fluid,\u201d Raab told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Actually, the role of this leaders\u2019 summit, and we are hosting it, is for the prime minister to bring all of our north American and European partners together and show that through Nato we can be bigger than the sum of our parts. Asked to clarify again whether he does not know whether the two leaders will be meeting, Raab said: I said that the arrangements for bilaterals are always quite fluid because they\u2019re done on the margins. This is a meeting for Nato as a whole and the prime minister\u2019s job \u2026 is to bring all of our allies together in the same room, not syphoned off in bilaterals because we\u2019ve got this unity of purpose we need to forge to strengthen Nato and that\u2019s the leadership role that the prime minister is taking. Good morning folks, Simon Murphy here to take you through the morning\u2019s politics news as Donald Trump visits the UK for the Nato summit. Looks like the US president still had his attention on affairs back at home when he touched down on UK soil last night: From Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary Labour has promised to end what it calls the \u201chostile environment\u201d for disabled people in the social security system as part of a raft of plans to tackle discrimination. The party\u2019s disability manifesto, published on Tuesday morning, proposes a range of measures across welfare, public services, transport, housing and jobs to enable disabled people to live independently, be treated with dignity and respect, and participate fully in society. The manifesto promises to sweep away a hostile environment of prejudice against disabled people it says was promoted by government to justify nine years of austerity cuts, and replace it with system that ends poverty and offers people security and dignity. \u201cWhat British democracy needs right now is the advice of a cartoonist who doesn\u2019t even live in your wretched country,\u201d writes Guardian Australia\u2019s cartoonist First Dog on the Moon. The day ahead \u2022 Boris Johnson is expected to be campaigning in south-west England. \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a speech in London on workers\u2019 rights. \u2022 Jo Swinson is expected to visit a farm in the east of England. \u2022 Nato leaders are gathering for the alliance summit over Tuesday and Wednesday. The main talks will take place on Wednesday near Watford and Johnson will break off from election campaigning to play host. Good morning and welcome to another day in politics. Today, Donald Trump is in town and his presence in London today for Nato meetings is causing jitters in the Conservative camp, as the Tories worry about the US president\u2019s unpredictability and tendency to say things without necessarily thinking through the consequences. Trump is being seen as a potential liability for Boris Johnson in the campaign, amid Labour\u2019s accusations that a US-UK trade deal will lead to an NHS sell-off and higher drug prices for Britons, with the Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason writing that Johnson will seek to downplay his relationship with the president in light of the NHS accusations. Johnson has made clear that he would not welcome any input from Trump at such a sensitive time in the campaign, after the US president offered his endorsement over the summer. But Trump has a full two days in the UK and is expected to give a press conference on Wednesday. The Tories will be hopeful he says little or nothing to inflame voter fears. Trump will be among world leaders attending a banquet with the Queen tonight at Buckingham Palace. NHS nurses and doctors will lead a \u201cHands off our NHS\u201d protest starting at Trafalgar Square then heading down the Mall to arrive at Canada Gate, opposite the palace. Also protesting outside Buckingham Palace will be the family of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old who was killed in a motorbike crash in Northamptonshire in August. Anne Sacoolas, the 42-year-old motorist allegedly responsible, claimed diplomatic immunity and was allowed to return to the US. We\u2019ll have all the politics news for, so stay with us. I\u2019ve got the blog for the first hour or so, you can get in touch with me on Twitter. Thanks for reading.",

In energy, a Labour government would simultaneously be trying to cut prices for consumers while boosting investment and changing the make-up of the electricity and gas grid. Those goals don\u2019t all pull in the same direction. To dismiss the IFS stance as \u201cnakedly ideological\u201d, as the shadow chancellor John McDonnell did, is unfair. The thinktank\u2019s point is pragmatic \u2013 it\u2019s about the most effective way to achieve an outcome.</p> <p>The risk of confusion via complexity is surely real. Even in the world of FTSE 100 takeovers, there are countless examples of managements baffling themselves because they didn\u2019t understand what they were taking on. Labour\u2019s plans involve changing control of 5% of total UK assets currently held by private companies, according to the IFS numbers. The programme is enormous \u2013 and it\u2019s supposed to happen within a single parliamentary term.</p> <p>It would also be generous to describe the planning as detailed. We don\u2019t know the batting order, as it were, and Openreach and the big six energy supply companies were 11th-hour entries in the manifesto.</p> <p>It would be easier to support a nationalisation programme that was confined to rail and water. In rail, the track is already under public ownership and even the current government\u2019s adviser says the franchise system is unfit for purpose; the argument for a state-backed shake-up is excellent. In water, dividend-extraction at the English companies has been obscene in many cases.</p> <p>Elsewhere, though, the IFS\u2019s challenge matters: \u201cIt is unclear which of Labour\u2019s stated objectives could not be achieved via changes to the current system of regulation.\u201d Quite. The UK\u2019s regulatory system is loose by international standards, and the great advantage of simply tightening the rules is that you can do so easily. Shareholders would squeal but they would be have to fall into line because regulations are never set in stone.</p> <p>By contrast, nationalising five entire industries, more or less, in rapid succession is to take a risk with an important chunk of the economy. Forget the ideology; on a pure risk/reward analysis, it\u2019s hard to see the case for being so ambitious. A smaller nationalisation proposal would have been more credible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Shameful blocking bid falls flat on Inmarsat</h2> <p>The sport for the lawyers was terrific, but the attempt to delay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/25/uk-satellite-operator-inmarsat-agrees-34bn-takeover-by-consortium\">the \u00a32.6bn takeover of Inmarsat</a>, the satellite communications provider, was abandoned on the steps of the high court on Tuesday.

They just wantedmoney for shareholders, such as themselves, on the grounds that Inmarsat\u2019s value could soon be boosted if the US Federal Trade Commission allows the company\u2019s spectrum assets to be used for 5G services.</p> <p>Sorry, but that\u2019s a weak argument for blocking a deal that was backed by 80% of Inmarsat\u2019s shareholders in May. Investors knew what Inmarsat owns, even if they weren\u2019t focused on the spectrum possibilities.</p> <p>The hedgies folded after the bidders, private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Apax, said on Monday that they would cancel their offer if asked to pay more.

The thinktank\u2019s point is pragmatic \u2013 it\u2019s about the most effective way to achieve an outcome. The risk of confusion via complexity is surely real. Even in the world of FTSE 100 takeovers, there are countless examples of managements baffling themselves because they didn\u2019t understand what they were taking on. Labour\u2019s plans involve changing control of 5% of total UK assets currently held by private companies, according to the IFS numbers. The programme is enormous \u2013 and it\u2019s supposed to happen within a single parliamentary term. It would also be generous to describe the planning as detailed. We don\u2019t know the batting order, as it were, and Openreach and the big six energy supply companies were 11th-hour entries in the manifesto. It would be easier to support a nationalisation programme that was confined to rail and water. In rail, the track is already under public ownership and even the current government\u2019s adviser says the franchise system is unfit for purpose; the argument for a state-backed shake-up is excellent. In water, dividend-extraction at the English companies has been obscene in many cases. Elsewhere, though, the IFS\u2019s challenge matters: \u201cIt is unclear which of Labour\u2019s stated objectives could not be achieved via changes to the current system of regulation.\u201d Quite. The UK\u2019s regulatory system is loose by international standards, and the great advantage of simply tightening the rules is that you can do so easily. Shareholders would squeal but they would be have to fall into line because regulations are never set in stone. By contrast, nationalising five entire industries, more or less, in rapid succession is to take a risk with an important chunk of the economy. Forget the ideology; on a pure risk/reward analysis, it\u2019s hard to see the case for being so ambitious. A smaller nationalisation proposal would have been more credible. Shameful blocking bid falls flat on Inmarsat The sport for the lawyers was terrific, but the attempt to delay the \u00a32.6bn takeover of Inmarsat, the satellite communications provider, was abandoned on the steps of the high court on Tuesday. A crew of rebellious hedge funds, led by Oaktree Capital, dropped their attempt to get a higher price from the bidders. In one sense, that\u2019s a shame. Inmarsat is a rare example of a large UK tech firm and the takeover price looks too mean. On the other hand, the hedgies weren\u2019t trying to save the company for the nation. They just wantedmoney for shareholders, such as themselves, on the grounds that Inmarsat\u2019s value could soon be boosted if the US Federal Trade Commission allows the company\u2019s spectrum assets to be used for 5G services. Sorry, but that\u2019s a weak argument for blocking a deal that was backed by 80% of Inmarsat\u2019s shareholders in May. Investors knew what Inmarsat owns, even if they weren\u2019t focused on the spectrum possibilities. The hedgies folded after the bidders, private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Apax, said on Monday that they would cancel their offer if asked to pay more. It\u2019s the right outcome. It\u2019s a shame to see Inmarsat go, but the takeover code would be a nonsense if bids were replayed regularly in court.",

      "body": "<h2>Trump: I have no thoughts about buying the NHS</h2> \n<p>Donald Trump has sought to counter Labour claims that the NHS would be at risk under a UK-US trade deal by saying he would not want it even \u201con a silver platter\u201d. With the election just over a week away, the Tories have been worried that any overt endorsement of Boris Johnson by the US president could backfire. But they have also been anxious for him to respond to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/corbyn-trump-nhs-never-be-for-sale-labour\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s much-repeated allegation</a> (which clearly has some traction with the public) that a Trump trade deal would pose a threat to the NHS, particularly via possible higher drugs prices.</p> \n<p>In an extended press briefing this morning, Trump staged an intervention in the election \u2013 while claiming to be doing the opposite \u2013 when he was asked if the NHS should be included in trade negotiations. He replied:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly \u2026 I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This was, of course, disingenuous because one person who started the rumour was Trump himself, when he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/04/donald-trump-president-visit-uk-press-conference-may-visit-labour-calls-us-president-sexual-predator-and-racist-live-news?page=with:block-5cf68c758f08d4e6b70ddf37#block-5cf68c758f08d4e6b70ddf37\">in a press conference in the UK in June</a> that \u201ceverything is on the table \u2026 NHS or anything else\u201d. Given Trump\u2019s reputation for honesty, his assurance may have little or no impact on public opinion, and it ignores the granular detail of how a trade deal could impact negatively on the British healthcare (which almost certainly would not involve US companies buying NHS hospitals). But, for the Conservatives, it is at least a quote they can use.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"62ba7f6d-203a-4ddc-9d1d-a5941674e38c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2i-EOEx2JXw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Trump: I also have no thoughts about the UK election</h2> \n<p>On broader electoral issues, Trump ostensibly avoided the temptation to take sides. He claimed he had \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election and, although he said he thought Johnson was \u201cvery capable\u201d, he said he could work with Corbyn if he became prime minister:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with.

      "bodyText": "Trump: I have no thoughts about buying the NHS Donald Trump has sought to counter Labour claims that the NHS would be at risk under a UK-US trade deal by saying he would not want it even \u201con a silver platter\u201d. With the election just over a week away, the Tories have been worried that any overt endorsement of Boris Johnson by the US president could backfire. But they have also been anxious for him to respond to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s much-repeated allegation (which clearly has some traction with the public) that a Trump trade deal would pose a threat to the NHS, particularly via possible higher drugs prices. In an extended press briefing this morning, Trump staged an intervention in the election \u2013 while claiming to be doing the opposite \u2013 when he was asked if the NHS should be included in trade negotiations. He replied: No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly \u2026 I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it. This was, of course, disingenuous because one person who started the rumour was Trump himself, when he said in a press conference in the UK in June that \u201ceverything is on the table \u2026 NHS or anything else\u201d. Given Trump\u2019s reputation for honesty, his assurance may have little or no impact on public opinion, and it ignores the granular detail of how a trade deal could impact negatively on the British healthcare (which almost certainly would not involve US companies buying NHS hospitals). But, for the Conservatives, it is at least a quote they can use. Trump: I also have no thoughts about the UK election On broader electoral issues, Trump ostensibly avoided the temptation to take sides. He claimed he had \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election and, although he said he thought Johnson was \u201cvery capable\u201d, he said he could work with Corbyn if he became prime minister: I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. This was also disingenuous because, only a few weeks ago, Trump did have very clear thoughts on the election: he thought Corbyn would be \u201cbad\u201d for the UK, and he wanted Johnson to align with Nigel Farage. In a rare display of self-awareness, Trump also told the press today that intervening in the election would not be helpful because in Britain \u201cthey may not like me\u201d. During his day in London Trump also managed to send share prices falling around the world, by saying a trade deal with China might be more than a year away, and to traduce the French president, Emmanuel Macron (for being rude about Nato, of all things \u2013 even Trump himself once called it \u201cobsolete\u201d). So, on the Trump mayhem front, the UK got off quite lightly. Meanwhile Corbyn has cast doubt on the plausibility of Trump\u2019s NHS assurances and said he intends to take up the matter with the president at a reception at Buckingham Palace early this evening. As I write, it is not clear yet whether the two men will be able to have a proper conversation \u2013 or whether their encounter (if it happens at all) will not get beyond pleasantries. Channel 4 has been cleared of bias by the media regulator after replacing Johnson with a melting block of ice during last week\u2019s leadership debate on the climate crisis. Nigel Farage has claimed that Johnson only became prime minister because he launched the Brexit party this year out of anger about Theresa May\u2019s handling of Brexit. He may be right. A new biography of May claims that in private Johnson has said something similar. Corbyn has apologised for antisemitic incidents involving Labour party members and said he was dealing with the issue. A host of leading cultural figures including the actors Steve Coogan, Mark Rylance and Julie Christie, the grime artist Kano and the writer and environmentalist Naomi Klein have united to back Corbyn and praised Labour for prioritising \u201cpeople and planet over profit\u201d.

The faction split from the Liberal party when it joined Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s national government in 1931. In the 1959 general election, the group won 19 seats, three times as many as Jo Grimond\u2019s Liberal party. Its last few MPs, led by David Renton, merged with the Conservatives in 1968, the party was in talks about a Liberal reunion throughout its existence. The divorce had been over tariffs and free trade. Heseltine\u2019s appearance on the Liberal platform, alongside Chuka Umunna, therefore brought the story full circle.

      "bodyText": "Channel 4 has been cleared of bias by the media regulator after replacing Boris Johnson with a melting block of ice during last week\u2019s leadership debate on the climate crisis. The Conservatives had complained to Ofcom that last week\u2019s broadcast broke strict broadcasting impartiality rules after Channel 4 News refused to accept the former environment secretary Michael Gove as a stand-in for the prime minister in the seven-way debate. Gove then attempted to argue his way on to the programme, in a move that largely overshadowed the actual substance of the debate about the future of the planet. Johnson\u2019s head of communications complained to Ofcom about the decision to exclude Gove and alleged a widespread pattern of anti-Tory bias at the channel, referencing the head of news Dorothy Byrne\u2019s criticisms of the prime minister. Conservative party sources also threatened a review of Channel 4\u2019s public service remit in the next parliament as retaliation. Ofcom ruled that it was perfectly fair to insist only Johnson could represent the Conservatives given \u201cother participants had only agreed to attend on the basis that they would be debating against other leaders\u201d. They also concluded the decision to replace Johnson \u2013 and the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage \u2013 with an ice sculpture did not breach due impartiality rules. Ofcom concluded this was a \u201crelatively low-key\u201d way of empty-chairing the politicians \u2013 hinting it could have taken a different view if, as had been suggested in advance, the ice sculptures had been carved in the shape of the politicians. Ofcom \u201ctook into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the prime minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants\u201d. The regulator made clear there was no obligation for any of the political parties or politicians to participate in any particular programme \u2013 and broadcasters could empty-chair politicians as long as they found other ways to ensure standards of due impartiality were met. The regulator concluded that Channel 4 had fulfilled its obligation to represent Conservative viewpoints during the programme itself, and through a subsequent report on the following evening\u2019s Channel 4 News. Ofcom\u2019s rules on due impartiality require coverage of alternative views that is \u201cadequate or appropriate to the subject and nature of the programme\u201d, rather than providing equal airtime to all sides of a debate. Documents provided to Ofcom by Channel 4 show that the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, also tried to send a deputy because of her commitment to appearing at first minister\u2019s questions in Edinburgh on the same day, but was told that this would not be possible. Instead she dashed to the train from Holyrood and made it to the London studio just in time for the 7pm broadcast.",

Top stories The penultimate week of the election campaign began badly for Jeremy Corbyn as the Labour leader, grilled by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil, insisted antisemitism had not risen in Labour on his watch and resisted repeated calls to apologise to Britain\u2019s Jews. Things looked up somewhat, however, when he presented a 451-page dossier which he said proved the showing the US preferred a no-deal Brexit and was demanding the NHS would be \u201con the table\u201d in talks on a future trade deal. Apparently rattled by an in-depth YouGov \u201cMRP\u201d poll (of the kind that predicted the outcome of the 2017 election) showing the Conservatives on course for a comfortable 68-seat majority, Labour instigated a tactical switch from going after Tory marginals to consolidating seats they already hold and trying to win back leave voters. The Lib Dems, meanwhile, were told by their former leader Vince Cable that their policy of scrapping Brexit without another referendum \u2013 which looks like doing them no favours with voters \u2013 was \u201ca distraction and not a very helpful one\u201d. The Conservatives, for their part, were embarrassed by Boris Johnson\u2019s decision not to take part in a Channel 4 climate debate, prompting the broadcaster to replace him with a melting ice statue (thought not in the prime minister\u2019s image). Johnson claimed a Tory government would be freed up to give more state aid to struggling companies after leaving the EU, but faced criticism over whether he was prepared to face a Neil inquisition of the kind that had posed Corbyn such problems. The row is unresolved, but tragedy \u2013 in the form of a London Bridge terror attack that left two dead \u2013 prompted the BBC to invite the PM on to Andrew Marr\u2019s show anyway, where he blamed Labour for the early release of the killer and made a series of questionable and downright inaccurate statements. The independent and respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said neither the Conservatives nor Labour were offering a \u201cproperly credible prospectus\u201d in their respective manifestos.

      "body": "<p>If you do the kind of political journalism that involves talking to the general public, something faintly magical can sometimes happen. As events swirl around and you try to make sense of huge, complicated themes, a single conversation will bring everything into focus. And not via words alone: facial expressions, gestures, and the way individual words are emphasised can give you a vivid sense of how people think, and the way their feelings could create political change. The encounter might be fleeting, but a connection can be made; as one side understands, the other feels heard.</p> \n<p>Since 2010, we have been responsible for the Guardian video series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/anywhere-but-westminster\" title=\"\">Anywhere But Westminster</a>, in which we try to explore the gap between high politics and life as it is lived. With so much political coverage now based on opinion polling, we are interested not just in how people might vote, but what is behind their political choices. Vox pops have long been a crucial part of what we do.</p> \n<p>In the summer of 2014, our travels brought us to the town of Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. The local Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell, had resigned from his party and joined Ukip, then led by Nigel Farage. For us, the resulting byelection was a reason to visit the neighbourhood of Jaywick, which government statistics showed was the poorest place in England. It was here that we first got a sense of something potentially seismic. At that point, Ukip were largely understood as a new presence on the political right, who were appealing to habitual Tory voters. But things were shifting.</p> \n<p>When we arrive in a new place, the drill goes something like this. Find a location: a high street, or shopping parade; maybe a residential street, or the entrance to a railway station. Acknowledge the awkward nature of what you are about to do, but get over your nerves, and grit your teeth. Survey the people you can see. Then find your first potential interviewee, switch the camera on, and begin: \u201cExcuse me. We\u2019re making a film. Do you mind if we talk to you for a bit?\u201d</p> \n<p>In Jaywick, sitting on a bench on a raised step outside his house, was a retired man who had once been a railway worker in east London, and a member of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union. We shared his company for a quarter of an hour. Just about everything he said highlighted the unexpected turns politics was suddenly taking, and we have returned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/sep/15/ukip-england-east-world-upside-down-video\" title=\"\">the footage we shot</a> time and again. Sometimes, we don\u2019t ask for people\u2019s names (it can make people feel a bit like they\u2019re being interrogated), so we have always referred to him as \u201cStep Man\u201d. Our exchange began when we showed him one of Carswell\u2019s campaign leaflets.</p> \n<p>John Harris: \u201cSo you\u2019ve had one of these through your door?\u201d</p> \n<p>Step Man: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWhat do you think of him, and the fact that he\u2019s left the Conservative party?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cGood for him. It\u2019s about time somebody got up and spoke.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cRight now, what\u2019s wrong with Britain?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell, nobody\u2019s doing anything are they? It\u2019s all going around in circles. They do bugger all.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cHave they done anything for Jaywick lately?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cNothing gets done for bloody Jaywick.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWhat needs doing?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cEverything. Look at the roads. Look at the state of it. The alleyways, look. Look at it all. We\u2019re a backwater, aren\u2019t we? That nobody gives a shit about.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAnd do you think [Carswell], and Mr Farage, are any different?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cI\u2019m hoping so.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWho did you used to vote for in the past?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM <em>[Emphatically, before the end of the question]</em>: \u201cLabour.

Let\u2019s face it, he did sod all for this country \u2026 And now he\u2019s in Europe, pissing about there, making millions. He went more Conservative than the Conservatives.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cBut this fellow [Carswell], until a week ago, was in the Conservative party himself. And now you\u2019re going to vote for him!\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell, yeah. But he wants to make a few changes.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll help Jaywick?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cI bloody hope so.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cTime was, Labour was the party of the working man, eh?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cCourse it was.

A US radio series of that name began in 1932, sampling people\u2019s opinions about the presidential election that would bring Franklin Roosevelt to power. In 1961, an influential French documentary titled <em>Chronique d\u2019un \u00e9t\u00e9 </em>(Chronicle of a Summer)<em> </em>based a whole film around asking people on the street a simple but provocative question: \u201cAre you happy?\u201d Vox pops were popularised on British TV by the trailblazing presenter Alan Whicker (\u201cI went out with my cameras into the monstrous avenues of Houston, stopped passersby and asked whether they owned a gun \u2013 I discovered it wasn\u2019t a question of yes or no, but how many,\u201d he once said). By the time we started doing them, they were an established part of TV news packages \u2013 the bit that usually comes near the end to show some \u201cextra views of the subject matter in hand\u201d, to quote one set of BBC guidelines.</p> \n<p>But Step Man represented something different. In the footage of our conversation, interviewer and interviewee are sitting at the same level, instead of a TV crew being ranged in formation against their quarry. The interview turns into an exchange between equals, and by the end, the power structure is reversed. In effect, Step Man told us not only that the old political certainties are dying, but also that a different kind of political journalism is called for. Reporters needed to go to places outside the traditional centres of power. The story must be dictated, not by a script they bring with them, but by what they find when they get there.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>The initial spark for Anywhere But Westminster was the headache-inducing tedium of covering party conferences. The first time we worked together, in the autumn of 2009, we walked out of Labour\u2019s annual gathering in Brighton and asked members of the public what they thought of the party\u2019s sudden fixation with a group of voters termed \u201cthe squeezed middle\u201d. In response, people talked about their exasperation with such phrases (\u201cI\u2019m working-class,\u201d said one man, \u201cwhy\u2019s it always about the middle?\u201d), and their overwhelming sense of distance from an event that was happening only a few minutes away.</p> \n<p>With the arrival of the coalition government in 2010, we believed there was a damaging estrangement between politics and the public. We decided to put this alienation at the centre of our work, and started travelling around the country, talking to ordinary people in places that were rarely visited by journalists, TV news crews or political reporters. The after-effects of the financial crash of 2008 had yet to make an impact on British politics, and the UK seemed locked into certainties that had prevailed since the 1990s. Viewed from on high, a lot of voters seemed either uninterested in politics or sufficiently becalmed that they would behave mostly as the main parties expected. </p> \n<p>But out in the country, dissent and resentment were bubbling away, and through the prism of vox pops, we were starting to understand what was happening. We talked to people who had strong opinions, but were often not the kind of voters who had either the time or inclination to make their voices heard via the traditional forums: party activism, public meetings, protest marches. As journalists employed by the Guardian, we needed to be fair and balanced, but not necessarily impartial. We were trying to expose our viewers to opinions they were probably not used to hearing. Our own views came into the conversations we had, and made these exchanges more equal, authentic and spontaneous.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9d9d2314951df568980b2597ae0ef0804981256\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9d9d2314951df568980b2597ae0ef0804981256/0_204_2448_3060/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Domokos filming in Merthyr Tydfil in 2016\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Domokos filming in Merthyr Tydfil in 2016</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Domokos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The people we met during this initial period have been stuck in our heads for years. From 2011: the two young men selling paintball sessions in central Birmingham \u2013 one of them just back from military duty in Afghanistan \u2013 who were lucky to even make the minimum wage, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2011/sep/21/liberal-democrat-conference-economy-video\" title=\"\">completely detached</a> from politics. In 2013: the two older men in Merthyr Tydfil who answered our questions about the death of Margaret Thatcher by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2013/apr/12/the-big-thatcher-road-trip-video\" title=\"\">telling us</a> they still thought about the 1980s miners\u2019 strike \u201cevery day\u201d, and a 17-year-old student who did not know what a trade union was. In 2014 we met Debbie, a young mum from a council estate in Falkirk, Scotland. At a packed pro-independence public meeting on a Sunday night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2014/sep/17/scottish-independence-political-reformation-video\" title=\"\">she told us</a> that the referendum had ignited her interest in politics for the first time. It had been, she said, \u201cOne of the most exciting things that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d</p> \n<p>Standard TV news packages tend to be scripted by the reporter, and vox pops are added to show what the public think of the story that\u2019s just been told. For us, although we always pre-arranged some encounters, vox pops were the first thing we did when we hit town. The views we encountered then guided a lot of what we did. We asked the people we met where we should go next, or who else we should meet. If a conversation with someone was particularly interesting, we would take their number, with a view to meeting them again.</p> \n<p>The films we were making were shaped by what we divined from talking to people, rather than the other way round. When we spoke to people for any length of time, our questions tended not to begin with \u201cWho are you going to vote for?\u201d or \u201cWhat do you think about Brexit?\u201d, but much more open, contextual lines of enquiry: \u201cWhat\u2019s it like living here?\u201d or \u201cHow do you feel about the future?\u201d We did not wear suits, or carry off-puttingly cumbersome equipment, or shine lights in people\u2019s faces. If the interviewee had the time, the conversation often lasted for 10 or 15 minutes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b08cd7ef-c695-42ce-937e-851fd5b4dff9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Never seen Anywhere But Westminster?

It was also becoming unsustainable. \u201cThey\u2019re all in it for themselves, they don\u2019t care about us\u201d may have become the great cliche of vox pop journalism. But before it was a cliche, it was a warning.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>From the early 1990s until around 2010, mainstream debate was personified by such politicians as Tony Blair and Bill Clinton: men with an alleged genius for understanding public sentiment, and manipulating it. But since then, politics has been upended. Within a couple of years of David Cameron taking power, an often angry and unpredictable public was starting to render the usual rituals \u2013 big speeches, appearances on daytime TV \u2013 increasingly useless. Now, three years after Cameron left the stage, voters increasingly set the agenda. Not surprisingly, the vox pop \u2013 the literal \u201cvoice of the people\u201d \u2013 has itself become the focus of angry debate.</p> \n<p>Last month, an Ofcom review found that many viewers thought the use of vox pops in the BBC\u2019s news and current affairs coverage gave more prominence to extreme views at the expense of the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d. On Twitter you will find hundreds of tweets expressing exasperation with the form. There is a certain irony in people who habitually sound off online taking issue with other people voicing their opinions, but that doesn\u2019t seem to stem the torrent: \u201cI\u2019m fed up of seeing vox pops of closet racist Dave from Blackpool and closet xenophobe Tony from Skegness.\u201d \u201cBan all vox pops on the news. I really don\u2019t care what Pete the electrician from Stoke-on-Trent thinks about constitutional law.\u201d \u201cAnother day, another set of BBC vox pops from a load of pensioners at a ballroom dance.\u201d</p> \n<p>In March this year, as Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal collided with parliament, the writer and comedian David Baddiel expressed his dismay on Twitter: \u201cBBC News are once again doing that thing: \u2018We sent our reporter to \u2026 a Leave constituency, always. Because that\u2019s where people will be crossest. Which they think makes for better vox pops.\u201d</p> \n<p>Back in 2017, The Radio Times published a piece by the columnist Alison Graham: \u201cIf I were Queen of the world I would draw up an Act of Parliament on fancy notepaper banning television vox pops from the minute an election is called until the result is declared. Then I\u2019d give myself emergency powers to ban them for an unspecified period after that, too. Then I\u2019d hope that in a world where, thanks to social media, no opinion ever goes unexpressed in a torrent of online detritus, vox pops will surely, finally, be dead.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f82307cfa227c5ee6451ad34d43192febb0f7ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f82307cfa227c5ee6451ad34d43192febb0f7ca/72_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Harris interviewing a homeless woman in Dover in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Harris interviewing a homeless woman in Dover in 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Domokos/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>These furies seem of a piece with the regular explosions of annoyance about audience members on BBC1\u2019s Question Time, and viral mockery of the contradictory opinions of participants in radio phone-ins. Hostility to vox pops arises from the feeling that too much media attention is focused on a particular kind of leave supporter \u2013 white, old, working-class. It\u2019s true that the 48.1% of voters who backed remain often seem to play only a minor role in the media\u2019s portrayal of where Brexit sits in our politics, but there is perhaps a snobbish idea that some people are beyond the pale, and things would be a lot better if they were returned to a state of voicelessness.</p> \n<p>But there are questions to be asked about how vox pops are used, and what they say about the media\u2019s attitudes to so-called ordinary people. These interviews come at the end of a package \u2013 suggesting that the substance of the story has already been largely decided \u2013 and follow a basic formula: one for, one against, and one comedy reply.</p> \n<p>The superficial presentation of people\u2019s views in hasty vox pops is a key part of one of the biggest political stories of our time. In Britain and elsewhere, a constructed idea of \u201cthe people\u201d is now both central to events, and deeply problematic. The new breed of populist leaders use public appeal to justify a politics of division and nastiness. The same reductive approach is common to Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, the Italian politician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/09/how-matteo-salvini-pulled-italy-to-the-far-right\" title=\"\">Matteo Salvini</a>. Want to keep out immigrants? Build a wall. Fear for the nation\u2019s social fabric? Classify incomers by usefulness, according to the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/how-europes-far-right-fell-in-love-with-australias-immigration-policy\" title=\"\">Australian-style</a> points system\u201d. This kind of politics never deals substantially with the complicated, difficult stuff woven into a lot of people\u2019s sense of grievance \u2013 deindustrialisation, housing shortages, a world that has long since started moving into an era of automation and insecurity. In the populist worldview, \u201cthe people\u201d are one-dimensional; so are the solutions. </p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>On Wednesday 6 May 2015, opinion polls were still suggesting the next day\u2019s election would be very close. In the weeks immediately beforehand, 56% of published polls had put Labour ahead. That day, we published a film put together over two days talking to people in the bellwether Midlands constituency of Nuneaton. We had been exploring the effects of five years of austerity, and a narrative had taken shape in our heads that the country might be ready for a change. But the vox pops we did in Nuneaton hit us like a blast of cold air. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/may/06/nuneaton-election-2015-scottish-get-in-with-labour-were-done-for\" title=\"\">Our film</a> rejected the fashionable idea of a \u201cchange moment\u201d, and instead highlighted the tangle of resentments \u2013 against benefit claimants, immigrants, and the supposedly cushy lives of people who lived in Scotland \u2013 that seemed to be driving people\u2019s political thinking. It wasn\u2019t what we wanted to hear, but it was pretty much all we found.</p> \n<p>When the Conservatives won a parliamentary majority, there was a great deal of soul-searching among the editors, reporters and commentators who had been taken by surprise. Some theories held that there had been specific problems with the pollsters\u2019 methodologies (over-weighting particular groups of Labour voters, underestimating \u201cshy Tories\u201d). There was also general acknowledgement in the media that political journalism had relied too much on data, and not enough on qualitative conversations with voters.</p> \n<p>But something else was going on. In left-leaning political circles, people wondered how they had not seen the Tory victory coming. Part of the explanation came from an effect of social media, identified by the internet activist Eli Pariser in 2011 as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/08/eli-pariser-activist-whose-filter-bubble-warnings-presaged-trump-and-brexit\" title=\"\">filter bubble</a>\u201d: an effect of endless personalisation, which, he said, \u201cmoves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.\u201d</p> \n<p>We were not aware of it at the time, but doing vox pops had become a way of bursting our bubbles. By going to locations we wouldn\u2019t normally visit, and allowing random chance to dictate who we spoke to, we had rediscovered some kind of antidote to the data-driven approach of polling and the algorithms of social media.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/dec/02/oldham-byelection-corbymania-collides-reality-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4eyjx\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2417149\" data-video-name=\"Oldham byelection: Corbynmania collides with reality \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-565ec08de4b0ef1f44c55c93\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/12/02/151202Oldham3_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/12/02/151202Oldham3.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/12/02/151202Oldham3_synd_768k_vp8.webm\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/12/02/151202Oldham3_large.3gp\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/12/02/151202Oldham3_small.3gp\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/dec/02/oldham-byelection-corbymania-collides-reality-video\">Oldham byelection: Corbynmania collides with reality</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But by the end of that year, it was our turn for some soul-searching. A December byelection in Oldham West and Royton was the first test for the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. We arrived in town buoyed by the sense that we had successfully divined the likely result of the election, and by our early coverage of the rise of Corbynism. It was raining torrentially for much that day, which makes for harder work than usual. We took cover in an indoor market, and got to work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/dec/02/oldham-byelection-corbymania-collides-reality-video\" title=\"\">talking to people</a>. We were shocked by the hostility towards Corbyn among older Labour voters; in our minds, the force of their opinions signified a serious possibility that the party would lose the seat.</p> \n<p>In fact, Labour won with a majority of more than 10,000. We learned several lessons. First, predicting political outcomes was a mug\u2019s game. Second, we had been guilty of creating our own filter bubble, by relying too much on a particular type of voter found in a particular place. Statisticians call this \u201cavailability bias\u201d. In simple terms, you can\u2019t base political coverage only on the sort of people you find in a market in the middle of the day.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>In May 2016, the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU was looming. Polls were tight, but the general consensus was that the remain side would win. As we began a new series of Anywhere But Westminster, we were determined not to repeat our own mistakes. We spent a week driving from Merthyr Tydfil (we like it there \u2013 people talk) to Manchester, via the English Midlands. We had nothing set up: our only aim was to speak to as wide a variety of voters in as wide a variety of places as possible.</p> \n<p>We listened to Labour-voting leavers in Merthyr, and wealthier Eurosceptic Tory supporters in Leominster, Herefordshire. In the inner-city neighbourhood of Handsworth in Birmingham, we got a sense that assumptions of a remain victory were by no means well founded. There, we tested the received view of Brexit as a cause that only appealed to a certain kind of white person. At that point, many people were describing the respective sides of the battle as \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d. In a downpour, we spotted a British-Asian man taking shelter, wound down the car window, and asked him which side he was on. \u201cOut,\u201d he shot back. </p> \n<p>In Soho Road, the multicultural thoroughfare that is Handsworth\u2019s main drag, we talked to Sikh business owners \u2013 who, in defiance of the facts, seemed to think that people from EU countries were a drain on the state and on taxpayers, and other people whose support for Brexit seemed to be down to the decay and decline they saw in their immediate environment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9dc83916e78a53ea0b3d9192b8e63047ec1e51d8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dc83916e78a53ea0b3d9192b8e63047ec1e51d8/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On Soho Road in Handsworth, Birmingham in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On Soho Road in Handsworth, Birmingham in 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Domokos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We then went up the M6 to Manchester. At a university recruitment fair, 10 vox pops turned up only one leave supporter. When we asked them how they felt about the future, most of the students we met were optimistic. But 15 minutes drive away, in the deprived northern Mancunian neighbourhood of Collyhurst, the polarities were reversed. \u201cI fear for the kids \u2013 for my grandkids and that,\u201d said one woman. \u201cJobs, and things like that: so I\u2019m looking at pulling out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her neighbour had come to the UK from Malawi. \u201cI\u2019m looking at immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cI studied environmental health, and I can\u2019t even get a job. As a person that came into the UK, I\u2019ve seen the change. I know what is happening. It\u2019s affected me. And the thing is \u2026 I\u2019m pulling out.\u201d</p> \n<p>We stopped to talk to two women next to a burned-out pub called the Billy Greens. Close by was an abandoned playing field, where rusty goalposts protruded from an expanse of overgrown grass. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-welcome-to-the-divided-angry-kingdom-video\" title=\"\">The conversation</a> was brief, but it got to the heart of how the leave campaign had managed to frame its campaign as the vehicle for an unlikely kind of class war.</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cHow is Collyhurst doing?\u201d</p> \n<p>Woman 1: \u201cCollyhurst is coming up again. It\u2019s a really nice place to live. But we do need more money spent on it.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cHave people in power talked about spending money here?\u201d</p> \n<p>W1: \u201cThey\u2019ve had the gardens done, but that\u2019s it. Nothing else. There\u2019s nothing for the kids to do. Nothing for the kids to play on. Nothing at all. And yet it\u2019s a lovely place to live.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cBut booming, thriving Manchester\u2019s only 10 minutes\u2019 drive down there.\u201d</p> \n<p>W1: \u201cYears ago, when I grew up here, there were places to go: playschemes, and everything. There\u2019s nothing for kids. Nothing at all. You can look round and see.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cIt\u2019s home, though, right? You feel very connected to it.</p> \n<p>W1: \u201cOh yeah. [Pointing at the pub] My mum had her wake there, God rest her soul, in the Billy Greens.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWhat I find odd coming here, is that they\u2019ve spent millions of pounds regenerating the middle of Manchester \u2026 \u201d</p> \n<p>W1: \u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cBut you haven\u2019t had money spent here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woman 2: \u201cIn Miles Platting [nearby area], they closed the swimming baths and all that lot.\u201d</p> \n<p>W1: \u201cAnd the library. They\u2019ve got nothing. And I feel sorry for them. For those six weeks [of school] holidays, if you haven\u2019t got a lot of money, you\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d</p> \n<p>John Domokos: \u201cI\u2019m curious about why you think that happens: all the money gets spent there, not here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woman 1: \u201cIt\u2019s people with money.

But for us, the film that finished in Collyhurst helped to frame what had happened. Lots of analysis and data since that referendum has cast doubt on the idea that Brexit was some kind of working-class revolt. But all across Britain, in neglected places that rarely saw TV cameras, we had met people who were voting to leave the EU as a way of calling for change: to be heard. The idea of listening to the \u201cleft behind\u201d briefly took hold, and found its way into Theresa May\u2019s early speeches as prime minister. It felt to us like Brexit might be a turning point for Britain, and that the vox pop was somehow part of what was changing.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>A year later, Theresa May called the general election of 2017. Mostly because we had never been there, we decided to begin our coverage in the Cornish town of Redruth, where the last Cornish tin mine had closed 20 years earlier. Partly because tin is a crucial component in smartphones and electric cars, there had recently been talk of reopening the mine, something that seemed to interest a lot more people than party politics. The campaign had yet to ignite: the people we spoke to seemed largely detached from it, and the few people we could persuade to talk specifics said they would be voting Conservative.</p> \n<p>Theresa May was ahead in the polls, and there was a sense that right-leaning Brexit supporters would have things their way. But as we kicked our heels on an almost deserted, pedestrianised street, a man on a mobility scooter came into view, and clocked our camera. He would identify himself only as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2017/may/04/is-this-the-weirdest-election-ever-video\" title=\"\">the tin man</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tin Man: \u201cAre you making a film about the deprivation in this country? This fascist shithole?\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d</p> \n<p>TM: \u201cWell, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s that bad? Or do you not see it as it is? If you fell down dead now, mate, no one would give a shit. Isn\u2019t that a sign of a fascist country?\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cI meet a lot of people who seem quite cheered up, because they voted Brexit and we\u2019re getting out and things are going their way.\u201d</p> \n<p>TM: \u201cYeah, brilliant. Prices are going up, and it\u2019s costing another $30m to reopen the tin mine because of the fall in the pound. This wonderful country doesn\u2019t manufacture anything any more. We\u2019re totally reliant on Swedish mining equipment, which is costing us more money. It\u2019s not helping us, mate.

There are countries that do things differently. I want to vote against crony capitalism.

I\u2019m running around on a scooter that was given to me [by a friend]. I don\u2019t get any help from the government whatsoever. And this is after I put millions of pounds in the economy, working at the tin mine.\u201d</p> \n<p>JD: \u201cThe crux of this is \u2026 \u201d</p> \n<p>TM: [loudly] \u201cThe crux of it is, surely society can be better than this!\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWe met a woman down there who said she thought Jeremy Corbyn was dangerous.\u201d</p> \n<p>TM: \u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s a man who wants to change things for the better. Change the priority. Stop spending money on bloody war, feed and clothe the poor. Not one person excluded, yeah? And then we can start to progress as a species, for the first time ever.\u201d</p> \n<p>We met the Tin Man when Labour were 15 points behind in the polls. The encounter with him was cut into a short standalone video that was posted on Facebook. It quickly amassed 2.2m views, and he was the subject of a story in the Camborne and Redruth Gazette. Labour came within 1,500 votes of winning the seat.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Now another election is looming, and we are still doing vox pops. But in the course of the last three years or so, encounters between the media and the public have been so built into the Brexit moment that they have become ritualised.</p> \n<p>In terms of the sheer amount of vitriol, mistrust, mocking memes and conspiracy-mongering, we are arguably in the middle of Britain\u2019s first true social-media election. In some ways, Twitter is one giant vox pop. But there are crucial differences. Most people don\u2019t have a huge Twitter following.<strong> </strong>And the things that make vox pops both revealing and satisfying are absent: all context and local surroundings, all the non-verbal communication that humans use to signal respect and empathy.</p> \n<p>One thing seems particularly striking while going back through our archive of roughly 140 films, and probably more than 1,000 hours of footage: almost all of our encounters have ended on friendly terms. No matter what political differences come to the surface, the encounters usually proceed respectfully \u2013 that\u2019s how people tend to behave when they come face to face.</p> \n<p>Ten years of vox-popping has taught us that calling the results of elections is not our job. But if Anywhere But Westminster has one key purpose, it is to at least try to transcend the polarisation and mutual loathing. At the risk of sounding sentimental, we want people to listen to each other.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, after we had finished <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2019/nov/25/homeless-people-the-voters-without-a-voice-anywhere-but-westminster-video\" title=\"\">filming</a> in Southend-on-Sea, we drove the 30 miles to Jaywick, and went back to find Step Man. At the local convenience store, the woman behind the counter told us that people in Jaywick now hated the media: there had been too many programmes, she said, reducing it to a caricature of deprivation. The worst, she said, had been a Channel 5 show titled Benefits By the Sea. </p> \n<p>It was surprisingly easy to locate his house: the same red car was parked outside, and the bench was still there, propped against the wall. But when we rang the bell, there was at least two minutes of complete silence, before an upstairs window opened. There he was: paler and more gaunt before, and half-hidden behind the pane. We spoke for 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cHello there.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cHello. I don\u2019t know whether you remember us. Five years ago, we were making a film in Jaywick. We spoke to you on that bench there.\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cCan we talk to you again?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cNot really. I\u2019m not very well at the moment. I\u2019ve got emphysema.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWhat do you think of the state of the country?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201c[Laughs] Shit.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cDo you think things are better or worse than when we met you five years ago?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cGoing like that [moves arm downwards], isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cDid you vote in the referendum?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cOf course I did. And I voted to leave.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell, I want to be out. Nobody seems to know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAnd how\u2019s Jaywick doing?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cOh, the same old same old. Nothing seems to change in Jaywick. Jaywick just rattles along. Like the rest of the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAre you going to vote in the election?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWho are you going to vote for?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cI\u2019ve voted Labour all my life, and I\u2019m not going to vote for Corbyn.

The poor having a few bob in their pocket. Pensioners doing well. All looked after. Hospitals. None of this \u2026 Every time you go into hospitals, hanging about in corridors \u2013 I\u2019ve been there many, many times. Friday and Saturday night \u2013 all these arseholes who\u2019ve had too many shandies, cluttering it all up, and people lying on trolleys, here there and everywhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cAnd you\u2019ve had that experience?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cYes. Many, many times.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cWhen you voted for Brexit, was the NHS in your mind? The idea of bringing the money back?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cOf course it was.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cIt was a dirty lie, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cYou were a railwayman and you voted Labour all your life. You know of old that if we get Conservative governments, they don\u2019t make anything better.\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cYeah, but I can\u2019t see Corbyn making it any better.\u201d</p> \n<p>JH: \u201cThe conversation we had with you was a big thing for us. It changed the way we thought about politics.\u201d</p> \n<p>SM: \u201cWell \u2026 I hope we just get out [of the EU]. And do very, very well.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was getting colder: he was starting to cough. We said our goodbyes \u2013 \u201cSee you later, my old mate,\u201d he said \u2013 and he closed the window and went back inside, after we\u2019d asked him his name.

      "bodyText": "If you do the kind of political journalism that involves talking to the general public, something faintly magical can sometimes happen. As events swirl around and you try to make sense of huge, complicated themes, a single conversation will bring everything into focus. And not via words alone: facial expressions, gestures, and the way individual words are emphasised can give you a vivid sense of how people think, and the way their feelings could create political change. The encounter might be fleeting, but a connection can be made; as one side understands, the other feels heard. Since 2010, we have been responsible for the Guardian video series Anywhere But Westminster, in which we try to explore the gap between high politics and life as it is lived. With so much political coverage now based on opinion polling, we are interested not just in how people might vote, but what is behind their political choices. Vox pops have long been a crucial part of what we do. In the summer of 2014, our travels brought us to the town of Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. The local Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell, had resigned from his party and joined Ukip, then led by Nigel Farage. For us, the resulting byelection was a reason to visit the neighbourhood of Jaywick, which government statistics showed was the poorest place in England. It was here that we first got a sense of something potentially seismic. At that point, Ukip were largely understood as a new presence on the political right, who were appealing to habitual Tory voters. But things were shifting. When we arrive in a new place, the drill goes something like this. Find a location: a high street, or shopping parade; maybe a residential street, or the entrance to a railway station. Acknowledge the awkward nature of what you are about to do, but get over your nerves, and grit your teeth. Survey the people you can see. Then find your first potential interviewee, switch the camera on, and begin: \u201cExcuse me. We\u2019re making a film. Do you mind if we talk to you for a bit?\u201d In Jaywick, sitting on a bench on a raised step outside his house, was a retired man who had once been a railway worker in east London, and a member of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union. We shared his company for a quarter of an hour. Just about everything he said highlighted the unexpected turns politics was suddenly taking, and we have returned to the footage we shot time and again. Sometimes, we don\u2019t ask for people\u2019s names (it can make people feel a bit like they\u2019re being interrogated), so we have always referred to him as \u201cStep Man\u201d. Our exchange began when we showed him one of Carswell\u2019s campaign leaflets. John Harris: \u201cSo you\u2019ve had one of these through your door?\u201d Step Man: \u201cYeah.\u201d JH: \u201cWhat do you think of him, and the fact that he\u2019s left the Conservative party?\u201d SM: \u201cGood for him. It\u2019s about time somebody got up and spoke.\u201d JH: \u201cRight now, what\u2019s wrong with Britain?\u201d SM: \u201cWell, nobody\u2019s doing anything are they? It\u2019s all going around in circles. They do bugger all.\u201d JH: \u201cHave they done anything for Jaywick lately?\u201d SM: \u201cNothing gets done for bloody Jaywick.\u201d JH: \u201cWhat needs doing?\u201d SM: \u201cEverything. Look at the roads. Look at the state of it. The alleyways, look. Look at it all. We\u2019re a backwater, aren\u2019t we? That nobody gives a shit about.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd do you think [Carswell], and Mr Farage, are any different?\u201d SM: \u201cI\u2019m hoping so.\u201d JH: \u201cWho did you used to vote for in the past?\u201d SM [Emphatically, before the end of the question]: \u201cLabour. Always voted Labour.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd what changed?\u201d SM: \u201cWell, bloody Blair. Let\u2019s face it, he did sod all for this country \u2026 And now he\u2019s in Europe, pissing about there, making millions. He went more Conservative than the Conservatives.\u201d JH: \u201cBut this fellow [Carswell], until a week ago, was in the Conservative party himself. And now you\u2019re going to vote for him!\u201d SM: \u201cWell, yeah. But he wants to make a few changes.\u201d JH: \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll help Jaywick?\u201d SM: \u201cI bloody hope so.\u201d JH: \u201cTime was, Labour was the party of the working man, eh?\u201d SM: \u201cCourse it was. Course it was.\u201d JH: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d SM: \u201cBloody Thatcher got in \u2013 destroyed it, didn\u2019t she? Done the working classes, didn\u2019t she? Pissed the miners off. Done the railways. She pissed us all off, big time.\u201d JH: \u201cBut Ukip\u2019s full of people who think Mrs Thatcher was the bee\u2019s knees.\u201d SM: \u201cNah \u2026 \u201d JH: \u201cThey are! They\u2019re all Thatcherite\u2026 [Carswell] wants to shrink the state. He\u2019s no fan of the trade unions and the working man.\u201d SM: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he is. Nobody is, are they?\u201d JH: \u201cBut somebody with your politics shouldn\u2019t be voting for him.\u201d SM: [Defiantly] \u201cYeah, course they should.\u201d Vox pops have a long history. A US radio series of that name began in 1932, sampling people\u2019s opinions about the presidential election that would bring Franklin Roosevelt to power. In 1961, an influential French documentary titled Chronique d\u2019un \u00e9t\u00e9 (Chronicle of a Summer) based a whole film around asking people on the street a simple but provocative question: \u201cAre you happy?\u201d Vox pops were popularised on British TV by the trailblazing presenter Alan Whicker (\u201cI went out with my cameras into the monstrous avenues of Houston, stopped passersby and asked whether they owned a gun \u2013 I discovered it wasn\u2019t a question of yes or no, but how many,\u201d he once said). By the time we started doing them, they were an established part of TV news packages \u2013 the bit that usually comes near the end to show some \u201cextra views of the subject matter in hand\u201d, to quote one set of BBC guidelines. But Step Man represented something different. In the footage of our conversation, interviewer and interviewee are sitting at the same level, instead of a TV crew being ranged in formation against their quarry. The interview turns into an exchange between equals, and by the end, the power structure is reversed. In effect, Step Man told us not only that the old political certainties are dying, but also that a different kind of political journalism is called for. Reporters needed to go to places outside the traditional centres of power. The story must be dictated, not by a script they bring with them, but by what they find when they get there. * * * The initial spark for Anywhere But Westminster was the headache-inducing tedium of covering party conferences. The first time we worked together, in the autumn of 2009, we walked out of Labour\u2019s annual gathering in Brighton and asked members of the public what they thought of the party\u2019s sudden fixation with a group of voters termed \u201cthe squeezed middle\u201d. In response, people talked about their exasperation with such phrases (\u201cI\u2019m working-class,\u201d said one man, \u201cwhy\u2019s it always about the middle?\u201d), and their overwhelming sense of distance from an event that was happening only a few minutes away. With the arrival of the coalition government in 2010, we believed there was a damaging estrangement between politics and the public. We decided to put this alienation at the centre of our work, and started travelling around the country, talking to ordinary people in places that were rarely visited by journalists, TV news crews or political reporters. The after-effects of the financial crash of 2008 had yet to make an impact on British politics, and the UK seemed locked into certainties that had prevailed since the 1990s. Viewed from on high, a lot of voters seemed either uninterested in politics or sufficiently becalmed that they would behave mostly as the main parties expected. But out in the country, dissent and resentment were bubbling away, and through the prism of vox pops, we were starting to understand what was happening. We talked to people who had strong opinions, but were often not the kind of voters who had either the time or inclination to make their voices heard via the traditional forums: party activism, public meetings, protest marches. As journalists employed by the Guardian, we needed to be fair and balanced, but not necessarily impartial. We were trying to expose our viewers to opinions they were probably not used to hearing. Our own views came into the conversations we had, and made these exchanges more equal, authentic and spontaneous. The people we met during this initial period have been stuck in our heads for years. From 2011: the two young men selling paintball sessions in central Birmingham \u2013 one of them just back from military duty in Afghanistan \u2013 who were lucky to even make the minimum wage, and completely detached from politics. In 2013: the two older men in Merthyr Tydfil who answered our questions about the death of Margaret Thatcher by telling us they still thought about the 1980s miners\u2019 strike \u201cevery day\u201d, and a 17-year-old student who did not know what a trade union was. In 2014 we met Debbie, a young mum from a council estate in Falkirk, Scotland. At a packed pro-independence public meeting on a Sunday night, she told us that the referendum had ignited her interest in politics for the first time. It had been, she said, \u201cOne of the most exciting things that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d Standard TV news packages tend to be scripted by the reporter, and vox pops are added to show what the public think of the story that\u2019s just been told. For us, although we always pre-arranged some encounters, vox pops were the first thing we did when we hit town. The views we encountered then guided a lot of what we did. We asked the people we met where we should go next, or who else we should meet. If a conversation with someone was particularly interesting, we would take their number, with a view to meeting them again. The films we were making were shaped by what we divined from talking to people, rather than the other way round. When we spoke to people for any length of time, our questions tended not to begin with \u201cWho are you going to vote for?\u201d or \u201cWhat do you think about Brexit?\u201d, but much more open, contextual lines of enquiry: \u201cWhat\u2019s it like living here?\u201d or \u201cHow do you feel about the future?\u201d We did not wear suits, or carry off-puttingly cumbersome equipment, or shine lights in people\u2019s faces. If the interviewee had the time, the conversation often lasted for 10 or 15 minutes. As we spoke to people, we sensed that the gap between politics, the media and the public was widening. It was also becoming unsustainable. \u201cThey\u2019re all in it for themselves, they don\u2019t care about us\u201d may have become the great cliche of vox pop journalism. But before it was a cliche, it was a warning. * * * From the early 1990s until around 2010, mainstream debate was personified by such politicians as Tony Blair and Bill Clinton: men with an alleged genius for understanding public sentiment, and manipulating it. But since then, politics has been upended. Within a couple of years of David Cameron taking power, an often angry and unpredictable public was starting to render the usual rituals \u2013 big speeches, appearances on daytime TV \u2013 increasingly useless. Now, three years after Cameron left the stage, voters increasingly set the agenda. Not surprisingly, the vox pop \u2013 the literal \u201cvoice of the people\u201d \u2013 has itself become the focus of angry debate. Last month, an Ofcom review found that many viewers thought the use of vox pops in the BBC\u2019s news and current affairs coverage gave more prominence to extreme views at the expense of the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d. On Twitter you will find hundreds of tweets expressing exasperation with the form. There is a certain irony in people who habitually sound off online taking issue with other people voicing their opinions, but that doesn\u2019t seem to stem the torrent: \u201cI\u2019m fed up of seeing vox pops of closet racist Dave from Blackpool and closet xenophobe Tony from Skegness.\u201d \u201cBan all vox pops on the news. I really don\u2019t care what Pete the electrician from Stoke-on-Trent thinks about constitutional law.\u201d \u201cAnother day, another set of BBC vox pops from a load of pensioners at a ballroom dance.\u201d In March this year, as Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal collided with parliament, the writer and comedian David Baddiel expressed his dismay on Twitter: \u201cBBC News are once again doing that thing: \u2018We sent our reporter to \u2026 a Leave constituency, always. Because that\u2019s where people will be crossest. Which they think makes for better vox pops.\u201d Back in 2017, The Radio Times published a piece by the columnist Alison Graham: \u201cIf I were Queen of the world I would draw up an Act of Parliament on fancy notepaper banning television vox pops from the minute an election is called until the result is declared. Then I\u2019d give myself emergency powers to ban them for an unspecified period after that, too. Then I\u2019d hope that in a world where, thanks to social media, no opinion ever goes unexpressed in a torrent of online detritus, vox pops will surely, finally, be dead.\u201d These furies seem of a piece with the regular explosions of annoyance about audience members on BBC1\u2019s Question Time, and viral mockery of the contradictory opinions of participants in radio phone-ins. Hostility to vox pops arises from the feeling that too much media attention is focused on a particular kind of leave supporter \u2013 white, old, working-class. It\u2019s true that the 48.1% of voters who backed remain often seem to play only a minor role in the media\u2019s portrayal of where Brexit sits in our politics, but there is perhaps a snobbish idea that some people are beyond the pale, and things would be a lot better if they were returned to a state of voicelessness. But there are questions to be asked about how vox pops are used, and what they say about the media\u2019s attitudes to so-called ordinary people. These interviews come at the end of a package \u2013 suggesting that the substance of the story has already been largely decided \u2013 and follow a basic formula: one for, one against, and one comedy reply. The superficial presentation of people\u2019s views in hasty vox pops is a key part of one of the biggest political stories of our time. In Britain and elsewhere, a constructed idea of \u201cthe people\u201d is now both central to events, and deeply problematic. The new breed of populist leaders use public appeal to justify a politics of division and nastiness. The same reductive approach is common to Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, the Italian politician Matteo Salvini. Want to keep out immigrants? Build a wall. Fear for the nation\u2019s social fabric? Classify incomers by usefulness, according to the \u201cAustralian-style points system\u201d. This kind of politics never deals substantially with the complicated, difficult stuff woven into a lot of people\u2019s sense of grievance \u2013 deindustrialisation, housing shortages, a world that has long since started moving into an era of automation and insecurity. In the populist worldview, \u201cthe people\u201d are one-dimensional; so are the solutions. * * * On Wednesday 6 May 2015, opinion polls were still suggesting the next day\u2019s election would be very close. In the weeks immediately beforehand, 56% of published polls had put Labour ahead. That day, we published a film put together over two days talking to people in the bellwether Midlands constituency of Nuneaton. We had been exploring the effects of five years of austerity, and a narrative had taken shape in our heads that the country might be ready for a change. But the vox pops we did in Nuneaton hit us like a blast of cold air. Our film rejected the fashionable idea of a \u201cchange moment\u201d, and instead highlighted the tangle of resentments \u2013 against benefit claimants, immigrants, and the supposedly cushy lives of people who lived in Scotland \u2013 that seemed to be driving people\u2019s political thinking. It wasn\u2019t what we wanted to hear, but it was pretty much all we found. When the Conservatives won a parliamentary majority, there was a great deal of soul-searching among the editors, reporters and commentators who had been taken by surprise. Some theories held that there had been specific problems with the pollsters\u2019 methodologies (over-weighting particular groups of Labour voters, underestimating \u201cshy Tories\u201d). There was also general acknowledgement in the media that political journalism had relied too much on data, and not enough on qualitative conversations with voters. But something else was going on. In left-leaning political circles, people wondered how they had not seen the Tory victory coming. Part of the explanation came from an effect of social media, identified by the internet activist Eli Pariser in 2011 as the \u201cfilter bubble\u201d: an effect of endless personalisation, which, he said, \u201cmoves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.\u201d We were not aware of it at the time, but doing vox pops had become a way of bursting our bubbles. By going to locations we wouldn\u2019t normally visit, and allowing random chance to dictate who we spoke to, we had rediscovered some kind of antidote to the data-driven approach of polling and the algorithms of social media. But by the end of that year, it was our turn for some soul-searching. A December byelection in Oldham West and Royton was the first test for the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. We arrived in town buoyed by the sense that we had successfully divined the likely result of the election, and by our early coverage of the rise of Corbynism. It was raining torrentially for much that day, which makes for harder work than usual. We took cover in an indoor market, and got to work talking to people. We were shocked by the hostility towards Corbyn among older Labour voters; in our minds, the force of their opinions signified a serious possibility that the party would lose the seat. In fact, Labour won with a majority of more than 10,000. We learned several lessons. First, predicting political outcomes was a mug\u2019s game. Second, we had been guilty of creating our own filter bubble, by relying too much on a particular type of voter found in a particular place. Statisticians call this \u201cavailability bias\u201d. In simple terms, you can\u2019t base political coverage only on the sort of people you find in a market in the middle of the day. * * * In May 2016, the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU was looming. Polls were tight, but the general consensus was that the remain side would win. As we began a new series of Anywhere But Westminster, we were determined not to repeat our own mistakes. We spent a week driving from Merthyr Tydfil (we like it there \u2013 people talk) to Manchester, via the English Midlands. We had nothing set up: our only aim was to speak to as wide a variety of voters in as wide a variety of places as possible. We listened to Labour-voting leavers in Merthyr, and wealthier Eurosceptic Tory supporters in Leominster, Herefordshire. In the inner-city neighbourhood of Handsworth in Birmingham, we got a sense that assumptions of a remain victory were by no means well founded. There, we tested the received view of Brexit as a cause that only appealed to a certain kind of white person. At that point, many people were describing the respective sides of the battle as \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d. In a downpour, we spotted a British-Asian man taking shelter, wound down the car window, and asked him which side he was on. \u201cOut,\u201d he shot back. In Soho Road, the multicultural thoroughfare that is Handsworth\u2019s main drag, we talked to Sikh business owners \u2013 who, in defiance of the facts, seemed to think that people from EU countries were a drain on the state and on taxpayers, and other people whose support for Brexit seemed to be down to the decay and decline they saw in their immediate environment. We then went up the M6 to Manchester. At a university recruitment fair, 10 vox pops turned up only one leave supporter. When we asked them how they felt about the future, most of the students we met were optimistic. But 15 minutes drive away, in the deprived northern Mancunian neighbourhood of Collyhurst, the polarities were reversed. \u201cI fear for the kids \u2013 for my grandkids and that,\u201d said one woman. \u201cJobs, and things like that: so I\u2019m looking at pulling out.\u201d Her neighbour had come to the UK from Malawi. \u201cI\u2019m looking at immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cI studied environmental health, and I can\u2019t even get a job. As a person that came into the UK, I\u2019ve seen the change. I know what is happening. It\u2019s affected me. And the thing is \u2026 I\u2019m pulling out.\u201d We stopped to talk to two women next to a burned-out pub called the Billy Greens. Close by was an abandoned playing field, where rusty goalposts protruded from an expanse of overgrown grass. The conversation was brief, but it got to the heart of how the leave campaign had managed to frame its campaign as the vehicle for an unlikely kind of class war. JH: \u201cHow is Collyhurst doing?\u201d Woman 1: \u201cCollyhurst is coming up again. It\u2019s a really nice place to live. But we do need more money spent on it.\u201d JH: \u201cHave people in power talked about spending money here?\u201d W1: \u201cThey\u2019ve had the gardens done, but that\u2019s it. Nothing else. There\u2019s nothing for the kids to do. Nothing for the kids to play on. Nothing at all. And yet it\u2019s a lovely place to live.\u201d JH: \u201cBut booming, thriving Manchester\u2019s only 10 minutes\u2019 drive down there.\u201d W1: \u201cYears ago, when I grew up here, there were places to go: playschemes, and everything. There\u2019s nothing for kids. Nothing at all. You can look round and see.\u201d JH: \u201cIt\u2019s home, though, right? You feel very connected to it. W1: \u201cOh yeah. [Pointing at the pub] My mum had her wake there, God rest her soul, in the Billy Greens.\u201d JH: \u201cWhat I find odd coming here, is that they\u2019ve spent millions of pounds regenerating the middle of Manchester \u2026 \u201d W1: \u201cOh yeah.\u201d JH: \u201cBut you haven\u2019t had money spent here.\u201d Woman 2: \u201cIn Miles Platting [nearby area], they closed the swimming baths and all that lot.\u201d W1: \u201cAnd the library. They\u2019ve got nothing. And I feel sorry for them. For those six weeks [of school] holidays, if you haven\u2019t got a lot of money, you\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d John Domokos: \u201cI\u2019m curious about why you think that happens: all the money gets spent there, not here.\u201d Woman 1: \u201cIt\u2019s people with money. People with money. Money talks!\u201d JH: \u201cLast question. How are you voting in this referendum?\u201d W1 and W2, loudly and emphatically: \u201cOut!\u201d JH: \u201cThey\u2019re all voting \u2018in\u2019 in town.\u201d Woman 1: \u201cCourse they will! \u2018Cos they\u2019ve got that!\u201d [rubs thumb and finger together to suggest money] JH: \u201cSo it\u2019s down to a very simple thing for you \u2013 those who\u2019ve got money vote which way?\u201d W1: \u201cTo stay in.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd those who haven\u2019t got as much money?\u201d W1: \u201cTo come out.\u201d We didn\u2019t predict the referendum result. But for us, the film that finished in Collyhurst helped to frame what had happened. Lots of analysis and data since that referendum has cast doubt on the idea that Brexit was some kind of working-class revolt. But all across Britain, in neglected places that rarely saw TV cameras, we had met people who were voting to leave the EU as a way of calling for change: to be heard. The idea of listening to the \u201cleft behind\u201d briefly took hold, and found its way into Theresa May\u2019s early speeches as prime minister. It felt to us like Brexit might be a turning point for Britain, and that the vox pop was somehow part of what was changing. * * * A year later, Theresa May called the general election of 2017. Mostly because we had never been there, we decided to begin our coverage in the Cornish town of Redruth, where the last Cornish tin mine had closed 20 years earlier. Partly because tin is a crucial component in smartphones and electric cars, there had recently been talk of reopening the mine, something that seemed to interest a lot more people than party politics. The campaign had yet to ignite: the people we spoke to seemed largely detached from it, and the few people we could persuade to talk specifics said they would be voting Conservative. Theresa May was ahead in the polls, and there was a sense that right-leaning Brexit supporters would have things their way. But as we kicked our heels on an almost deserted, pedestrianised street, a man on a mobility scooter came into view, and clocked our camera. He would identify himself only as \u201cthe tin man\u201d. Tin Man: \u201cAre you making a film about the deprivation in this country? This fascist shithole?\u201d JH: \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d TM: \u201cWell, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s that bad? Or do you not see it as it is? If you fell down dead now, mate, no one would give a shit. Isn\u2019t that a sign of a fascist country?\u201d JH: \u201cI meet a lot of people who seem quite cheered up, because they voted Brexit and we\u2019re getting out and things are going their way.\u201d TM: \u201cYeah, brilliant. Prices are going up, and it\u2019s costing another $30m to reopen the tin mine because of the fall in the pound. This wonderful country doesn\u2019t manufacture anything any more. We\u2019re totally reliant on Swedish mining equipment, which is costing us more money. It\u2019s not helping us, mate. People have been conned.\u201d JH: \u201cDo you have a meaningful option in this election, do you think?\u201d TM: \u201cAbsolutely. For the first time ever I think we\u2019ve genuinely got a choice.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd the choice is?\u201d TM: \u201cTo do things differently. There are countries that do things differently. I want to vote against crony capitalism. And the only way to do that is to vote for someone like Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d JD: \u201cWhat\u2019s it like being disabled in the current climate?\u201d TM: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely miserable experience. Constantly picked on and harassed by the government. I got myself a cracking job down the mine: a job I was born to do. Now I get problems with my health, and I get treated like dirt. I\u2019m running around on a scooter that was given to me [by a friend]. I don\u2019t get any help from the government whatsoever. And this is after I put millions of pounds in the economy, working at the tin mine.\u201d JD: \u201cThe crux of this is \u2026 \u201d TM: [loudly] \u201cThe crux of it is, surely society can be better than this!\u201d JH: \u201cWe met a woman down there who said she thought Jeremy Corbyn was dangerous.\u201d TM: \u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s a man who wants to change things for the better. Change the priority. Stop spending money on bloody war, feed and clothe the poor. Not one person excluded, yeah? And then we can start to progress as a species, for the first time ever.\u201d We met the Tin Man when Labour were 15 points behind in the polls. The encounter with him was cut into a short standalone video that was posted on Facebook. It quickly amassed 2.2m views, and he was the subject of a story in the Camborne and Redruth Gazette. Labour came within 1,500 votes of winning the seat. * * * Now another election is looming, and we are still doing vox pops. But in the course of the last three years or so, encounters between the media and the public have been so built into the Brexit moment that they have become ritualised. In terms of the sheer amount of vitriol, mistrust, mocking memes and conspiracy-mongering, we are arguably in the middle of Britain\u2019s first true social-media election. In some ways, Twitter is one giant vox pop. But there are crucial differences. Most people don\u2019t have a huge Twitter following. And the things that make vox pops both revealing and satisfying are absent: all context and local surroundings, all the non-verbal communication that humans use to signal respect and empathy. One thing seems particularly striking while going back through our archive of roughly 140 films, and probably more than 1,000 hours of footage: almost all of our encounters have ended on friendly terms. No matter what political differences come to the surface, the encounters usually proceed respectfully \u2013 that\u2019s how people tend to behave when they come face to face. Ten years of vox-popping has taught us that calling the results of elections is not our job. But if Anywhere But Westminster has one key purpose, it is to at least try to transcend the polarisation and mutual loathing. At the risk of sounding sentimental, we want people to listen to each other. Two weeks ago, after we had finished filming in Southend-on-Sea, we drove the 30 miles to Jaywick, and went back to find Step Man. At the local convenience store, the woman behind the counter told us that people in Jaywick now hated the media: there had been too many programmes, she said, reducing it to a caricature of deprivation. The worst, she said, had been a Channel 5 show titled Benefits By the Sea. It was surprisingly easy to locate his house: the same red car was parked outside, and the bench was still there, propped against the wall. But when we rang the bell, there was at least two minutes of complete silence, before an upstairs window opened. There he was: paler and more gaunt before, and half-hidden behind the pane. We spoke for 10 minutes. SM: \u201cHello there.\u201d JH: \u201cHello. I don\u2019t know whether you remember us. Five years ago, we were making a film in Jaywick. We spoke to you on that bench there.\u201d SM: \u201cOh yeah?\u201d JH: \u201cCan we talk to you again?\u201d SM: \u201cNot really. I\u2019m not very well at the moment. I\u2019ve got emphysema.\u201d JH: \u201cWhat do you think of the state of the country?\u201d SM: \u201c[Laughs] Shit.\u201d JH: \u201cDo you think things are better or worse than when we met you five years ago?\u201d SM: \u201cGoing like that [moves arm downwards], isn\u2019t it?\u201d JH: \u201cDid you vote in the referendum?\u201d SM: \u201cOf course I did. And I voted to leave.\u201d JH: \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d SM: \u201cWell, I want to be out. Nobody seems to know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd how\u2019s Jaywick doing?\u201d SM: \u201cOh, the same old same old. Nothing seems to change in Jaywick. Jaywick just rattles along. Like the rest of the country.\u201d JH: \u201cAre you going to vote in the election?\u201d SM: \u201cOf course I am.\u201d JH: \u201cWho are you going to vote for?\u201d SM: \u201cI\u2019ve voted Labour all my life, and I\u2019m not going to vote for Corbyn. He\u2019s not doing the working classes any good at all.\u201d JH: \u201cSo if not him, who are you going to vote for?\u201d SM: \u201cBoris.\u201d JH: \u201cGod \u2013 you\u2019re a lifelong Labour voter, voting for Boris?\u201d SM: \u201cYeah, because I want to get out of bloody Europe.\u201d JH: \u201cBut what\u2019s he going to do to the country?\u201d SM: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. But as long as he gets us out of the mire.\u201d JH: \u201cEton-educated, very wealthy \u2026 \u201d SM: \u201cI wish I was. But they need to get it all sorted.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd the future of the country? How do you feel about that?\u201d SM: \u201cWell, I\u2019d love to see it blossom. The poor having a few bob in their pocket. Pensioners doing well. All looked after. Hospitals. None of this \u2026 Every time you go into hospitals, hanging about in corridors \u2013 I\u2019ve been there many, many times. Friday and Saturday night \u2013 all these arseholes who\u2019ve had too many shandies, cluttering it all up, and people lying on trolleys, here there and everywhere.\u201d JH: \u201cAnd you\u2019ve had that experience?\u201d SM: \u201cYes. Many, many times.\u201d JH: \u201cWhen you voted for Brexit, was the NHS in your mind? The idea of bringing the money back?\u201d SM: \u201cOf course it was.\u201d JH: \u201cIt was a dirty lie, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d SM: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201d JH: \u201cYou were a railwayman and you voted Labour all your life. You know of old that if we get Conservative governments, they don\u2019t make anything better.\u201d SM: \u201cYeah, but I can\u2019t see Corbyn making it any better.\u201d JH: \u201cThe conversation we had with you was a big thing for us. It changed the way we thought about politics.\u201d SM: \u201cWell \u2026 I hope we just get out [of the EU]. And do very, very well.\u201d It was getting colder: he was starting to cough. We said our goodbyes \u2013 \u201cSee you later, my old mate,\u201d he said \u2013 and he closed the window and went back inside, after we\u2019d asked him his name. He told us it was Frank. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "bodyText": "Convicted terrorists are having to be put on waiting lists for the main government-backed programme that will turn them away from violent extremism, an expert has revealed. Prof Andrew Silke has studied the efforts to deradicalise those jailed for terrorism offences and his claim comes as debate rages following Friday\u2019s attack at London Bridge in which two people were killed. The fallout from the attack by Usman Khan has triggered investigations by counter-terrorism investigators and a series of searches by police at properties linked to the attacker in Stafford and Stoke. Those searches which began after Friday\u2019s attack have now ended, police said, as the investigation into Khan, released half way through a conviction for a terrorist plot, continues. The attack at an event on prisoner rehabilitation has also refocused attention on whether those convicted of terrorism offences can be safely released. Silke, professor of terrorism, risk and resilience at Cranfield University in Bedfordshire, has been into prisons to study deradicalisation and is one of the UK\u2019s leading experts in the field. He said lack of resources meant those convicted of terrorism offences cannot get the best help. The main deradicalisation programme in prisons is called Healthy Identity Intervention. It is open to those convicted of Islamist terrorism offences and those jailed for extreme rightwing violence. Silke said there was a waiting list for the scheme \u201cI\u2019m absolutely sure. I have seen the case files. \u201cSome prisoners who have said they are willing, never get on it before their release. Some are waiting a long time. \u201cIt can have a real impact. It could use more resources. It is hard to imagine austerity did not have some impact.\u201d Prisons have been hit by steep cuts and Silke pointed out the impact this has had on the number of psychologists prisoners could access. The scheme is essentially intensive counselling sessions led by a psychologist and Silke said the results are good. \u201cMany interventions involve two to three sessions a week, which are one or two hours long, so it ties up quite a lot of time and resources. It can last several months.\u201d A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cWhile Healthy Identity Intervention is the core rehabilitative programme for TACT offenders, there are multiple other counter-terrorist specific interventions being used in the prison estate. They have been accredited by an independent panel of experts, who approved its evidence base, methodology and delivery.\u201d Meanwhile Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command said searches into addresses linked to Khan had been completed. While they do not believe anyone helped him in the attack, they want to rule out every lead and reasonable possibility. Initial investigations will have focused on his communications in the run-up to the deadly attack on Friday. The fake suicide vest was rudimentary, one source familiar with the investigation added, and there is no evidence that Khan\u2019s former association with al-Muhajiroun at the beginning of the decade had any bearing on recent events. Investigators are now reexamining the 74 cases of people who have been recently released from prison after serving time for terror offences, as indicated by the prime minister on Friday. Home Office sources said that \u201cthey wanted law enforcement to see if there is a reason to pull them back.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will seek to downplay his relationship with president Donald Trump at this week\u2019s Nato meeting, amid Labour\u2019s accusations that a US-UK trade deal will lead to an NHS sell-off and higher drug prices for Britons. As the US president landed at London Stansted just before 10pm on Monday and disembarked with his wife, Melania, Conservative strategists were hoping Trump would not add fuel to accusations that the US will seek to profit from the NHS as the price for any trade deal. Johnson has made clear that he would not welcome any input from Trump into the election debate at such a sensitive time in the campaign, after the US president offered him his endorsement over the summer. There is nervousness within the Conservative campaign about Trump\u2019s unpredictability, as he has a full two days in the UK and is expected to give a press conference on Wednesday. Johnson said last week that \u201cclose friends and allies\u201d like the UK and the US should not get involved in each other elections. As Trump landed on Monday night, Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the US president demanding assurances that any trade deal would exclude any reference to pharmaceuticals and accept the role of the UK\u2019s drugs watchdog in setting the threshold for the cost-effectiveness of drugs for the NHS. He also requested that the US drop the demand for \u201ctotal market access\u201d to UK public services and rule out any investor-state dispute settlement mechanism by which the UK government could be sued for protecting public services. Corbyn also wrote to the prime minister, urging him to break off trade talks with Trump until any reference to pharmaceuticals is struck out of Washington\u2019s negotiating objectives. The Labour leader has repeatedly accused Johnson of preparing to sell off the NHS, and Labour activists at recent rallies have taken up a chorus of \u201cNot for sale! Not for sale!\u201d Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, also highlighted Trump\u2019s previous claims that foreign \u201cfreeloaders\u201d are paying too low a price for US medicines and instructions to his chief trade negotiator to make drug prices a \u201ctop priority\u201d in any talks with trade partners. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, accused the opposition of scaremongering, denying the NHS would be up for sale. \u201cOnce again, Jeremy Corbyn is desperately trying to whip up absurd scare stories about our NHS to distract from his confused position on Brexit and plans for two referendums,\u201d he said. Johnson is yet to have fixed a bilateral meeting with Trump in his diary but he may still meet the US president one-to-one on Wednesday. On Tuesday, he will host a reception in Downing Street for the Nato leaders and attend a separate event at Buckingham Palace, where Corbyn will also be present. The Nato meeting is expected to be dominated by tensions within the alliance over the conflict in Syria and Turkey\u2019s incursion into Kurdish-held areas. The leaders\u2019 meeting, hosted by Johnson just outside Watford, was called to mark the alliance\u2019s 70th anniversary. However, the celebrations are likely to be overshadowed by French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s accusation that Nato was \u201cbrain dead\u201d for failing to stop Turkey\u2019s attack on Kurds. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish president, accused Macron of having \u201ca sick and shallow understanding\u201d of terrorism, suggesting he was the one who was \u201cbrain dead\u201d. Johnson will host the two leaders, together with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for talks in Downing Street on Tuesday ahead of the main gathering on Wednesday, when the 29 world leaders are expected to give speeches and discuss Nato missions, member states\u2019 spending and Nato\u2019s role in responding to threats around the world. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThe PM\u2019s position is that Nato is the most enduring and successful alliance in military history and that it continues to adapt to the evolving threats that we face. \u201cIt is the cornerstone of Euro-Atlantic security and it helps to keep a billion people safe. The PM will emphasise that all members must be united behind shared priorities so Nato can adapt to the challenges ahead.\u201d",
