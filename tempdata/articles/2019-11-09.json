      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1990/jul/31/obituaries.jonathanaitken\" title=\"\">Ian Gow</a>, the member for Eastbourne, rose to his feet on 21 November 1989 to make the first televised speech in our most ancient of parliaments, it is fair to say he wasn\u2019t too happy about it.</p> <p>\u201cI have always voted against the televising of the proceedings of this House,\u201d said the Tory MP, and he was not alone. His ire stemmed partly from a letter that had been circulated to MPs three weeks earlier, confirming in his mind the cynical and unseemly nature of the whole ghastly endeavour.</p> <p>\u201cThe impression you make on television,\u201d Gow recounted from the advice contained in the memo, \u201cdepends mainly on your image (55%), with your voice and body language accounting for 38% of your impact. Only 7% depends on what you are actually saying.\u201d</p> <p>The guidance to camera-shy members went on to say: \u201cWe can guarantee to improve your appearance through a personal and confidential image consultation. You will learn if you need a new hairstyle \u2013 and where to get it \u2013 and the type of glasses to suit your face.\u201d</p> <p>Gow considered himself \u201cbeyond redemption on both counts\u201d. Neil Kinnock sympathised, recalling that before he made his entrance on to what was now essentially a TV set, he had been handed a \u201cpapier poudr\u00e9, which looks to me like cerebral blotting papers which apparently are for mopping one\u2019s head\u201d.</p> <p>Self-deprecation aside, much of the dialogue came from MPs wearily accepting something that had divided Westminster, and been delayed by its members, for decades: the inevitability of the mass media age. Not only on the issue of picking your best side for the camera, but over deep philosophical anxieties about the nature of democracy, and the very soul of a democratic chamber itself.</p> <p>Today, as we approach the 30th anniversary of that first televised session, it is hard for most of us to imagine what the fuss was about \u2013 not least a younger generation so used to capturing and sharing almost anything and everything as part of daily life. This is especially true of the withdrawal agreement, a year-long soap opera that has seen live parliamentary coverage cross over from niche geek activity to mainstream spectator sport. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-bercow\" title=\"\">John Bercow</a>, until recently Speaker of the House, is now a star on the continent, where an app can imitate him saying: \u201cUuuuhhhder\u201d, and BBC Parliament even enjoyed a ratings spike that briefly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/23/brexit-boost-for-bbc-parliament-as-channel-briefly-outrates-mtv\" title=\"\">took it above MTV</a>. It would be hard for any democrat to argue today that a citizen has no right to see inside.</p> <p>John Reith first pushed the idea of parliamentary broadcasting as far back as the 1920s, but it was never given serious consideration until Harold Wilson arrived in No 10 for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/sep/19/harold-wilson-white-heat-technology-speech\" title=\"\">\u201cwhite heat of technology\u201d</a> revolution. What precipitated the unthinkable? The 1960s had brought a sharp rise in TV interviews and panel debates between politicians, and there was a rising sense that the \u201csupreme forum\u201d of national debate was being substituted for something baser. So in May 1965, the member for Ilford (the appropriately named Mr TL Iremonger), begged to move that \u201cthe maximum involvement of a responsible people in the processes of parliamentary government is a sure guarantee of liberty\u201d, and it was time to directly enter people\u2019s homes.</p> <p>But a select committee investigation and test screenings brought unfavourable feedback, and members voted against. As they again did in 1972. And 1975. It took more than 22 years and 11 debates before a sea-change occurred \u2013 in that bastion of forward-looking modernity, the House of Lords.</p> <p>A sort of \u201cout of town tryout\u201d was initiated in \u201cthe other place\u201d by Christopher Soames \u2013 leader of the Lords and son-in-law of the orator-in-chief, Winston Churchill \u2013 in December 1983. They tested it in January 1985, when Harold Macmillan \u2013 whose own premiership had been destined to end when he was mocked in a theatre by Peter Cook and the rest of <em>Beyond </em><em>the Fringe</em> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4XT4wg1DJk\" title=\"\">stole the show</a>.</p> <p>The Commons, whose inhabitants would be elected by those watching, after all, had many concerns. Who was going to edit the coverage? Would exhibitionists get to hog the mike? Would it change the character of the house, turning politics into mere performance \u2013 the substance, the nuance gone?</p> <p>But the die seemed cast by 1989, when the leader of the House reported back from the select committee with reassurances: \u201cEight remote-controlled cameras will be mounted just under the galleries and will be as unobtrusive as we can make them. We went into lighting with some care, as many honourable members feel passionately about the subject.\u201d</p> <p>Only a standard head-and-shoulders shot would be permitted. There would be limited use of wide-angle shots, a limit on the use of reaction shots, and a prohibition on the use of split-screen. No panning, just straight cuts. All in the interests of fair coverage and balance. It didn\u2019t take long for the pressures of \u201cgood drama\u201d to intervene. Only weeks after opening night on 21 November, the restriction on reaction shots was relaxed.</p> <p>Today, the controller of BBC Parliament, Peter Knowles, tells me that the intention is to \u201cmake you feel like you are part of the event. We see members who are actively taking part in the debate \u2013 not just when they are speaking \u2013 and in the floor-level shots you see the chamber much as the Speaker sees it, which gives some thrilling moments of drama.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s suddenly \u2013 and perhaps surprisingly \u2013 a big appetite for the authenticity and rawness.\u201d</p> <p>And it is thrilling. At least, I think so. I began watching footage of the House on the evening news as a boy in the early 90s, as the industries in my Nottinghamshire village began to disappear as a consequence of the discussions and the votes taking place on the TV. Getting to know the faces, learning the names. It\u2019s a fascination that fed into the writing of my play <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/14/this-house-scenes-execution-review\">This House</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/14/this-house-scenes-execution-review\"> for the National Theatre in 2012</a>, about the high drama of the 1974 hung parliament.</p> <p>So, have the old anxieties passed about turning the chamber into a variety hall and politics into mere performance \u2013 about parliament becoming a place where the best actors triumph over the best minds, with elected representatives in the chamber not so much speaking to each other as simply broadcasting to those outside? The motivation for Boris Johnson\u2019s war against parliament was the message being sent out to his leave base \u2013 he had little time for winning around the people sitting opposite him. And Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s final question in PMQs is no question at all, but clippable content to share among the Momentum network.</p> <p>My own local MP, Gloria De Piero, retiring this year and a former TV news star herself, champions the way the cameras force you to think of your constituents watching at home. When getting to her feet, she says: \u201cI am totally thinking about my constituents, and bringing their voice to parliament.\u201d She doesn\u2019t judge those who use the stage to grandstand and wax lyrical, \u201cbut I just can\u2019t think of the job like that\u201d. The best question she thinks she ever asked was 11 words long, to David Cameron: \u201cDoes the prime minister support the closure of local police stations?\u201d</p> <p>The British remain squeamish about cameras entering other public spaces, courtrooms in particular. Yet this too is now being trialled. The direction of travel was set, 30 years ago this month. But as the boundaries continue to blur between real and manufactured, truth and lies \u2013 as a reality TV star prepares to fight for a second term in the White House, having instigated a new culture of constant campaigning that is taking root here \u2013 our anxieties over politics as exciting television persist. We celebrate what has been gained, but fret over what we may have lost.</p> <h2>Cameras in the Chamber: a history in 10 scenes</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/oct/10/geoffrey-howe-resignation-speech-margaret-thatcher-downfall-video\" title=\"\">1.

The camera cut from the quiet assassin on the backbenches to the stony-faced Thatcher listening upfront, staring forward, trapped in the frame and possibly cursing the decision to let the cameras roll a year before. Howe joked about her cabinet being a cricket team whose \u201cbats have been broken before the game by the team captain\u201d; the laughter that followed echoes down the ages to all restless leaders looking over their shoulders. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw4JB25nr0s\" title=\"\">2. \u2018I\u2019m enjoying this!\u2019, 22 November 1990</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f82e568f682c94216a458b790d4ed6cbb892a9a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f82e568f682c94216a458b790d4ed6cbb892a9a4/0_51_1261_830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher \u2018 I\u2019m Enjoying This \u2018 moment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Margaret Thatcher reclaimed the spotlight on the day of her resignation, refusing to be cowed by the Commons. \u201cHer performance was as tough and uncompromising as ever,\u201d came the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im9c1JHtrI0\" title=\"\">Paxman review</a> that night. There are some classic, quotable lines for sure, such as her attack on the Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes. \u201cHe would rather the poor were poorer, provided the rich were not richer,\u201d said Thatcher, mockingly demonstrating her view of socialist economics with her fingers to the delight of loyalists behind. Then came a classic quip from Dennis Skinner. In response to the question of whether Thatcher would continue her fight against a central European bank, the Beast of Bolsover volunteered from his sedentary position: \u201cNo, she\u2019s gonna be the governor\u201d. Cue a roar of laughter, unusual for coming from all sides \u2013 including the Iron Lady, who had been crying only hours before. \u201cWhat a good idea!\u201d she cried, giving a swing of her fist.It was such a bravura swansong that the party may have already begun to regret getting rid of her. And she knew it. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this,\u201d she trumpeted with a smile.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?56817-1/john-smith-memorium\" title=\"\">3.

John Major should have been facing John Smith at the dispatch box that day, but the Commons instead met together in grief. \u201cWhen I think of John Smith, I think of an opponent, not an enemy,\u201d said Major. Despite her clear grief, Margaret Beckett \u2013 who as deputy leader took the place of her friend \u2013 was impossibly dignified as she informed the House of the closing words of a speech Smith had given the night before: \u201c\u2018The opportunity to serve our country.

      "bodyText": "When Ian Gow, the member for Eastbourne, rose to his feet on 21 November 1989 to make the first televised speech in our most ancient of parliaments, it is fair to say he wasn\u2019t too happy about it. \u201cI have always voted against the televising of the proceedings of this House,\u201d said the Tory MP, and he was not alone. His ire stemmed partly from a letter that had been circulated to MPs three weeks earlier, confirming in his mind the cynical and unseemly nature of the whole ghastly endeavour. \u201cThe impression you make on television,\u201d Gow recounted from the advice contained in the memo, \u201cdepends mainly on your image (55%), with your voice and body language accounting for 38% of your impact. Only 7% depends on what you are actually saying.\u201d The guidance to camera-shy members went on to say: \u201cWe can guarantee to improve your appearance through a personal and confidential image consultation. You will learn if you need a new hairstyle \u2013 and where to get it \u2013 and the type of glasses to suit your face.\u201d Gow considered himself \u201cbeyond redemption on both counts\u201d. Neil Kinnock sympathised, recalling that before he made his entrance on to what was now essentially a TV set, he had been handed a \u201cpapier poudr\u00e9, which looks to me like cerebral blotting papers which apparently are for mopping one\u2019s head\u201d. Self-deprecation aside, much of the dialogue came from MPs wearily accepting something that had divided Westminster, and been delayed by its members, for decades: the inevitability of the mass media age. Not only on the issue of picking your best side for the camera, but over deep philosophical anxieties about the nature of democracy, and the very soul of a democratic chamber itself. Today, as we approach the 30th anniversary of that first televised session, it is hard for most of us to imagine what the fuss was about \u2013 not least a younger generation so used to capturing and sharing almost anything and everything as part of daily life. This is especially true of the withdrawal agreement, a year-long soap opera that has seen live parliamentary coverage cross over from niche geek activity to mainstream spectator sport. John Bercow, until recently Speaker of the House, is now a star on the continent, where an app can imitate him saying: \u201cUuuuhhhder\u201d, and BBC Parliament even enjoyed a ratings spike that briefly took it above MTV. It would be hard for any democrat to argue today that a citizen has no right to see inside. John Reith first pushed the idea of parliamentary broadcasting as far back as the 1920s, but it was never given serious consideration until Harold Wilson arrived in No 10 for his \u201cwhite heat of technology\u201d revolution. What precipitated the unthinkable? The 1960s had brought a sharp rise in TV interviews and panel debates between politicians, and there was a rising sense that the \u201csupreme forum\u201d of national debate was being substituted for something baser. So in May 1965, the member for Ilford (the appropriately named Mr TL Iremonger), begged to move that \u201cthe maximum involvement of a responsible people in the processes of parliamentary government is a sure guarantee of liberty\u201d, and it was time to directly enter people\u2019s homes. But a select committee investigation and test screenings brought unfavourable feedback, and members voted against. As they again did in 1972. And 1975. It took more than 22 years and 11 debates before a sea-change occurred \u2013 in that bastion of forward-looking modernity, the House of Lords. A sort of \u201cout of town tryout\u201d was initiated in \u201cthe other place\u201d by Christopher Soames \u2013 leader of the Lords and son-in-law of the orator-in-chief, Winston Churchill \u2013 in December 1983. They tested it in January 1985, when Harold Macmillan \u2013 whose own premiership had been destined to end when he was mocked in a theatre by Peter Cook and the rest of Beyond the Fringe \u2013 stole the show. The Commons, whose inhabitants would be elected by those watching, after all, had many concerns. Who was going to edit the coverage? Would exhibitionists get to hog the mike? Would it change the character of the house, turning politics into mere performance \u2013 the substance, the nuance gone? But the die seemed cast by 1989, when the leader of the House reported back from the select committee with reassurances: \u201cEight remote-controlled cameras will be mounted just under the galleries and will be as unobtrusive as we can make them. We went into lighting with some care, as many honourable members feel passionately about the subject.\u201d Only a standard head-and-shoulders shot would be permitted. There would be limited use of wide-angle shots, a limit on the use of reaction shots, and a prohibition on the use of split-screen. No panning, just straight cuts. All in the interests of fair coverage and balance. It didn\u2019t take long for the pressures of \u201cgood drama\u201d to intervene. Only weeks after opening night on 21 November, the restriction on reaction shots was relaxed. Today, the controller of BBC Parliament, Peter Knowles, tells me that the intention is to \u201cmake you feel like you are part of the event. We see members who are actively taking part in the debate \u2013 not just when they are speaking \u2013 and in the floor-level shots you see the chamber much as the Speaker sees it, which gives some thrilling moments of drama. \u201cThere\u2019s suddenly \u2013 and perhaps surprisingly \u2013 a big appetite for the authenticity and rawness.\u201d And it is thrilling. At least, I think so. I began watching footage of the House on the evening news as a boy in the early 90s, as the industries in my Nottinghamshire village began to disappear as a consequence of the discussions and the votes taking place on the TV. Getting to know the faces, learning the names. It\u2019s a fascination that fed into the writing of my play This House for the National Theatre in 2012, about the high drama of the 1974 hung parliament. So, have the old anxieties passed about turning the chamber into a variety hall and politics into mere performance \u2013 about parliament becoming a place where the best actors triumph over the best minds, with elected representatives in the chamber not so much speaking to each other as simply broadcasting to those outside? The motivation for Boris Johnson\u2019s war against parliament was the message being sent out to his leave base \u2013 he had little time for winning around the people sitting opposite him. And Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s final question in PMQs is no question at all, but clippable content to share among the Momentum network. My own local MP, Gloria De Piero, retiring this year and a former TV news star herself, champions the way the cameras force you to think of your constituents watching at home. When getting to her feet, she says: \u201cI am totally thinking about my constituents, and bringing their voice to parliament.\u201d She doesn\u2019t judge those who use the stage to grandstand and wax lyrical, \u201cbut I just can\u2019t think of the job like that\u201d. The best question she thinks she ever asked was 11 words long, to David Cameron: \u201cDoes the prime minister support the closure of local police stations?\u201d The British remain squeamish about cameras entering other public spaces, courtrooms in particular. Yet this too is now being trialled. The direction of travel was set, 30 years ago this month. But as the boundaries continue to blur between real and manufactured, truth and lies \u2013 as a reality TV star prepares to fight for a second term in the White House, having instigated a new culture of constant campaigning that is taking root here \u2013 our anxieties over politics as exciting television persist. We celebrate what has been gained, but fret over what we may have lost. Cameras in the Chamber: a history in 10 scenes 1. Geoffrey Howe resigns, 13 November 1990 Iconic for what it captured on camera as well as the events it precipitated off (the Iron Lady would be out two weeks later). The camera cut from the quiet assassin on the backbenches to the stony-faced Thatcher listening upfront, staring forward, trapped in the frame and possibly cursing the decision to let the cameras roll a year before. Howe joked about her cabinet being a cricket team whose \u201cbats have been broken before the game by the team captain\u201d; the laughter that followed echoes down the ages to all restless leaders looking over their shoulders. 2. \u2018I\u2019m enjoying this!\u2019, 22 November 1990 Margaret Thatcher reclaimed the spotlight on the day of her resignation, refusing to be cowed by the Commons. \u201cHer performance was as tough and uncompromising as ever,\u201d came the Paxman review that night. There are some classic, quotable lines for sure, such as her attack on the Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes. \u201cHe would rather the poor were poorer, provided the rich were not richer,\u201d said Thatcher, mockingly demonstrating her view of socialist economics with her fingers to the delight of loyalists behind. Then came a classic quip from Dennis Skinner. In response to the question of whether Thatcher would continue her fight against a central European bank, the Beast of Bolsover volunteered from his sedentary position: \u201cNo, she\u2019s gonna be the governor\u201d. Cue a roar of laughter, unusual for coming from all sides \u2013 including the Iron Lady, who had been crying only hours before. \u201cWhat a good idea!\u201d she cried, giving a swing of her fist.It was such a bravura swansong that the party may have already begun to regret getting rid of her. And she knew it. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this,\u201d she trumpeted with a smile. 3. The death of John Smith, 12 May 1994 It\u2019s often the more sombre sessions that bring out the best behaviour. John Major should have been facing John Smith at the dispatch box that day, but the Commons instead met together in grief. \u201cWhen I think of John Smith, I think of an opponent, not an enemy,\u201d said Major. Despite her clear grief, Margaret Beckett \u2013 who as deputy leader took the place of her friend \u2013 was impossibly dignified as she informed the House of the closing words of a speech Smith had given the night before: \u201c\u2018The opportunity to serve our country. That is all we ask.\u2019 Let it stand as his epitaph.\u201d 4. Robin Cook resigns, 17 March 2003 There were many turbulent and emotional scenes in the lead-up to the Iraq invasion in 2003; the resignation of the respected former foreign secretary, who could not support the war, was one. \u201cHistory will be astonished,\u201d he rightly predicted. Note that man to the left of the frame, sitting behind him \u2013 a future Labour leader and key player in the Stop the War coalition. 5. Purple rain, 19 May 2004 One of the more surreal moments, as a screaming Fathers4Justice campaigner in the public gallery launched a flour bomb at Tony Blair, which connected with his shoulder and burst into a purple puff. No one knew what the concoction was, so the session was suspended immediately. A Perspex barrier has sealed off the gallery from the chamber ever since. 6. \u2018That is that. The end\u2019, 27 June 2007 Tony Blair ended his tenure with a quieter turn than Thatcher, paying tribute to the House despite admitting he was not exactly a \u201cCommons man\u201d. Politics, he said to the occasional swallow, was the arena that set the heart beating a little faster, a place for noble causes. \u201cI wish everyone, friend or foe, well. And that is that. The end.\u201d A highly unusual (and technically forbidden) standing ovation from the entire chamber followed. 7. Tributes to Jo Cox, 20 June 2016 As with the death of John Smith, this was an occasion everyone would sooner had never taken place. But it was also, once again, a deeply moving national moment that showed the House at its humane best, and a testament to a clearly loved colleague. The white rose of Yorkshire was worn by every member and also occupied the seat \u2013 alongside a red rose \u2013 where Cox should have been, as her friends repeated the sentiment now familiar (though still too frequently ignored) from her maiden speech: \u201cWe have more in common than that which divides us.\u201d 8. May government found in contempt, 4 December 2018 The Netflix-style saga around the withdrawal agreement\u2019s traumatic passage through parliament has too many episodes from which to choose, from the points-of-order attacks against the Speaker for selecting the Grieve amendment, to Labour members trying to prevent the proroguing of parliament, to the final fall of May. But this is where it began: a government voted 311 to 293 to be found in contempt of parliament for the first time in history. One member is heard to call out \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d. Talk about spoilers. 9. Rosie Duffield recounts her abuse, 2 October 2019 There is no better recent example of MPs reminding us they are real people, with real lives, than Rosie Duffield\u2019s brave and precise account of the ways, big and small, that abusers can trap those that they abuse. She makes it all the way to the end before allowing her grief to flow out, to be immediately swamped with hands by her colleagues and friends. 10. Saturday matinee, 19 October 2019 The first televised weekend fixture in the House\u2019s history. It must have been serious. Kick-off was 9.30am and the big vote to delay a vote on Johnson\u2019s deal was passed around 3pm. It didn\u2019t have the fireworks or the memorable lines of other Brexit sittings \u2013 in fact, everyone was trying to be very collegiate and statesperson-like. How much of that had to do with the cold light of a Saturday? Or was it a greater understanding of the little lenses fixed menacingly around the chamber, as they have been now for three decades, the knowledge of a captivated world watching?",

      "body": "<h2><strong>When did you start working at the Guardian? </strong></h2> <p>It was October 1988 \u2013 just over 31 years ago! I was hired to cover business, with a special responsibility for property. Canary Wharf was being built and the UK was in the middle of a house price boom. I remember my first day clearly. I reported on British Gas, with a deadline of about 5pm. Back then it was only a newspaper, so there was no huge rush to file copy like there is today.</p> <h2><strong>Have you always been interested in this area?</strong></h2> <p>A few years previously, I had graduated with a degree from Cambridge in history, having originally been accepted to study economics and switched courses because there was too much maths for my liking. I was deeply interested in the economy, but mostly from a historical perspective. After graduating, I worked at the Press Association as their economics correspondent and enjoyed some time as a cub reporter before my big break at the Guardian.</p> <h2><strong>What are your biggest professional highlights so far? </strong></h2> <p>It feels slightly ghoulish to say so, but the most memorable moments have often been in the middle of times of despair. The stock market crash of 1987, Black Wednesday in 1992, and the Financial Crisis of 2007-09 particularly stick in my mind. For an economics reporter, these are frenetic, exciting and often highly satisfying periods. There\u2019s a lot to discuss and our readers often appreciate having complicated things made more explicable and less jargon-y \u2013 though many are specialists themselves, or at least highly interested and self-taught amateurs.</p> <h2>What are the biggest challenges of the role?</h2> <p>When the economy is doing well, it can be very challenging. The period from the 90s to the early 00s was dubbed the \u201cnice decade\u201d by Mervyn King, the then governor of the Bank of England. There was falling unemployment, interest rates were low, the economy was downgraded as a news story, New Labour had come to power. There was some debate over the euro, but otherwise it was fairly steady and not much to write about.</p> <h2><strong>Looking at the period between the financial crisis and the Brexit referendum, what </strong><strong>have been the most </strong><strong> significant moments?</strong></h2> <p>I think the moment when we knew the banks were going to be bailed out was hugely significant. It signified that those responsible were getting away with it. I knew that this was a financial crisis that had been caused by the financial sector, and I believe it contributed<strong> </strong>to the 2016 referendum result because the eurozone almost broke apart following crises in Greece, Ireland and Portugal brought about by the crash. Europe felt flawed and in need of fundamental change. Since 2016, we haven\u2019t recognised the importance of that period on the result \u2013 the impact of austerity on those parts of Britain that feel left-behind \u2013 and we\u2019ve had three wasted years when no one has really got to grips with the reasons we voted as we did.</p> <p>Politics dominates economics, and it can be quite depressing when you see the same mistakes being repeated time and time again by the financially powerful. You can often pre-empt what\u2019s going to happen because things happen in waves. People forget what\u2019s come before, and then the same mistakes are made again, sometimes by the same people. It\u2019s happening as we speak, because all the signs point to another financial bubble out there that will leave policymakers scrabbling around for a response when \u2013 not if \u2013 it pops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26b0f5e23053dd5f425774a27b5c0830ab049acb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26b0f5e23053dd5f425774a27b5c0830ab049acb/0_0_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lehman Brothers sign on wall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>You\u2019ve previously spoken about how in 2007</strong><strong> you came up with the </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/audio/2019/apr/23/how-the-green-new-deal-was-hatched-in-a-london-bar-podcast\">concept of the Green New Deal</a>.

There has been much more recognition of the green agenda, and climate is now a much bigger part of it. But nothing really happened back then.

      "bodyText": "When did you start working at the Guardian? It was October 1988 \u2013 just over 31 years ago! I was hired to cover business, with a special responsibility for property. Canary Wharf was being built and the UK was in the middle of a house price boom. I remember my first day clearly. I reported on British Gas, with a deadline of about 5pm. Back then it was only a newspaper, so there was no huge rush to file copy like there is today. Have you always been interested in this area? A few years previously, I had graduated with a degree from Cambridge in history, having originally been accepted to study economics and switched courses because there was too much maths for my liking. I was deeply interested in the economy, but mostly from a historical perspective. After graduating, I worked at the Press Association as their economics correspondent and enjoyed some time as a cub reporter before my big break at the Guardian. What are your biggest professional highlights so far? It feels slightly ghoulish to say so, but the most memorable moments have often been in the middle of times of despair. The stock market crash of 1987, Black Wednesday in 1992, and the Financial Crisis of 2007-09 particularly stick in my mind. For an economics reporter, these are frenetic, exciting and often highly satisfying periods. There\u2019s a lot to discuss and our readers often appreciate having complicated things made more explicable and less jargon-y \u2013 though many are specialists themselves, or at least highly interested and self-taught amateurs. What are the biggest challenges of the role? When the economy is doing well, it can be very challenging. The period from the 90s to the early 00s was dubbed the \u201cnice decade\u201d by Mervyn King, the then governor of the Bank of England. There was falling unemployment, interest rates were low, the economy was downgraded as a news story, New Labour had come to power. There was some debate over the euro, but otherwise it was fairly steady and not much to write about. Looking at the period between the financial crisis and the Brexit referendum, what have been the most significant moments? I think the moment when we knew the banks were going to be bailed out was hugely significant. It signified that those responsible were getting away with it. I knew that this was a financial crisis that had been caused by the financial sector, and I believe it contributed to the 2016 referendum result because the eurozone almost broke apart following crises in Greece, Ireland and Portugal brought about by the crash. Europe felt flawed and in need of fundamental change. Since 2016, we haven\u2019t recognised the importance of that period on the result \u2013 the impact of austerity on those parts of Britain that feel left-behind \u2013 and we\u2019ve had three wasted years when no one has really got to grips with the reasons we voted as we did. Politics dominates economics, and it can be quite depressing when you see the same mistakes being repeated time and time again by the financially powerful. You can often pre-empt what\u2019s going to happen because things happen in waves. People forget what\u2019s come before, and then the same mistakes are made again, sometimes by the same people. It\u2019s happening as we speak, because all the signs point to another financial bubble out there that will leave policymakers scrabbling around for a response when \u2013 not if \u2013 it pops. You\u2019ve previously spoken about how in 2007 you came up with the concept of the Green New Deal. Can you tell us more about that? I am very proud of the Green New Deal.
